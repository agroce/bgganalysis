The starter set was the best thing about this Entry into the DM fray. ASM was sadly disappointing overall as an addition to my collection. OF course, I bought as much as I could of it. lol *facepalm* #addict

I dislike collectable games.  Usually, it is because the idea of spending more money = greater chance to win is stupid.  Fortunately, that is not the case here, since you agree ahead of time which dice to use.
I was hoping for a complete set of Spider-Man and some of his main villains -- a living dice set, per se, but it wasn't really the case.  You still need to go buy more blind packs.  You can play with this, but there's not much there.
The game is fun enough, but it is a money pit.  Beware.

Really solid set here that probably could have been the 'flagship' product for the series, with a lot of Spidey's iconic characters and abilities that seem more straightforward than in some of the other IPs' designs.

Really got into Dice Masters at one point but some broken tournament strategies really killed it for me. I could see pulling this out just for fun if I'm in the right mood.

I really think this set is one of the weakest in dice masters. The underdog effect is just not very useful.  I think they said it's fine if you like Spiderman characters, but for those who enjoy the game more than the theme, this is a weak set.

How much of this crap can they sale?
Have they had another original thought since starting this?

What a cash cow. 

One set of this $$$ boring dice roller was enough for me.
Let me guess, they haven't bothered even to updated the cheesy mats to reflect the rule change a while back, and they will just cobbler any changes into the old text, and the small form rule ok that makes you print off a pdf so you read it. Guess if you have all the sets you don't need an updated rule ook, just phone it in. 

So tired of this.

Right up there with rethemed Monopoly games.

Dice Masters is so addictive! I think it's a perfect game of modern strategy, like chess, but far more risk management since you have to manage the odds of dice rolls. 

This is a great set. Spider-Man is my all time favorite hero. Not a fan of the way he was drawn on the cards with his mask off. And he isn't my favorite character in the set. But there are some great ones that I do like a lot. Spider-Man is okay, obviously. But with Dice Master sets, you are bound to really like cards of heroes/villains to which you never really paid much attention. Everyone is so different. The variety is what I like along with the hero theme, which I absolutely love!

While I have a lot of characters and a decent amount of dice. I just don't have enough dice to play with standard tournament rules. I can play with those rules, but that would limit my options to fewer characters that I own. So to get the most out of my game, I play with 5 characters, 10 dice, and 20 points. I think strategy changes depending on the amount of dice to point ratio you have. The way we have it so far seems to work like a charm. I didn't want anyone to be able to successfully nickel and dime the whole game to a victory. That kind of strategy is too much luck based, in my opinion. I wanted more margin for error and required thought for well thought out and planned attacks to get those points down. I still might go to 15 points at some point. But for now, we do the full 20 with 10 dice and 5 characters. Even with the amount that I play  with, I have had a match were 19 points were taken in one player's turn to win the game. That game was THE game of Dice Masters games that I've had. The score was 19 to 2. And the winner took away 19 points to win the game in improbable fashion. It was actually quite unbelievable!

Update: Decided to move to 15 points with 10 dice. It's more balanced, I think.

Update: Moving back up to 20 points. More skill is required and there are other reasons. Playing with so much fewer than 20 dice makes it really hard to purchase high cost characters. Playing with 15 points makes it nearly impossible to buy them.

We are also going to start mixing in a few tournament rule games since we both have more than enough cards and dice for that. It's just that for a game like this, I want to be able to play with every last card I own if I wanted. And I am very into thematic teams, teams that fit together strategy wise, but not so much like what is done at the tournament or hardcore level. I love theme. I like the idea of being forced to use a pain in the a$$ character who just is not all that helpful in hopes of trying to see if you can work around that weakness. I think that part of the game is awesome! That being said, we are also going to start playing tournament rules with assembling teams for maximum effectiveness, too. We have never really played like that before because we didn't have enough dice per character to assemble a full team.

On Christmas I received a wrapped gift from my wife that looked an awful lot like a gravity feed. I opened it and saw that it was an Amazing Spider-Man gravity feed. I looked closer and saw that it was a War of Light box that I had previously obtained with Spider-Man logos taped all over it. I opened the box and inside was a package of underwear. I couldn't hide my disappointment and luckily my wife went around the corner and pulled out my real gift, which was an Amazing Spider-Man gravity feed.

I love Dice Masters, but I just haven't played it an awful lot lately. My Justice League and Age of Ultron sets have hardly been used, so I decided to not invest anymore for the time being into new sets. Which is a shame, because I would love to get all of the DC and Marvel stuff for the game.

A really great 2 player dice game. The best description is really more or less a cross between Quarriors and Magic the Gathering, which is a fantastic combination. It's fast and possibly the most strategic dice game I've ever played, with lots of great theme and wonderful artwork (not to mention all the gorgeous dice). The only two things to warn about I think are 1) it's collectable, which is sometimes fun but also sometimes irritating and 2) the combat rules can be confusing when first learning the game (in terms of knocked out vs used up). Otherwise it's fantastic.

I didn't know Dice Masters existed until two years after the fact, but it was apparently made for me.  Incorporating the good parts of deck building boardgames with the pre planning of deck building from CCGs and the gameplay of Magic and then blending it together with superhero and DnD themes created a Frankenstein masterpiece.  I love it and Jen loves it.  All our plays are recorded under Marvel Dice Masters: Age of Ultron because that was our first set and we play with all of the sets together.

The asymmetry and direct conflict is a welcome addition to the deck/pool building genre, but adding randomness on top of randomness is a major turnoff for me.

I wasn't expecting much from this game at all but now it has me buying booster packs all the time! Really simple, really fun, but with interesting choices to make in regards to building your team buying your characters and when to field, block, and attack. I'm really enjoying this one right now.

I absolutely LOVE this game. It has very similar elements to MTG, but it seems much more balanced. What I mean is that anybody can buy some packs and play the game evenly against their opponent. MTG requires a LOT of investment and money, while this game requires very little investment and buying the booster packs are insanely cheap. It's addicting, fun, and one of my favorite table top games, hands down.

Sigh. More Dice Masters. I keep buying it and I'm not really even sure why since I really only have 1 regular opponent.

It remains entertaining, if largely chaotic bullshit. Fun, but hard to actually recommend to others.

I suspect this is probably my last wave. Especially as I'm starting to see the real competitive advantage of super-rares.

Further update: The lack of clarity of rules and a seeming complete lack of an FAQ to mitigate the awful WizKids quality control killed off my interest in this game. Once it slips to an occasional game, you spend half your time debating how to interpret the rules on cards. Sold.

A great standalone or expansion to the Dice Masters franchise. Features a huge variety of allies, heroes, and villains related to Spider-Man. The new mechanics really helps players that fall behind as it gives them powerful abilities to push them back into the game. Truly an Amazing Dice Masters set!

RATING: 7
Missed this the first time around and have just read George RR Martin's  Song of Ice & Fire  and Maurice Druon's Les Rois Maudits, so really pumped up for this. The components are very good for a board wargame, particularly of its era. I'm not 100% taken with the combat system - it could perhaps do with a few tweaks, although I've not tried the latest rules and variants available on the fan sites.

Special mention for Herve Tardy's excellent expansion maps - check out his website http://www.cryhavocfan.org

RATING: 9
There are days when I'd say this is my favorite wargame.  To wit: My avatar, which as of this writing is a counter from the Viking Raiders expansion.

It's beautiful.  The best counter art in wargame history, and maybe game history.

It's expandable.  You get a huge, huge toy chest full of pieces and maps and rules and whatnot to play with, if you get it all.  Including a campaign!  And there's a thriving community--mostly in France--that is making more and more stuff.

It's simple.  You're not looking up rules, you're playing, all the time.  And you're doing things that seem natural, rather than gamey.  It makes a successful effort to evoke its subject, which is all you can ask for from a wargame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Good looking medieval man to man combat simulation. The rules are fairly simple and easy to learn. The length of a game ranges from maybe an hour to about 2 or so depending on the scenario. Includes the Village map and the Crossroads map as well as 7 scenarios.

RATING: 6
An absolutely fabulous wargame for its time. While the rules are a bit spotty here and there, the CRT is very elegant and tactics are definitely front-and-center, while still allowing for good strategy with starting unit selection and positioning. The in-book scenarios are rather boring but creating your own is very easy. Give this a try if you're a hex and chit fan.

Pros:
The concept was brilliant with its mix of colorful artwork and individual characters. Maps and counters are top notch.

RATING: 9
Although lots of time has passed since its first appearance, the game and its series still have plenty of fans worldwide. The game comes with a small rules booklet, a scenario booklet, two modular paper-sheet map boards of fine quality and a sheet of paper counters. The counters represent either one person or a horse rider. This is a light tactical wargame. The theme deals with melee fighting, on one-on-one basis, in the medieval era. Each counter-person has 4 steps; the last one being dead. The mechanics of the clash of arms is easy and fast. Each person has printed on the counter his attack and defense value. Melee is resolved with a die after modification. The result can be a stun, a hit (giving the person lesser fighting values) or a kill. The fighting, depending on the scenario, can be between, peasants, merchants, bandits, soldiers or knights and can even involve a Dame in distress! The theme is intriguing and play is fast. In order to add more flavour just look for the series that were published after this one, like SIEGE, SAMURAI BLADES, CROISADES etc.

2015-08-10 : The now long defunct 3W magazine had a really good article on this game back in the eighties, but it proved too difficult to acquire at the time. Much later a pc computer version emerged that was pretty decent and I played that one for a while. A couple of years ago I saw it at a second-hand sale and bought it for nostalgic reasons, I just wanted to have it, but then I got a good offer for it and it moved on.

Hybrid between wargame and boardgame. Medieval characters represented by counters at full strength, wounded, stunned and killed. Simple mechanics, visually good and great fun to play with a large crowd each controlling a few characters...Strong narrative to the game, people get very attached to their Lords and peasants... My favourite is dear old Gobin, boy does he have a history! Sadly this does just not get played anymore!

I saw Cry Havoc and related games at a friend's home back in the 80's and always thought they looked cool.  So I eventually collected Cry Havoc, Outremer and Siege myself.  I haven't played very much with them yet.  But I want to.  

The game has a lot of appeal.  The maps are beautiful.  The counters are small works of art.  I really like the idea of a medieval battle game that is flexible enough to handle most any encounter imagined.

But the game does have some down sides.  The counters are too thin.  Every version of Cry Havoc and the subsequent games has different rules.  Counters do not use the same approach from game to game (mostly, but you gotta be careful).

This format seems to work well for small encounters.  Keeping track of which characters are on your side could possibly become an issue.  So I am leery of especially large scenarios.

So, how to rate this?  At this time, I am still very keen on this game.  It shines through the various problems mentioned.

I love how every piece has a name, and how when you flip the counter to the "dead" side, everyone's corpse looks slightly different.  At the end of the game, with the bodies of men and horses piled up on the battlefield or in the street, it does give you a different perspective on wargames.

RATING: 6
Well, I had a good time playing the game, and we had some real silliness occur.  One of my peasants held off three attackers for two rounds, then, when trapped in a room by 2 mercenaries, continued to stand for many, many turns before finally succumbing.  Despite overwhelming advantage, my two mounted knights could not do in one opponent, and the only damage that could be done to my own knights was when I hurt myself.  The combat results can be truely weird, and the retreats are not damaging enough.  Bows and crossbows devastating, and the line-of-site too liberal.  However, the art was nice, and I did enjoy playing, and would do it again, but I think I may put my own acquisition of the game on hold.

First scenario is good for learning the basics of this very simple wargame. The Shortbow units are very (too?) powerful and some initial luck might make the difference in the outcome. Counters are thin but nice looking and the map are quite pleasant.  The rules are especially incomplete when it comes to line-of-sight. We used decimal dice to account for fractional 'odds'. Rating is slightly generous at this point but the rest of the game will certainly merit at least this 7.

A game from my teenage years that I spent far more time reading about scenarios for than actually playing.

There are very few good skirmish games out there.  I think this is one of the best.  The map and counters are stand out, the rules are low complexity for this type of game, and the system works smoothly and quickly.

RATING: 7
Light but nice medieval man-to-man combat simulation. The map and the chits are gorgeous but ridicolously thin.
The rulebook is a mess, but with a good rewrite this game could be fine.

I purchased this game to introduce my 7 year old son to the world of simple wargames. He is very fond of Knights (as are most young boys). Although it is not state of the art graphical value, it is a good introduction game.

This is a great man-to-man light wargame. The artwork and presentation is very pleasing, even if the counters are incredibly flimsy. Still, this one play fast and carries a lot of theme.

A fun game during the medieval period. Every character [they're all individual], requires 2 double sided counters so it can be difficult to keep organized. Although I loved that the dead stay on the board and can become an obstacle for the other players/characters.

simple medevil hex and counter, d10, skirmish wargame, with big games this can get a bit fiddly with dead and wounded counters all over the place, the componants are nice enough and the maps (of which there are quiet a few, although admittedly only 2 in the basic game) can be useful for role gamers (GURPS players especially), theer are a few more game boxes in the sereis  adding rules for sieges, crusadeing (well at least saracen pieces) feudal japan, dark ages (north sea area; saxons and vikings) and a fantasy set, also a couple of scenario books are avalaible

I love the combat system in this game, you jest don't see CRT's any more. I know they are old and clunky some times but this game got it right, add divide and roll. when i played with my gf she thought the combat would be slow and clunky and it would take forever to kill the knights. and then she attacked and watched my little mans die in droves. 
its a really realistic representation of how that combat of the time went. you get all armored up so that the peons cant hurt you. In order to take out a knight it takes a lot of high power units but they drop after that and that's how it was.

Played a number of solo games and with the PC version. Interesting topic, horrible but interesting artwork. Game play would benefit from an RPG element .. give all the characters a bit more personality/individuality.

Not a serious simulation, but fun fun fun, and the counters are terrific. I added many house rules to make combat more realistic.

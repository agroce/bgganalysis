Revised. Solid improvement to original. Much of the imbalance has been smoothed out, making it a more varied and interesting game. Still kinda broken, but it has so many pro's to outweigh the otherwise crippling cons.

The Revised Edition.  I played this with a group of guys that had played it so many times that all of their first two rounds worth of moves were scripted.  I did my level best to try different things, but was usually argued down.  this is a fine version of the game, but the AA50 ruleset is better.

[I]tl;dr - It's complex and depends a lot on dice, but Axis & Allies is a light wargame with a pleasing game arc - it's a great way to spend several hours![/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Everyone should have that one 'afternoon' game, where you grab some friends, eat food and drink a few beers, and play the heck out of one game for the entire day. Axis & Allies is that game for me. I was introduced to this game in high school, and really relished the complexity of it and the sweeping strategy it offered to players. 

I know this is only a 'light' wargame, and the randomness may bother some, but what it does, A&A does extremely well. I've played much more than I've logged, and I feel like I've only begun to scratch the depths of the game -- I usually play Russia, and still have big swathes to explore from playing the Axis or even another Allied power. Every player at the table will have their own concerns and abilities, and that makes for some nice asymmetry.

I would love to pick up the [b][thing=35052]Anniversary edition[/thing][/b] of this one eventually, but we'll see what my pocketbook allows. More rules streamlining can only be a good thing, and the Italian player looks like an interesting addition as well. 

Axis and Allies is a classic game and a trailblazer, you should try it at least once. For me, it's the one toe that I'm content to dip into wargame waters.

Another bad idea... I thought my buddies I played Risk with would enjoy it. Turns out we like Risk more. Ah well... it's not bad, but for the time it takes to set up, teach to people, etc. I would honestly just rather play something else. UPDATE: traded for Survive!. UPDATE: Got another copy.

Great game as expected. Be careful though: The optional rule that allows allied units to convert to Russian units makes it  nearly impossible for the Axis player to win; when it is abused.

I have fond memories of playing this with my college roomie. Sadly, he was much better than it than I ever was. Still, I managed to pull off a victory or two.

Great components, love the minis. 

Can't say the same for the gameplay. A dicefest that is 1 step above RISK. Not to say it's a bad game but it uses the war background to make this game worth rolling the dice for. 

Minimal strategy. It's a good basic step into more knowledge of wargaming.

RATING: 5.5
First off, setup time is entirely too long. Also, the game basically "ebbs and flows" where I win one battle, you win one battle back and forth until someone wins, while not much has really happened.  No one took over the world or even took much more than they started with.

There are some interesting mechanics, and I like the way research is done, but I feel more accomplished after a game of Risk.

One of my favorite strategy games.  I'm used to the old version, but the changes made for this version all seem to be solid improvements over the old: the game feels better balanced now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The best Axis & Allies, in my opinion. Quite similar to the original Axis & Allies, but with a handful of significant changes. Fighters cost 10 IPCs, Carriers 16. Tanks defend on a 3. Battleships can take 2 hits. Artillery and Destroyers make an entrance (though don't expect them to be popular purchases). 

On the map, the Eastern Front has been given a much-needed complete overhaul and now presents far more interesting strategic options to Russia and Germany than the original. The Atlantic Ocean has also been widened, presenting the US with a more difficult task in bringing its industrial power to bear in Europe.

These minor tweaks make a huge difference in gameplay. Strategic balance is vastly improved (the game is probably still tilted toward the Allies, but only by a handful of IPCs), and the strategic options are much richer.

The box says 5 players, but personally I think Axis and Allies is best as a two-player game. It's fun three hours. Expect the setup to take ~30 minutes. Recommended.

Good game, seems reasonably well balanced. Able to win from either side and able to lose from either side.

Did switch from the stock game to the Larry harris Tournament rules pretty quickly though.

Gaming group does not use weapons development chart though. So have never played a game of revised with that feature under any rule set.

Also only use between 0 and 2 of the 6 optional abilities for each country (usually random).

Hasbro/AH has done a really good job remaking this classic into a superior game and a long game slugfest (if that's what you want). Graphically is is superior and captures the strategy and theme of WW2 very well. The knock: too much dependence on dice. Sure, they *should* average out in the end, but when they don't, it's a lot of carpal tunnel syndrome for naught.

Mi primer juego, que no se compra en aurrera, soriana, o wallmart xD

Un gran de juego de estrategia!! y me encanta porque maneja bien la economia con la guerra, la inversion influye mucho en el resultado.

Un juego que te desplaza a esa epoca en la historia!

Lo que no me gusta es que siempre empieza igual, aunque sea la misma guerra debieron de darle variedad en el inicio (unidades iniciales variables) :S y esa es la razón del porque se tiende a la misma estrategia todas las partidas

Lots of childhood memories playing A&A and this game updates it in a significant way (balance with naval units, points for cities, changing the map so you can't shuttle directly to Europe etc).

However, it is the kind of game that will never hit the table again given the number of good Euro games I'd rather play.

Pretty good as an intro wargame, as is tolerable to play even for people that love wargames.  There's enough going on to make it VASTLY more enjoyable than risk, but not enough to burden down people who want a simpler game.

Wow, this game takes a long time. A long, long time. I had fun when I was playing, but I'm a spoiled Eurogamer, I guess, because there was waaaaaay too long between turns. Our game lasted from 8.30 pm to almost 4 am! Still, there's stuff to do in your downtime; look at your position, confer with your allies, roll dice for your poor little guys who are just going to get blown away no matter what you do. I'd play again. UPDATE: Well, I might not.

I haven't played it.  From reading the rules, though, I kind of wonder what all the hoopla is about.  People seem to love this game, but it doesn't strike me as a very balanced or a terribly elegant game.  I'll have to reserve final judgment until after I've played it.

Edit: Played it.  Meh.  Gamble big, get bombers, and you win!  Or gamble big, get the shaft, and you lose!  Awesome!

Enjoyable, accessible game.  When it first came out we kept running into people who thought it was too easy for the allies.  Enjoyed proving the axis could win.  Used it now to introduce my son into the wonderful world of games beyond Sorry (not that there's anything wrong with it).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Nothing can likely be said about this game that hasn't already been said in many different venues: It's a step up from risk, a step down from a handful of other games. It's a good "gateway game", but ultimately won't hit the table much because it's longer than Twilight Imperium, and frankly a little less satisfying.

What I love about A&A though, is the "what if" factor that can arise. What if the Germans didn't attempt to invade Russia, and instead focused entirely on eliminating the English?

Due to the time it takes to play a game (and the massive amounts of downtime in between turns) It will probably only hit my game table once every other year or so, but I can't say that I hate the game. Rather, I actually like it it's just unwieldy.

Initial Impression: An interesting step up from basic Risk. I particularly enjoy the open-endedness of this game. Although it may seem as if there are optimal strategies, you are not locked into doing things historically. This allows for "what-if" moments in the game. I very much prefer playing this game with 5 players.

I'd give this a higher rating if it didn't require a week to play and a table to occupy for just as long. Setup also takes quite a bit of time. I'm also not one for rolling low numbers. The game is also slightly imbalanced in favor of the Allies, and there's not much room for alternate strategies. TripleA is a nice flash based PC version of the game that nice for testing strategies. I'd like to try this online/via email, where you can take as much time to strategize as you like, and there's no space in the house that's occupied forever.

All cards and rule book are present and accounted for.  *Full disclosure:  1 missing British fighter, 1 missing German fighter, 1 missing battleship, and 1 missing US control marker--Otherwise, 363 playing pieces are present and ready to duke it out across the globe.

Serious disappointment compared to the classic A&A. The artillery and some changes to the cost or the pieces are a nice addition but the map is just a lot less interesting and slower than the 1986 map. The initial layout also force brutal battles right off the start. Most people play LL (low luck) but than its not a real probabilistic game anymore. I have no idea why this version became more popular than the classic one, it just doesnt make any sense to me.

Simple introduction to the strategic aspects of WWII. As each power, you could see clearly the threats and opportunities that were seen identified by the historical leaders. However, the slug-it-out, dice-it-out nature of the game makes it a slightly unsatisfying experience, esp. given the significant game length.

The original was always a fun game until I learned of the shuck-shuck stratagem.  The Revised Ed. seems to have fixed the game in a number of ways.  There is just something about pushing a bunch of little figures around a map that gets me.

When I first got back into gaming, I wanted to get into some heavier wargames, so I first cut my teeth on this for a few games.  I remember those games being fun, but now that I'm playing meatier games I haven't gone back to this.

I am, however, keeping it, to teach to my boy when he gets older. :)

One of the best versions of Axis and Allies (all are good, though). The submarine is used very strategically in this version. Great replay value, many different strategies to win, never know the best way to go about winning, especially because it depends very much on opponents' moves.

RATING: 7
Have played 6 times now and have thoroughly enjoyed each session. The new victory conditions allow players to tailor play to the time they have to spend and the new map breaks up all the old strategies. The addition of destroyers, artillery, and improved tanks give players pause in determining their builds, too. Optional rules import some of the better elements from the Europe and Pacific games. Also, we play that each nation randomly draws 1 national advantage and keeps it secret from the other players, revealing it only when they're ready to use it. If you enjoy the original, you'll like the new game even more. A distinct improvement over the time-worn classic.

Revised Edition. It's a nice revising of the game.  So far I've only played it once but found it nice not to be relying on the same old scripted moves that we had developed 20 years ago.  Now it's just finding the new script! But that will take us a lot of games.  Well worth buying to make an old favorite fresh again.

An important game in the history of wargaming, but given what else is out there in the same genre (with a large chunk of it outside the historical realm), it's by far too obsolete to justify playing.  Not to mention how solvable it is.  Sure, you need the dice on your side, but if you don't do certain things on the first few turns, no matter what side you're playing, you're screwed.  And if you do know what you're doing, you can pretty much always count on the Allies winning.  Not much of a game if you ask me.  It's complete rubbish that should be forgotten to allow better games in the genre to come into the spotlight.

It has great unit variety. It has detailed rules for each. Why do I rate it so badly?

 - You'll painfully find out how useless many of the units are.
 - You'll painfully find out how useless most strategies are.
 - You'll painfully start the game with the same base strategy again and again, because it's dominant.
 - You'll painfully wait for something to happen, because this turn the odds just aren't good enough yet.
 - You'll painfully lose games after 4 hours, because of dice rolls.
 - You'll painfully count units again and again to predict odds.
 - You'll roll dice a hundred times

This game is a bit like probabilistic, random result chess, where most openings don't work and with half an hour of setup and a rulebook ten times as long. It has no use.

I like this one. I have only played it with two players, which, I think, is probably the best way to play. Love the little pieces, only problem is that playing 9 vc's (8 vc's is not an option IMHO and 10 vc's seems unnecessary to me) takes about 5 hours to finish , but maybe we think too much.Update: Played it again with 3 players. It creates a unique sort of tension when you play 2 against 1 (I played the Axis alone and lost, but it was a close call). I think the game is somewhat scripted, but I might be wrong. This is one of these games you need to play several times before you really understand what the best moves are. Again with 3 players it took us about 5 hours.

I only came around playing this classic very recently. I thought I'd hate it, but I was very pleasently surprised that it's quite entertaining. It's a surprisingly good emulation of World War II, albeit quite abstract. Luck is a factor, but can be mitigated with strategy. Beats Risk with several lightyears. There's only one thing I don't like with it, really: it's waaay too long for what it is.

RATING: 6
Very similar to the original Axis and Allies, with with several minor tweaks that result in a substantially better game.

The map is mostly similar to the original. One big exception is the Eastern Front, which got split into many more territories. This is a huge improvement, and makes for a much more dynamic and interesting situation than in the original game. The Russians have a particularly interesting decision for their Turn 1 attacks; they have four possible targets, each with advantages and disadvantages. The Russian player could attack as many as three or as few as one, depending on her boldness.

France is now three spaces away from America, which somewhat delays the American assault on Europe. The Americans must either land in North Africa first, or attack from the UK. This is a nice change--D-Day was far too easy to execute in the original. It should take some serious preparation, just as it did in real life.

A few other starting positions have been tweaked, too. The British have a better chance at defending India if they choose (though they are probably better off focusing on Germany).

On the whole, the balance between Axis and Allies is much more even than the original. Some slight help for the Axis might be necessary, but nothing too extreme.

Unit abilities have been tweaked, typically for the better. Non-infantry pieces are more competitive. The introduction of destroyers rounds out the naval portion of the game nicely. Generally speaking, purchasing decisions are more interesting. 

The decision to use the Stuka as the model for the German fighter (instead of an actual air superiority fighter like the Messerschmitt 109) is regrettable. 

As in the original, there are serious crowding issues on the map. There's not enough space in Germany for everything you need to place there.

Because of the long setup, fixed starting positions, and snowball issues (flaws this game shares with everything in the Axis and Allies series), I cannot give this game anything higher than a 6. It is still fun to play on occasion, however, and a much better Axis and Allies experience than the original.

I think Axis & Allies is still riding the wave of its former glory... It's better than Risk but the unit interaction (read: endless exceptions to the game rules) give it a clunky feel.

I played this a lot when it was newer & I was younger. It takes quite a while to play and has a fairly steep learning curve for a newbie. That, combined with the nearly an hour it takes to set the game up, is a large part of why this game has sat on my shelf (through several moves now) without ever hitting the table.
Still, it's one of the grand-daddies of "Ameri-trash" and deserves a seat of honor in the Halls of Geek-Fame.
For my current tastes in game design, it relies too heavily on dice.

As far as recreations of WWII go, A&A does a pretty good job of it.  Every time we play the Battle of Britain always seems to work out as history dictates; those little British fighter planes always fight off the entire German invasion.

Axis and Allies takes a long time to play, but has a lot of strategic depth to it -- and LOTS of tiny pieces!  Its attempts at reproducing the economics of the era without getting too bogged down *almost* works.  Sometimes it just feels too sluggish; building new units seems to take too long.  While this promotes careful use of resources, it also tends to reduce the game to a lot of sabre-rattling standoffs and fewer battles than a game about the second world war might warrant.

Overall it's a fun game if you've got the time, but it's not the best game out there.

I'm a fan of the improvements, in particular the method of gaining technological advancements.  This is one of the few wargames I'll actually play.  The time involved in most wargames is usually what kills it for me... not necessarily the motivation.  Yes, it's a dice fest, but it's a really fun dice fest.  I play this irregularly, but I always have a blast when I do. UPDATE: Well, after discovering War of the Ring, I realized I can indeed make time for good wargames!  Also, many wargames are no longer than A&A, though they are much better, in my opinion.  Still, this is a decent place to start, and it is a fun game.  A great way to get started in wargaming.

Meh. Nice components aside, doesn't do it for me as a game. The time invested:fun ratio gets pretty top heavy for me long before it's over.

Not involved enough to be interesting as a sim, not quick enough to be worth it just for the fun of it.

Great components, good game, best played either by 2 or 4. The revised edition is much better than the 1984 version primarily due to reworked map. Now there actually is choice on the strategic level! Some of the units and technologies are unbalanced. The optional rule -  national advantages - is obviously broken. The game suffers from serious downtime in a 3-5 player game.
I do not mind the relatively high luck factor. It makes the general course of events less predictable and gives newbies better chance to win (OK, better chance to survive longer :) ).With some house rules I would rate the game 9.

For a 5-player game. No politics, too chaotic, too much downtime and way too little possibilities. Friendly nations will always discuss what's the best to do for you, so I never had the feeling I was playing it for myself. (I also missed the fact that you can never backstab your Allies.) Ship transport is too limited, so the idea to go oversea is unuseful.

I have thoroughly enjoyed playing Axis & Allies for almost 30 years.  The 2004 edition was a nice improvement to the original game and lets players play the whole world at war in a simplistic war game.  The tension can be felt.  The long game is the best for this edition.  The game has been a solid winner for a long time and the encore of additional Axis & Allies variant games attest to the continued popularity of this game franchise.  Kudos for continued development and this 2004 version comes highly recommended.

Just my preference...

Too long, too complicated.  My wife bought it for me in 2008/2009.  We literally spent an entire day trying to figure it out.  If you like long, complex games, than you will enjoy this much more.  The max time I like to commit is 60 to 90 minutes.

Had the misfortune to play this title several times with people who think way too much. 7 hours and a half of play with the same strategy, conquering a territory to lose it the same round, repeated for 4 whole rounds. No possibility to end the game, and no satisfaction with the gameplay at all. I highly think I've lost interest in this title. There are several ones that with less time to play are more strategical and rewarding to play.

RATING: 9
Better than the original edition from 1981: new rules and units and a better balance; big disadvantage of this game is the fixed setup and development of the game. However, because of the long playing time I do not play this game very often, so that this is not a real problem to me. For sure better games exist, but every time I play I have a lot of fun; this, in combination with a bit of nostalgia (A&A is a classic game I played a lot in my youth) makes for a high ranking; Anniversary and 1940s editions do not add enough for me.

RATING: 8
Vastly improves on the original. The Eastern Front now gives you the feel of the actual campaign (e.g. now you have a reason as the Germans to make a stab at Stalingrad(i.e. the Caucasus, with its 4 economic points, factory complex, AA gun, and back door to Moscow)). The variable levels of victory based on possession of victory cities plays nicely. The new rule on neutral countries and impassable terrain gives the game a more historical feel (no North African campaigns that flow freely southward into the heart of the continent, and no offensives over Mt. Everest!).

The only slight negatives that prevented a perfect "10" rating are a) Could have had more pieces, as we find ourselves stealing bits from our other A&A games during play, and b) Requiring 10 victory cities for the Axis to gain a Major Victory makes game length jump considerably, as it requires an amphibious invasion of either the UK or USA - if you want a game playable in one session (a.k.a. 4-5 hours), play for a Minor Victory (only 8 cities required to win, out of 12), or make the requirement for Major Victory only 9 cities, not 10. 

In summary, a great game that is highly recommended!!!

Beyond the plays I've logged here at BGG, I estimate I've played this ~10 times prior to my logging of plays.

Great classic game that is only improved upon with the Revised edition.  New territories and units make for better replayability.  This version is quite balanced and overall, an excellent strategy WWII game.

This game started me into the boardgaming hobby, but there are so many better games out there now, I rarely will ever play this again.

I would never play this game all the way through a Total Victory (or even Major Victory) conditions.  3 hours into it, the outcome should be determined.

Used to be the go to game between me and my brother.  The 2004 Update is much better than the 1981 version...at least it changes strategies over the tried and true 1981 map (which turned into the same game nearly every time).  Still a bit long, and the set up can be long, and it isn't worth it when there are so many other good games out there today.

A true classic though.

This is a great game that keeps the dice-hucking classic feel of the original and cleans up the wonky issues of the old MB edition. Unit costs are fixed, new units are added, geography is fixed, the victory conditions are now wonderful and tense. Highly recommeded for both old hands who re-acquaint themselves with a classic, and also for new players who want a great intro wargame.

The changes from the orignal are well thought out and implemented.  The East front is now a lot of fun and is no longer stagnant until someone gets desperate.  The impassible zones, the new 3/3 tank , and the end of the one turn hop from the East Coast to France, all make a big difference in this game.  

If you don't own this one , buy it now.

2 players is optimal, with 5 it becomes more of a social event (still fun , but just not quite as good).

For as large as this game loomed in my childhood, one would think it would rate more than a 4, but I have found myself growing away from games with lots of little pieces and rules.  I almost wrote, 'fiddly rules' but that is really not fair.  While they are many, I wouldn't say that there is any fat on them.  I respect Axis and Allies, but don't have much fun playing it. Maybe I need to try one of the smaller scale editions.

The original ([gameid=98]) was a fundamental change for me in games.  It and a few others were what transformed me from games like Monopoly to a bigger game world.  I have great memories of that game.  

In 2004, they came out with this Revised Version.  I actually like this Revised version better than the original version ([gameid=98]).  

It is an all day game experience, but sometimes, that is what I want. 

I think this version is a good reworking of an all-time game classic.

I'm not a war gamer. Though, it can happen that I play a war game from time to time. Axis and Allies is an OK game. I played it a few times. Oddly enough, more time on the computer than in person.

The first few turns are basically the same in every single game. No real surprises there. What comes next is who won the battles during the first few turns.

Takes a couple of hours to play. Dice fest like Risk, but with various different units. A step up from Risk.

Got Axis and Allies in a game trade.

Played once, two player.  As someone completely new to the A&A experience, I had a lot of fun, although my head wasn't completely in the game.  I can see potential for a lot of strategy here, although the veterans tell me that the game is scripted.  I'd like to challenge that assumption, although the long playing time of this game means that I won't be able to do that often.  The game seems to offer a variable play experience based on number of players, experience levels of the players, and personal play style.  I think this will end up being a game that I rather enjoy, but won't be able to get to the table very often due to length.

RATING: 2
A&A is really a 3-hour game that's five hours too long. Axis & Allies has always been one of those games that has a very low efficiency index. You take eight hours to reach a conclusion you knew four hours ago. 

So this was Hasbro's chance to make this game right but it seems they just went on retaining the things that made this game bad. Still long, still low efficiency. Extremely frustrating when you can see where the game will inevitably head but you have to sit through hours more of the game. Moreover, it's a game where the Allies can play a less intellectual game and still win (except that it will take a really long time to win). :snore:

Excellent game that definately beats the pants off Risk.  A little luck is involved, but not a bad game.  The axis powers are at a disadvantage if they don't strike fast and roll well in the beginning turns.  Games start to get stale because nearly the same tactics are always employed.

There WERE mass battles, but not every battle was like that.

The revised edition has a lot of great improvements over the original. The problem is that this game runs for about three to four hours longer than I'm willing to commit to a game like this. Just way too much for what you get when you open the box. Maybe I'm just not a fan of the WWII theatre.

I recently saw this played at a con, and swung by three hours later, and the stalemate that I left the game to was roughly in the same position. I don't know if I could bear to bring myself to sit at a table for that long with that little action going on. Too many fronts with too many fiddly bits. And with too many people, downtime cannot help but become a negative factor. Plenty of other wargames I would prefer to play or even watch.

Just call me "not a fan".

I played A&A Pacific 4 years ago, but it could not satisfy me. This is because war field in only near asia, so I tried to buy A&A original. However, many people said that its game balance is not good. In this reason, I gave up buying A&A. 
However, I heard A&A Revised came out and its reputation was good. As a result, I bought this one and played. After few plays, I have satisfied this game. I thought that this would depend on dice luck so much. It was true, but there are also sterategies about options where I attack, which tech I develop and so on. In addtion, when I play this game, I feel like a real general in the WW II. This means that this game make situation in the WW II well. 
I recommand this game, especially on war lovers and strategic game manias. If you want to see review in Korean, please visit this web page - http://blog.naver.com/faces821/120036539945

Great game for casual play. Can be a mind burn/ emotionally draining in high-level 2-player play. (Do you have the will to continue the war when you just got unlucky and lost a single battle that cost you about half of your troops on the board?)

So, Im staring at the box, as I have had this game for a few years.  On opening, the bits are still in the wrapping.  Now, I found this game for a cheap price ($25), that I bought 2 copies and gave one to a friend.  He has managed to play 3 moves in 2 years, but its at least 3 more than me!  I like the concept of the game, I would like to get into it, but I fear this is more a game you play when young or at uni, not after when time becomes restrained due to the realities of life.  So, its an archive game, as I live in hope to one day to have the time to play it properly a few times.  So, a game I bought and have not played for a few years, I guess by definition a rating 6 (the right mood has not yet arrived) (13/9/11). UPDATE: Tried one game and realised how long this game must go and that I would not really enjoy it despite the classic nature of the game. (Rating 4.529, Jan 17)

A game that simply blows the top off the old fun-o-meter. Just think of it as a classic big game dice contest with a pinch of history and some passion, sort of multi-player chess with cheering.   
  
Now don't get me wrong, it does have problems. Boy, does it have problems. Let's just say both the newest edition and its immediate predecessor have their share of quirks.

First, they are just this side of being minimally, historically, accurate. 

Second, while the latest edition managed to fix some problems, it simply ignored others and then went on to create new ones all its own. 

Among the old problems fixed was the inclusion of simple blocking terrain. Now, for example, it's no longer possible to capture India by marching over Mount Everest or to have panzers take the Congo by scooting across the Sahara. 

As for the problems ignored, well Moscow still has to worry about being captured by a Japanese infantry army marching across Siberia (there isn't any weather, either).  
 
And as for the new problems, there's the latest technology sub-system and the new victory conditions. My group simply ignores'em. After all, real men don't need no stinkin' book to tell them when they've won a fight.     

I suppose it's fair to say of the most recent edition that what it made up in the straight-aways, it lost in the turns. 

Great game, fair history.

4/5 - Recommended? Yes.

+ The classic beer & pretzels game

+ Replay WW2, change the fate of the world!
- A bit too long to play in an evening
- Can be very one-sided if players' skill levels don't match

Note: The Larry Harris (the game creator) Tournament Rules are a huge improvement over the stock rules. Goggle for them.

I enjoy the scope and the simplicity added with some strategy in this one, however the playing time  lessens it's attributes.  I have to say I do enjoy playing when I do, but I need long periods inbetween.  I wish the combat mechanism was more like nexus ops though, as I always have a hard time being convinced that specific targets aren't chosen.

One of the better editions- I really like the color choices for the land and sea zones (on the map). Better overall quality regarding units and map compared to other editions (except Anniversary one). It keeps the playtime realistic (Axis & Allies 1940 games are more epic but far longer). Worth keeping.

RATING: 7
[b][i]Axis & Allies[/i][/b] was my (and many others') introduction to war games. Created in 1981, this is still the standard for global-scale World War 2 board games. However, gameplay wise the slow player-by-player turn sequence and simple (but still fun!) dice combat make A&A feel dated relative to more recent games. This game is nominally 5-player--and it's great if you can get a willing enthusiastic group. However, the long wait times between turns make this most easily played with 2 people.

Perhaps it's because I've had so many good times with this game, but I hope that everyone tries this game at least once. Unfortunately for my nostalgia, I think games such as Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, War of the Ring, A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, or Warrior Knights are better games. But I [i]would[/i] recommend A&A for people interested in learning the basic flow and geography of World War 2.

The modified map, inclusion of destroyers, and various other tweaks lead me to prefer the 2004 edition over previous editions.

a very good WWII game on world scale that puts you in charge of one of the 5 great powers of the time battling for the allies or for the axis. among economy, battles, tactics and whatever this game as to offer, the final quest is: can you change the fate of the WWII war? will the world be changed by you? thats to be seen. best played with all 5 people, good also with less then this

I've had too much fun with this one over the years to give it anything less.  You can complain about the luck, or lack of realism, or even the short list of reasonable strategies but when the game goes right (about 33% of the time) it gets the adrenalin up and is a ball.

Fun game. 1 play. 
Aug 08 -  4-5 hours playing time.  Set up time is a bit long (half hour for an inexperienced 3-player game).  I've played 5-player, and 3-player (turning into 2-player).  It is almost better 2-player as downtime is a major issue in a 5-player game.

RATING: 9
A significant improvement over the second edition. Most of the set-piece opening moves have been eliminated by deploying most forces for the first players (Russia and Germany primarily) such that they can't attack until another player has moved. The balance is better, although it still favors the allies a little. Unit costs are better balanced as well, and rather than adding the silly smorgassboard of optional units as so many expansion pack creators have, they added just a select few that create meaningful strategic options. The technology table isn't as badly broken, but I'm still not convinced it adds anything to the game.

The choices of victory conditions are a little puzzling, since they don't really change the length of the game so much as adjust the balance between the powers. (Fewer victory spaces required favors the axis because it is hard for the US to get into the game before they take Karelia S.S.R. and India.) It is still similar enough to second ed. that paying for the upgrade is an open question, but any light wargamer who doesn't have an earlier version should definitely pick this one up.

[JAN 09] [Rating: 7]
The “new” edition of Axis & Allies are definitely better than the old game master series game and the reason behind this is that is has more strategy to it. It still feels a little scripted, but not as much as the previous version.

Axis & Allies is aesthetically pleasing with great looking pieces and board. It is quite sad that it probably is its greatest merit. But there are other things I like with this game too. I am usually fond of civilisation games where you build up things and I get to do that here too, more than meets the eye. You should not only win the battles, but you have to win the war too and therefore have to be prepared for the next turn. There is more managing the resources than meets the eye.

There are a few things I don’t like about the game though and the most obvious is the down time. A great deal of time passes between your turns especially when you are playing with a full compliment of players. The total play time can also be daunting and can take more time than what the weight of the game is worth. But it is a beer and pretzel game where, so you should maybe not take things that seriously.

In reality this is a 2-player game. Interesting enough I enjoy this more with 5 players even considering the down time. Maybe I am more of a social gamer after all.

Initial rating of 9

This is EXACTLY what the remake of a game should be! 

Q: How much different is this than the 80's version?

A: 80% the same and 20% refinement. Everything that was ever an issue is fixed.

Q: What are the biggest changes?

A: The map. Probably not noticed at a casual glance, but once you play on it you realize what new opportunities exist.

New units/unit rules. Destroyers, artillery, two hit battleships and submarine refinement.

National advantages (optional rules). Each country has a list of six distinct advantages that can be implemented. Once we used these we can't imagine playing with out ALL of them.

Victory conditions. Victory cities are now used in place of capitols and economic victory. Players can determine game length (somewhat) by the number of these required to win. Victory cities also create interesting strategic play.

If you ever enjoyed the original A&A, you owe it to yourself to at least try this game.

Solid strategy game good for a night of fun.  Fairly easy to learn.  Not for players obsessed with realism.  Lots of dice rolling means lots of luck involved but on the flip side, unpredictable battle outcomes forces quick strategy changes.  Players must adapt or be engulfed.

This is still an interesting game, although a bit long.  The modifications from the 1981 are mostly good, but I would have preferred a LARGER board!

Tried a "Major Victory" game, where one side needed to Capture four Capitals, but after 8 hours, we called the game.  It had become obvious the Axis would loose as the American navy had surrounded Japan, and the German attack against Russia had stalled.  With the Allies controlling the seas, the end for the Axis was inevitable (minus some terrible die rolling).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The revised edition of this classic does a good job of streamlining the game moderately by adding new units (i.e., the artillery, which in turn makes attacking with infantry less of a bust; giving the battleship two hits to sink, making them less fragile and far more useful). Also, this version is updated by removing the swingy technology development. This latter change to my chagrin, as I loved the possibility of turning a game around with a luck technology breakthrough, especially if you're playing with multiple players and you're playing the US (and aren't quite sure as to what you should be spending your money on!).

While the production value doesn't seem as high as the classic edition, it's still generally nice.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This grand daddy creates a tense, exciting atmosphere of world wide war. 
Regarding time and brain power involved, it is massive, and earns an 8-9 on that scale.

But the same unchanging game setup that provides the thematic immersion also results in limited options and a limited choice of pragmatic game openings. And this means the first 2-4 hours of most games will be strikingly similar. 

Only an option if you have the time and nerve to endure 8-16 hours of playtime over 1-2 days, plus the final discussion who would have won the game if it actually were to be finished. I don't have that kind of time anymore, hence not played it for a couple years. 
With more than 2 players, I strongly recommend alcoholic beverages.

Very Good Game (like to play and never will turn it down).

Better than the original 
... but it's really too bad they didn't have the guts to go with Don's 1/1 Infantry fix for the revised edition that would have addressed the core mechanics problem and may well have made it a 9+.

That said I've played a lot of this game on Facebook / GameTable Online and now with Triple A and am enjoying the game more and more.

RATING: 7
Where else can one play out "What if?" fantasy strategies during WW II? Can the Germans avoid the mistakes of history and take out the British first? Will the Russians hold on just long enough for the Americans to get into the game? Will the Japanese defeat the Flying Tigers and conquer China, and then attack Russia via Siberia? Will the Americans withstand an invasion on either coast?

Although significantly abstracted, this makes gameplay accessible and fast enough to fight WW II in an evening. If one is looking for historical accuracy, this is not it. But if one is looking to capture the flavor and feel of world conquest, in a WW II theme that is somewhat elevated from good old Risk, this is a winner.

Easy mistake to make - almost always happens.

The single biggest complaint is that it goes on for far too long if you play with more than 2 players. I like playing the game where the teams discuss strategy and that ends up just taking forever, even just using the minor victory. I suppose you could cut that out but it'd be eviscerating what I like best about the game.

If I'm going to settle for just 2-player and am willing to devote a couple hours to a game there are tons of other games I'd rather play first. Things like Napoleon's Triumph or Espana 1936.

This is a game about re-created pretty much the entirety of WWII, with some nice "alternate history" possibilities. It's aproprietly large and complex, and filled with hours of moving plastic pieces around, flinging dice, and strategizing what to do with the resources availible to you. Good stuff, but it also falls into an awkward middle of "overwelmingly convuluted" and "mindlessly simplistic", depending on where you're coming from. I myself fit in this awkward middle, but others are either scared away by it, or pass it off as pointless, leaving my with a box collecting dust. Oh well.

RATING: 8
Nice remake of the venerable classic.  Nearly everything has changed, including the map, pieces, rules, and victory conditions.  Yet, the feel of the old game remains.  Balance is much better now, and gameplay is more interesting with more viable strategic options.  Victory is now determined by control of twelve victory areas, as opposed to just the five capitals.  The only problem is that with better balance, more units, more territories, and more options, playtime is much longer unless the Axis can quickly grab Karelia and India in the eight victory-area short game.

First played this version on August 4th, 2012.  I like the additions this revision has.  It's nice to restrict countries to only produce so much.  One thing is to make sure to play with people of the same skill level with maybe more emphasis on the Allies being more willing to work towards similar goals.

Abstract and simplistic - NOT a simulation. But when using the national varient rules it does add some 'context' to the game, and I have to say... as much as I feel an '8' is an overscore - I always really enjoy playing this game. Usually ends up being an all-night affair!

More options than the original A&A but certain strategies are still unchanged from the original -- for example, if you're playing the Russians, you still need to pump most of your resources into defending against the Germans.  There's more to do if you're playing the Brits or Japan.  Even with the new units and the unique powers that each country has, the game is only marginally better than the original.  There's much better wargames out there.

After having played some of the more complex hex and counter wargames, I have a new respect for Axis & Allies. Combined arms tactics make sense in this game, and understanding how to maintain an offensive is important. There is more depth to this game than there first appears, and the multitude of options is a nice change from the more scripted traditional wargames.

A true classic and the second best of the GameMaster series of games after Shogun/Samurai Swords. One of the better games to ever come out of the U.S. plus you have to love the bits, especially if you add some decals to them. Very long game though, not usually finished up in one night and, of course, it is a dicefest.

First Axis&Allies game from 1981 was my first real encounter with boardgames. I played it, I think, even before Risk (more precise I watched how it is played). So, when I saw revised edition, didnt hesitate much. If you are interested in WW2, and you played and liked Risk, play this game and it wont let you down. Army figures and dice make you feel like a child again, but there is also a new perspective, about strategy, and tragedy, of biggest armed conflict in history of mankind. It's a challenge to play with each of the five nations. Can be played in few sessions, you can download my list for unit placement and other elements of game. This game is from 2004. and there are new, bigger and improved versions of A&A games, but also more complicated. If you havent played anything more complex than Risk, I think this version is just right for you and your group.

Then again, I've played this version only a handful of times, and it was mainly against someone that was learning.

A game that could have been so much more. 

PROS - I like the research and buying troops concept and simultaneous battle mechanic.

CONS - Odds are the Allies will win most games and the dice seem to powerful. Also the game is far too long.

CHANGES - I'd love to see this system in different game. A DUST type of alternative reality would be cool, just as long as the two sides were more even. Also the game needs to be 120min tops. I'd also like to change the dice from #'s to the CC type that are used in M44 and CCA.

I was really excited to buy this game when I got it.  That was about 15 years ago now.  I was so dissapointed.  The game is too long.  There's far too much down time.  The luck of the dice have a huge effect.  And the rules are flawed.  That and the Allies have a massive advantage!  The German player risks it all and moves into Russia, then th eallies will win.  Almost always. I hate this game.

RATING: 8
A very solid conquer-the-world game, and I'm not really much for those in general. It's complex, and takes a long time, but if you can get some guys to really get into it with you and make an evening (...and night... and morning ;) of it, it can be a very rewarding experience.

In my opinion this revised world edition beats out all of the other Axis & Allies titles, including Europe.

Best stragy game ever!!  And I've played them all... from Risk to Napoleon in Europe.  This game rocks my socks off!!!  Much better than last edition.  The only unrelistic problem with this game is that tanks fight and defend at a 3.  And since they only cost $5, they are almost unstopable.  Besides that, this game is amazing!!

This is a major improvement on A&A, but it still boils down to having the same flaws as the original.  Japan also seems incredibly overpowered in the new version, but that's only based on 3-4 plays with the same group.

Additional Information
Takes more time to set up than to play. In the end (and in the beginning) [b]its a waste of time to set up[/b]. All the game comes down to is this: Does Germany take Russia? No = Allies win. Yes = Axis win. 

Can't invade England because ship transports are way to fragile and take way too many to get enough troops to take England.

Why? Well, it takes 8 to build a transport and 3 to build an infantry. So the attacker has to spend 8 more per pair of infantry or per tank (cost 5).  Infantry attacks on 1 and defends on 2. So the whole game, Russia is building infantry, that's it. If Germany ever prepares an invasion on England, the England player declares open mating season and drafts the whole country and then some.

What's the solution? Either A) Burn the game or B) Nukes (i.e. [gameid=1829]).

Light strategic wargame with a focus on combined arms and concentrating your attacks. The 2004 edition of A&A is essentially the original with some expansion elements incorporated (e.g. artillery, destroyers, 2-hit battleships, less randomness in research). I never played the original so I can't make a comparative analysis. The game has limited allure as a two-player wargame, given the simplicity of the combat resolution mechanism, and while I can see it might function in a five-player soda-and-pretzels context, there are other games in that vein I would prefer such as Twilight Imperium and even Diplomacy.

Great update from the Older Versions.  Very solid, but surpassed by Anniversary Edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An old chestnut that I still find isn't that bad, there are certainly strategies that work better in the game than they ever could have in real life (Japanese invasion through Alaska; a land invasion of Australia; just about anything concerning the Chinese). But as long as you don't expect it to emulate the strategic realities of World War II, and don't mind the dice, it's still not a bad game. The various wrinkles, like when to use artillery and which territories are most valuable, are not necessarily obvious the first time around. (I've played this at least 6 or 7 times, plays recorded notwithstanding.)

Great strategy game, but seems like it ends up pretty much the same, hence the 6 willingness. Not too many German openings attacking Britian for example. Great theme and epic-ness created by this game, but dice can kill.

The revised version of a classic that I played a ton growing up. Like the classic version, the length of the game and long downtime between turns is still here and, to make matters worse, the smaller and darker map board can make things crowded and harder too read. 

All that said, the new units and various tweaks to units, rules, topography, and setup all work together to offer a new but familiar experience that may improve on the classic edition. 

I'm interested to get more experience with it but it seems like the 'Victory Territories' variant used at the WBC tournament is a nice improvement on the win conditions for this game.

An absolute classic and by far the most compelling of the light wargames. Nothing really gets you excited over wild strategies that you just need to try next time like A&A.

RATING: 4
(Rating assumes you're my 7-year-old; if you're an adult, I'm probably going to want to play something else.)

I'm surprised how little this has hit the table.  My friends won't play because it's too long for our weekly game nights, and they aren't interested in playing to a minor victory.  (Plus it has a lot of downtime, which is my main complaint about it.  Some people say it's only good 2-player...)

Although I did rate this higher than the older version, I don't know that it's that much [i]better,[/i] it's just a little [i]different.[/i]  I like the victory cities, and the changes to the map, but [b]hate[/b] every graphic design change they made.

Update: holy crap, I'm playing this with the burrito boy, age 7!

2009-10-31: dropping this back down to 6; no matter whether I have 2 or 5 players, there are a lot of other things I'd rather play.

Update: sentimentality be damned, I'm dropping this to a 4.

Still unplayed but unpacked and rules read. My little home group has evolved into a more euro type of gaming group, and risk is the furthest they venture into wargaming. I got them to play Starcraft once or twice and that was a big stretch.

RATING: 6
[2007.Apr.12] An overall improvement over the original Milton Bradley 'Axis and Allies' game. The new units are (mostly) representative of the WWII-era units of each nation. The re-drawn map is a win; unfortunately, the coloration of the new map is much too dark in my opinion. The game is still a 'dice fest', and many of the old version's attack & defense strategies are still applicable.

Lots of fun, even if I never win.  Seriously.  Never.  We don't play it often (I hate losing), but occasionally one of us gets the itch to wage an epic battle, and nothing else in the collection does it so completely.  Agricola gets close, but an hour or two isn't enough sometimes.

RATING: 6.5
My friend and I were bored one summer and decided to pick this game up from a local store on a whim.

Prior to playing A&A the only thing resembling a war game that I had ever played was Risk.

Once I played A&A i was hooked on the wargame genre (i'd always been a fan of war related computer games).

In short I think A&A really is the perfect gateway game to get your friends interested in wargaming.

I rated it a 6.5 because I think that I do have to be in the right mood to play it but when I do play a game it is always a blast.

RATING: 8
I've had this game since it first came out and it was an enormous upgrade to the original Axis & Allies. However, it was still a little unbalanced and it was difficult to want to invest in building a navy. For its time, this game was amazing. But now, I would suggest everyone to get the 1942 edition(s) instead.

When I'm in the mood for a lengthy medium-weight tactical wargame, this one hits the spot.  It helps that the old (1984) Milton Bradley Gamemaster edition was a classic for me during my college days (played that one weekly).  Now, this new one with new map makes it more interesting.

RATING: 7
I played the old MB version of Axis and Allies quite a bit as a teenager in the 80's.  I have always enjoyed the game and credit it with helping to introduce me to other wargames.  The new version improves the game significantly in my opinion.  The quest for victory point cities is a more sensible end game condition and helps curtail the game's unfortunate length.  I like the new units as well.  Although the map is definitely a bit uglier and the plastic pieces aren't quite as nice, the production values are still impressive.  This update really has improved an old classic (albeit not a game I could play often). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
A new facelift of the same old game.  I wonder whether the game has been correctly positioned in the market as wargamers find it too ahistorical and the non-wargamers find it too "military" a subject matter.  Still too dicey to my taste.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I had to drop my rating on this one. I used to rate it much higher, but recent plays have really swung my opinion around. GERMANY FIRST is an unbeatable strategy. Also... 8 infantry... 8 infantry... 8 infantry... Amusing to watch new players try this game, but for me, I have better things to play now.

I've had more fun playing this game than playing any other.  We played with 5 and throughout the game each "team" would conference and strategize.  I've had almost equal fun with 4.  Although I like playing with three, the only problem is that one player has to play by himself, so he misses out on the group fun.  With four or five, I will play this anytime, anywhere.

A note on the versions.  The ruleset in the revised 2004 edition is the best and the layout of the map is also superior to the Gamemaster version, particularly the addition of another territory between Germany and Moscow, which gives the Soviets more of a fighting chance.  The color scheme of 2004 revised map, however, is not an improvement in my view.  The old Gamemaster map is far more aesthetically pleasing, but beyond that the 2004 revised version is the way to go.  I have not played any of the iterations since the 2004 revised edition, but comments have not been overly favorable, nor have led me to believe that they contain any improvements over the 2004 revised edition.

To date, this is my favorite board game.  The revised edition really adds a lot to the original by making all units feasible to purchase in some circumstance, mellowing out some of the hugely unbalancing techs, and generally keeping the game a cliffhanger for longer.  A phenomenal number of optional rules were included with the rulebook as well.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The revised edition of A&A is the must own version that every A&A player should have.  It has perfect balance (although with a German 7 bid).  Like chess, this game is reasonably easy to learn but the learning curve to master is substantial.  The game is long F2F 6-12 hrs. 

Players with substantially different skill levels can make this game very unfun for a newbie or less skilled player.  

A game you can play with your kids, but you may want to let them win a couple of times.

RATING: 6
I'm sure I'm not alone when I say that this is the game that got me interested in wargaming.  So while I can agree (somewhat) with the crusty old grognards who say this isn't a "real" wargame, I don't think it should be so easily dismissed.  Tight games can be real nailbiters with surprising results...and if it falls far short on the "simulation of war" side of things, I think it meets every qualification for a great game.  The only problem is that games can stretch on for hours and days.  Fine if you've got the time, but after a while you're likely to discover meatier stuff to fill your craving for monster games and this game just won't make it off the shelf anymore.

RATING: 9
An edition that just add some rules that make A&A a better game. Axis & Allies is a great mix between simple rules and good strategies. Easy to learn, not easy to master. Not very realistic, but that is not its purpose. Still, every aspects of a Grand Strategy game are in it: Fight on land, sea and air, strategic bombing, weapons development, amphibious assault, resources management. You have to decide how you will share your forces between your different fronts and with what kind of weapons.

Strengths and weaknesses are different for each country, and for each side. A very interesting setup for a great strategy game!

A must for those who seek a light but fulfilling wargame.

Still a good game. Takes a little too long to play, although that's part of the experience of fighting a global war in one sitting I suppose. 

Probably works best as a two player game, particularly since the Axis armies need to be well-coordinated to have a good chance to win. 

 Totally awesome plastic pieces. My gateway game (yes, it's the game that led me here and, thus, to the world of hobby boardgaming. A single tear is falling down my cheek as I type this).

Purchased 1/25/2008 from Phoenix Games. I felt it was "about time" I added this to my collection. This is a classic I wish was around when I was 10 years old (circa the early 70's) I would have played this to death. Yes, it's a dice-fest, but I would have dug it as much as I dug RISK. It still holds up after all the years. I enjoy it alot.

Map too small for all the units.  Too much rolling of the dice. Tactic work only if the dice is with you.  Don't like the fact that one player have more action since he is controlling 3 factions when playing a 2 players and I don't imagine playing at 5 it will be worst.

Better than the original.  Can be long, depending on the victory level you choose.  We used to play the older MB A&A with select rules from A&A: Europe and A&A: Pacific, after those games came out, so we were easily able to slip into this rules set.  Re-invigorated the game for us.

RATING: 7
One of my first "heavy" games (or what passed for heavy when I was 12). Yes, it's simple mechanically, but I still marvel at the map design (the Pacific Ocean spaces especially are tuned perfectly to produce interesting decisions in movement and fortification) and the sheer fun it brought to our table. It's now been iterated upon many times and in many versions, but I've not been interested in any of them. I'll take the classic, even if it's mainly for the memories.

While this game has a lot of very cool thematic tie-ins to WWII, the extremely long downtime and overall playtime makes this one unrewarding for the investment that goes into it. If turns were quicker and the game was streaomlined, I'm sure I would be much more interested (i.e. Nexus Ops). Nevertheless, I respect this game’s place in board gaming history as a forefather of many of the dudes-on-a-map games I love today.

While some improvement was made over the MB version, this game is a big step back from Europe and Pacific.  It seems to me that the new designer was determined to leave his mark on the series and made a slew of odd changes and comments that irritated me to no end.  Stick with Europe and Pacific if you don't like using house rules, cuz this one needs them.  
   It gets a lower mark then the MB version as it had all the updates to work with and discarded them.

Very nice bits (need more though), with a much improved mapboard; the color scheme is better; gameplay is easy, but it's too simplistic for me compared to other wargames; I like that all of the units have national distinction, rather than just the infantry from previous editions; and I like the optional, national special characteristics--with the exception of the U.S. B-29s: they are much too powerful. However, for a light wargame, it's too light for me and doesn't really hold my interest.

A great revision to a classic.  Problem is with downtime between players - don't play with 5, unless you have several games going on simultaneously.  It offers many, MANY new options as far as strategic approach - almost to the point of . . . brain drain. Which is good, but takes a LOT of time. . .

Just as good as the new A&A 1942 2nd Ed. variant, and slightly simpler (and cheaper, now). For that reason I rate this older version higher, even though the games are nearly the same in function.

Played years ago in a bigone era of gaming. And, was just not impressed. So dry and tedious. I realize this is a classic, but I always preferred Risk - if only for the metagame.

This of course is a classic.  Who hasn't played it and loved it from the pieces to the dice in battling.  I found that after a few years and the same opponents, the game got very scripted.  I still like the game, but it doesn't get much playing time due to its length.

A kid's dream come true. Toy soldiers with real rules! This is a vastly simplified version of Third Reich with miniatures that encompasses the entire globe instead of just Europe. The revised version tweeked the rules slightly and more importantly altered the map board so that (in my opinion anyway) it becomes much more likely that the game will play out in different ways and not come down to a large dice fest in Karelia.

For some reason this game never really interested me. I usually prefer multi-player games. Feels like an advanced version of two-player Risk, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Sometimes I wonder if the game will ever end as cities are lost only to be reclaimed, lost again, reclaimed again, and on and on. I much prefer something like History of the World or Risk 2210.

RATING: 8
Slightly better than the original.  IMHO, one of the true "gateway" games (e.g., Axis & Allies for wargames and Settlers of Catan for eurogames).  Although at first glance, it looks a lot like Risk on steriods, A&A really has a lot more depth and connection to the wargame genre, than most so-called "wargamers" would like to admit.  If you want to get the feel of WWII on a strategic scale without endless calculations on CRT charts/tables, then give A&A a try.

My favorite edition, but some of my opponents seem to think it's skewed toward an Allied victory. I generally only play the Allies, so that's fine by me. I like the added destroyer and artillery pieces, but miss the trays of the 1981 edition. Also, It still has paper IPCs and technology, which have been removed from the most recent edition.

This is the revised version that corrected all of the flaws of the original 1981 version, such as the advantage of the Allies.  Now the game is balanced.  It is partially for sentimental reasons that this game is a 10 to me because I grew up on the original, and this version is an improvement in so many ways, such as the new artillery unit, adjusted tank stats, adjusted costs of units, a better looking map, a more balanced strategic map, and the omission of the strategic bomber tech that tempts less skilled players into blowing money on tech rolls in an attempt to win by luck.

This rating may be adjusted when I try the Pacific and Europe 1940 separately or together.  I do love that this revised 2004 edition begins with the Pearl Harbor attack being the most obvious move for the Japanese.  D-Day is the best way to go, too, but there are plenty of different ways to pull that move off, and it is fun recreating WW2.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I have this version plus my original game from the '80s.  I give this one a slightly lower rank because I don't especially care for the changes they did to the board.  The rules changes are obviously helpful to bring the game up-to-date and a bit more in-line with today's modern mechanics, but the core of the game remains the same which is nice.  Still very fun to play!

Great Revision to the classic game.  Only 2 problems with the A& A franchise: 1) the down time between players and 2)length of game.  They really tried to improve the second one with victory cities.  Giving a 6 as you have to know what you are getting into.  Great Classic game!  They improved the options for different strategies for each country, balanced units and overall game play.

RATING: 7
Classic large scale battle game. No subtlety here - buy lots of units and crush the opposition beneath your die rolls. The game has more strategy than it seems at first glance, but poor luck can ruin the best laid plans. Main downside is that it can take 3 hours to a full day to play, depending on the skill of the players involved. Still a lot of fun if you have the time, especially with 5 players. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The complexity of the rules is overstated. Once you get it down, the game becomes a different world. Instead of having too many units, you have too few. It comes down to determining how risky your opponent wants to play and maximizing your deployment of units to both defend and to coax the opponent into attempting reckless advances. It's true that the game can be determined by a few good or bad streaks of rolling dice, but there is so much depth to unit movement that it makes up for this fatal flaw.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great game, but too weighted on the allies side.  Some small tweaks do a lot for the game.  Bidding on who is germany (how many extra IPC they get when starting, who can bid lowest) makes the game a lot more interesting.  Regardless, a classic game.

I bought this as a birthday present for my 6-years-old son, and he liked it very much. Contrary to CRT-based wargames, the required arithmetic doesn't include the division, which he wouldn't be able to compute. His problem is that he tends to buy only big units such as battleships and bombers. Admittedly, it's very much like Risk, but the narrative is more plausible. Set up time is a bit of a pain.

RATING: 2
The randomness of dice rolls, combined with major balance issues between the factions can make Axis & Allies a good experience on one playthrough and completely miserable the next.

A player's gameplay experience is very dependent on which faction he/she plays. USA gets the freedom to pursue almost any course of action, while USSR is stuck grinding out Infantry every turn until someone defeats one of the Axis powers and by then the game is basically over.

Axis & Allies has been surpassed by many other war games since its release. A&A, and Risk before it, now only serve as a snapshot showing how far modern games have come.

A lot of fun, doubtless unbalanced.  It takes so long to play that we've often resigned rather than play the game to completion.  It's a game that keeps your mind going back to your next move, and has you contemplating various strategies.  

Pretty much just Risk with lots of fun chrome and complication, but I'm okay with that as I enjoy classic Risk.

RATING: 10
Love love LOVE this game.  I'm not a crazy maniac about it... only play a few times a year, but each game spans several 4-hour sessions.

UPDATE: Nov. 5, 2008: Okay, time for an update. Turns out I AM a crazy maniac about this game... or more specifically, about the potential it has awakened. I have created a custom 6' x 3' totally redesigned map of the game.

We call it Axis & Allies: World.

We have several new units for land, sea, air, and infrastructure, which all serve specific purposes and we're working on more. Jeeps carry troops on land, halftracks fight decently and tow other slower land units, special forces have a first-round attack bonus, they "panzerblitz", and can be airdropped, cargo planes conduct airdrops and transport gear, interceptors group with other planes to absorb AA fire, Escorts repair capital ships and group to absorb shore gun fire and sub raid hits, machine guns are great defenders against infantry, shore guns cover seazones from land, cruisers are strong fighters that can be converted to antiaircraft cruisers, land mines defend land borders and coastlines, fortifications absorb hits, and there are probably a few more i am forgetting right now.  China is a minor power and Italy is a major power. We use ports and airfields, convoy boxes, greatly-refined strategic bombing, minefields, CAP, anti-sub warfare and sub raids, and a lot of other added rules.

The game lasts very long (multiple multi-hour sessions) because the map and the number of units on the map is so greatly expanded (140 seazones and over 215 territories)... also we have included rules for defender retreats, so units have longer "lives" and battles can often rage back and forth for several rounds over key territories until one player can get a good solid defensible position there... the game moves slowly, but that's how we like it... a nation can suffer from a bad battle or strategic error and still recover if played wisely. Feels more like a war and less like a battle.

Edit: knocked a point off as the anniversary edition of Axis and Allies has come out and is better in every way.  That game now deserves the 10!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A rather unflexible game with a war theme, which offers only 3 or 4 basic strategies for each side. It's harassing to handle all the tiny bits (the board is too small!), it has enormous downtimes when played with more than 2 players, and takes around 10 hours to complete, if not even more. Still, it looks great and is sometimes fun to play. 

I strongly recommend to play it online (TRIPLE-A, an open source clone). Automatic setup, keep track of your units... it's much easier and faster, and thus less frustrating!

POSSIBLE TWEAK: Application of low luck rules? Meaning, you don't roll 1 dice for each unit, but sum up the attack/defend values of all units involved in a battle, devide the result by 6, roll 1 dice in case of a remainder. The arithmetic average will not change at all, but the deviation will extremely decrease the larger the battle becomes, making Axis and Allies a (almost) perfect information game. 
I GUARANTEE anyone reading these lines: This tweak turns AaA into the heaviest brain burner you may ever have encountered!

The revised rules are much easier to get a grip on than those with the original game--and yet, I still don't find this engaging. Maybe this particular game design just isn't my bag, as I'd like to like it. 

There are still a lot of rules to keep in mind, even though this is not considered a complex war game. So that in itself is a little off-putting. Also, the set-up alone can take quite a while. So one way or another, it takes a time commitment to set it up, learn the game, and play through. 

But that's exactly what you have to do--start playing while following the rule book (which is well illustrated, generally well-written and pretty well laid out) and go step-by-step. 

I don't find A&A as engaging as some other games in the same general category ("World in War: Combined Arms, 1939-1945" and "Pacific Victory" come to mind). And for some reason, when I played it I still get a tinge of a feel of playing 'Risk-plus,' which puts me off a bit. But the map and army pieces are excellent, and it's a good all-around game. 

Sold--along with "Conquest of the Pacific"--in December of 2010. Owned this in the '80s, but didn't have anybody to play with and didn't do much with it. Got this revised (2004) version in January '07 for one of my sons' birthdays.

A great improvement from the ‘old’ verision. The game is more balanced, there is more tough decision-making, and loads of options. Now Island-Hopping in the Pacific make a lot more sense (through the IPC value of Borneo and East Indies are both at 4 now), the increase of the number of spaces on the Russian border makes this part of the board a LOT more dynamic (changed from the old “if Germany does not capture Karelia in G2, Allies win the game…”).

My first game didn't go well. We had five persons playing and the game lasted for 7 hours. I played the United Kingdom and felt that nothing worked out. It was 6Ã‚Â½ hours of pure misery. After that, there was an unseen change of events and we won the game. Ok..

At the end I finally managed to land on Normandy. The game was over by then since US tanks were at Berlin, but at least I was historically a bit correct now...
Wouldn't very easily play again because I have choices.. I want to try some other WWII-games first before even planning to come back on this one.

RATING: 5.75
I'm not a seasoned veteran of the original A&A, although I did play it a few times.  I wanted to buy this version because I want to play it 'fixed' - that is, if this is the result of years of playtesting and listening to customers, I assume that this will be be the 'best' that A&A (main scenario) will get.  My A&A-inclined friends already drool at the idea of playing this remake.. should be fun! Update: Played some of one game - ran out of time to complete.  Subtle changes here with big results - it has the feel of the original A&A but you'll have to come up with all new tactics.  Impassible neutral countries, new units (destroyer and artillery), and improved tanks are only a few of the changs - and I happen to like them, so far.  Still unrated.

Classic dice-fest; luck factor is not really a problem. Historical theme; feels nice. Takes a long time to setup and play; often feels static and has downtime problems. Relatively simple to learn, but to win you really need to know what the working strategies are. Nice components. Better balanced and more fun than the original version.

Great improvement over the original. Still has some oddities but appears to have resolved the programmed move syndrome. Where the previous edition was repetitious, this is different; much more enjoyable.

A Better succesor then it´s original ?
The game is a tad bit deeper ( more sorts of units, other territories etc)BUT!!!! IMHO AvolonHill could have done a better job with the quality of the product (too less tanks , wear and tear problems, the board is SMALLER then the original etc) . I prefer the original for a beer& pretzel game night with the boyz.

Having grown up on a regular diet of Axis and Allies and Dungeons and Dragons, I was apprehensive about the "new" Axis and Allies.  After a single play, I can honestly say, this version is a worthy successor.The new rules and the new map, greatly improve the game.  Gone are the old days, of massive infantry stacks.  It actually makes sense now, to buy tanks and planes, and all the other cool stuff.I like it.

RATING: 7.5
A&A Revised is a great light wargame, which is real fun,  especially with a partner. If you're thinking of buying e.g. Attack!, I think Axis & Allies Revised Edition is what you should get instead. However, SBR with heavy bombers (incl. USA's Superfortresses optional rule) is unbalanced IMHO. I hope AH will fix this with an official rule variant or so. There's lot of dice rolling too, but voodoo magic helps!  Games played for more than 8 VC:s tend to take a looooong time, so you'll probably get to play only on weekends or holidays.

RATING: 6
Unbalanced powers. The setup of the gameboard takes some time. The production quality is good, but there isn't enough unit pieces and the board is a bit small. Nevertheless, it is a very good simulation of World War II with various types of combat units, simple rules, solid combat mechanics, good strategic depth and great historical feel. Place an additional German artillery in Lybia to balance things up and you're good to go.

RATING: 5
To me, this game is rather stale, with old-school, uninventive game design. Unless you're really into WW2 or approach the game with the same mentality as for chess, it loses much of its charm after you've played it a couple of times. It's not really designed for "optimum fun", with players having to wait a long time for their turns and gameplay continuing long after it's become evident who's winning and who's losing. It's kind of inflexible in terms of number of players, and there's not enough tactical diversity to make it feel replayable after everyone's had one go at playing each nation. The methods used by the game designers to have gameplay flow in the "right direction" (from a historian's point of view) feel crude and you still get some historically absurd situations now and then. I know there are other people who can't get enough of Axis & Allies, but I'd rather play something that's more inventive, more replayable and doesn't involve such long downtimes between one's own turns.

 The 2004 Revised A&A exceeds the original.  Russia is now far more interesting to play, and instead of almost continuously being decimated, in many (but not all...)games can become a Power!  New Victory Conditions will please some but not all.  We found that their recommended Short Game (8) is too quick and lucky, but their Longer Game (10) is almost un-necessary.   It is usually clear who has the upper hand at NINE CITIES and recommend you play with that figure.   Another option is to allow a New Production Factory to produce +1 unit, to a maximum of 3.  Thus, the few 3s and 4s still produce their number.  But now more strategys are available for a player wanting to build a Factory in a TWO region, as it can build 3 units per turn.

Hard to improve on the classic 2nd edition, but this one does so in some very key areas. Eastern Europe and the Pacific have been fragmented, making them a much more dynamic battlespace. The East Indies are worth more IPCs, giving the Japanese incentive to hold on to them beyond denying a staging area to Allied bombers. Nation-specific units and the ominous dark oceans add a ton of character.

I first played the third edition nearly 20 years ago and have since played the revised edition. Axis and Allies is a great two player game which involves you in the full sweep of world war II. Its central driving mechanic, the economic inferiority of the Axis powers ensures that games are played in an aggressive manner.

RATING: 6.6
When you have the time to commit to this, it can be great fun.  Really enjoyed the last game played, probably because we won, but hey, who doesn't like winning.
There's a lot of strategy within the rules of the game rather than the era it was set in, so, just because you know your WWII history doesn't mean your going to be able to steam roll others.
Experienced players therefore have a distinct advantage and will tend to play game type moves.  I mean who sends two infantry to attack a place with tanks and aircraft if only to use the bombardment from the ships feature.  Clearly a suicide mission for the infantry which would in a military sense achieved little in reality.

As a mechanism for collaborating with your allies and formulating bluff moves & counter strategies its a very thematic and enjoyable way to spend a day.
You certainly have plenty to talk about afterwards, even if its to curse your luck at loosing to some crappy dice rolling.

:star::star::halfstar::nostar::nostar: Easy to learn

(6/21/07) - Purchased

(6/24/07) - [8] - The mother of all strategic wargames. I've only been able to find a few people willing to play this behemoth. As a history buff I love seeing alternative history in action (aka the time I took Japan and swept them through all of Russia and linked up with Germany in the Soviet Capital!).

(12/10/07) - [7] - After playing a few more games I am going to re-rate this to a 7. A bit too much dice rolling for my tastes. Playing with the "low-luck" variant certainly helps though.

SOLD (04/14/2017) - Axis & Allies was one of those games that held a special place in my heart, but I found myself never really wanted to ever play it.

Game is really better played with 2 or maybe 4 but, terrible as a 5 player game.

However, despite massive dice rolling, the game has simple rules allowing for concentration on strategic planning. This means you are spending production to replace current anticipated losses while planning 2-3 turns ahead.

Nice intro for younger gamers and good general primer for WWII history.

As a former A&A fan, I've followed the AH preview, "Countdown to Invasion" with interest.  From what I've read, it sounds like a great revision of the original game.

Sorry, A&A, I used to love your theme and scale of war, but I've decided that the game rules favor defense so strongly, thwarting or drawing out any advantage one has over the other, that the only winning move is not to play. Besides, I'd rather play AA50 or the other newer versions.

More interested in trying the mini-A&As, since the shorter game time makes the "dice brakes" less annoying. I still love the theater scale though, and wish I could find other games at this level of "zoom" that don't take forever (A&A) in an unsatisfying way and aren't too complex (World in Flames).

RATING: 4.5
Improvement over the original, but has the same repetitive problem where the game becomes the same re-hash of a very small number of 1-2 possible opening strategies.  Great game design, well worth having, but after about the 10th play...it just isn't that interesting anymore.  The opening round and the opening strategy chosen, dictate the rest of the game and is usually fairly predictable, after that. An experienced Allies player will win 4 out of 5 times.  If the Axis player doesn't have good luck in the first two rounds, the game becomes a long, slow tortuous grind of "MORE vs LESS" and is really pretty boring.  I've lowered my rating on this one.  After eleven plays on GTO, with 8 straight wins as Axis, once Allies know what they are doing, they will always win, last 0-3 losses in a row for me as Axis prove that out.  Maybe I will go out and buy "A&A: 1942" some day, but I doubt it.

RATING: 9
[48 plays] [2 player rating = 9] [3-4 player rating = 6]

Games no longer seem stale or scripted in this new version. Germany and Russia still need to purchase infantry for cannon fodder, but less so than traditional A&A. The increased defensive value of armor results in less "strafing" and "dead zone" fronts than the old game. Japan, USA, and the UK are still purchasing a mix of land, air, and naval - but more armor than in traditional A&A. Fighters and carriers are bought more often (by everyone but Russia) because of their cheaper price and better odds of a new carrier surviving its launch from the shipyard. The new impassable zones and other changes to map boundaries make the fronts more volatile and challenging in several regions of the board. 

The game is well balanced and plenty of fun without the extra luck and chaos introduced with technology. This game is simply a wonderful medium/light 2 player wargame. Crazy damn dice are the one thing that keeps my rating from going to 10.

Most recent play completed 4/14/13 with Garrett on gametableonline.

My A&A revised record :
15 wins and 8 losses with the Axis
19 wins and 6 losses with the Allies

The Revised edition of Axis and Allies was interesting. It added new units, locations that needed to be held, and new unit defense numbers (specifically for tanks). Additionally, the map was changed a little bit and some spaces were added in key areas, slowing movement down some. 

Overall, I enjoyed my plays. I probably won't be buying it, but I will definitely play it!

I played this a bit when it first came out. I certainly liked it much more than Risk, but I feel abosultely no compulsion to obtain a copy. In fact, it just isn't that memorable. Reading the rules to Struggle of Empires is more exciting to me than actually playing Axis and Allies.

This is a very accessible game and definily provided a starting point for many now veteran wargamers.

The game is pretty straightforward: devise a strategy, build units, move units, throw dice.

That's it, but although the design is lacking when compared to other games, it still provides a good basis for an entertaining evening (as a multiplayer game). And this is what most games promoted on this site are lacking IMHO.

RATING: 4
It is an OK update of the "ol' classic".  Certainly it is bringing this tired game to the modern era and gaming, but for all the bells and whistles it is still the same game.  They added a couple new units, fixed the map and added more reasonable victory conditions, but really, as with the original A&A, whoever rolls dice better will get better results.  This can be said for many games, but with A&A there is no attempt to disguise it.  As with the original it runs a little long with extensive stretches of downtime if you are only playing one country.  

It's fun to move the pieces around for the first half, but soon it wears thin and I'm reminded why I haven't played this in 15 years.  I kept thinking of all the other great war games I'd played since high school that have made this system completely obsolete.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is still a good war game that I will always cherish from my youth, but its starting to get dated. The game length is a major issue, 3-6 hours of play time, plus it's not newbie friendly, and the board is static, so if play regularly it gets samely real fast. Still I will aways have a place in my gaming library for this classic.

I really want to like A&A, I really do! But playing this game is frustrating for me and forces me to admit that I'm just not a wargamer. At setup the pieces don't even fit the gameboard; very frustrating and not much fun to play. Not a game meant for a board. Download the free computerversion Triple_A instead.

Very good game. I've only played a couple of times but I've loved it. The thing is. You depend very much on dice result. Tactics is very important, much more important than in Risk for example, however the dice tirany could be a problem. It takes too long.

PORTUGUÊS: Jogo muito bom. Joguei poucas vezes mas acho que vou gostar ainda mais do jogo quando começar a jogar mais e a conhecer melhor a mecânica. A ideia das cidades vitória é muito boa porque nos permite controlar melhor o tempo de jogo, embora eu ache - eu e os meus colegas de jogo - que a vitória pequena favorece muito o eixo. É um jogo de táctica de guerra como eu não conhecia e, embora dependa da sorte dos dados, esta tem sobretudo a ver com estatísticas. Ao contrário do Risco (Risk) por exemplo, neste jogo podemos melhorar muito a nossa probabilidade de vitória num determinado combate e isso já faz com que a sorte dê mais trabalho e traga mais mérito a quem se souber posicionar melhor.

A gaming buddy and I played our first round (one turn for each country) last night, and my first impression is that this is a significant improvement over the original Axis & Allies, which I played many times in high school and occasionally afterwards.  The balance between the two sides seems much  better; for example, the addition of the Western Russia territory, initially under German control, allows Russia to take offensive action early in the game without crippling Germany.  And, while I have yet to figure out their optimal use, I like the artillery and destroyer units that have been added to the game -- it definitely bothered me that there was no ship with a balance of offense and defense with a power in between that of a submarine and a battleship in the original game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An improvement on the old classic.  It's still much the same game, but with a bit more depth to the land combat (artillery) and naval combat (destroyers).  The map has been slightly altered to correct some flaws.  This is more balanced than the original - which is non-historical, but makes for a more fun game.  The Allies still have the edge, but strong Axis players can easily tip the balance.  It's an interesting game, though not in any way a simulation.

I've played A&A since I was 14, bought the revised edition and played it as well, and can finally say that I no longer am interested in playing this game.  A&A is all or nothing - you attack with 100% of your stuff, and at the end of your turn, you will have your boot on your opponent's neck.  But then they take their turn, and their boot is on your neck.  Then you go again...   Eventually, all the boot-necking wears one side down, usually the Axis, and someone concedes.

The revised version I like much more than the previous, but I still think it is too long for what it is.  Still feels a bit scripted and still a lot of dice. Probably a better game with 2 players, but I have always played with 3-5.

I was afraid that when I heard they revised the old A&A that they would screw it up....well, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with how many changes were for the better rather than the other way around.

Do have a friend that loves this game, but that is also the problem. He'll play your side as well. Also, he also owns the game so there goes a reason to keep it around.

AAR is one of my favorite wargames. It's not a true multiplayer wargame since the war is waged between two predetermined factions. While the Axis--the Germans and Japanese--can play their own game, teamwork is imperative for the Allies--the Russians, British and Americans--if they hope to win. AAR is a lot more complex than it first appears. Players are constantly managing their global strategy while juggling tactical demands in each round. Best with four players. Highly recommended.

RATING: 5.5
Fun at times, but there gets to be a lot of crowded piles of tokens under minis and a possibility space that feels a bit too large to handle. It doesn't even feel like AP, even when you take ten minutes to make a decision, just because there really are that many things to consider. Of course, when it does go down, you're left rolling a lot of dice. Not to say there isn't deep strategy-- more experienced players win consistently in my games-- but it doesn't hold excitement all the way through and starts to drag on by the end. Even if you know who's going to win, you have to play out the battle(s) for those last cities from both a tactical and economic disadvantage until you officially lose, despite seeing it coming. I normally think it's poor form to forfeit 'early' in most games unless victory is impossible, but A&A almost encourages it. It probably improves with more plays, but what a commitment that is. I may try the newer version (1942) if I get a chance; I've heard it's a genuine improvement, but I don't expect it to totally turn me around.

2/14/05 - Rating is pending first play 
2/22/05 - The complexity of this game is not beyond the reach of the moderate game player. Its accesiblitiy makes it a good game. Its ability to keep the play from getting ridiculous makes this a great game. I love the changes to the game since the original edition. The play is far more fluid. My only complaint (which I'm sure is a BIG PLUS for all you WWII geeks out there) are the pieces. More specifically the different Naval units make it hard to tell which type of ship you are working with. Some, Aircraft carrier and Submarine, are easy enough but the Destroyer, Battleship and Trnasport are some times are to tell between. All-in-all an excellent game.

We've been playing this since it came out & really like the balance so far. My biggest gripe is that they give you only the bare minimum game pieces. We found ourselves digging in the other Axis & Allies games we own for units, counters, even chips!! We bought a 2nd game so that we have enough pieces to play with. Also the board should have been a little larger so the pieces fit on easier. Stop chintzing! So the game costs a few extra bucks. You're selling mainly to a gamer market. Do you think they won't pay the price to own it?

A bit of a grinder, but goes smoothly with experienced players.  I would like to see this one get to the table more but I understand not everybody's into since the rules are somewhat heavy to grasp for non-experiend gamers and there's lots of chess-like movement with drawn out dice battles, and of course the luck factor can ruin even the best strategy.  With well-balanced sides this game can take all night.

Axis and Allies is the gateway war game. It can be fun if you are interested in the era and history behind the war, but can drag on for hours or even days. Not for the faint-of-heart. Still, as far as war games go, it is not very complex at all.

This updated version, released in 2004, is worth every penny.  The expanded area has an awesome impact on play, both expanding the Russian front and increasing the usefullness/dependence on sea units.

A&A is a sentimental favorite, although I am no longer as hooked as I once was.  It is a great combination of resource management, luck, and strategy, but I would probably lean towards some newer games in a pinch.

Beautiful A&A game. Played it several times. Owned 3 copies
This review is for the  version with Gray germans and celiri green british only.  ( the other versions are ugly )
The pastel colors is really seducing and reminescent of WWII propaganda boards.
Best version is the one with Gray germans and Celeri Green  British, which are rare to find since they introduced Black germans armies. Are highly not recommend the Blacks Germans as they are more difficult to differentiate on the map and also because its highly inaccurate historically. Also and sadly, this revised edition got several version that did not fit the colors of the armies on the back of box which is really annoying and sad.
This game also includes National rules which is pretty neat to use if you are a A&A hardened player

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I love Axis & Allies but it is nearly impossible to play a game (i.e. all my plays are from 10+ years ago).  With the length of a game taking at least 3 hours it is difficult to schedule enough participants.  If any of the players are new then at least 5 hours is necessary (AP is rampant), which makes introducing new players a difficult proposition.  The board really should have included a flip *introductory* side for two players.  Yes, I know the game can be played with two players (!) but I don't think it is reasonable for a new player to manage more than one country while still learning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game is fun to play, and when having 5 more or less equal players it's even better. Sadly the game is far from balanced. The Axis has to be very aggressive from start (along with some luck) or they are doomed. If they fail the first two rounds the allies will win the game without much effort.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This game was my introduction to war gaming. By far and away (in my limited knowledge) one of the more solid games in existence. The mechanics are fairly straight forward and the playability of the game is top notch. Some people may not like the amount of chit and micro miniature handling involved with the game, but there are far worse out there to be sure. If you have never played Axis and Allies but have managed to slog through Risk at least once...I implore you to try this at least once.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game with a lot of flaws, e.g. it lacks in historical accuracy, places too much emphasis on dice rolling, players develop standard strategies after a few plays etc., but, nevertheless, a game with a lot of charm to keep you interested.
The pieces look especially beautiful. 
In the end, a better version of "Risk" with more options for the players, but still a slightly flawed game.

I was first introduced to this game in the Fall of 1986. The first semester of my freshman year at university was full of A&A, beer, and NCAA football Saturdays. At the end of the semester, some dean or other official sent me a letter informing me that I was on academic probation. When I inquired if it was double-secret probation I was invited to vacate my room in the dormitory. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Wasn't nearly as long as I had been led to believe.  On the other hand, being the allies, I rolled poorly enough and made some rather spectacular strategic mistakes that the game ended rather abruptly with an axis economic victory.  All in all what seemed like a reasonably realistic simulation of WWII. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a good game, better balanced than its [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98]older counterpart[/url].  New map, units, and some new rules make it interesting, but I wouldn't buy it if you own the old one.  If you don't own the old one, though, this game is definitely worth a look.  I can't comment on it versus the newer editions, as I have never had an opportunity to play them.  I maintain that this is a superb introductory game for anyone with latent wargamer tendencies.  If you can get somebody to sit down for a couple hours to play this baby and they like it, it's a good sign that you can start throwing almost anything down on the table for them to try.

This is one of my all time favourites. Its a good gateway game thats easy to learn and play. Although there are flaws with some of the rules, the Revised is a definite improvement on the classic version with more options. The game also lends itself fairly well to house rules. The national advantages are a nice touch although some are unbalanced and either too weak or too strong. I think this is a good lightweight strategy game if you don't mind the lack of depth.

One of the original Ameritrash games. This rating is for the Wizards of the Coast revised edition. I like the victory cities and the national advantages, they are a neat addition to the classic gameplay. Still, the game takes a hair too long for what it is and so it doesn't get played much...

Have loved A&A since my cousin got the Game Master version for Christmas 15+ years ago.  This game tickles the military history fan in me, and the strategy and mechanics are deep, if a little predictable at higher levels of play.

Give Germany an extra tank in Algeria, and this game *really* gets going.

The time and number of players it takes to play keeps this below a 10.

Good times - I wouldn't turn down a game, but I will agree with most on the complaint that it doesn't vary enough from game to game, and it can get boring for certain players (ex. Russia who just cranks out infantry).  It's really a two player game.  5-player games often turn into essentially two player games anyway.

RATING: 5
Flaws: Axis in 8 VC game is incented to gamble on all-or-nothing plans (whether Sealion or Calcutta/Leningrad), subs will never be purchased, VCs are oddly chosen. Strangest, though, are the breakpoints: 9 should [b]obviously[/b] be the standard game. Even better would be a "VP clock" from AAP, but I think this one was developed with blinders on. It's like they ran out of time and said "good enough."

There are strong points, too: much better map, reduced emphasis on big stacks, better initial parity, great variety (though marginal balance) of special powers.

Overall, considering the opportunity they had, a slight miss for me.  Still an interesting game, with lots of tough choices and difficult probabilities to mull over. Better than original, to be sure.

RATING: 8
Finally got to play the revised edition with Jason.  The much more dynamic Eastern front, addition of the artillery units, tweaks of other units all combined to make it a definite improvement on the old (good) formula.  My only concern is that he seemed to think there were some pretty scripted best moves to begin the game.  As I get more plays in (hopefully) we'll see how that holds up.

Highly overrated and overplayed if considered as a wargame. Just fine if one thinks of this as a game with a history theme of WWII pasted on with safety glue which when wet dissolves. There is so little connection with real world strategy in this game that while it's a fun game, it's got little to do with the real interactions of the war. So much is so highly abstracted to gamey activities that only the hard core devote' is going to consider this a real wargame instead of super light fluff barely a notch above Risk (*cough* *cough* *cough*). The whole design seems to be based more on a thin buckets of dice approach, just not nearly as much as the other aforementioned game. As a game it is fun, it is enjoyable, it is a nice light way to entertain yourself and some friends while sitting maybe and watching war movies or football on Sunday. It does permit one to sit and do short term statistical analysis of one's turn, though frequently that's not necessary.

After playing for 7 hours the game was not finished. All the nations did not advance that much. I think the game would at least take another 4/5 hours to finish. So defenately not my kind of game, because I think a good game must be finished within 7 hours max. Furthermore, 9 out of 10 times hard earned ground is lost next turn, so little to no progress. Considering production rates I do not think the game is equally balanced. Axis must go for the throat and win within 3 rounds, otherwise they are doomed. So in my opionion victory conditions should be reconsidered. Maybe by adding a maximum of rounds. Last but defenately not least: Nations could have more "flavour" to their national characteristics: where are the kamikazes? -my fellow axis player was searching for them. Where are the famous English stubborness or german tactical advantages of 1941? This would defenately add more colour and individual tactical decisionmaking to the game. That's better than the not-so-interesting R&D implemented in the game.

RATING: 2
Played once with friends, but 1 found it too complicated, 1 already knew A&A and loved it, 1 will likely never play it again as he prefers lighter games, 1 didn't care about the game just as long as he could be Japan and I... think it's much better than Risk, but it's pretty heavy for my tastes. I'm not really that into 'real' wargames, I prefer Shogun (the Queen Games one), Risk 2210AD and the like.

Update: Played once again and it's definite: I wouldn't want to play this again. The same set-up each game that takes half an hour, the terrible faction that the USSR is, the fact you do nothing half the game as the US, the terrible system to research technologies... I don't like this game. It also takes way too long. I'd much rather play Game of Thrones, Risk 2210AD, Shogun, or what have you.

RATING: 6
About the upper limit of how "complicated" i like a game to be, this is a wargame for those looking to take a step up from Risk (and that's not slight against that game). The rule book is a bit all over the place, and a few of the smaller rules are hard to remember, but do sink in after a few test plays. Piece quality is pretty good, but there's a LOT of little bits so be careful. The cardboard markers are surprisingly thin. Adjustable game conditions can shorten length, but expect this to take a while, espically if you are playing with newbies. Downtime for other players can also be a factor, so try to work with your teamates on your turn so that you work as a unit. Expect my rating to go up a bit as i get more used to the game.

Just not the type of theme I'm interested in. Prefer Mare Nostrum, Diplomacy or even Risk 2210. Too focused on war, no trade aspect. Forced to fight as only means to win. I can see why it is so popular though.

Made the best tactical and strategical movements possible, got great dice rolls, kept everything flowing, and lost because of my partner. So disappointed with a game that has such a large fanbase. Poor minis, poor rules. Just a bad experience for me. I will only play again if there is nothing else on the table and my only ride home is the guy who REALLY wants to play A&A.

Risk, except better and taking place during WWII. A poorly organized instruction manual kept this game from getting a 10.

I don't have the right group for this game like I once did.  Also after playing a much more fun game like Dust, I knocked A&A down another point.

Not the most subtle game I know. But still delivers a lot of fun.

I've never had fun playing any board game for six hours.

Fun game, but game play tends to repeat itself and it can get bogged down in the massing of armies and handfulls of dice rolling.

The Revised version only improves a classic. Dice-rolling galore. There are, of course, much deeper wargames but this one does a fair job of simulating the strategic subtleties of WWII solely through setup and geography. I am in agreement with the designer on depth of simualtion in wargames: tracking how much gas is in a jeep isn't my idea of fun. Setup is a bitch on this one though.

Seems really good but just takes too long.

Classic.  The new units/map add to the game, but either way this is a great any-time game.  Always ready to play.

A good introduction into wargaming although it is not properly balanced.  Attack! is better.  After playing Victory in the Pacific, War at Sea, and Neppagames: ETO, I doubt I'll ever play A&A again.

A classic. Played the original and the revised. Bought the revised and used it to get a friend hooked on gaming. A good time, but what a pain to set up.

Lotsa fun, but pretty dang long if the sides are even. The changes from the older version are excellent, making the Russian front more interesting with the new area divisions, and giving England a new fleet to play with. The balance still feels biased against the Axis, though; unless the Germans are really successful in the beginning, there's probably not much hope. Making Hawaii a victory city might improve things by forcing the US Navy to come out and play before its completely ready.

Largely the game that brought me to wargaming, an absolute classic, inspired by risk, striking via great detail and balance, comes with huge possibilities to play online. but suffers a bit from long duration and very carved in opening standards.

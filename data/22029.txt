My first toofatlardies game, and the best WW2 wargame there is. 

Just brilliant!

A favorite of mine for over a year now. Some people just don't get it and want a definitive answer to each circumstance  in modeling miniature warfare, the Kreigsspeil approach taken by these rules makes for a smooth flowing simulation. I try and demo this game as much as time lets me at conventions or in the local game shop. It's one of those games everyone's heard about but has never tried. The breath and range of the conflicts you can simulate is only limited by the reference material at hand, it's perfectly made for the historical do it yourself type. Lots of online support at the yahoo forum.

my intro to ww2 miniature combat-this is a blast to play!
Also have 
'Where the Hell You Been, Boys?'-Omaha Beach supplement,
'Gotterdammerung'-Western Front base game,
'Afrika Korps'-Western Desert supplement
>>>>>P.S.  UPGRADED FROM 9.5 TO 10 because two guys named "PETER PALMER" (great name btw) from the same part of NZ both gave it a "1".  Plus this is a great, fun game to play!  (Shame on you, "Peter".)

I like the basic mechanics but many parts of the rules are too sketchy. Just saying 'do as you wish' isn't great rules design, IMHO.

A very different, yet enjoyable approach to WW2 gaming. Best if played by individuals with an interest in the period and history, rather than powergamers. I find the 'quirky' humor in the rules annoying, but it's clear the authors don't want the game to be viewed as a matter of life or death. Emphasis is on enjoyment of the game throughout. A few situations require a judgment call.

The use of blinds for movement, and card-based activation along with the Tea Break end turn card vary activation between turns, so most of the 100 foot general problem is removed. However, a certain amount of trust between players is needed.

Not a game I've been able to play often, but I would gladly play again.

Superb system for WW2 Company-level miniatures games.  By far my favorite for the period.  The Kriegspiel approach is perfect for sensible gamers.

MY number 1 miniatures rule set for company level wargaming.  Its a card driven system which yields good results without adding too much friction as in other card driven games.  This game lets you focus on the tactics not the rules.  You can play this game using real world tactics and it yields real world results.

My favorite WWII company level rules.  The rules are best for playing in a friendly setting, and a not a "tournament-type" rules set.  Some of the rules are a bit vague, which is a result of the Kriegspiel type background.

RATING: 9.4
A really good rules system, not too complex but give a good feel of the friction of war through the eventcard dek.  Like an apple mac, very easy for newbies to use and be involved without spending two hours reading the rules.  In many ways to me the ASL of modern wargame rules for figures. You can set up a small scenario, weakend company level and play in an hour or the rules do scale up to battalion level actions

I have a lot of wargame rules for WWII and these guys have developed a great system with fantastic support to enjoy a lot of different theaters. The infantry rules are really fun but the it's not designed for tank vs tank games and as a result the tank combat rules are too gamey, not that great. Otherwise though a tremendous achievement!

I been a IABSM! fan from nearly the beginning.  Each version gets better and better.  The current version "3rd Edition" is an outstanding set of rule with excellent presentation.

A great game that leads to exciting games.  The card activation system is an excellent mechanic.

While the rules book is....not so great, the actual system is excellent!

RATING: N/A
You need period knowledge to enjoy these rules as they are a kriegspiel type framework. By intention they do not attempt to define the affects of all possible situations but leave it up to the players' judgement. Having an experienced umpire helps but is not essential.
Not recommended for rules lawyers.

I really like the turn sequence by using cards.  Infantry combat is well thought out and easy to understand.  The rules become very confusing when using tanks and artillery.  I hear IABSM3 will fix these problems

A definite refreshing departure from other WWII miniature rules.  Maybe it's not for everyone, but hey, "Try it, you'll like it."

Decent concept.  3rd Edition improves layout quite a bit.  Still sometimes requires an umpire and/or opponents who are on very friendly terms with you to resolve actions/conflicts.

Reglamento para jugar enfrentamientos en la WW2 con unidades tamaño compañia, con motor de cartas, muy agil, mejor con arbitro, y que requiere sin este de jugadores-caballeros.

Have to play more. Though designed for friendly play, the rules could be more tight.

Love Too Fat Lardies Rules. Great mechanics for company level 15mm ww2. Like Chain of Command a bit better though

RATING: 1
an antidote to an orchestrated campaign. Like the ideas but the rules are a WIP rather than a finished cohesive whole.

It's a fun set of rules, love some of the ideas, but it doesn't quite grab me for what I want for WW2 game-play.

This games gives a great feel for the small unit commabder at Co level.

One of my favourite WW2 miniatures rules, they put you in the role of a Company commander and the interrupted card driven turn sequence mechanic produces "friction" nicely.  The Kriegspiel approach suits my gaming style too.

A great set of WW2 miniatures rules from the Two Fat Lardies.  Card activation means this works better with two players.

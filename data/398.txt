What a lovely little gem of simplicity and grace!  It is one of Knizia's most elegant games - I think he does this simple stuff as well (or better) as his complex stuff - witness Circus Flohcati and High Society.  There's so much going on here in terms of what you can do - well at least for such a quick game!  And yet it's very easy to explain and children from about 6 could play it with some degree of reasonable performance. It's also really cheap and you could make your own set easily enough.

RATING: 5
Simple game of collecting colours/animals with the highest values but they are dictated by other players who will lower your values given the chance and the game may end if you leave manipulating until the end.

RATING: 8
What an interesting game!  It feels stock market-esque, complete with speculation based on imperfect information, but it further develops along group think lines to provide a larger experience.  It's not just about speculating correctly in view of your cards, but also taking into account the speculations of other players.  I really liked how the board developed, the perceived values changing and refining over time.

I will gladly play this one again.

Botswana version.
Use the variant where you cannot take the same animal as the card you just played.
As a children's game, it's one of the best out there, and can encourage kids to develop strategic thought. Rating for kids: 8.

RATING: 7
A simple game.  The thing I LOVE about this game is that almost ANY age level can play.  Even if they have almost no understanding of the rules or scoring.  At its most basic level the game is simply this: 

1) play one of your cards

2) pick up a toy animal

...and that's it!

We've had games where the players' ages were: 2, 4, 6, 35, and 60.  Sure the 2-year-old's decisions were random and chaotic, but she could actually play the game and participate.  In this way, the kids can develop their strategies organically over time as they watch and learn, as opposed to other games where you have to spoon-feed your kids some of the basic tactical tricks in order for them to not fall flat on their faces.

Such a simple and elegant set of rules, almost feels like a modern "micro-game" sometimes... As of writing this, and rating it an 8.25, I've only played it with three. I think I might bump it to an 8.5 once I get to play it with 4, because although it might make the game less predictable is some ways, one fewer card per suit is removed. It reminds me of a condensed Titan Arena, with speculation taking place only across a single hand. We played 3 games with a running tally and this created an interesting scoring dynamic similar to playing Gin Rummy for free-sies or even love letter... it was obvious that our group was playing for the series score, but there is a little consolation winning a single round... great game. I hope to get to pick this for our group to play more often with 3 or 4 and slim time.

I've been curious about this game for a long time. I almost bought it years ago in the Loco version, but I'm glad I waited for the Botswana version because you get to play with fun plastic animals. Sadly, I'm just not sure this is a very good game. At times I felt like I had zero control over the outcome, and other times I felt like no one could stop my brilliant plans. I'm sure the truth is about halfway between those 2 points, but initially it seems a little difficult to comprehend the strategy. That could be considered a compliment because people sometimes crave strategic depth without complex rules. In fact I love how short the rules sheet is for this game, it allows me to teach the game in seconds, even reading the rules at the table. I just wish there was a little more to the game. It doesn't seem to have that "wow" factor that other quick games like this possess. I was also a little disappointed with the cheap quality of the animals. I'd play Botswana again if someone asked, but I've traded away my copy.

The card version is clean, quick, and clever. Not a bad filler at all...hoping the Quandary version I scored will push it up via overproduction.

------

Yep - it's as others have said: playing with those tiles on the board *does* push it up a notch. I'm feeling kind of shallow while I say it, but I feel it's true - this is a 6 with the cards, and a 7.5 with the Quandary version. Here's to tactile pleasures!

A good, short game. The most boiled down stocks game I know of. Yes it is just cards and a few tokens, but buying stocks is what you do, even if it isn't themed like that. We prefer No Thanks in the group, but this one hits the table too at times, if nothing else for some variation.

Loco! is really a very simple game ... but intensely devious nonetheless! RK truly does know how to design a brain-meltingly evil bluffing game now and then.

A bit over-engineered for what is an abstract 'stock taking' game. It's cute enough, but I think the simple FFG edition with poker chips and plain cards is easier to play with.

Owned it as Quandary, sold that version. Bought it as Loco. Played as Botswana, and I prefer Loco because it is much more portable. Own again as Quandary.

Excellent game: players play cards to the table to influence the point value of each of five colors, then take a share in any color. When on color has all cards played to it (from zero to five) the round ends. Each color is worth the last card played to it, and players score for each share in front of them.

Do you choose to better your own position or shaft an opponent by devaluing his four green shares? Can you do both at once? If you do one will he stab you right back? What about player three?

Dry and tactical as can be but totally fun.

Light, easy to learn card game.  We played it fairly straight (most piles ending in 5s), but it's clear what you want to do is save some low cards to sabotage other players before game end.  I suspect a 2nd playing would be a better game.  Still, it's so simple an short that it's hard to say much about this game.

Mar 2011 Rating Modification:  I can't help but feel that this game would be better if it was a little longer as it would provide more tense competition and opportunities for surprise screwage.   Perhaps instead of cards 1-5 going 1-8 or something would have been better.  Still, it's a fun little game.   Much prefer the Botswana version, as the animals are a nice touch and Loco is themeless.   Rating up to 7 from 6.  Added to "want in trade", but it's low priority and wouldn't purchase it outright.

RATING: 6
An incredibly simple stock/investment game with some mildly interesting, though predictable choices. I actually think the game could use a little more chaos. I wonder how the game would change if you had to draw cards each turn rather than have the whole deck dealt out to you at the beginning...

A clever game with angst ridden decisions.  I don't usually consider myself prone to liking a game because of the bits, but Quandary is sooooo much nicer than Flinke Pinke even though there are no rules differences between the two.

The fastest filler around.  We play multiple rounds so that everyone gets a chance to go first once.  Even then, it's very speedy.  Don't burn your brain since long term strategy can go out the window in no time.  Fun.

RATING: 5
Extremely quick game, with very simple rules. I liked it as harmless filler, but I think the game has some serious pacing problems. The beginning of the game seems a bit random, as you start off by just burning the cards you don't want to end up scoring. The very end can get tense, though -- as with the end of Lost Cities, you'll have plenty of places where you MUST play a card, but you're constantly afraid that your opponent will end the game with a single card placement.

RATING: 8.5
Almost nothing to it but this is a great wee game which demonstarates the joys of minimalism.  Mysteriously, Flinke Pinke somehow feels a lot lighter than Thor, even without using the extra cards and rules from the latter.  So good I bought it again as 'Loco' and now need to replace that due to excessive play (if only the production quality was up to FFG's usual standards!). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Very similar to the Flinke Pinke edition but an awful cheapo production.  A flimsy box that barely stands up to repeated use and a container for the counters that doesn't hold them all!  Fantasy Flight should be ashamed of themselves, even a hint of their usual high standards would solve the problems and the game is so good it deserves much better.

Also known as Quandry. A decent middle-tier Knizia, but didn't do a lot for me. Like many of the Knizia games that I am less enthused about, seems to offer only an illusion of control that is pretty annoying once pierced. Not bad as these things go, but not very much repeat value.

Really short and fun little filler.  Probably the easiest rules to a decent game ever!  On your turn, simply play a card which influences the value of the animals, and grab an animal.  There's really no rules other than that.  Play until one animal has all of its cards played, and score your animals according to the current values!

The over-the-top animal figures also help.

Play a card, take a chip... this game may just have the easiest rules of any game in existence. Nice quick fun with a little bit of screwing your opponents and tactical play. The Loco! edition is fine, but why didn't it come with a better box? As it is, you get an extra chip just floating around there. Oh and the "you must say Loco! whenever you play a zero" rule is stupid.

Good game that has lots of screw your neighbor potential. The fact that it is fun and takes about 20 minutes to play makes this a great game to carry around for game nights. After more plays, I have come to like this game even more for its stock manipulation aspect. The short play time belies the strategy behind the plays you can make to time the correct end value for the colors. There is more game here than I originally thought, but it is still a filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great light game with animals. But there is a bit of strategy in order to decide how to end the round locking the desirable values to each of the animals we've been collecting each round.

A bit abstract which could make some players confused about the rules in relation to the theme.

RATING: 8
The best introduction to stock game.  There are a few strategies that one can employ to manipulate market prices, but I worry about the long-term viability of the game.  How different will my strategy be each game?

That being said, the game is ridiculously approachable.  There is just the right of uncertainty because of card removal, to keep tension in the game late in the rounds.  It's also a plus that all the cards are distributed at the start of the game, so that "luck-of-the-draw" issues are minimized.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There are some similarities to Members Only, but I think Flinke Pinke is the better game. They both involve the gradual reveal of hidden information.

I love the way you must choose which color to take. There are few turns, so the opportunity to bluff is limited, but present. 

But what really makes the game work is the scarcity of coins vs the variable game ending. You have to time when to play that high value card for your coins, or that low value card for someone else's color. Add in a little hidden information that no one knows (the unused cards) and it just clicks together perfectly. This is a great example of an amazing game design from Knizia with a minimum of moving parts.

Fun, quick filler that scales well from 2-4.  I have the Quandary version with the over-the-top quality tiles.  Each number tile you place changes the value for that color.  Try to get the most of the highest value tiles by the end of the round.

Components: Loco version is functional, and I like the plastic tokens, but it could certainly be prettier. I waiver quite a bit on this one, from thinking it is beautifully simple for what it is, to thinking it is dismally simple for what it could be. The Thor version is attractive, but the god cards don't work as well as Loco's chips, and the theme/artwork don't add any enjoyment to my play.

Experience: Delightfully agonizing hand-managment decisions. This game is as simple as its box declares, but I find it to be interesting and tense.

(Quandary) Superb filler game with lovely clunky pieces.  Players are dealt a hand of tiles that depict a colour and a number.  Tiles are played in their column and the leading value at the head of the column is the current share &quot;price&quot;.  After placing a tile, claim a share in any colour.  A round ends when any one column is filled, and shares claimed are scored at current value.  Great fun.

RATING: 6
(As of [b]2[/b] plays) This game presents an interesting conundrum. On the one hand, it is extremely easy to learn and teach to non-gamers. On the other hand, the gameplay itself is potentially AP-inducing and, in my experience, unfolds mostly in thoughtful silence. So, while it is the right weight and length for a fun filler, it is almost too [i]thoughtful[/i] for that purpose. Very interesting decisions involved, though.

Botswana- fun game, great bits, but the game is nearly broken, particularly for the 2 player game (the scoring leader just mimics the animal choices of opponent).

Can't argue with the production quality - the animals are gorgeous. Simple enough to play with my 6 and 8 yr old, but enough depth to keep adults interested too. Great game.

A very quick Knizia filler game, very quick to teach and play.

Own both the cheap "Loco" version (Fantasy Flight), and the rethemed "Botswana" edition - rethemed with animal miniatures, great eye-candy for kids & adults!

Gryphon Bookshelf series game.  The animal bits look great (too bad they don't stand up better).  Good game to introduce new gamers to, or play with your non-gamer family.  It plays pretty quickly (15-20 min tops per round). The end game mechanic where any one of the stacks is complete ends the game really can surprise players and I feel like this seems to hook people I've introduced this to with an instant want to get multiple plays in.  That way they can try hedging their bets in different ways and try to sneak in that last card on a stack early to mess with their opponents.

Played 10+ times. I rated the "Thor" version a "5" because of ridiculous theme and overpriced. I didn't have any expectations coming into playing this game. It feels like one of Knizia's old card games: one mechanism, dry and abstract, like it or loathe it type game. Never having been a big fan of numbered, abstract card games, I don't care for this one either. Feels a bit like Caesar & Cleopatra for some reason, but no special actions in the game. // Played the "Loco" version and liked it quite a bit better, mostly because now it looked like the type of game it is: simple fun. Loco is colorful, inexpensive, and easy to teach to non-gamers. Up from a 4 because this verion is a good one for non-gamers. (F; traded for Saboteur)

Probably the easiest game on earth to learn (yes, it's as easy as Candyland), but there are a lot of tough choices to make.

Needs more "there", super light and fluffy.  The new Gryphon Games edition has fantastic bits though, kids love it for that reason.  Though I'm not sure they can play the stock/evaluation/drafting game well enough, so this truly sits in a very weird place.

I enjoy it as an uberfiller, but it does wash over you quite a bit.

(my version is called Loco! Very cheap and tiny version of the same game).  For what this game is, you really can't go wrong.  It is ultra quick, ultra simple, and very cheap.  It is also much less mindless than most card games with so few rules.  Buy it!

RATING: 7
Botswana is known as a light game but with tough decisions. And boy was it! I think it runs a little long with 4 rounds, so I might limit it to 3 (regardless of number of players). I can understand that there are that many rounds because of the luck of the card draw, but I don't think one less round is a biggie.  But yes, given the nature of the game the scores each round are rarely close, which might suggest that luck has to be evened out over multiple plays.  Anyway- cute game with grabbing the plastic animals a nice aesthetic appeal. A good dose of push-your-luck which I always like. A little subtle bluffing is also involved, so overall a nicely rounded filler.

I remember when I first read the rules to Flinke Pinke, I thought, "Is that it? Man, that sounds really stupid and pointless." Well, I was wrong. There's all kinds of interesting stuff happening within this almost trivially simple package.  The reissues (Quandary and Thor) are both far superior to the original (Flinke Pinke).  Quandary is extravagantly produced, with wonderful chunky tiles that "clack" when you stack them.  Thor is a beautifully illustrated and more compact version that uses cards, like the original.  There are minor rules differences among the three versions.

Ah, the clack-tastic feel of over-produced bakelite tiles!

Quandary is a very simple game and a great filler. The rules are easily explained and each round takes about five minutes. Yet in that simplicity, there are some difficult decisions to make. A little bit of read your opponents, a little bit of push your luck. Perfect for the time it takes.

Loco and Botswana use the exact same rules, so my comments apply equally to them.

This one is pretty fun but with more players I think the scoring system needs to be modified.  It becomes too large a difference if you have one less animal.

With more players it also essentially dictates that you go for a boom or bust strategy.  What is fun about this game is the banter and laughter that comes along with the play.

Revision: with more plays and scoring over multiple rounds, more than just 1 per player this becomes a real fun card game.

[Initial Impression: 4]
In Loco!, I saw the potential for multi-layered strategy stemming from a reduced form, in the style of incomplete information games.  Is my hand strong enough to go it alone or do I ally myself with other players by choosing similar tokens? Can I forsee, by their actions, which tokens other players will champion? Can I bluff them by taking a token or playing a card on a color I know I can devalue? Unfortunately, the incredibly simple rules (play a card, pick a token) are accompanied by relatively simplistic strategy, which seems to reduce to holding your 0's and 5's until the endgame and hoping another player doesn't end the game before you can play them.  Removing some cards at the beginning increases the uncertainty, but there already seems to be plenty.  There might be an interesting variation buried in here, but as it is, there just isn't enough to hold my attention, even for the short playing time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.25
Mostly unplayed Knizia filler card game, FFG edition, off of Flinke Plinke.

Game play involves inter-player strategy and guess-work to obtain the most valuable chip set based on the last point card played for each color.

It's OK, and it's very transportable, but the components do little for me.

RATING: 7
The Romans had a saying, 'Clothes make the man.'

Components make a difference. This edition is lauded for the over-production that went into it, and now it's clear why.

The tiles feel awesome; they're simply more fun to play with.

The Game play is essentially the same as Loco, except there's no need to announce a '0' play. It involves inter-player strategy and guess-work to obtain the most valuable tile set based on the last point tile played for each color.

Nice edition, nicer game.  Well worth it.

Such a simple game, but the choice of what to play and take each turn is so hard. Lots of gamers I know think this is super-light, but I know a few folks who win far more than their share at this game.

I only want Thor and/or Quandary in trade

For Loco version.  Ok game.  The stupid "Loco!" rule is straight out of Uno, which is to say it is childish.  Apparently, other versions of this are better...

Edit 5/9/7 - yep, Thor is better than Loco.

I've owned Loco for a while, but never played it.  Tonight I got the chance to try Quandry.  The weight of the components may have added to the pleasure, but I like a good group think game.  This is a bit like Trendy - heavy.

Great little Knizia filler in the "No Thanks" mold. Play a card, take any colored chip. At the end players score as many points per chip as the top-most card played of that color!  You thereby "gamble" which color will count more in end. Gets very tense toward the end when everyone's jockeying to play their 5s and 0s.  Scales well 2-4.  2p feels like Pico 2 with a gambling twist. (Can be played DIY.)

RATING: 6
This is the kind of game that is difficult for me to rate. The decision space is distilled to such an extent it actually gets you thinking about game design as you play and I'm sure this has been an inspirational game for many.

There are a few different editions, but the basic premise is that you have a deck of 30 cards with 5 suits valued 0-5. You also have 5 sets of "chips" that represent each suit. Cards are dealt and on your turn you play a card the top of one of the five suits and take a "chip" of any suit. When all six cards of one suit have been played, the "chips" you've collected score points according to the value of the last card played in each suit. The "chips" in the latest edition are plastic animals, but in other editions they are tiles or other cards. 

The strength of the game is its simplicity, but that is also its problem. The anticipation of what will score and your ability to influence that score by the playing of a card is all there is to the game and it doesn't provide much of a varied experience. It's cool, but gets old pretty quick. I don't really like any of the editions that exist. What I want is a game with Quandry-like components and a Botswana-like box. If that ever comes into existence, then I might pick this up.

A palate cleanser of a game. Light, cute and plays darn fast. That's about all I can say. It's not the type of game that's going to satisfy; the instructions suggest you to play three rounds and total the score - but that seems like an unnecessary way to extend the playing time. All you have to do is dump the animals out of the box and deal the cards - there's no setup - that's the beauty of it. Play the game in 5-10 minutes, if it feels good enough, do it again. Otherwise wrap it up and move on to the next game.

It's all about who is able and willing to end the game. Tension increases towards the end since the options in your hand become increasingly urgent and conflicting - you want to fix your scores and then end the game, but can't rely on being able to do both in one move. The downside is that if one or more players aren't paying attention the outcome can easily be decided by chaos. (One player suggested there should be floating numbers over each player's head showing their current score.) I would highly recommend playing 2-3 games with cumulative scores and the rule from Flinke Pinke that gives 2 points to each player with one fewer token.

I'm recording identical ratings and comments for Thor and Flinke Pinke/Quandary/Loco!/Botswana. Played with Rage cards and sets of glass gems.

Botswana version.

This may not be the greatest game ever but it is pretty fun.  So why such a high rating?  The  rating is based on the ability to involve younger players and help them learn planning and strategic thinking. Even some bluffing and second guessing. It is so short you can play 10 minutes before bedtime.  I enjoyed it and see it getting played all the time...I would never turn down a game and would offer it and would always get takers.  The components are great, and help make it an ideal family game.

I have the Milton Bradley "Quandary" version, in all its overproduced glory. Still, this game would be fun even with just the cards. It's the type of game I love -- easy to play and learn, and seems very obvious and simple on the surface, but a couple of turns in you are faced with some agonizing decisions. There's so much going on here and every time I play it I find myself in a new situation to think about. I have yet to bring this out and not have all the players really enjoy it.

PLEASE NOTE Comment based on playing the original Flinke Pinke version.  I cannot comment on the details of the Botswana version.

Enjoyable game with Kinizia's ability to distill genres to its purest essence but enhancing their power, in this case the stock market genre, while introducing real decision making into what appears a simple looking game and teasing you by never allowing you enough actions to do what you really want.  

I would be interested to see how games end with experienced players but its several versions (Botswana being the latest) suggests that the game has some longevity.

The rules are unbelievably simple, but the game is very, very smart. The random element plays virtually no role at all. I've been able to make something of ANY hand I've been dealt. Knizia's lighter and smaller games are often overlooked though they are brilliant in their own right.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very fun, minimalist (even for Knizia) stock game. The gist of it is that you are dealt a hand of cards which have a face value and a colour (suit/stock). On your turn, you play one of the cards in your hand, which sets the current value of the stock for that card's colour, and you then take one share of your choice (although there is a limited supply). The game ends when every card of one colour has been played, and the chips are worth points equal to the value of the last card of its colour played in the game.

It doesn't sound like much, but this simple system generates a lot of tension. You end up tracking which values have been played of each colour, and which shares the other players are taking, and you try to read the market from that (and what cards you have left). This task lies right on the cusp of possibility for a gamer, which is why it is so delicious.

Play becomes more chaotic with more players and, like so many games, I suspect the sweet spot is four players.

It's worth noting that this game has been published under a huge number of names, even if you just count English editions, although some versions also include special power cards. It is also possible to play this with a stripped down Sticheln or Rage deck, plus some appropriate poker chips.

Not going to take your breath away, but a great object lesson in minimalist game design from the master, and it plays quickly enough that I think every gamer should give it a couple of tries somewhere along the line. Not one of my favourite fillers, but one that I want to play more.

A game with identical rules to Quandary but with cute plastic animals.  You play a card numbered 1 to 5.  And then select an animal.  Once all of one animal number has been played, the round ends.  You then score based on what animals you have acquired and what the last number is for that animal.  

A very simple "stock" game that is accessible to any person.  

Not a great game, but not bad either.  A good filler game on a  board game night.

2016 update: Dafuq. This confused the heck outta me until I clicked it and saw it was a retheme of Loco.

Gave it to Angie for her b-day. We played 8 hands the same evening. Incredibly simple to learn, and little bits of strategy continue to reveal themselves with each play. A small bluffing element is coming into play. For such a simple game, it has quite agonizing decisions.

We've only played it a few times, but it seems pretty simple. We seem to almost always split the markers 2-3. There is little chance at the end of the game to play cards that change the outcome, since the last cards (0 or 5) are usually held until there are enough cards on the table to end the game when one is played. Perhaps we will discover more depth when we play it more, but for now it doesn't seem like there is much room for strategy.

Pound for pound, Loco! is the most efficient engine for generating turn angst I've ever seen. It plays in less than 10 minutes and literally has one rule (play a card, take a chip) plus a scoring explanation, and yet nearly every turn you take involves a painful decision.

Do I hold back this high yellow for one more turn, or play it now and risk having it zeroed out just before the game ends? Do I broadcast my hand by taking a second red chip, or take a less profitable color and hedge my bets? Do I gamble that the last blue card -- a zero -- is in the kitty, and take another blue chip? Ahhhh, bliss.

Loco's turn angst:time and fun:time ratios are among the best I've ever seen -- this is an amazingly tight (and surprisingly tough) game, and it's damned near perfect filler. The landscape of the game also changes dramatically every few turns, which is impressive for a game that takes 5-10 minutes tops.

The box, however, sucks. I replaced it with a plastic CCG deck case immediately, and that works much better. It's without a doubt the worst box I've ever seen for a game.

While this gets a 5 from me, it should be noted it is a VERY good 5.  the relatively low rating is purely due to the game being sooo simple and to the point.

However, LOCO! is nevertheless a great filler/intro/family game, and there is a certain degree of strategy/tactics behind its simple mechanic.

LOCO! is true ten minute filler in the best possible way.  Toss it out between games.


>>update<<
bumped up from a 5 to a 6 just because you can say "fuck it", toss it on the table, turn up the bullshitting factor, and have 5-10 minutes of solid game fun.

How many different versions of this game are there? I owned [i]Quandary,[/i] which featured nice clickity-clack playing pieces, a garish board, and an oddly shaped box. The game itself, while brief, is a bit of a brain-burner, and ultimately somewhat less than fun. [5 plays; gave away]

Nice, light game, very fast, good as a filler or a warmup.  It can be taught and played in about fifteen minutes, tops.  I'd hardly ever turn a game down just because it's so fast, but it wouldn't always be something I'd suggest - just depends on my mood.  Ought to be in your collection just because it fills that "fast and friendly" niche so well.  (By the way, this game is actually Loco, the version I have.)

Fun little filler, plays best with three, but also okay with four.  Not so good for two.

I was really taken with this one at first, but now that I have some other three-player filler choices, it's slipped a bit for me.  Still a good game, though, and the Fantasy Flight version is easily worth its $5.00 price tag.

It's a little odd that most of the cost that went into this game is with the little plastic animals. The toy factor is nice, but I think the game is good regardless.

This is another classic Knizia game in my book.

Loco! 
Well this is another one of those very simple, filler style card games where the ruleset is dead simple yet there is just enough strategy and tactics in the game to make the gameplay interesting. the game is very easy to teach.. the claim on the box is 30 seconds to learn... and that isn't far off. Within minutes you'll have the main gist of this game down pat. Place a card... take a chip. As simple as that. The value of each color goes up or down depending on the cards placed in each color so much like a mini stock market your fortunes rise and fall with every card that each player places. The game isn't complex but there is scope to be evil as their are "0" cards in every color which effectively make that color worth nothing in the final count. Good when you play this on others... not so good when it's done to you. :) 

Keeping with the stock market theme in this game you need to determine whether you want to put all your eggs in one or two baskets and go for 1 or 2 profitable colors as you try to raise their values... or take a more diversified approach and spread your color choices around.

In summary... it's a solid little filler card game... and certainly is over very quickly so as not to extend it's simple premise beyond the point of being interesting. Maybe not the greatest card game out there but it occupies a slot in a collection as a good filler for a 10-15 minute slot of time where you'll be able to play 2 or 3 games.

Light game from Knizia: There are 5 suits numbered from 0 to 5. Players play to one of the 5 columns, where there are 5 colored cubes. After playing a card, a player draws a cube. Scoring when any one suit has all been played, colored cubes are worth the last value of the card showing. Fun, play this over several rounds, reminded me vaguely of Titan the Arena.

Vicious, thinky interplay with two; a tactical push-and-shove with three; and a harmless, fun diversion with four or five. There's plenty of reach in Botswana, even if there's really only one strategy, but it's a game that's far from obvious given the ridiculously-simple rules set. Component quality is out of the world for a little game - smart artwork on the cards, and of course the plastic animals.

[b]Wildlife Safari[/b]

[i]- Awesome family filler game that my kids really enjoyed. 
- Everyone in my gaming group also enjoyed it when they played.
- Great bits (namely the plastic animals) that my kids loved.
- Another Knizia with a great scoring system; trying to time when to play your high value cards before the game ends while not giving someone else the opportunity to play a low number.
- In essence this is a stock market manipulation game. You can take any animal you want, no matter what animal card you played which allows you to hedge your bets.

I immediately added this to my wishlist and then found out they are changing the name which in my opinion is awful (from Botswana to Wildlife Safari). I hope I can find a copy of Botswana for a reasonable price.[/i]

RATING: 8
At the top of my list of filler games.  It has more depth and decision making than most filler games that I have played.  It also requires you to read what your opponents are doing.  I have the Loco! version, I have never played the Botswana incarnation, but I guess BGG doesn't distinguish them.  It is a great game to have in your collection, because it is fast, portable, and will be likely to hit the table often.  It is also incredibly easy to teach, but difficult to master.

Update (02/04/17):

Had two 2-player games and two 3-player games. While the 2-player games are fun with more control of the outcome, the 3-player games really shone with the tension down to the last cards. Love the simple rules, tense gameplay and how each action by each person gives info a bit at a time.

Great fun in a short time. Hallmark of an excellent filler/gateway game.

Awesome 2-player card game with plastic animals. This game is improved with the new Gryphon edition. We own Thor which is very similar, maybe even the same without the use of the special cards. But, the plastic animals make this a whole lot more interesting and fun to play. I find it great fun to play with 2 or 3 players...still have not tried it with more players yet. Easy to play, but difficult to win!

A solid filler game. I think I've figured out a strategy for this, but you still have to cross your fingers that the game won't end before you're ready.

Not my cup of tea (I don't like Knizia, generally).

Fun little filler, but maybe not as enjoyable as the others I'd consider comparable (No Thanks, 6 Nimmt etc). Simple enough to teach and play, portable - I can see this being taken overseas with me (and the language independance is a plus).
One thing and I know it shouldn't bother me but it does - but who thought to create an inner box that doesn't hold all the chips?

This one has been hit and miss with the various groups I have played with. When it hits, I really enjoy it. It is a quick, stock-market game with a lot of typically Knizia tough decisions in it.

I will always think of this as Quandary, which I was very lucky to thrift for $2. But the Botswana version, sleeved up is better. Way more portable (box only 1/3 the size as Quandary), cooler animal figures and it plays up to 5 (vs 4 in Quandary).

A very quick game to play. It wouldn't be a game I'd like to play too often, but is OK now and then. I picked up the Loco version for about £2, so you can't go wrong at that price. Botswana seems overpriced for what the game is, but if you can sell it at that price that's good marketing.

Quandary is truly clever; I enjoy the timing aspect and figuring how to screw your opponents.  Great components!  I could see this becoming a little dry after too many plays, but as long as it gets played only a few times in a sitting once a month, I expect it will hold up.  This would be a good game to inroduce new gamers to...  Not too complex, but has enough factors to think about taht I think most anybody would enjoy it.

I never really thought of it this way until Geekbuddy Nate Straight pointed it out, but this is the closest I've seen to an abstract shareholding game. The rules are very simple and the game is quick to play. People tend to grasp the way that the game is influenced, so the goals and tools are clear. 

Not the deepest game out there by any means, but it's a good time and it's simple. Some good bluffing as well as you make it seem like you're interested in leopards before ultimately shorting them with your 1 card. And yeah, that decision might be obvious, but no more obvious than letting a card go around the table again in No Thanks, and that game remains plenty fun.

I'll have to try this one again, but it was very disappointing.  The game wasn't fast enough to feel loco, but the options were fairly limited and most of the meaningful choices were only apparent after there are too few chips or cards remaining to properly influence things.  A few more cards and chips would greatly add to the depth of experience this game offered.  Alas, there's just not enough here.

RATING: 6
I have only played this once (our version is called Botswana, in the Gryphon games bookshelf series), in October 2013. I was actually pleasantly surprised what a nice little game this was - better than most of the others in the series. Typical of Knizia's light card games, really - very simple rules but ones which keep you thinking the whole way through. And definitely elements of bluff here too. Definitely no more than a filler, and not a game I think I'd ever request to play (and there are plenty of other good or better fillers too), but this is one I'd definitely be happy to play every once in a while.

Feel as though I don't have enough information to predict a color's value until the last four or five card plays.

I have Loco.  I enjoy it, but my group doesn't.  Isn't that always the way.  OK, not always, I'm just being pessimistic.  Sometimes it's the way, though!  Yes, sometimes.  And there are enough of those "sometimes" times that sometimes it seems like always.  Sigh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's worth getting this game just to experience how much game Knizia can get out of like, two rules, cards labelled 1-5, and some chips. He's like the McGuyver of game designers. He could make a heavy game out of a chocolate bar and a piece of fuzz.

Very light and fast card game. Choices become painful as your hand shrinks.
With two players  you have more control over the chip values and more information about your opponents hand (since you hold roughly half the deck). With 4 and 5 players the game is very chaotic since you have fewer cards, less information about your opponents' hands, and fewer opportunities to act.
Three players seems to be the sweet spot.

Not a bad way to kill 5-10 minutes while trying to decide what else to play for the night!

This a light and fairly straightforward filler by Knizia.  I was happy to see it come back into print several years ago when I picked up my copy.  We have played several times over the years, generally as a filler.

As time has gone by, though, my preference for it has waned somewhat.  We had one player play randomly (e.g. roll a die for every decision) and very nearly win on one occasion.  I already had some concerns about how limited your control was.  Not to mention that many decisions that have to be made, particularly early, are completely opaque.  Still, it ends quickly (or should) and is fun for what it is.  [01/08/2011]

Played EGGs Botswana with my wife and daughter recently. Great family game, we enjoy the simplicity and especially appreciate the superb components (high quality animal figures and heavy weight, beautiful cards). The production value is about as good as it gets for a stripped down filler. It's been around for decades and in many different versions, some without the safari theme. I don't think there's ever been an expansion, but it would be nice to have a few more cards types (maybe hippos and giraffes) and some interaction cards, perhaps crocodiles or cobras ???? that let you modify your end score or your opponents score. Nothing too complicated, just a few more decisions would be nice.

We love the card art and especially the superb quality and detail of the animal figures. The game is easy to teach and quite fun to try to claim the most valuable species while preventing your opponents from doing the same. Ours is kind of a hybrid version, the box is labeled Botswana, but the card deck is labeled Wildlife Safari.

RATING: 7
Played with 3P and 4P. An interesting game of speculation which relies on minimal components and rules. (I played a DIY version using Circus Flohcati and some cubes.) Gameplay is as simple as playing card from hand and taking a coloured cube, but there are a few subtleties which have to be accounted for. 

Playing cards influences the value of each colour at the end of the game, but it is only the last card played which matters. Players have to work with the cards in hand to either increase the value of colours that they are collecting, or sabotage the value of other colours. At the same time, players have to pay attention to the cubes their opponents are taking as they signal which colour will likely have the best value during the endgame.

This game is more entertaining than its simplicity and abstractness suggests. I prefer this with 3P as it offers more control over the fluctuating values though.

1994-es játék, mégis parádés. Tiszta Pingu Party érzés fogott el a játék során. Fél perc a játékmagyarázat. Kb. 10-20 perc maga a teljes játék. Bármikor elővehető, bárkivel játszható. A játékosok hatféle állatot gyűjtenek úgy, hogy kártyákat helyeznek le hozzájuk 0-tól 5-ös értékig. Minden kártya lehelyezésével egy állat vehető el. Ha valamelyik állathoz a hatodik kártya is lekerül, akkor vége egy fordulónak. Az állatoknál levő lapok aktuális értékével szorzódik a megszerzett állatok száma, majd összeadódik, ennyi pontot gyűjt a játékos. Ahány játékos annyi forduló, a legtöbb pontszámot szerző a győztes. A gyönyörű állatos kiadás pedig akár gyerekjátéknak is tökéletes. A kártyák minősége fantasztikus. Le a kalappal!

[2015-01-03]
Jópár játékkal a hátam mögött azért bőven volt átértékelni való. A játék valóban gyönyörű a Bostwana kiadásban, de ez egy teljesen szerencsejáték 5-en. Mindenképpen jobb 4-en játszani. A For Sale-nél sokkal, a High Societynél is gyengébb, ezért muszáj lepontoznom. Ettől függetlenül az egyszerűsége és szépsége miatt bármikor jöhet.

For me, Reiner shines in his simpler games.  He understands how to boil down concept games into their simplest forms.  Quo Vadis? is a brilliant boiled down negotiation game, Medici a perfect elegant auction game, and  Flinke Pinke the purest stock game made.   When playing games like this it makes me marvel at how great the game is without the superfluous nonsense often attached to games.  This game is designed in the spirit of Occam's Razor.

Quandary is completely overblown for what a light simple game this is and Loco is cheap and looks like a bad Uno clone (which I'm sure was the intention).

I have the Thor version, which adds a bunch of cards I don't use, but it does add a new color to expand the game for larger groups.  I find it to be quite pretty.  Totally pasted on theme, but pretty.

Another Knizia filler. It's actually pretty elegant and not a bad filler in that it plays quickly and the decisions aren't all that bad.

Perfect in its own way.  Short rules, simple components, plays quickly, and has a nice balance between luck and strategy.  Lots of decision-making under (a variety of kinds of) uncertainty including the neat twist that you don't know whether a particular card hasn't come out yet because it's not in the deck this time.  

Plays well with 3.  Not recommended for 2.  Good for ages 7 and up.

RATING: 6
Somewhat interesting, standard-ish Knizia game of placing numbered cards in various places claiming tokens. But it's just not very compelling or tense -- would MUCH rather play 2er BattleLine, for example.

--- Summary ---
Cards: 0-5 x 6 colors/animals. Tokens: 6 per color/animal, in central area.

Deal out all cards to players. On your turn, play a card in front to the matching color, in a stack where you can see all numbers played. Then, take _any_ available token. The hand ends when all tokens of one color are claimed (i.e., that color has 6 cards in front of it). Each token is worth as many VP as the last (topmost) card. All players record VP.

Play one hand/player; player with highest sum of VP wins!

I have played Quandary and Thor... so naturally this game is listed under "Loco."  The wonderful quality of the bits actually raises Quandary from a 7 to an 8.  The game is easy to explain and difficult to play well.  I've never tried the "special power" cards in Thor, but I've played it with six players (Quandary only takes four) and it still works all right.  One of Knizia's simple ideas that make a demanding game.

This is a fun little game that plays quickly but makes you think a bit.  I really like how quickly things can change with the play of one card.

Really it has a good nitche place just based on how easy it is and how fast it plays.  I would not mind playing it again. Even after one play though I can't imagine it having "great" replay value nor is it at all the type of gaming that really leaves me wanting more.

RATING: 6.5
[FFG 'Loco! ' Scandinavian (2003) Edition] {Filler; commodity speculation; optimal 3-4p} Loco! is a typical Knizia's scoring game, which involves heavy calculation and deduction. Loco! is a remake of Thor but it's simpler and more streamlined, though less dynamic. It's one of the best fillers and backpack game that I have - a tight game with decisions, planning and player interactions within 15 minutes. 

Don't be misled by its size and price, it's deeper than one could have expected from its pedestrian appearance and short rules. It is my most favorite game in my collection within USD5. Luck is not strong in Loco! It's about playing cards at the right time. Besides, it's important to deduce what are the dropped-off cards because they greatly affect how one should play the cards.

Loco! isn't highly fun - it's quite static and dry for some players but it's an excellent opener. 

[Thor] The graphic of Thor is clearly better than Loco! (well, many things can be better than a set of number cards). However, the graphic is not my taste and the theme is still tenuous. I am still very happy with Loco! Although Thor provides fresh way of playing, I may not consider it in near future.

[Variant] The Knizia's (?!) variant makes the game more tense and interesting: a player must take a chip with different color from the card he played.

This one reminds me quite abit of Lost Cities: the turns have the same procedure (you must first play one card then take one card) and you never seem to have the right cards in your hand (Knizia seems to be good at making games like this). Thor is also very simple, quick and offers some painful decisionmaking. Oh, and the action cards are a nice addition.

Got the Botswana version; the animals really look nice, and seem to wear well. They are not the usual soft toy plastic, but hard plastic that maintains its shape; as such the pieces don't need the usual oval bases to stand up, though they are more than a little top heavy, of course.

The game is exactly Loco, with animals for chips. I prefer the chips: the animals give it the feel of a child's game, which it is not.


Old comments for Loco version:

Would like to see an expanded version. Thinking of getting chips to use with Circus Flohcati cards.

Would consider any of the similar Knizia games, but all seem to be out of print and hard to find. Eventually this nice game will be republished in some form. It's much like the Knights of Charlemagne, Loco, Great Wall of China set of similar games.

It's fun to play a few rounds of this with people new to the game and watch how they go from thinking it is silly and simple to really trying to plan and scheme. 

It *is* simple, which is what makes the scheming all the more fun.

Nifty little filler.  Has that, "ooh lets play one more time" quality.  Good game for non gamers.  I'm a sucker for card games though.  Nice depth for a short rule set.  Its just very forgettable.  Not enough depth to make anyone remember it.

This could be a good family game or all-out competitive gamer game depending on the crowd.  The sudden game stop is evil, making getting near the end of any track dangerous.  You'll never know if you get to play that zero or five last or not.  Relying on a single stock can be all or nothing.  Lots of fun here.

DIY. Wow, not good. Majority of moves aren't going to matter in the end.

...I think others like this more than I did due to the potential to try to guess what other players are hoping to do.

...So, I revisited Botswana trying to understand and appreciate it in the context of it being a commodity speculation or stock game. What players/investors can do to affect stock value is based on their initial random draw of the cards, with no connection to what they've invested in. Players affect the values very bluntly.

This of course leads to my negative feeling about most moves being inconsequential until you get to the end. But I wonder if this too is similar to other stock games, as I have a similar feeling from e.g. King of Siam or Princes of the Renaissance, that the early game feels extremely aimless with little perceptible importance to individual decisions.

...Gave this yet another try, thinking it might work if you dealt out fewer cards, shortened the game (fewer cards to trigger the end), and had open cards. It definitely felt like more of a game, and I'm upping the score a bit, but 1) it is uninteresting that the "stocks" only pay out once, meaning who will play to a color last is all that matters, and 2) I think there is a problem with turn order advantage: Whichever player goes last, and everyone before them, has obtained one more share in total than the other players.

One really good example of Reiner Knizia the very simple rules and numbers but delivering a very clever multiplayer game. Fast for casual play. Deep for serious play.

Rating Knizia's lighter games is tough. I always admire how simple these games are and there is no lighter or stripped down version of the game than Botswana or Wildlife Safari. Compared with other games in this category of fillers, Botswana is quite amazing. You play the game but you also play the people that play the game. There is a lot of second guessing and plenty of angst but in the end, the game boils down to turn order, how cards are distributed and how people play the game. It is very much like Modern Art in the sense that the game and the players that play the game matters quite a bit. 

Like No Thanks!, High Society or For Sale, Botswana is best played before or after the main course and ably keeps players engaged. It is not to be played every session nor every other session. When introduced sparingly, Botswana shines and is one of Knizia's lightest and most durable game in many collections.

RATING: 6.5
Picked up Loco for $4.  It's a decent game.  You have some control, although I am not sure what you can do if you were dealt nothing but 2's and 3's.  The game is very quick, so it is unlikely to offend anyone.  Still, if you are looking for a cheap game that is available in a mass-market store, get Loot first, and this second.

Much better than I expected.  A solid filler.  There's just enough strategy, just enough brain burning, and it's just short enough to make it satisfying and not a waste of time.  (Though, for a similar mechanic, I'd rather play 'Die Fugger').

Have played Loco!, Quandary, Flinke Pinke and Thor.  The first is a cheap & nasty production, the second is a beautiful one but in an infeasibly large box, and the third is somewhere in between and more appropriate to the game weight and length.  However, Thor is the one to have, being attractive, compact, and including the optional action card variant.

Thor edition. A game which straddles the line between simple and elegant. First play was with three and seemed lacking. Second play was with four and showed marked improvement. This is a solid filler and recommended for fans of the similiarly "simple but deep" Coloretto. Beautiful and unique graphic design. Now all I have to do is get the Heidelberger edition of Korsar and I have the whole set!(I have this and the very entertaining Delphi.)

Two minutes to teach the rules, five minutes to play a round, 20-30 for a full game.

Simple rules, deceiptively complex strategies. Simple enough for a child to learn, complex enough for vetrean gamers to enjoy bluffing and tricking each other in it.

One of my favorite games of all time.

Typical Knizia minimalist filler (as a Knizia fan, this is generally a compliment, but I know others find his minimalist abstract fillers off putting). While I appreciate the tension and elegance of the system, I'm not sure this is one I need to own. Unfortunately it seems a bit too subtle to be enjoyed by non-gamers. Much like Chicago Express, non-astute players would find the process largely banal. But if I can't introduce this to non-gamers then its value to me really is too limited to justify owning, considering the plethora of other games I'd rather choose when with gamer friends.

RATING: 6
This is a dry game as it is, but playing it with two players turns it into three-day-old toast ... MELBA toast.  With more players, it becomes a different animal, but it's still pretty dry.  It's sort of like a stock game, since you're playing for majorities, but a lot of the tension in the game comes from the push-your-luck element of knowing when to play your cards.  This is a nice game, for such a simple design, and the price tag can't be beat.

On safari in Botswana, you might be able to spot lions, rhinos, elephants, leopards, and zebras. In this game, you will spot them for sure! But can you guess which ones will be worth the most at the end of this safari? Play the right cards at the right time, collect the best animals, score the most points and win the game. Botswana has easy and quick rules, it is fast to learn and yet challenging to play for all family members young and old. This is the latest addition, 11, in the popular Gryphon Bookshelf Series of family games. You’ll want to collect them all for a never-ending supply of quick, challenging, fun family activities; whether at home or on-the-road! This game easily adapts and therefore plays well for 2 to 5 players by simply adjusting the number of cards in the playing deck.

I have the very well made Quandary version by Milton Bradley. Simple mechanics and rules make for a surprisingly good game. It even feels like a card game to me - which I like. 
The decisions to make are not light with each play of a tile/card.

1/17/06 - Plays very different with just 2 players. It is nearly a perfect information game in this case and becomes much more tactical. I'd rather play many other 2-player games than this. However, the multi-player version of the game is quite good.

The [b][i]Botswana[/i][/b] edition of this design is a cute one, but handling cards lacks the appeal of the chunky tiles from the Milton Bradley version, so out with the new so that the old can maintain its cherished position on the shelves.

One of those confusing little Kinzia games where I have little idea what to do for the best. Obviously making progress invites opponents to spoil your score, but it's unpredictable to what lengths they will want or be able to go to do this. Its opacity makes it feel like it's very clever, but it could just be that it's equally confusing for all players such that the outcome is approximately random.

I have a copy of Thor and Quandary.

Quandary is very nicely produced. The tiles are great.

I have played Quandary with 3 and 4 people. It is good fast fun. It is hard to get a strategy to reliably work with 3 or 4 so it can be frustrating for those who abhor luck. Still it is fun when your plan to screw you opponent comes through and they score nothing for that pile of tiles of one color.

Played with 2 players, with the "variant" (approved by dr. Knizia himself) that you can't pick up a token of the same colour of the card you played, it can burn your brain (in a good way). In 4, with standard rules, it has a strange poker vibe that draws players in. Recommended.

Another card game filler.  No real strategy besides to block the color(s) you aren't looking to invest in, but when there are a lot of players, there is only so much you can do just with the cards in your hand.

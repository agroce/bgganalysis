RATING: 7
This game is much harder in practice than I expected it to be, and I haven't quite gotten the hang of how to control where you're hitting the balls. The included rules are not very good and instead I would suggest looking for the variant rules here on the geek. As a collector and a lover of dexterity games, this is a very welcome addition to the collection. It is one of the coolest looking games out there when it's set up on the table, and sure to attract attention!

A very innovative dexterity game that also goes well with beers. Keep the young kids away from it though, as they will wack the balls too hard and make them fly across the room.

Extremely difficult to control directionality in this game.  I suspect with enough practice you could get good, but to the beginner it seems to be pretty much a random/accidental exercise to me.

RATING: 6
A fun dexterity game that takes some practice to get the ball to move the way you want it to.  I hesitate to bring this out when very young children are around because they always want to play and they hit it way too hard.  I'm always afraid they will rip the cloth bottom.

Unusual dexterity traversal game. Fun, but can be frustrating to first time players. My usual tactic is to find the ball I want to hit, then hammer looking up at the shadows from below the level of the board.

RATING: 5
I enjoyed this game, although it seems to &quot;peak&quot;. That is to say, for a dexterity game it has a nice feel of progress in the early games as I picked up the skill to improve my play ... but then the improvement seems to stop, and I didn&#039;t feel like I was controlling the game much, and yet I didn&#039;t feel like I was getting any better at the game. I played someone else&#039;s copy, and as much as it draws me I&#039;d be very leery of shelling out the big bucks for this one, as there seem to be other, better, high-priced dexterity games.

RATING: 6
Addictive dexterity game, although it's very difficult to control where your ball goes!  I'm sure one could improve with a little practice, but it's very tricky!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I found it difficult to get the ball to jump in the direction I wanted it to.  It seemed to go the opposite of where I intended most of the time.  Once it got going though and you were in the middle of the board, it became more more fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Entertaining and extremely light dexterity game. I have only a modicum of control over where the balls go when I hit them right now, but this is still pretty fun to play. I imagine that with a group of experienced players the game would actually be that much more interesting, as right now it feels like we were both struggling against the game itself rather than playing each other as much. That's not to say that some aggressive capture moves/attempts aren't possible, but without finer control most of them (and the scoring shots) tended to be more luck than skill. Still, cute, fun, and I would like to play again.

Much trickier than it looks.  I don't like the original scoring much.  The Houston Gamers have a variant scoring system that I haven't playtested yet.  (I had this and sold it.  It's cool, but I was afraid of damaging it.  Even with the legs off, it's a giant, flat square.  Yay (not yay).

Cannonball Capture. Mistake to buy (even cheap). Cloth busted, too much effort to get good. Takes up more than its share of room. The little balls jump off and roll everywhere. [years later] Wasn't a mistake after all. Quite fun. Play in a room where the rolling balls won't always roll to impossible to get to spots. Practice.

OK dexterity game where you are positioning balls by hitting them with a mallet underneath a linen stretched grid.  I don't feel I have as much control of my shots as I would like and don't feel repeat play in order to improve would justify the amount of fun the game provides.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
[8 plays] Fun incarnate.  I discovered this game at a con, and from the first moment that I walked in and saw it and thought, "What the heck is that contraption?" I was obsessed with it.  Over the course of a few plays, we became more skilled and less of a menace to bystanders.  

It wasn't until after the first time we played that someone revealed the name, and hence the theme, of the game.  We were chagrined to realize we should have been talking like pirates that whole time!  

The only downside to this game is that it's pretty hard to predict the length of it, because a game that seems close to over can be prolonged by exchange of prisoners.  You also have to manage trying to keep everyone in play long enough to accomplish your goals.  

I'm not that crazy about dexterity games normally, but this is definitely one of the most outstandingly fun ones I've ever tried.

Actually a fun game, but a bid tedious to play - perhaps with more practice skills develop and the tedium drops. But of the dexterity games I've played, this one is not in the same league with Crokinole or Carabande (Pitch Car).

RATING: 6.75
This is a very nicely produced and fun little dexterity game. Players use little wooden hammers to knock the balls, from underneath the board, in hopes of getting them across to their opponents side. It takes a little practice to get the hang of it and can be a little tricky, but it sure is fun trying. I'm not sure the game is worth the high price, that I paid for it, but I'm still glad to have it in my collection, to bring out every once in a while for something different and a few laughs.

RATING: 7
Fun game where one tries to hit one's balls across a fabric/wood gameboard to the other side with a wooden mallet.  The youth I've played it with enjoy it although it is difficult to pick up how to hit the balls effectively the first few plays.

Great social game for almost any group.  Easy to learn the basic technique, and guaranteed to bring lots of laughs and groans from kids, non-gamers, whomever.  I highly recommend the Frank Branham scoring variant: game ends immediately when any player has no more playable balls.  Score 4 for a ball in the goal, 2 for a captured ball, and 1 for a ball in the field (home row doesn't count).

I really like the concept of the game, but it did not play as good as it looks. First thing, it is really hard to play somewhat well, which makes the moves a little random and the game frustrating. Second thing is that the rules we played with were not the best (it might however be the rules book or our rules reading), but when you have a lead with about 4 points, the best thing to do was to whack the balls outside the frame. But it is fun to shoot the balls.

One of Wittig's early masterpieces. There are some issues with the scoring, but then: who really cares? Played this in an enlarged version made by Joe Nikisch (I think). That was even better as there were less random shots as in the regular version.

RATING: 6
Rating dexterity games is pretty difficult, especially as I've rated so few.  This is one I was fascinated with just due to the fact that it was sitting out there with its awesome linen underneath board and the hammers.  It seems that the game is less about getting across quickly than just about getting across--it's pretty easy for balls to fly off of the board or to get captured by your opponent.  

On the whole, quite an entertaining diversion. (1 play)

RATING: 7
Al confine fra il gioco di abilità e quello di fortuna. Tamburellando con un martelletto, da sotto, il piano di gioco - un'imponente scacchiera in legno a riquadri separati, con una base in tessuto - si deve cercare di far saltare le proprie biglie, per andare a "mangiare" quelle degli avversari. Grandi risate o avvilente scoramento, a seconda della platea.

RATING: 7
Such a fun, unusual dexterity game. I would rate it even higher except for one thing: you spend half the game chasing the balls all over the room and under furniture. 

Finally found a copy for less than an arm and a leg. So beautiful. Should have sent. A poet.

RATING: 6
The idea of the game (though thematically ridiculous) is good, but in practice is a little clunky and too dependent on skill for new players.  I can see how seasoned players would grow to enjoy the game more as their skill increased, but for new players (with whom I usually play dexterity games) I can see how it may be a little frustrating to not be able to make many shots work.  A newcomer would still probably lose in a game like Crokinole, but would still be able to make most shots.  Can you tell that I wasn't very good at this game?

A very unusual dexterity game.  Players use mallets to whack the bottom of the linen-covered grid, popping the cannonballs across the board (and the room).  I'm not very good at this game.  Very novel, but I didn't play it much, so I traded it away.

Great quality, BIG "I want to try that" effect. It takes some time to master the basic maneuvers, but even after more practise there is still some luck included - which makes Piratenbilliard a great game: if you're rookie you'll have some chances to win although the experienced player will have some advantage. Luck & Skill -mix makes Piratenbillard such a great game. It goes to the same genre than Zopp, Weykick, Crokinole or Carrom but compared to those mentioned, this is the best for the whole family. For me this is a strong 8, but I do like Crokinole or Zopp better.

RATING: 8
Simple dexterity game that is just a fun time.  Personally, I just enjoy going after people more than trying to win the game...:-)  One seeks to use their mallet to hit their balls from below the raised platfrom and get them across the board into the opposite final row.  One scores points for captured opponent balls and landing in the final opposite row.

RATING: 6
Any game that has the instruction take your mallet is going to be slightly crazy and have unexpected results however this game is insane in the membrane.

I truthfully don't think this was designed as a game.  I instead think this is a crazy cricket training drill.  Your opponent hits the ball with the mallet.  If the ball stays in the frame you swap roles.  If the ball goes out of the frame you must catch the ball or chase the ball across the floor until it is retrieved.  Fast reaction speeds are rewarded.  If you haven't lost any of the balls at the end of the game then you have won. 

Highly recommended for 1) cricket players, 2) drunk games conventions and 3) players who do not worry about losing pieces if the cricket drill goes wrong.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.2
While I don't dislike dexterity games some of them are just an exercise in frustration. Those little balls just seem to fly wherever they want and I'm sure with enough practice I could get them to go where I want them to but I have already invested that time into other dexterity games that are more interesting.

For novelty value, this is pretty awesome.  I really think we should have played the advanced scoring rules, though, as the basic scoring in the Hearthsong rules we had lead to a degenerate state.  However, it's still really neat and I would like to pick up a copy eventually.

Falls firmly in the category of stupid fun. I don't think I would want to play this over and over again, but I would play occasionally. It's a great filler game for BGG.CON. It would also be really easy to make your own copy, maybe $15 worth of materials and a few hours of work. Why you would want to go to the trouble, I don't know, but it could be done.

This was decent fun for a dexterity game, popping balls up out of squares, aiming with placement and speed to knock a ball into your opponent's squares. The more you played the better you got. But there's only so many plays in the game - you either get too good or the repetition ennui kicks in.

Super cool idea and wonderful fun (theoretically), but actual play is darned random and just gets silly with excessive force smackage. I'm sure skill could be acquired but who would take the time? For silly fun Loopin' Louie is better and for a 'skill activity' Crokinole is better. Still, a nice novelty item to own. (My older son won it for his brother! Thanks Kevin for offering it up as a prize.)

This is a hard to find game who's novelty outlast it's gameplay.  More often than not it's nearly impossilbe to control any of your shots, therefore the element of playability degrades into chaotic shots that are only amusing if the balls go rocketing off the board.  In the 4 games I played at BGG.Con 2007, the Pirate ball only ever came into play once. 

Play this if you see it a t a Con or someone brings it to a Game night, but I just can't see myself setting out to own it.

Someone brought this game to our gaming group and everyone seemed to have a lot of fun trying it out, or watching others doing so.  I was terrible at it, but a lucky capture meant that I was on most poinst when the game ended, as all the rest of my balls very rapidly vanished off the table!  I think maybe I shouldn't have hit them quite as hard!

This is an interesting little dexterity game that I finally got to play at BGG.con.  As expected, I enjoy it a lot.  There really is not a whole lot to it -- you are just smacking balls with a hammer.  The challenge is that you cannot see what you are doing.  It does take some work to get to where you can perform with some consistency, but once you do, the game is a blast.  Even, then, though, there can be a fair amount of randomness.  Overall, though, a great fun game.  Oh, yeah, use the alterneate scoring where the game ends immediately when a player loses his last ball and you score balls in play as well as captured and in the scoring row. [11/26/2008]

This is the game I still use to "shock and awe" people. It does draw a crowd each and every time, but the skill level needed to play is quite high and far beyond any group of newbies. Its novelty keeps everyone playing until the finish, but nobody feels too successful and not too many want to play again. I would offer that there are many dexterity games that offer a far more satisfying time for all levels of player (and those do not need their scoring rules altered like this). I'll never get rid of this unique game but it doesn't get played nearly as often as I would have thought.

Eh.

It just isn't all that exciting.  You can play this to the point where you are actually really good at this, but is it worth it?  

I like dexterity games, because often it evens the playing field.  In Piratenbillard you are pounding your ball in hopes that it will reach its proper destination, and unless you are well practiced it will usually yield a random result.  The learning curve is discouraging, as you realize that there is something of a game here, but trying to make the moves that need be done and actually pulling them off are two different things.  This just makes the game exhausting as you struggle to get your piece all the way down to the end to accidentally knock it out, or to get inadvertently captured either from someone's slop or from just positioning yourself incorrectly from a stray shot. 

It seems that I just waited around hoping that other people don't capture me only to get frustrated by the general results, especially from the results of my own turn.  Often times, you will be in a position where you know it is impossible to catch up at your current skill level and you have to play through.  I guess it can be fun trying to be a kingmaker...

Anyway, finding four players with the same level of skill for such an obscure game is tough, everyone really would have to want to get into the game for it to be even slightly fun two or three sessions later. 

UPDATE: I would give the game a point more if you pretend that the mallet is your penis.

Such a unique design.  How does someone conjure up a game like this?  We mixed casuals and serious gamers and it was a blast.  I wonder what a match with experienced players would look like.  I was a complete hack and it felt great!  We played that the game could end once someone did not have any playable balls, with the catch the current leader could not end the game by hitting their last ball out.  Instead, if they did so, their ball is returned to their home row on their next turn.

Fun game.  There's definitely a learning curve as far as ball control goes.  I imagine that this would be frustrating for a novice to play against a more experienced player.  Best not played anywhere where dropped balls will be difficult to find and/or retrieve.  If it weren't quite so awkward to tote around to gaming get-togethers I'd play it more often.  It's proven to be quite a hit when I've run it at conventions.  Everyone I know of who's played it seems to like it.  Definitely money well spent.

For a dexterity game, the mechanics are tremendously fun.  The scoring system is tremendously flawed.  For learning players, it's advantageous to 'fail quickly'.  Thus there's no incentive for players to try to succeed to give them the practice time they'd need to be able to play the game in its intended form.

Piratenbillard was one of my favorite new dexterity games that I tried at BGG.CON (tied with Weykick for that title). It’s another strange dexterity game where you hit the bottom of a platform with a mallet to launch your marbles resting on top from one side of the platform to the other. That is to say, you try to do this. Instead, if you’re like me, you end up launching your marbles half-way across the room. While you might have to crawl under tables to recover the marbles, it’s still a blast to play ineptly.

This is another dexterity game that works because it requires a certain amount of skill and finesse to play the game well.  Unfortunately, it's also another one where you can be sharked by players who have had a lot more experience with them than you, or just pick up on the skill of the game faster.  When that happens, it goes from being fun to frustrating.

How compelling is this game? I bought the cheap American version from Hearthsong, set it up at a dessert party, and had five people ask me how to order a copy. Even my parents wanted a copy, and they're the least gamey people I know.

Still being produced and sold, and from a collector standpoint, a dexterity game that was long missing from my collection. Good family fun, nice components, and fast play for two or four players. Note that the newer produced version do not come with a black ball.  Dry clean only!

I can't play this. It is a neat looking game with a unique movement system. Worth playing.

A delightful dexterity game with amusing tactical decisions to be made.  It is about 45% tactics and 55% dexterity.  There are also numerous ways to play so there is a lot of variety.  My only concern is that it is expensive and fairly fragile.  Children or adult yayhoos could easily break this.

Linen bounce ball grid with sticks - use the blunt end and don't aim for the ball, but the linen behind it...

An outstanding goofy end-of-night dexterity game. We make up new rules every time we play, because the published rules don't really work...and for most games this would be a problem. Not a problem with this one!

Bizarre, unique, and challenging game.

After 1 Play: Everyone I played with found the balls so hard to control that we were limited to short and boring moves if we wanted to maintain any semblance of control.  I would probably enjoy watching an experienced player make bold, board crossing moves, but I'm never going to play enough to be able to do them.

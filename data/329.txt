Russia Besieged, Russian Campaign and Russian Front are all my solid favorites for the standard hex wargame for Eastern Front Corps/Army level.  RF offers great graphics, fast play, the blitzkrieg rules add a nice feel.  THis will always be a keeper on my shelf.  Has stood the test of time for over 20 years.

For an old game I like the different method of initiating combat. Still exploring this one but a very nice change of pace so far. 

Edit: Discovering how much I like the way combat is handled. And finding more similarities to modern wargames where much of the same has been "abstracted" even further yet RF does it with much more depth.

The best russian front game ever designed so far. The system is both unique and very easy to learn.

The amount of units involved, from Air, Land, and sea, really brings the whole russian front neatly into 1 single package.

Play time is about 72 hours in total for the full 4 year battle. Extremely satifying to play from the start till the end.

IF there are only 1 russian front wargame that anyone should play, than this is it.

Well researched and developed. This really captures the essence of the Eastern Front. Axis starts strong but weakens as the game progresses. If the Russians can hold, their reinforcements will likely win.
Typical AH rules, complex but not overly heavy.  I love how the Axis has to reconfigure rail lines for supply. I also appreciate how Finland, Hungary, Rumania, and Italy are represented.

RATING: N/A
I thought the rules were a mess, or maybe it was just me and my Master's Degree getting in the way of understanding what the Gnomes at AH wrote.

I am curious; which game company, and which game, began the "trend" of treating the Axis Allies (Romanians, Hungarians & Italians) in such a shabby, un-historical manner?  How many game designers have taken the time to design OB's for the Axis Allies that "get it right" both from the historical designations to the combat strengths of the units?

The main idea at the time behind its creation was to offer an alternative improved and more innovative game to The Russian Campaign. Initially, I thought it was a better game with some very clever combat mechanics which I liked. The way combat units didn't lose their strength but became brittle through sustained fighting was done well. The main issue however was a totally unrealistic air combat system which ultimately broke the game. As long as you won the air war you were virtually assured ground victory. Air was way to powerful. As long as the Axis just pumped all their resources into their air fleets they could most likely hold out, if not defeat the Soviets. The Naval was also way to powerful. The designer obviously and understandably wanted to show the impacts of combined air and naval support on a battle but just went overboard. Due to the vast distances and other reasons, while air and naval was important on The Eastern front, it was nowhere as important as this game portrays. Additionally, using the same ground combat table for  "a winner takes all" air combat dice off instead of allowing both sides to realistically add air effects into the battle and using the same value generic air pieces for both sides throughout the war exacerbated the problems with air and naval. The ability to spend your build points on anything also does not take into account other logistical or macro factors such as manpower or factory constraints.

A latecomer to this classic, I find it a pretty good blend of scope and detail. Not too slow to play, but sometimes combats can get fiddly if air, land and naval forces are involved (not surprisingly, this is rare.)

I'm not 100% convinced by the portrayal of airpower - absolutely lethal in this game, as it is concentrated in units that support particular combats. Perhaps this is valid; I've not done much reading on the use of airpower in this conflict.

RATING: 4
It was supposed to be an improvement on The Russian Campaign, but it left me flat. Yes the map is gorgeous, but frankly it is overwrought. The combat in the hex system works for naval games, but not here. The use of naval factors in combat seemed wholly out of proportion to their actual employment in this campaign. I have read many accounts of the war on the eastern front, and all I recall of "naval activity" was the ferries across the Volga and the Dnieper. These would not have garnered even one-tenth of a combat factor. The extra chrome not only added to complexity, but had questionable validity. Sold this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
The concept that a damaged unit maintains its fill combat strength, even when having lost half its tanks and personnel is just ... fantastic at best.  It makes no sense.  The necessity of placing "strength" counters beneath units to indicate how much its reserves of personnel and equipment have diminished also makes stacks of counters that insist upon falling over and getting mixed up.  This game design has major failures.

This was THE game for Attilla66 and I for a time.  Never managed too get through an entire game despite many, many sessions of Russian Front.  Can't tell you how many times I re-lived the Axis blitz on the Communists. In the end it became to fiddly for unit placement and demanded high rolls to have a shot at conquering Mother Russia.  Would like to get it on the table again for a re-assessment but ONLY if its a play to completion...

RATING: 9
Excellent game with one of the best maps, at least in terms of aesthetics, of any wargame. The combat system felt right with units actually moving into contact within a hex rather than the more static adjacent hex stand-offs. The fact that units took hits but did not lose combat strength also felt right, reflecting that at this scale combat effectiveness at the front line is not reduced by casualties so much as the resiliance of the unit being reduced which forces the player to be wary about over committing it and risking it's absolute destruction.

This is one of the best and funnest games I have ever played. Last time I played with my cousin and it was a very bloody fight. I managed to take Leningrad after a very bloody battle with infantry, Luftwaffe and Krigesmarine all in synchronized operations. The battle for Stalingrad was difficult, where I had to advance and retract back and forth to guard my supply lines and flanks from hard counter attacks. I managed to keep them protected and massed my heavy Luftwaffe units to finally take Stalin's pride. I am about to set up a new game with a friend and will see how it fairs this time about...

An average grand operational game on the war in Russia. The rules are fairly clean, but I don't like the fact that units accumulate hits.

A remarkably simple game to play.  Rulebooks are brief and easily learned.
I've played this game a few times now and they all turned into a german routes.  Maybe I played it wrong, I dont know, but the entire war in the east usually dies out by the spring of 1942.
The Russian replacement rate is ridiculous and the Axis can't keep up.  Simply put, the Russians can repair all their Armies and replace several lost ones every turn while the Axis can barely repair their damaged Corps.
And then there are the railroads.  The entire German offensive is almost LITERALLY tied to rail lines.
They have to be converted to be used and that tends to slow down the advance.  There's no mad dash across Ukraine without securing and converting the rail lines near Kiev.

A good game.  Sadly, it came out just as I was entering college so I did not get to play it to death when I was still in high school.  :-)  There are a lot of things that I really like about this game that make sense for corp level on the Russian Front - combat occurs within a hex, the units accumulate hits, a unit's combat effectiveness is not changed by hits, but you have to be careful how far you push your army, the fact that the German units are more powerful, but more brittle than the Russians, etc.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Intense, incredibly satisfying strategic exercise played out on the most compelling, era-defining stage imaginable. A longer than average game lasting 24 turns to May 1943, given sufficent thought, will require c.48 hours to complete face to face; Vassal games played to date at a good pace have taken between six weeks and three months. Naval rules could use some additional situational parsing but this deficiency can be remedied by house rules and doesnt affect core enjoyment one iota. My No.1 game of all time.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
"In the hex" combat... doesn't seem to work in this game of warfare on the Russian Front.  Units have to be spread much to thin and breakthroughs, which only happened a few times historically, constantly plague the Russian player.

Maybe I'm missing something in the rules, but I don't think that I've ever seen the German player lose this game.  Not well balanced at all.

An excellant siumulation that captures the truths of combat at the strategic level. Fact is that Armies and Corps contiuned to fight with a constant capability unitl a breaking point is reached,,,and then they are combat ineffective, Other games, like Russian Campaign do this too but in a coarser manner...you either survive or get eliminated. The attrition CRT in this game does a better job of reflecting reality. Only a few glitches....like Naval support ,,,keep it from being higher rated in my opinion

Mi wargame preferido. Toda la campaña del este a nivel estratégico exceptuando diplomacia y producción hasta cierto punto, el orden de batalla inicial está definido pero se pueden reparar/recuperar unidades. Creo que es una buena simulación del frente ruso. Una vez las entiendes las reglas tienen una consistencia que hace que jugar sea sencillo. Se nota que es más moderno que los anteriores wargames de Avalon Hill.

Del orden de 5 partidas sin loguear.

UPDATE: tras profundizar un poco en el juego me doy cuenta de que las reglas tienen serias lagunas. Es conveniente negociar las posibles interpretaciones antes de la partida.

A game about the entire Russian front during WW2 always interests me, not to mention this game with an extraordinary map by Charles Kibler.  The game has a an unusual loose stacking rule and a relatively gamey feel whereby a solid front line is not easily established and maintained. Encirclement is the norm rather than exception, somewhat contrary to the past historical writings.  But then, the interpretation of the warfare can be different among people.  The case for the game design has been well explained in AH's house magazine "General" already.  This game has a rather strong design-for-effect feel.  It might not be tasteful to everyone but certainly to those who are obsessed with the blitzkerig tactics.  Gorgeous map, great easetern theatre feel, and a realisitc simulation of the blitzkreig discipline.

Only limited experience so far, but after finally trying it (and being aware that some of the mechanisms are controversial) I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a good rendition of the Eastern Front overall.  Unusual in that it rewards trying to keep a closed front - everyone's aim in the historical period but typically not the way it works in wargames. Not a fast game but better than many newer games I've seen.

Nice system and nice components, yet there is a big problem, common with almost all Barbarossa games on the market. It is really difficult to achieve the German rate of advance in the initial phase of Barbarossa. After many games on the subject I have decided that this is more a reflection of the difference between accurate planning and a professional staff on one side and a gamer on the other rather than system problem. Still Russian front is a very rewarding experience.

In AH rating parlance, this game had a high excitement level rating for me. Can't understand why it hasn't been republished by anyone, while The Russian Campaign has. After Russian Front I never went back to TRC.

RATING: 7
A fun game, but not as big of an improvement on Russian Campaign as advertised. The concept of in-hex combat is very good, as it allows for those bloddbath city fights so common on the eastern front. The counters suffer from a lack of contrast between background and numbers, but good lighting can overcome this. The map is excellent and it still holds up well when compared to today's games. While I enjoy the game, it rates third on my list of Russian front single-map games, behind Russian Campaign and Russia Besieged.

Played this one in the 80's when it came out and, although I enjoyed the game quite a bit at the time, it didn't seem to create the itch to pull it out again.  I'm looking at it now for the first time in quite a while.  Interestingly, when I looked at the rules again it was fun to see how well designed the system was.  Just played a quick game to sort the rules out and I am quite impressed with the games ability to recreate the rapid advance.  I couldn't do quite as good as the Germans did (Leningrad wasn't surrounded and Kharkov held out) but the feel was similar.  The change in fortune in the first winter is palpable.  I can see how eventually the Germans get worn down but I haven't reached it yet.

This game I use to play alot until Russia Besieged entered my collection of games & changed things around. If you are a serious & massive fan of the Eastern Front wargames of World War Two & you have mastered Russian Campaign to perfection, this could be the next game to play. However this game does have alot of disadvantages & yet equally it has its advantages too. If you are into too much complexity this maybe the right game for you. Nice graphics for the mapboard & several scenarios & good optional rules. If you have alot of time & patience maybe this is the right game to play provided you have the right kind of opponent who has patience to play for so long & getting bogged down with complex rules. Still worth holding onto this game in my collection. If you are a wargamer with less patience & does not want to get mentally bogged down with complex combat, supply & logistics rules & so on, stay clear of this product. However if you are into spending too much time & detail on battles & you are very patient, this is a good game.

RATING: 7
Move your forces and roll combat dice to win the war on the Russian Front of WW2.

Plays: A couple?
Type: Wargame = a game where you move military forces on a map to destroy other military forces and/or conquer territory. Hex-and-counter style. Strategic scale.
Complexity: Medium wargame.
# of players: 2.
Playing time: 1200-2400 mins.
Player interaction: Conflict.
Randomness: Low - dice, but no single die roll is decisive and you roll enough to make them average out. You can also decide when to roll and prepare for it to some degree.

Replayability: Medium. This has depth.
Fun: Hex-and-counter wargames are fun in their own way. Either you like them or you don't.
Memorability: This is where wargames that re-create a well documented historical conflict shine. The game lets you create a what-if story that can be compared with historical fact.

Thematic integration: High. The game is based on a well documented historical conflict.
Components: Good. One of the best-looking maps I know in hex-and-counter wargames. The counters themselves are standard.

Who will like this: Wargamers.

Beautiful map and counters gives outstanding presentation to this strategic level WW2 hex-and-counter title.  Interesting aspects are railways as supply chains and converting opponents tracks to your own, and step-losses in combat / air support. We played the basic game, and couldn't help feeling like we were being historically railroaded (pardon the pun). The Soviets badly lost over 95% of battles, yet "earned" a marginal victory.

A very good game with top notch physical components (especially for 1985). The thing that I like the most about it is that you can really see how the Germans were ground down instead of blown out. Once it starts to go downhill for them it is really hard for them to come back. They can have a pretty solid wall of units but each one is a bad roll away from oblivion.

RATING: 6
The game has an innovative combat system. That said, the concept of a unit retaining its full combat strength and being one "hit" away from destruction is simply absurd, yet its fans will passionately defend the design. The naval game impact on play is way beyond its historical importance. Despite its play balance problems, it is a game I will occasionally return to and play, probably due to the superb graphics and challenging play. Just don't expect to be able to get up for a Pepsi and a smoke while your opponent makes his move. And don't fool yourselves, for better or for worse, this is a S. Craig Taylor design.

A classic in all sense. Because it is almost 30 years old, because it is AH and because it is one of the best game on the subject. A conventional AH title with complex OOB and time consuming setups with basic and advanced rules so an average AH game. The difference and what make this game unique is combat system, bringing battle off the map in one hand and in the other, using a hit mechanic really never seen before. Air combat and support and the presence of naval units for the very first time on this front in wargaming entitle this game into the innovative range. Do not miss it. Although it is not easy to find a copy and it is necessary to spend money it is worth every cent you may invest. Recommendable reading "The General" volume 22, issue 4, a lot of examples, variants and hints.

looking for an opponent - excellent game very good game mechanics for logistics and control of rail tracks, ports etc and victory points.  really is a tough game to play for both sides.  however a draw back exists in that if the german player does not go for broke in 1942 (stalingrad, oil fields etc) it means they have a huge amount of units still alive.  On the one time I actually reached stalingrad, I got hammered in Jan - Apr 1943.  but all in all a great game, set at the right level, corps and armies (soviets)

RATING: 5
Too much emphasis on the naval aspect - the mine rules are ridiculous at this scale. Naval influence too strong.

The attrition units suffer doesn't impair their values - that alone is cause for concern in the game vs. history. Requiring corps-sized units to pay movement points to re-gauge RR lines seems wrong.

Finally - the game simply falls apart in 1943. The Axis have no chance beyond 1942 to simply hold the line, let alone hold it until the end of the war - May 1945 - although this game ends a year early (May 1944). The system cannot handle Bagration and that tells you another thing right there - the game as history doesn't work.

The Russian Front is a fine treatment of WW2 in Russia (as the name implies!).  It focuses on the land war, air units being rather generic though important.  The game has an innovative combat system, where battle takes place within a hex.  That really forces both sides to try to maintain a coherent line, for fear of being outflanked.  Very good game.

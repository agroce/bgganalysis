Invited to play by a friend.

At the beginning I was intimidated by the scale of the map, so we started by playing the small scenarios. Later we advance to the Great Campaign in the Valley.
The system is easy and plays fast and in pleasant way.
The soul of this system lies in its operational nature (marching and maneuvering your generals and at the same time outmaneauvre your opponent) and the management of the marching schedule of your formations (fatigue).
The Campaign (several months and each turn= 1 day)runs smoothly but may take some time to culminate (Our campaign took several months 1 session by week).
Very low counter density at brigade scale (The Union have a signitificaly numerical advantage). 
Movement of troops it's regulated by dice (Jackson Foot cavalry have clear advantage).
Battles can be nasty if you let yourself surrounded.
The victory conditions reflect the reality of the campaign; the Union must send at the first opportunity his troops to East to deny Vps to the Confederate but at the same time risking his position in the Valley.
Lots of marching and counter marching.
Over the weeks, we studied the map like true ACW generals and know all roads, trails, rivers creeks, fords passes ... consider the wether in Our future moves...  Great gaming (and travel) experience!
Hope to return to this Campaing /game in the future.

For those who have space to mount the fantastic Kibler maps this is a very solo friendly game. Enjoy!

One of the better entries in the system, as the field is more wide-open and it has more of an operational feel with more maneuver - somthing at which the system excels.

This may be my favorite member of the series.  

It one differentiates itself with small units and the immense Valley over which they range.  Making for scenarios full of maneuver - at which the GCACW system excels - and for the very tense, dynamic battles (at the operational level).

The role of calvary also changes in this theater as the largest infantry units do *not* dwarf their comrades on horseback, a large infantry unit having a manpower of 4 or 5 verse a 1 for calvary.  Calvary can be used to surround, flank, and even attack infantry successfully.  And their mobility is a tremendous asset given the distances over which battles range.

This title's Cross Keyes/Port Republic scenario is one of the series top 5 IMHO of course. 

One day I will play the campaign, I just need a bigger table :)

The GCACW series is simply fantastic - very elegant and playable rules, a mile or two per hex, and division level units.  Playing the game just feels like you&#039;re reading a history of the Civil War, even if you are rolling a dice (!) for movement.  Brilliant series of games.

RATING: 7
Rating based on trial run. This game covers the middle ground of 'operational level' campaigns. The scope is larger than tactical [Battlecry scale] but smaller than grand strategy [A House Divided]. I tried the low-density 6-day scenario and was impressed at how clean the system really was despite bulk of rules. Battles are decisive and chancy, but you can sure stack up a lot of factors to influence that luck. One of the late-era products from Avalon Hill that is really a clever, clean, and puzzling diversion.

RATING: 10
Unbelievable. Only a few pages of rules for a straightforward hex-and-counter game but has a remarkably tense atmosphere. You don't get the feeling you're just pushing counters around. The full campaign game would be very long but the game does have usable scenarios that can be played in a few hours. Major plus point for me.

RATING: 9
Otro buen juego de la serie Grandes Campañas de la Guerra Civil Americana.

Tras haber jugado a todos los escenarios básicos, me parece un buen juego introductorio para la serie. No hay muchas fichas y se deden de realizar casi todas las acciones del juego (forzar la marcha, atrincheramientos, asaltos, grandes asaltos, antiflanqueo). La Confederación es inferior en número, pero de mayor calidad.

Solo dos cosas no me gustan. El mapa, ya que para enlazar los tres mapas hay que colocarlos diagonalmente. Y la gran cantidad de líderes que tiene la Unión que en las partidas que he jugado le dan una gran capacidad de movimiento y facilita su posiblidad de realizar asaltos y grandes asaltos.

RATING: 9
Excellent, as are all of the original Avalon Hill games of the GCACW series (I haven't made my mind up yet about the MMP ones as I haven't played them, except for some scenarios in the Skirmisher).  I played all of the basic scenarios that I could fit on my table (1- and a few of the 2-mappers that didn't need the entire second map), and all of the scenarios from the Skirmisher and "Sherman in the Valley" that I could.  The mid-range to longer scenarios (McDowell and Cross Keys/Port Republic) are the best.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
GCACW may be the best operational level gaming system ever developed. SIV suffers a bit on the playability scale (relative to the other games in the series) because it requires 3 maps in a peculiar configuration that requires enormous table space.

I used to own this and all of the other Civil War games in this series. Although I really liked this series, I found this one to be far behind the others.  Too much maps for the few counters on them. The Confederates have a very tough time in capturing their early objective of Harpers Ferry, due to lack of quality units. I never was able to capture it which always resulted in a damn yankee victory. I sold my copy and have not missed it.

Great game and great series.  Not overly complex but enough so that it's not for beginners, and just a bit of chrome.  It hits my sweet spot for complexity.  The initiative system is a great way to mix things up and raise and destroy your hopes and plans every turn.  Every game is completely different from the previous one and keeps the game fresh.  
Warning: Scenario 1, Kernstown, is the dumbest scenario in the series. Union wins by running away and exiting the map with no need to fight, maneuver or obtain objective hexes. Normally I give games in the GCACW series a 9, but Kernstown is so stupid I dropped my rating for this particular module.

Really enjoying this system and this game, although it's a tough time for the Union with SJ's command ratings and the Confederate tactics.
PbeM suitability: high, as there are usually no decisions for the non-active player (particularly when you can apply the retreat chart rigorously). Cavalry retreats are a bit annoying but it's only a quick pause.

Highly recommend the book "Stonewall in the Valley" by Robert G. Tanner as a companion to game.

This 1995 fourth game in the GCACW Series by AH is a delight to play. The counters and maps are wonderful as is the easy to follow rules. Hit and run tactics followed by two army's maneuvering great distances makes this an exciting game from start to finish. A great game for learning history, or just having fun.

Volumn 4 in the series and halfway through the whole project on the Civil War's eastern theatre.  This game features Shenandoah Valley campaign, one that appeals less to me because of the relative lack of bloody and monumental battles.  But the overall quality of the series remains intact.  Many scenarios are provided and they are all solitaire friendly.  The three map campaign scenario worths all the bucks on this game.  A must buy.

Once I played this I really warmed to it and not just because of the lush map, which is of course really beautiful.  The system works better in the valley than in the Antietam Campaign and Stonewall Jackson's abilities to command are well represented.  In battle, the Union is in real trouble here and the maneuverability of units (because of the randomness of the activations) can lead to disaster.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
STUNNING maps but I never really got into the system - It's too simple for my taste.  Great game too, with lots of tension between the large but hopelessly inefficient Union armies and Stonewall's small but powerful one.  Very long campaign game - over 100 turns). Own the whole series but this is the one I play most (when I have the space).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Probably the most interesting of the campaigns in the series.  30-40  hours, but very fun.  Good replay value, multiple strategies to try as the Union.  The Union player is likely to lose, but probably gets to set the tempo of operations.

I prefer Here Come the Rebels and Roads to Gettysburg over this version. The counter density is very low in general and the counter-to-map density is very small. But, I realize that this was necessitated by the need to make the scales/maps compatible with the other games in the series.

The GCACW system with its emphasis on maneuvers really shines with the fluid Shenandoah campaign. The rules are crystal clear, I particularly like the retreat rules, and the maps are a masterpiece. The only problem is the small number of scenarios: only 4 + the 2 small ones included in the first issue of the skirmisher magazine and the fact that the campaign is a 3 mappers with a weird staggered layout.

The Great Campaigns of the American Civil War series is solid gold in my book. I find the Civil War fascinating, but my main interest is European history. So it isn't just the period covered that makes it great for me. The games in the series are examples of wargames at their finest. The maps are very detailed and look fantastic, and the games are complex enough to give fine detail to the campaigns but not so much that they require huge amounts of time to play. They have a great mix of playability and meatiness. The historical simulation of the battles is excellent. All of these features combine to give players the needed substance to experience how these campaigns played out.

RATING: 5
Played the shortest scenario in this series (#4 of volume 4) for three game days, and it was enough to know that while I respect the system and consider it to be interesting and well thought-out, in the end it's a lot of fiddle and bluster in an era I care almost nothing about.  Streamline it a little and stick Napoleon or Frederick the Great in there and now yer talkin'.  Very hard to rate - I think the basic concepts are worth at least an 8, but the setting and baroque presentation drag it back down.  And it's very hard for me to take a pre-20th century operational system seriously if it doesn't have any limited intelligence mechanics.

01/27/08 - Port Republic scenario is pretty good, although it doesn't look like any of the others included will be classifiable as short.  So, while inexpensive by GCACW terms, perhaps not the best starting point for a beginner.

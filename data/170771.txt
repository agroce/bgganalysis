It's hard to rate this one. I like it, but I don't love it. There are some really cool features but it lacks something. For me it failed to overthrow descent, despite being better on some areas the fiddliness is holding it back. Maybe it's simply because our group isn't "hardcore" enough.

We rarely play campaign based games due to lack of time so we figured if we were in a mood for campaign based dungeon crawl we would rather play Arcadia Quest. Plus I found rules too thick and confusing and in the end the big box also just took shelf space so the beast went away.

Nicely done but a bit fiddly. Production wise it’s hard to compete with FFG these days, which I’ve been spoilt by, making this feel a tad flimsy in comparison (though TONS of stuff).

What a mess. As generic a dungeon crawler as can be, including weirdly out-of-place pop culture references ("A tomb raider called Lara"), overcomplicated damage calculation), a ridiculous amount of randomness (encounter cards) and a dull campaign. 

But there are good sides: it looks rather pretty, the enemy "AI" well done and the weapons and spells feel powerful. 

There's just no reason for me to continue playing after a few runs. It's repetitive, overly generic and requires a lot of time for setup as well as "saving" (despite the app).

New or updated features from the GD base game:

- Master enemies with menacing system (GD addons)
- Effects (Poison, Lethal, Critical etc.) (GD addons)
- Level up system with collected tokens (no dice rolls!)
- no longer player elimination (Ghost forms)
- focus action (boost your hit rolls)
- tweaked defense system (static values for less dice rolling)
- more character development 
- controlling and dominating area system
- fog of war (line of sight is limited)
- power cards for enemies (so they scale and differ more)

After playing it I was a little bit disappointed at first. It seems much less tactical than Galaxy Defenders but in mission 4 the system shows, that there are options to think about.

Nonetheless it is not as good as Galaxy Defenders. Sword & Sorcery is a more simple game with less tactical options and less cooler enemy AI Scripts.

EDIT: We finished the campaign now. The result remains the same. It is a good game with a good sense of exploration but it lacks on the tactical part. If I had not played GD before I would rate this game higher, but after playing GD with all its expansions, Sword & Sorcery does feels too much like a massmarket GD with stripped down tactical choices. When you like the feeling of losing your 40+ hours agent in GD because of permadeath, you will miss  the same amount of danger in this game.

All in all, Sword & Sorcery with hexes and permadeath would have been the perfect dungeon crawl game. Now it is just a good game - and better as Gloomhaven for me.

RATING: 9
This is a wonderful game.  I have played through three of the eight scenarios, and all feel different due to the variable set up, different enemies, and different missions within the scenarios.  

I am thoroughly enjoying the campaign nature of the game.  The story is engaging, and I am actually getting attached to my characters.  Every time I get to draw a treasure card, and am quite excited to do so.  The miniatures are great, and the game play is smooth enough regarding the somewhat complicated rule set.  

I will say, thought, that the game really should be played as a campaign.  The progression of the characters is half of the fun for me.  With this progression, this game is something special.  Without the progression of the characters, the game would a lot of its fun factor.  I keep the game set up on a table at my home, and I am slowing playing through all of the eight scenarios in the box.  I am playing back to back games, and each game feels fresh and fun.  

The game has a high level of replay-ability as each character plays very differently.  The storybook also changes depending upon whether chaos or law heros are played.  As such, I could finish the eight game campaign from the core box with two law heroes. I could play the same campaign with two different heroes, using their chaos side, and it would feel like playing a completely different campaign.  Fantastic.  

I also own Mice and Mystics, Gears of War, Galaxy Defenders, and Myth, and this is my favorite dungeon crawl of the lot.  That said, I do like the others as well.

One thing to note for those of us who have the Kickstarter edition: some of the variant heroes are really strong. You might want to consider trying to maintain the same role balance as in the standard character mix (fighter, wizard, ranger, thief, cleric); we took berserker, fighter, necromancer, ranger; the dual heavy fighters just really tear through the lower-level adversaries. I think breaking things up a little bit (maybe using a bard or thief instead of one of the heavies) would make the game better. Compared to Galaxy Defenders, the adversaries are not quite as varied, so a variety of heroes is helpful for flavor. Still quite enjoying.
---
Quite enjoying so far. As much as I enjoy Galaxy Defenders, Sword & Sorcery is massively more playable just because it uses better fonts and readable cards instead of chits for skills. But it's also just a lot more streamlined and better bang for the investment (although still not simple).

I think one of the things I really like about both GD and S&S is that the AIs really are seriously trying to kill you. A lot of other games in this genre have combat designed to wear you down or drain resources while characters are generally expected to survive. Both of these games are seriously gunning for you.
---
Looking forward to playing this, and it looks like a nice upgrade from Galaxy Defenders. It's generally a beautiful production. But since it seems to fall to me to do these things now, I feel the need to call out just how outrageously sexist the presentation of the women in the game is - classic fantasy babes with skimpy armor that should have gone out of style 30 years ago.

Otherwise, it's basically Galaxy Defenders, but with many of that game's bits of awkwardness smoothed over: fewer defense dice, areas instead of hexes, cleaner engagement and LoS rules, better and more varied powers, much more readable (although still a bit small) fonts. It's not a simple game, but it is a lot more playable than the lengthy and sometimes not exactly straightforward rulebook would lead you to believe - the Galaxy Defenders engine plays cleanly, and Sword and Sorcery files off a lot of the details that made GD a bit persnickety. Anyway, really looking forward to playing.

Easier to learn and play then Descent- Road to Legend with the app. S&S is fun and yes there is luck involved, but it is not all about that. You have to determine which hero will go first and which weapon /power they should use to beat the quest. It is not about trying to kill every enemy.  
I love the game. As far as being similar to GD, just with the enemy AI which is great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've only played 2 sessions of the Sword & Sorcery prologue but my initial impression is guardedly favorable. If all goes well, this will be the "Descent 1st Edition Sans Overlord" game that I was seeking a few years ago, though I'm guessing that I'm in the minority here. I'm not sure many are still looking for this style of game in 2017. In the context of Gloomhaven, which effectively beat this game to the punch with zero miniatures and much more content, I suspect that S&S won't make a huge splash and that's fine. I don't think there's much of a splash to be made in the genre any more.

I do, maybe perversely, enjoy the seemingly infinite recess of dice parsing in Sword & Sorcery, which I think will just cause some hair-pulling for others.

*Chucks 4 dice*

Let's see... two hits and a surge, +1 hit because I used my non-combat action to focus, +1 hit because we're dominating the area, -1 because it's night, one hit absorbed by armor 1, but I got a surge for a crit! *draws crit counter*... Armor minus 1! ...

*Gremlin rolls two defense dice*... he blocks all but one hit.

TLDR; after mod attrition extravaganza, two die rolls, and a chit pull: 1HP damage. And that's a pretty bare-bones example.

There's lots of this, on every single turn. Add saving rolls, enemies that cause a round of defense rolls for the entire party because of AoE reactions, special powers to activate for further modifications, AI cards to verify for weapon-type resistances & other behaviors and... you get the idea.

The special sauce of this game is the Book of Secrets, which conceals scripted events and separates them from the main Scenario book used during setup. This adds a nice layer of surprise to compensate for the lack of exploration or branching in most of the dungeons that I've perused in the early sections of the campaign. However, while it adds to the immersion, the concealed script also guarantees a limited shelf life for the initial campaign. You can add variability by changing your party composition to keep things fresh (and each character has a lawful/chaotic ability tree, so you can try the "dark" side of a favorite), but the general flow of the scenarios will only be a surprise once. There is no random one-off dungeon generator for S&S which is another knock against it when compared with Gloomhaven which admittedly needed to have such a system to accommodate grinding for perks.

Overall, I think the design succeeds in its goal of creating a strong entry in this subgenre of scripted, campaign-only, dice-chucker dungeon crawls, while also demonstrating that perhaps it's time to stop chipping away at this design space. They've really mined it clean with this one.

Another dungeon crawl cooperative. But death here is not permanent, because you can resurrect. But there is some penalty to death. This game takes inspiration from EverQuest and Diablo into a board game. Rahdo really loves this one. Probably a must play at bgg, but the instruction manual is over 50 pages long.

My favourite dungeon crawler at the moment. It's very thematic and even though there are a lot of rules they aren't fiddly and just serve in bringing the story to life. The AI deck is also one of the best AI systems I've seen in a board game and the enemy power system that means one every single goblin, orc, bandit...etc is the same is just genius. Tons of fun with this one and can't wait to play more.

An excellent if not punishing dungeon crawler.  Beautiful graphic design and detailed (but bent) miniatures.  Monster AI is intuitive but can be something easily forgotten during play.  Monsters always targeting the weakest characters is IMO very mean.  Great storyline.  Hero resurrections and development is akin to a video games of the same genre (cool!).  Looking forward to playing the campaign.

Ordered the super-deluxe hype edition with metal coins, 1,000 miniatures I'll never paint, five expansions I'll never play and extra dice I'll never roll.   I'm basically just flushing money down the toilet at this point.  Please send help.

Update:  received the game and started unboxing it, but the table collapsed.

Update:  got the table fixed up.  Started punching tokens; three hours later my fingers were cracked and bleeding.

Update:  girlfriend had a dream about a pot of boiling water overflowing on the dining room table.  I took this as a metaphor that I should get all this mess cleaned up. 

Update:  started reading the rulebook; got to page 25 and fell asleep.  Woke up the next morning and couldn't remember any of it.

Update:  finally finished learning the rules.  Got the table set up.  Sorted the cards and put them in their card holder.  Started setting up the first quest and realized I had another five pages of rules to read first.  

Update:  invited some friends over to play.  When they arrived, they just wanted to play Apples to Apples.

Update:  decided to play with my brother and girlfriend instead.  Brother says he'll just choose his character randomly, picked the sorceress, then says he "doesn't want to play the girl character in the chainmail bikini."  I tried to explain that wasn't chainmail - or a bikini - but it was too late.  

Update:  I chose Captain BigSword.  My brother took Dwarvy McScowlFace and my girlfriend finally settled on Sparkles Bigboobs.  

Update:  prior to starting the game, everyone is asking me why the dice don't have numbers on them.  I try to explain to them what all the symbols mean, then realize I don't actually know.

Update:  start playing the game, but need to stop every 10 minutes because I get this nagging feeling that I "just need to check one of the rules."

Update:  finally finished the first quest.  Game seems ok.

Update:  for a game with such a long rulebook, I'm surprised at how many questions I still seem to have about the rules.  

Update:  just realized I forgot to download and listen to the official soundtrack for this game.  This game is crazy.

Update:  finally finished playing the campaign (solo, because everyone thinks this game is crazy) and it was great fun.  I'm honestly very excited to get the second wave and more quests.

Update:  just realized there's an app available for my Android phone to save a campaign in progress.  This game is crazy.  

Update:  just heard that the Act 2 stuff is going to be delayed for a month or so.  I'm disappointed, but at least the publisher is taking the time to fix and update some stuff from Act 1.

I think its very well designed with a lot of content. But for me all this content and rules takes away a little of the experience. A lot of modifiers on everything makes me think that I always miss something.

RATING: 7.5
Pros:
Overall a great co-op dungeon crawler. The enemy A.I is one of the most interesting on the market (only second to Galaxy Defenders). Lots of character development and character differentiation. The game has a good narrative and progression of story.
Cons:
It's a bit fiddly and complex, which makes the games fairly long (~3 hours). The scenarios are a bit one-sided (similar to most co-op crawlers). They are mostly just go from point A to B to C and kill the enemies you encounter. This feels like a step down from Galaxy Defenders.

100 minutes. 1-5 players.
A very nice dungeon crawler, based on Galaxy Defenders.
Fantasy setting.
Random traps, some fixed and some random encounters, lots of levelling-up, some loot-looting, lots of monsters bashing.
Rolls D10's, influence through equipment + skills + attitude + whether you're outnumbered.
Story-telling = supposed to be good, to be tested!

RATING: 9.5
The only negative one on this game is the long setup time ;-) but then it rocks! Very glad to own this one :-)

After my first act experience I have to admit that there are two issues with the game:
First the difficulty level its ok but not challenging for me (but act2 and side quests shall fix that so the creators said)
Second the Soulweapons. Atm they feel nothing else but almost worthless there are some points during story when you are told to get one and always our gear till then was fairly better so what's the point for this type of items? But right now act1 stuff there are only 4 soulitems so hoping for act2 :-)

But doesn't affect my rating. This game is top notch.

Fiddly, with a generic setting and art.  Some of it would improve with increased familiarity with the system, but there didn't seem to be adequate incentives to invest the time to really learn the game and components.  I liked the effort to build some story and decision-making in through the paragraph system, but the tale the game had to tell just wasn't compelling enough and the heroes were overall very dull.

This is, so far, the best "players vs board" game with any sort of campaign or persistence aspect to it, including ones with a campaign and no real progression such as Zombicide black plague etc. The game system is very solid, and passing out the enemy AI cards to the inactive players is a brilliant way of keeping players engaged when it is not their turn. The level up system/customization is simple but effective and the overall story, while generic, is interesting and well done thus far. I have the kickstarter edition and the extra bling takes the game into out of this world production values, but the base set is still very solid in that regard. Overall Highly recommended for anyone looking for a dungeon crawl or co-op in general.

Kickstarter Immortal Hero pledge. I'm about halfway through a campaign playing with a friend. The story is decent though I would rather not have the goofy pop culture references (e.g. meeting a tomb raider named Lara). Gameplay is fun but requires frequent rule references. It's a bit fiddly I suppose, but no worse than others in the genre. I'm playing Gloomhaven too and while it has better gameplay than S&S, this one is probably more fun. I prefer Descent with the Road to Legend app to either.

This game had soooo much promise.  It looked and sounded amazing.  And on the table, it's pretty good, but the rulebook is ABSURD.  It is one of the worst rulebooks out there.  Over 50 pages with no index and no easy way to find key rules.  Also, the game feels incomplete and only has a few monsters, which got old pretty quickly.  The game is good but a LOT of work needed to get to it, and I am not sure it's worth the effort since there are better games that are easier to access..

I finally managed to get my game group together and give this a fair shake. Sure punching out the components and arranging everything took ages but we managed the introductory scenario and the first of the regular scenarios. 

This game is great, I mean thus far we had just Gremlins and Thugs but I can see how this will progressing. I can't wait for the cards in Wave 2 just to realise how deadly those big guys really are.

All my miniatures, coins etc where present, some slightly bent, but that gave CALIFORNIA Gremlin (the most relaxed chilling Gremlin) for example a lot more personality. 

The only problem I have is that I couldn't put the Card Rack into the box. I have no idea how that will work yet but I am sure I will come up with sensible solution.

So Thank you guys, you made a great game and I am happy.

It's a good game. I like the KI system (though I do not like the way the monster activations are determined) and I like that the dice rolls don't feel too random, overpowered or luck depended like in many other games where dice are used for combat. I'm a little bit dissapointed, that most of the items you can buy are just crap. You spend all your money for healpots and forging, not for upgrading your character. I would have loved if characterprogression had played a bigger role in this game. I'm missing something to look forward to.
All in all the gameplay doesn't feel too special or exciting, sometimes I'm a little bored. But as already said, it's a good and solid game nonetheless.

First Impressions:
S&S (and GD) are great games because they aren't simple. They have some of the best AI enemies in board games. But to achieve that greatness, the game has a very "granular" feel. At every moment, you have to check several triggers and consult AI cards, or equipment cards to make sure something doesn't activate. However, it then creates great narrative moments that a simpler system would not. 

I wish I could describe a few of the awesome interactions that happened but there were so many of them that I can't recall any one specifically right now. However, the feeling of seeing the game and enemies/heroes come alive before us is real. I saw it happen and it was exhilarating, even if by the end I was tired.

Also, I'd like to say that although the written story and campaign itself is campy and cliche, it accomplishes what it sets out to do. And something else it showed me was that maybe a random dungeon system isn't that needed after all. 

The potential for fan made quests is huge (they released the beta quest editor a couple of days ago and after a brief glance it looks good). The way the game is set up, you could literally make a choose your own adventure novel where at points you would cut back to the table for the action. This has got me more excited about making my own adventures than any other board game before. I play tabletop roleplaying games and I usually am the Game Master. After playing S&S today, I want to write my own adventures and campaign for S&S because you can really do very interesting things with it. And that is what has finally really hyped me for S&S.

As a GD fan, I "had" to buy S&S because it was the same system and I knew I would enjoy it. At the time I did KS it, but I wasn't all that excited. Now, after having played. The hype has arrived!

I played it three times now and watched carefully all available reviews. I am a big fan of dungeon crawlers and own so many of them, but I cannot help the fact that I really dislike this game.

I really do not want to play this again.

Yet another Descent clone with its own rules and idiosyncrasies. The twist here is that you can have heroes of different alignments, which sounds cool, but it really only serves to make the choose your own adventure aspect of the story (also cool) completely linear.

As an aside I don’t think in all my minis based games I have ever had minis that are so bent and deformed ...I know they can be sorted with hot water but half of them were unusable when they arrived ...

I am very disappointed in the several aspects of this games production ...

Sword & Sorcery is a campaign-based dungeon crawler that uses an AI system to spawn and control the enemies. Over the course of a single scenario, player characters can gain experience and level up, increasing their stats and abilities. The game also features a fair bit of player death, which delevels a player and turns them into a ghost with very limited abilities. However, they can respawn, using valuable experience points. I didn't really have a good experience with this game, just because the game had tons of little niggly rules that were difficult to look up on the fly. It's possible with someone who knew the game well, I'd have a better experience, but this seems to be a really tough one to learn.

Excellent dungeon crawler. Just right amount of complexity - offers rich rules and gameplay while not being overly complicated. Has nice storybook included for the scenarios called the Book of secrets - events happen also during the scenario and choices are offered with different unknown outcomes - a really exciting feature. I really love the dice system in this game - there is no automatic miss for a whole roll (like X in Descent or Doom) but just individual "zero" result per die, so it´s less swingy. Dice sides and items having the charge icons for choosing and applying different effects is also something that is familiar from Descent and I liked it a lot there as well here. Character build up is done wey well with level up system and finding better equipment along the way. Usually I like dungeon crawls better if the opposing forces are controlled by a player instead of a "AI" ruleset but it works well here. The monster control is indeed rotated between players all the time during scenario, but this is just for following the pre written monster behaviour and rolling the dice for attacks - otherwise it wouldn´t work anyway since it´s a fully co-op game.

Classic fantasy dungeon crawl. Really well done. I like the character customization options and the variety of the characters. The book of secrets makes playing a quest even more exciting, never knowing what to expect, and does a good job telling the story. Game is quite lengthy, a quest can easily take 3 hours with 3 players. I wouldn't play this with 5 players because it becomes too long.
Can't wait for ACT II !

A handful of scenarios in and this feels like the ultimate dungeon crawler.  You lay out the dungeon in advance but the shadow tokens (how many enemies are placed) are randomly placed in pre-determined spots.  One mission might have 2 enemies, or an enemy with a power, and the next one it's a civilian.  Waypoints sometimes are also randomly placed driving you to different locations on the board.

Game play is very dice heavy but with chances of rerolls depending on class, skills, etc.

During scenarios there is flavor text and choices that could affect the current or future missions.

The is a sense of advancement as you gain levels, pick up gear, and buy equipment.

A limitation, since it's miniatures driven, is how the types of monsters you can encounter.  Also, since the monsters don't improve, once you get to a certain level, green and blue gremlins and raiders start to become unchallenging.

Another limitation - the core box comes with 7 scenarios.  That's, frankly, just not enough.  I late pledged the KS, so I'll eventually have 3X that but it's still fairly limiting for how much bang the buck you get.  Trying different character combinations and some randomness is where replay-ability comes in but, as of right now, it looks limited.  The creation tools should be interesting if people start writing scenarios/campaigns for the game.

Prefer solo with 3 characters over 4.  3 and 5 is easier than 2 and 4 just due to how shadow tokens are added (more enemies for 4+).  Also the game starts to drag.

I enjoyed Galaxy Defenders and I also enjoy this, but I just really wish any company doing a dungeon crawler type game w/ many ruleset nuances would follow the FFG format of having one book to get you quickly going with the first mission and all the rules you need for that, and then a Rule Reference Guide to address every rule organized alphabetically for easy lookup.  I just got through the prelude in a solo 2 char game last night and it just felt like I was flipping through all 4 (Rulebook/Story book/Book of Secrets/Reference Sheet) references over and over.  There is a possibility that this will go higher once I get used to the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I've only just started playing it, and I can tell I love it. It's a mid-heavy dungeon crawl with amazing minis to paint. The fantasy theme is a bit worn out, and the pieces/rules are fiddly while you first learn it, but it's proving to be more strategically rewarding the more I play and just about itches that role play DnD vibe as well (although not mechanically, obviously). It's flexible with different parties and changing player counts, and the painting gives me something to do with free time when a group can't be assembled. It gives tons of character build options and the "Immortal Hero" KS pledge I have gives plenty of content through expansions.

I feel like I have played more exciting dungeon crawls before. Perhaps I find the darker art style of the figures a little disappointing. I think in the end there are just a few more rules and moving parts than I want in a evening of kicking monster ass.

I wanted to like it but the mechanics are bad.  Played many times both solo and co-op hoping to find something but ended up eating the $20 shipping charge and returning it, a first for me

Spend more time looking up ambiguous rules than playing.  The spawning doesn't make sense - I end up letting an almost dead monster live an extra turn because I know killing him will mean spawning a brand new, fresh, tougher monster at the end of the turn. This was done to "solve" the horrible balance issues in the game punishing people for killing monsters.

Get a good treasure card and become invincible (or just equip a shield making you an almost unstoppable tank).  Only 1 or 2 powers are useful for any class

I don't understand the high ratings tbh

i would rate it 8+ if the amount of Fiddly in the game were more manageable by mere mortals such as myself. While the authors claim that it's "streamlined", and "faster-playing" compared to its predecessor (Galaxy Defenders), for every one aspect they streamlined, they added more complexity in three other places. This is EASILY the most fiddly game i have ever owned, with "fiddly" meaning the number of state changes (and changers) which have to be constantly accounted for throughout the game. In a group, this is probably not that bad, but for solo players it's bound to be overwhelming for all but a superhuman few.

It is a game with amazing fun that shows faithful reproduction of fantasy. It has a solid system and various expansion packs are expected. Especially the a.i system is a great advantage that you can play co-operative and solo full of excitement. However, I hope that the heroes will be able to grow more variously. Each hero deck is held to the limits that are allowed.

This is a co-op fantasy game.  It's the best such game I have played and by a wide margin.  As a D&D player since the 80's, I've been looking for a boardgame that plays like D&D and this is it.  Forget Temple of Elemental Evil and the other D&D boardgames.  Sword & Sorcery puts them to shame.

RATING: 7
This is my try on getting an RPG-in-a-box game. Hopefully it will deliver, since I went all-in on the KS edition. But at least the miniatures should give me enough back, because I can use them in other games. And the team creating it has good track records with Galaxy Defender for coop and solo experiences. After playing the prologue: there is a ton going on and this really captures the RPG feel in a game board. Less fiddly than I feared, but still not something to pull out on a whim as it needs serious setup. Second play was multiplayer and I decided this probably will be another Mage Knight for me: a game I play purely solo. because francly this is a bear to teach and I don't look forward to trying to teach this to anyone. Bit sad about that, because that and the involved setup definitely take it down a notch for me.

KS. Played the first scenario. It's not too bad to get into if you've played Galaxy Defenders. But unlike GD, you and the enemies just run at each other, roll dice, and grab loot. Not too much thinking required on your part. Story is cool and brings in some surprise elements, and the minis look good too, but Act I is limited to 7 scenarios.

My wife and I have logged some crazy hours playing this game and really look forward to each time we get it to table. The quests can take a while, which I enjoy.  We just leave the game setup, save our place on the app, and jump back in when we have time.  We played the core/base version for a while, but ended up purchasing the Immortal Heroes KS version second-hand.  My only complaint about the core version is the lack of decent arcane weapons in the emporium deck, leaving Auriel at a slight disadvantage compared to other core heroes.  She does have some fairly powerful spells as powers, however.

RATING: 7
1st impression: Gorgeous production and interesting, branching storyline. Reminds me of a more complicated/less cutesy version of Mice & Mystics. It could be just me as I was learning this on the fly, but it did seem a bit fiddly/complicated for its own good. More importantly, though, it seems to lack a mechanic that leads to interesting tactical decision-making (e.g. Descent's fatigue system, Gloomhaven's hand management).

Sword and Sorcery - One of the best dungeon crawl board games I've played. It appears the designers of this game are the only ones paying attention to what doesn't work in other similar games. For example - the too easy/simple (i.e. D&D adventure system), the too tight(euroish) - but heavily luck driven(i.e. Descent, Imperial Assault), anything with an app - technology has no place in board games...go play a video game(i.e. Mansions of Madness 2e). While also paying attention to what DOES work - light story with choices, leveling up, LOOT!, tactical combat that is not too complex, mitigated luck that feels meaningful. AND it takes mechanics from tried and true dungeon crawl video games (Diablo, Baulder's Gate, Dark Souls, Word of Warcraft)- like the town portal/shopping in town, punishment from death without player elimination, an interesting skill tree...etc. The only thing holding this game back is the massive rule book (50 pages). While the game isn't complex, it takes a few turns to really grasp everything. I look forward to exploring this game more. Highest recommendation.

I enjoyed playing through the campaign once.  I just never felt the desire to play it again.  The campaign was short compared to Imperial Assault or even Galaxy defenders.  The dice rolling was not as bad as GD but this is not different enough from IA and I prefer the Star Wars theme.  Just need to have a solo app.

Up to now I played Prologue Scenario twice. Failed with first attempt, but could save my party with all equipment. Defended until I run out of event cards. One party member I had to resurrect.
In second attempt another member died, but I could  achieve the objective.
Two challenging adventures, where game mechanisms worked very well. I feel, rules aren't complicated, but still a lot of room for decisions. Dice rolls created some surprises and the good side as well as some bad luck. For me a big fun.
Replay value with start version not so high, as you have only six scenarios. I hope it will increase remarkable from October on when second oart of delivery will come for the kickstarters.

Another epic, coop, scenario based, fantasy RPG board game with all the miniatures and trimmings. I love the recent trend of this genre infusing a video game quality to game play. I am also so glad to be a paper and pencil RPG'er otherwise I'd be penniless with no storage space. The downside is I'm missing out on this one.

Great for a family game when the father and one daughter is into D&D type games but the other family members are reluctant and dad gets tired of always having to be the dungeon master (no dungeon master in this, it's all AI).  Good manipulatives, right blend of rpg and action for the younger ones.  High quality contents and minis.

S&S is a solid game.  It has a well developed system with a detailed and robust rules set.  As such, it is not a simple game.  It is actually quite complex, and gameplay is pretty heavy.

So this is my knock of the game.  It does not flow.  At times, it can seem a bit of a slog.  Also, it is a bit linear.  It gives the illusion of lots of choice, but there isn't really any.  You can tell this is a conscious design decision, because the entire game runs on a timer.  I like the book of secrets that reveal as you go.  But again, the progression through the story is linear.  Randomized by the event deck, but linear nonetheless.

I could forgive this as a necessary evil, but I primarily was interested in this game solo, as my game group would not stand for the type of investment this game requires.  However, its complexity means that it is extremely unpleasant to play solo.  It's just not fun solo.  There is simply too much going on.  This could be a good thing for you, but for me it ruined solo play.  This would not be a problem if you have a dedicated group, as the game management would be quite a bit easier.  YMMV.

Beautiful minis and stellar components, though.

Some of the best moments in this game are related to the tactical decisions and options available to the players. However, this is also the major downside of playing Sword and Sorcery. As play requires many rules and rule checks to be played as intended (especially with the large amount of game pieces/effects) it can be overwhelming and complex to the point action and play stops or is slowed to the point of breaking the immersion. Obviously steps can be taken to alleviate this problem, I just don't feel they out weigh the enjoyment of the game.

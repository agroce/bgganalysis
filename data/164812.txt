The more I think about my gaming time the less use I have for fillers. If I need to fill my time with something I'd rather it not be an innocuous time waster. This comment could stand in for lots of "filler" games I guess.

I'm new into boardgaming, and haven't played anything more complex than Pandemic, but I understand that some people hate "light" games that involve a lot of luck. Well, this is one of those games.
I don't love it either, to be honest (because of the amount of luck involved), despite being new in the hobby, but I don't hate it. I consider that it's a great game to play with family, especially with children.
I would never refuse to play this with my nephews, uncles, etc., but if the circumstances are appropiated, I would rather choose any other game in my collection.

Ok, so I'm giving this game a 10 because it's the only game I can play with my 86 year old dad and my 18 year old daughter at the same table.

In fact my Dad liked it so much he bought a copy to play with my sisters.

Its a fast light filler game, it does have lots of luck of course, but no-one seems to mind.

[ESP] Juego de dados extremadamente sencillo en el que se compite por lograr la combinación de dados de los objetivos disponibles. Sus reglas simples, su rapidez y el nerviosismo por lograr los objetivos hacen que si tuviese que jugar un filler este sería un buen candidato. A ello se debe mi nota ;)

A simple filler game that can easily be described as "Yahtzee on steroids".  It's fun for what it is, but is only good for one round at a time.  I recommend slightly smaller numbers of players, though, only because it starts to get lengthy with too many.  (3-5 is probably ideal.  It took an hour for 7.)

The cards requiring 6 dice offer far too little reward for the likely effort of claiming them, and bog down the game. Why don't they require 5 dice? (No cards do.)

RATING: 6
Just like the original game, but more color choice, a nice tin, a nice bag, more players possible, and more cards to shuffle. 

On the down side- some of the dice have uncolored pips, some of the "premium" dice are very plain (blue and yellow), there is no spare room in the tin (nice to have a paper and pencil or future expansions), and I'd expect more variation on the 2 sets of cards that are included (very similar apart from gold/silver edging), plus the well over double the price of the original ($37 vs $15) makes me say you should just buy 2 copies of the basic set instead.

Calliope could have done lots of things to spice up this set, or done the same things better.

Pretty much the perfect light filler game. Is the deluxe version really worth that much more that the base? Hard to tell - but I got my money's worth pretty quickly.

Not sure whether I'd rate this higher that Love Letter - it pretty much depends on my mood - I find this lighter fare.

The artwork and components are beautiful. Although the dice are a little small for my tastes. The game play is extremely simplistic and luck-based, and there is a little push-your-luck element in determining which cards to go for. I like it, but it's not for everyone.

This is a light-weight dice-rolling game that is quick to play.  Players take turns rolling their die and placing them next to matching die faces on the card pool in the middle of the table.  First player to match all of their dice with the die faces on a card gets to keep that card.  Each card has a point value on it, and the first to 40 points wins.  Simple rules, and simple fun.  Not too many meaningful decisions and extremely luck based.  It's decent as a very light weight filler and is very portable.

My daughter really enjoys this a lot. No strategy but the push your luck aspect is fun and there's a lot of dice chucking. Cards are much nicer then the base game, but doesn't justify the price... wouldn't have purchased this but I was flush with CSI credit and though my children would like it.

Perfectly fine super light dice game with great components.  It really is VERY simple, though.  I think I'd just prefer to play Las Vegas.

Update: After playing several 3-4 player games with my parents, I like this game a lot more. It really does work for quick fun with "non-gamers," but offers more fun and quick decisions above Yahtzee.

Uncannily simple game to teach and play. The components and box are top quality. The mechanics are all about difficult choices, pushing your luck, and mindless rolling, but it's a quick and fun game to pull out with 3+ players. It can be played with 2 players...but the tension seems a little too light without the extra players competing for the cards.

Roll For It Deluxe
MFG: Calliope Games
#of Players: 2 - 8
Age Range: 8+
Overall Construction: The Deluxe version of Roll for it comes in a metal tin that is hinged on the side. It’s great for travel, but you have to have the components sitting in it the way they originally come of it won’t close properly. There is a little velvet bag with the “Roll For It” logo on it for carrying your dice. It’s almost better than a Crown Royal bag. You get 48 dice, 6 of each color and like the base games half of the dice are opaque and the other half is translucent. The cards are interesting in that they are more stylized than the standard decks. You will get the equivalent cards as what you would find in both base sets. The rulebook is quick and easy.
Gameplay: Game play is still the same. Each player gets their set of 6 dice. Cards based on the number of players are played out in the center of the table. Each player takes turns trying to roll dice corresponding to the image on the cards. Each card has a designated amount of points and you are playing until someone hits 40 points. You can Put your dice on multiple cards, just make sure that you will still be able to claim at least 1 card. On your turn you can choose to pull your dice off, but if you do you have to remove all of your dice, so placement is critical.
Yes/No Recommend: Just like the standard version of the game, this is the ultimate competitive version of Yahtzee out there.  Sure Yahtzee is somewhat competitive, but with Roll For It, you can actually block opponents from getting combinations. It’s so much more cutthroat and requires so much more strategy. As much as I would or should feel bad about maligning a Classic game, Roll For It kicks Yahtzee’s butt.
This version can accommodate up to 8 players, whereas the base game is only up to 4. If you plan on playing Roll For It with more than 4 players or want a wider variety of dice combinations & dice to play with, then I definitely recommend this version over the base game sets.
You can play it with a younger crowd, but they might not get the strategy of the game & might get distracted easily.
Where To Get It: Roll for it is definitely available at the local game stores, as it has been out for a little while now. Not sure about the Big Box stores, but Calliope Games’ website does have a store finder on it. Here is a link to their website. Feel free to visit it and check out their other products as well. http://www.calliopegames.com/read/75/roll-for-it-deluxe

Initial Rating: 5.5 (September 2014)

After the explanation I was sure I was going to hate the game, however it was pretty fun, I was VERY surprised I enjoyed Roll for It!. Still I’m not sure if the game is for me, after all it is 99% luck if you win, very little decisions and they are all obvious, there is almost no game here. I was surprised I liked the game because I hate similar games I have played (Weilong comes to mind), but I think having a lot of target cards with different values helps, also you can compete for the same cards hurting other players (direct conflict). Perhaps I liked it due to the game group and not the game itself. It still has to be a very quick game to continue to hold my attention. The game is dead simple to explain and play.

This Gen Con edition comes with good card quality and ok art. The dice and thin are gorgeous. Not sure about the eight player count, I think that would make the game very boring for me, too slow. I think this is best with 4 players.

Bottom line I can play it again, but I’m not sure if Roll for It! Can continue to hold my attention. Very fun with the correct group. Perhaps I’ll buy it but I’m not sure. Most likely it will go down in my personal ratings.

I just bought the purple Edition of the game and I rated it a bit higher than this one. The reasons are 1. The deluxe edition is A LOT more expensive without adding any advantages for me. 2. I would hate to play the game with 8 players, I think I would play Roll for it as a 3-4 player game, otherwise the game length and downtime could be excessive for such a simple game.

The regular edition of the game is perfect for me. I´m still surprised I liked the game in the first place.

RATING: 9.5
There really isn't much to this game: roll your dice, try to match the cards' requirements, and hope to win enough of them to reach the requisite points. However, we really enjoy watching someone aim for the sixth of a number after getting five of them, or the fact we're all failing our rolls. As a starter game or ending break, this is quick and light -- just what you want in a small game. (But it works best if you mix cards no matter what number of players.)

MINUS: simple game only

The dice are much more appealing and the cards more impressive than the box had left me to believe. For any fans of standard Roll for It, I suggest looking into this edition.

Quick dice rolling/bidding/press=your-luck game.  I liked how you'd compete versus others for cards, creating tension.  The cards seemed appropriate and it was a fun little game.

Being a dice game and trying to roll a specific number, especially on cards requiring all dice, can be down to luck and fun and aggravating at the same time.

I rated this one a 5 and that is because there really is not much to this game.  But here's the clinker.  I actually enjoy this game when there is nothing else to play.  Simple play.  N depth but it is fun.

xmas present for my sister and her husband as they were wearing out Yahtzee score pads (WEARING OUT!!) and enjoying episodes of TableTop. i think it never caught on. in fact, i think they stopped playing dice games altogether since i bought them this. so, yeah, if you're looking for a dice game that'll satisfy that filler itch PERMANENTLY, well...

Card-acquiring Dice Rolling game.

Pro: Very simple mechanics, yet still engaging for actual 'gamers' - albeit on the extremely light end of the scale. Cards in the Deluxe Edition are beautiful - in fact I waited months for it to be back in stock because I couldn't stand the cosmetic side of the regular editions.

Con: Only decisions to make are where to place dice (in one of 3 places) or whether to bring all dice back and abandon in-progress cards; other than that, entirely luck based.

1 play, 2er

Very simple dice rolling, set collection type of game, without very many meaningful decisions -- mostly just luck of the rolls. It seems like it would last way too long with more players. 

There's a deck of cards showing dice combos worth 2, 5, 10, or 15 points: place 3 face up in display. On your turn, you may first reclaim ALL your d6 into your available pool. Then, roll your available d6. Allocate the dice to the cards as you like, placing matching die faces near the cards. If you match all the requirements, add the card to your score pile and those dice to your available pool, and flip a new card. Any unused dice go to your pool. The first player to get 40+ points wins the game.

RATING: 6
It's fine. Heard a lot of good things about it and it does look like a pretty fun party/con game but the experience can easily be ruined by indecisive people. Played a game where a guy took 3 minute turns when literally all you do in this game is roll your dice, of which you have at most 6, take a few seconds to sort them, and then place them next to the cards. It's a very simple game, which is why having just one AP-prone player can ruin the entire experience.

For what it is:  a light filler game, this game really hits the spot.

I do prefer the deluxe version for the snazzier dice and the metal tin.  The cards are also much nicer which does increase my enjoyment of the game.

RATING: 6.5
A fast and easy game where players take turns rolling 6 dice attempting to match them up to one of 3 or 4 displayed cards (only your dice count when matching). When a card is matched it is added to your score pile and replaced by a new card from the draw deck. First player to score 40 points wins. Its a fun game, but is purely based on luck.

Distills the essence of dice games to it's purest form.  This game usually ends up as a tedious exercise of rolling and re-rolling dice to get the numbers that you want.  A good introduction to dice games in general but is readily replaced by more innovative games.

Fun dice game. Roll it - match it - score it. 

A bit sad that you only have to get 40 pts to win in a 2 player game. At home we house rule it to 50 or even 60 points. Sometimes go for the whole deck of cards so it dosnt end to quickly.

A bit boring that 40 pts to secure a win. In a 2 player game house rules need to be applyed in my opinion. Me and wife usally go for the end of the deck, after that we count the points.

Another game cracked open on a camping trip - the usual reservations of the alcohol fuelled gathering were simply brushed aside at the glorious spectral hue of the luminescent dice. 

Really easy to pick up the rules, no skill needed just luck and common sense - which was fortunate to the demographic playing and not forgetting the nice illustrations on the cards and metal tin.

A brilliantly solid filler game!

Stupid simple but fun push-your-luck filler dice game. Be the first to completely match the dice combinations of objective cards and claim them for points in a race to 40. Players can all compete for the same objective cards and that is what makes it fun. Total random dice luck game with no mitigation and that is what it is supposed to be.

Did not enjoy.  Nearly pure luck-based; less strategy than Zombie Dice.
Our large group got hit with three 15 point cards at the same time, so we went around the table about 3 times with nobody being able to add any dice.
Only saving grace is that the art and dice quality for the price is okay.
Would not play again unless peer pressured into it out of politeness...

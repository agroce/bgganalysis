GAME: Albion's Legacy
RANK: 4074
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Albion's Legacy was one of the most disappointing gaming experiences I've had in a long time. I purchased this game at Origins 2016. I was really intrigued by the theme, art and cooperative game-play, but was let down hard once it made it to the table. Two things that are worth mentioning are: I have only played the 1st edition of the game and I do not have any of the Kickstarter expandable content.

Pros:

-The art work is very well done and sets the mood of the game well.

-The components are good quality. Cards were sturdy with no chipping on the edges. Tokens were a nice thick cardboard and the metal tokens looked good. The board was okay, nothing special but functional.  

-Graphic design does not get in the way. It was serviceable and easy to read. 

Cons: 

-The rulebook was atrocious. This easily could be the worst rulebook I have ever had the pleasure of trudging through. In my game group I am almost always the gamer tasked with teaching the game. I have read probably hundreds of rulebooks at this point and feel very confident in my ability to do so. However this rulebook had no examples in it, lacked illustrations to aid understanding, rules were buried in component overviews and lacked any comprehensive flow. We almost put the game away and picked a new one at one point. Anyway, you get the point. 

-The game relies too heavily on luck for it's length. 

- The encounter cards are do not add any value to the game. Majority of encounter cards are some version of roll X stat, if Y number then gain a card\token otherwise place a token on the end game track. The game could have been far more interesting if the encounter cards gave interesting decisions for the party to choose. Similar to the crossroad cards from Dead of Winter or encounter cards from Scythe. 

-The game is artificially hard. It is not hard because you have to make tough choices presented by the game design; instead, it is difficult due to the overwhelming amount of luck in the game. 

-Combat is uninteresting and unrewarding. All combat is resolved by rolling a certain amount of dice with almost no way of mitigating a bad roll. You have destiny tokens that let you re-roll one die and increase your 33% chance of getting the symbol you need to a 50% chance. Oh, but you only get three for the entire two hour game.

-The destiny token system is poorly designed. It is too limited for the games length and we found almost no way to regain them. They also are needed for special abilities in the game, so have fun deciding if you want to use a special ability or re-roll ONE die. We ended up not using any special abilities because we felt the tokens were best used to reroll dice in combat. Also, luck gets you here too! We found one card the whole game that lets you replenish the destiny tokens. The character that resolved the card was already maxed out though. Fun...  

Above are some of the key things I wanted to highlight but this is not a comprehensive review. Overall the game was frustrating and boring.

Good fun although very tough, completing story quests in sometimes unknown locations, surviving and getting the quest coins is difficult. Nice feel to the game. 2nd edition rulebook is a vast improvement on the first, and saves time in set up and game play.

Albion's Legacy was the first board game that I ever developed. I will always have a soft spot for the game, and am admittedly biased, but I really believe that it's a great game, made better by what a strong community we've got on these forums.

It's a lot of fun and there is a lot of stuff to do in every game: defeat Roaming Threats, try and achieve Personal Quests, do Story Quest Challenges. But this isn't a game for casual diversion for an hour. I find it rather like a wargame: you have to think carefully about setting up your characters and how to manage everything -- and then in-game the dice screw up most of your plans and you have to adjust.

The game concerns me that the "heroes" are disposable. And they must be disposable in order to come close to "winning". The game has very positive mechanics but I just don't seem to have fun playing it. I am going to modify some rules and see how it goes. This is my third report on this game.

Slow to start - quick to learn, co-operative board game based in Arthurian legend. Looks daunting while being unpacked, but once all tokens are in place and the game gets underway, things move fluidly into a comfortable pace. The name of the game is player vs game, its wholly centered around the players acquiring a fixed amount of quest coins (read: victory points) along with the required win condition of completing a challenging quest; said quests, of varying difficulties, can be chosen before the start of the game. Each character is themed and has a personalized quest that entices them to a unique board location with the promise of unmatched treasure. Each character feels different enough to differentiate their play-styles, whether it be through special abilities or their own strengths and weaknesses. One of the pronounced differences between characters is the RPG-style numbered stat system (themed accordingly with the Arthurian backdrop,) but no character feels hamstrung by their natural aptitude towards some, but not all, types of encounters. If anything, the breadth of character styles leads new players (or new friends) toward creating their own small travelling parties to better their chances in the wilderness. The parts feel of good quality, whether it be the cards, tokens, coins, etc. However, as I would with all games of this scale, Id reccommend laminating/sleeving the cards and making copies of the single included reference sheet. The game can be a bit cumbersome to teach people who are new to boardgames or stat-based tabletop games, but given a few keyturns, the game quickly begins to explain itself organically as you face unique encounters. Reminicent of Arkham Horror. For those who havent played Arkham, it feels like a PUG D&D session with all the number work done for you. Overall, genuinely fun to play, great presentation, and promising first game from a new team of designers.

RATING: 7
Rating based on 1 play - theme is great but the mechanics is a bit boring. Rolling dice for skill checks for everything just isn't very immersive unless you're into a lot of dice rolling. Rulebook is sparse but readable - needed more illustrations and examples, but the forum here helped with that. Modular board is neat, but the locations themselves have next to nothing to do with its ability. The game basically amounts to drawing tiles continuously until you find the ones you want - enemies pop up randomly in random numbers (you roll a d6 dice to see how many show up) so difficulty is also very variable. Rating might change with more plays (up or down) and with expansions.


(6/28/16) Edit: Rating Changed from 6 to 7

Played with expansions and it fixed some of the problems I had with the base game. The draw and survive mechanic reminded me of Ghost Stories - but unlike Ghost Stories, the abilities of the locations are rather underwhelming. This is why I found AL's expansions help make the game more interesting. 

I like how the expansions made enemy tokens/dungeon decisions more thinky - "do I need a quest coin, spoils, or trade it in for some of the new advantage tokens?"

-I appreciated the spells deck, but wish it wasn't so random
-The extra cards to all the decks made them a lot more interesting to go through (especially mounts and relics)

Another problem I had with the core game was that the only semi-reliable way to mitigate the randomness of the dice was with destiny tokens. Tokens which are rather difficulty to get back if you used them all up! The expansions made using destiny tokens a lot more viable with the Mana Wells and Destiny Advantage where you can regain your spent destiny tokens.

The addition of the extra bases made traveling less of a chore and I rather enjoy how the Companion tokens helped further mitigate the luck of the dice.

The disaster deck made the board more interactive and that's never a bad thing!

The only complaint I still have is that the enemies are dull. They all require either 3 or 4 successes to beat and aside from their icon, they're all rather the same. I rather they had some abilities to differentiate them as well as varying hit points to correspond with the difficulty of their abilities. For example: 
Saxons = Army (3HP): For every 2 Saxons alive at the end of a turn, place 1 additional Saxon in a Realm tile
Dragons (2HP) = Firebreath: Surrounding realm tiles does 1 wound upon movement 
Magic = Teleportation: Move 2 realm tiles per movement
etc. etc.

Overall, I can't see myself playing the base game by itself again. The expansions definitely made the game more playable.

A terrible rule book makes this bad game truly awful, awful in so many ways I'm not willing to commit the time to write them all in these comments. Bought it on claims it was similar to Arkham Horror..it is nothing like AH, a game I love.  This game has little to none of AH's depth, silly thematic connections to base Arthurian lore (this game will NOT educate you as the designers claim), mediocre components....etc.  It feels like a game designed by novices.  There are few reviews right now. I suspect this game will get slammed if and when other popular reviewers get their hooks into it.  Dead Viking was being nice with the prototype.

I wish there were more games with the same theme and quality of art as this one. I really wanted to like it but it just didn't really do it for me. I felt that I did not have enough control over the fights as there are not many ways to manipulate the dice. As a result the game was too heavily reliant on luck. This is not a problem when the theme is well implemented like Eldritch Horror, but this one felt too abstract.

First of all, the rulebook is absolutely horrendous. Not only is it disjointed, but it also fails to address common concerns and situations. Much of the experience this game provides was ruined by the rulebook.

Also, it's a brutally hard game. Within a couple turns of exploration, the land will be overflowing with enemies - sometimes including multiple dragons who can damage you if you even go near them. Combat is similar to Eldritch horror, but there are many more enemies and your heroes can't soak up nearly as much damage.

I lose a lot in Eldritch Horror, but I always enjoy the experience. This, to me, has a different feel. It becomes too hopeless too soon and through no fault of the players (you scout a tile and suddenly  a few (or one time eight!) new enemies are introduced to the land). On top of that, they often create penalties until they are eliminated.  

It's not all bad though. The art is amazing, and the actual writing is very good as well. The stories and characters are evocative and definitely do justice to the legends. 

I really wanted to like this game. I could probably enjoy it if I house-rule it to death, but I honestly would rather play games I enjoy out-of-the-box.

After owning and playing this game for a few months now, this game loses alot. The 3 scenerios that came in the base game get stale, every weapons card is just a different variation of use X intead of Y when fighting Z enemy. Gets bland, and boring. Maybe if there was some way to buy expansions for it without kickstarting there new projects, but you cant.

While I have currently rated it a 7.5, a few things would make me boost this to a 9.  It needs a new rulebook (which is in the works).  Even with the proposed new rules, this game generates a lot of questions.  Second, it desperately needs to include the terrain types associated with various tiles you are looking for to be listed on all the cards.  The cards need to tell you that Hadrian's Wall is a mountain tile that can only be found by scouting from a single direction.  If those changes were made, I'd probably rate this a 9.0 based on a couple of plays.  It's very easy to solo with four characters because the character playmats are organized and don't undergo lots of changes.  With the deluxe edition there looks to be an enormous amount of replayability, but you'll get some mileage out of just the base game.  In closing, I think the game is unplayable without a Plano organizer or some similar way to quickly find tokens; with one, the game plays pretty smoothly.  It's a clever design.  I can't wait for the second edition.

Solid game which we really wanted to love after backing it on KS, especially because Lynnvander does right by their backers.

This is a game for those who are not too worried about winning or losing but play for the enjoyment of the story that unfolds as you journey through the game.  The variability in how the cards, the die and tiles play out makes the game fresh and exciting everytime but also means that sometimes you will be doomed from the start despite your best efforts.  The game does run long - the first game took 4hrs, subsequent games have been 2-3 hrs... but as soon as i finish a game i want to play again i enjoy it so much.  Can't wait to include the expansion content.  Lets see how it holds up to more plays.  Game is probably more a 7 but the enjoyment i get out of it elevates it to a 9 for me.

Aside from a rather harsh difficultly curve, Albion's Legacy design emphasizes a large number of somewhat independent victory mechanics, none of which feel engaging on their own.

Terrible, terrible rules (both version 1 and 2) made the game far too confusing and we gave up. Don't know that we'll ever try it again. 2nd edition in bound for free to backers so maybe it'll get another chance then. UPDATE: I've been repeatedly harassed by the creators to change my rating, even when I've emailed them trying to find out where the additional Kickstarter content is that's two years late. They ignore my questions and repeatedly ask I change the rating.

In my opinion much better adventure game than Eldritch Horror. And theme is more friendly to more people due to King Arthur's world. Now everyone knows what Cthulhu is, but most people know arthurian legends. Modular map that is built during gameplay adds more variety. Also characters are different and quiet a bunch of great, thematic scenarios. Game is medium-hard to win for me. More players = easier game. With 3 it is really hard to win, but after winning we feel completed and satisfied!

An ok game. If you like coops, and like the pressure you feel when a roll can end the game, that's a good game.

I find it quite hard, not at first, when you start playing it's all nice and beautiful until you realize Camelot has been flooded with enemies, and you need like 10 succesfull (dificult) rolls to defeat them ...

Like the exploration aspect of it.

Not a unique, neither the best game, but a game worth trying.

This was a huge surprise for me. Ever since I played Arkham Horror back in late 2011/early 2012, I've been looking for a game to come along that tries to tackle a subject in a similar manner. Albion's Legacy is that game. What Arkham did for Lovecraft, Albion's Legacy does for the knights of Camelot.

It isn't without its faults though. The rule book is pretty awful. It's almost completely backwards of most rule books, but if you just decide to dive in and look up things as they crop up, it works pretty well. There is also a large amount of luck here. Even more so than in Arkham Horror, I would say. This is closer to Darkest Night, where dice rolls played a pretty major role in how good or bad your game would go. Albion's Legacy isn't quite as dice dependent, but if you're not a fan of chucking a lot of dice for different things, stay far away from this game.

What Albion's Legacy does bring to the table is an engrossing theme, a varied experience, and a world that's ripe for exploration. In many ways, this feels like Shadows Over Camelot if it was a straight-up cooperative game, with some strong influences from Arkham Horror. This is a game where you can really do a large variety of things to work towards winning. Not only that, but this game is brutally difficult. I can definitely see how it would be possible to win, but it's going to be a tough time all the way through.

This game was just such a breath of fresh air for me. I took a chance on it, despite the fact that it has little to no buzz at all, and I can honestly say that it's one of the best games I've played in quite some time. If you like thematic, cooperative, experience games, do yourself a favor and check this one out. It's not the easiest game to learn, but what it offers is one of the most flavorful gaming experiences out there.

I was not prepared for the game length... 5 players took us 5 hours to complete.  We found ourselves in a decent amount of situations where the rule book did not explain.  A lot of pieces and management of items/spells/character abilities without any means or tools to manage those aspects.  The game felt fiddly and there were turns that were lack luster in options, creating the feeling of being skipped.  

The theme was there and I feel as though it could use some ironing out and this rating would be much higher.  But as it is, this game really wasn't for me.

This is quite a devilishly hard coop game, which is very nice. The thematic feel, storytelling and lore are also great. However, this game is poorly balanced for the number of players (optimal with 4) and definitely deserves the award for the most incomplete rulebook ever. You'll basically have to invent rules as you play because the rules don't clarify half of the situations you are expecting to obviously encounter. Poor job on that end... but the re-edit should hopefully fix that.

Kickstarted this and I really wanted to like it because this is one of my favorite themes and is cooperative.  I just felt everything was too samey.  All of the heroes had similar stat's (roll 3 or 4 dice per skill test), their weapons had the same effects, the enemies didn't feel different, and neither did the quests.  

I quickly grew tired of how the enemies spawned as I was trying to locate the tiles I needed for the scenario.  Just felt tedious.  Might have been more fun if I had anyone else to play it with.  But as a solo game it was too samey and didn't offer a lot of choices that I enjoyed making.  Bummer.

Have to say though that the designers were incredibly gracious with their offer of a free second edition to backers because they didn't like how the first version came out.

There are some great ideas here, and fantastic artwork where featured, but too much is dependent on pure luck and the cards are too bland. Also, the retail edition lacks too much of the content found in the Kickstarter Deluxe.

thematic, nice Locations and characters, good ideas, but terrible mechanic, not really a game, more like storytelling, learning much about Arthur, Merlin, Gawain, Parceval and the like

Rulebook sucks - pictures are too small which makes trying to figure out what everything is difficult.  Too many components are not defined, mechanisms not explained, and no examples.  I simply do not find this type of coop game interesting anymore.  Tiles randomly show up and with random creatures popping up across tiles.  You simply run around to tiles and then roll the dice and hope you roll lucky.  Yes, there are a few modifiers that let you roll extra dice or reroll one or more die, but this does not translate to many satisfying tactical decisions.  You keep this up until the location tiles you are waiting for get flipped so game length and difficulty varies quite a bit.  The theme of the quests and locations gets lost because all you try to do is roll 3 or 4 of something so it does not really matter that much.  The locations also feel the same although they have different abilities, but there is no link between abilities and the location itself.  Yes, the game can be challenging, but that did not mean it was interesting.  Box size is overkill for how much is actually in the box.

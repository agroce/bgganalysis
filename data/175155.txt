RATING: 6
Very mixed views on this one: 
+ Great action selection mechanism 
+ Great asymmetrical factions. Definitely felt like I was playing Orks :) 
+ Like that the game promotes attacking 
+ Good range of upgrade options, I like the action upgrades in particular and would've liked to see more
+ Combat is interesting on paper... 
- ...but bloated and protracted in practice
- Warp storms also good on paper but in practice drag out the game and feel a bit random
- Strangely claustrophobic for a space game
- Downtime is awful in 4p, especially when combat is involved 
- Overall felt too long for the play experience. Feels like it takes forever to accomplish anything 

Would play again (particularly at 3p) but honestly I'd just go the whole hog and play TI3 given the choice.

Loved the theme and order dispatch mechanics.
The initial setup, with objective placement is very clever.
Battle resolution is a bit too tedious for my taste but I can live with it.

My only real concern is the lack of "come from behind" options.  Once you get punched, it is hard to get back on your feet.

What I like: the 40K universe, the order system, the warp storms, the objectives, the building of the board (its a mini game in itself), the combat system, the tech tree in upgrading your race, the battle deck and upgrading it, the minis, the tiles (excepting the wavy font).  It is a long game for 4, but at 3 players this is simply a great war game.  A shame it is going OOP would have loved Necron/Tyranid expansions.

RATING: 8
This game has some really interesting mechanics, particularly the order stack and deck building for combat resolution (in an area control game!). All four sets of faction cards / abilities feel very true to the 40k universe factions, and the game overall is loads of fun. I'm disappointed that this game never got an expansion before the FFG/GW split, because there's a ton of interesting design space here.

It's also very nice to have an epic, thematic conflict game where the best player count is 3 (imo). At this point I own something in that style for every common player count, so the option to play my favorite type of game is always available!

(area control; 3x)

RATING: 4
The game is well designed and very thematic I admit. Plus the production quality is exceptional. The major downside though is the downtime between turns whenever there is a battle or battles. They can take a while and usually only the results really effects you. After a few even I was walking away from the table to look at the other games being played. As a 2 player game I think it is very good but not so for me with more and if you are playing with more, do not use the beginner setup as the objectives are very evenly spread and it seems to become basically 2 2player games happening on the same board.

FAVOURITE GAME - an epic space battle game based on the Warhammer universe. You control one of four space races tyring to collect the number of flags necessary (depending on the number of players) to win. It is very action packed, as there is almost no time to build up a stronghold. You have to explore and conquer, and sometimes let go of previously owned bases. The combat system is very good, as at the end not the remaining number of unit counts, but their morale. So it is possible to win a combat by having only one unit with a bigger morale value, rather than many units with lower values. The planning phase is borrowed from the Starcraft boardgame: stacking the actions, an whoever has the top action goes first.

RATING: 7
A light weight wargame that is hyped by all the nice plastic minis it comes with. 

Great production value. Components are top notch. Game play is actually very basic. The combat rounds uses a recurring damage and defence value that is hard for the loosing side to catch up with only combat cards. So it's like taking 3 damage followed by 4 damage then 5 damage (or more). Thus making warfare a stacking of hits and shields that could be counted upon on consecutive rounds. 

In that sense, it favours the stronger attacks or defences right from round 1. It does not have the wild randomness of Axis and Allies type of combat resolution. 

The cards do alter the combat effects and other resolution to maintain a fresh twist to each game. 

Overall, a very simple wargame that is tight and light to play in an evening. Recommended as a beginner wargame of choice.

Wow! I picked this up intending to fill a combat heavy itch for two players and this one just blew me away. A mix of computer RTS, chess, and strategic dice and card based combat just sits perfect for me. Asymmetric factions make this an even bigger blast. A game full of deep strategy and surprises. Already a memorable experience. I'm very glad I picked this up before it disappeared from shelves forever.

3 losses, 0 wins and I love it!

I'd love to try with higher player counts but that'll make for a long night. Granted we're not the fastest players.

Well see how I feel after some more plays though. It's just such a long game for us, we can never get it to the table.

At 1 1/2 hours per player, this game is difficult to get to the table.  Best with four players and I'd rather not play it with less than three players.  If it played faster or was more accessible (for these reasons) then I'd rate it even higher.

The worst about this game are the extremely annoying, inconvenient and unclear rules. The rulebook is a joke and you will probably constantly need it to still find no clear answer to your questions. This alone makes the game unplayable / unenjoyable for me.
It seems devoid of any way to properly plan or strategize for longer terms. 
It is unplayable / not enjoyable with 2 players - he who has the upper hand in resources after the first 1-2 turns will always win. The game is basically over after turn 3-4, but to actually win it would still take ages (or at least it would fell like that - for both). 
It also takes too long with more players - the time commitment itself isn´t the problem for me, but for what this game has to offer it should be over waaaay faster. It just gets boring and stale, and potentially frustrating for players that get torn apart for weird reasons like because the semi random storms just force all other players to attack him.
I really dislike it, so I gave it the by far worst rating of any game I own/rated. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great tactical battling game with more strategy than most. Feels a bit like Kemet meets Eclipse. Rules are very well written and made the first play relatively straightforward. 

The comment about the sculpts is ridiculous. They are some of the best board game sculpts out there, and the game never felt crowded, IMO. 

This is a perfect 2-3 player game; 4 might be a bit too long for people who aren't into longer games, but I'd give a 4P game a shot. 

Highly recommended for those who are into a deeper tactical combat game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
While this is definitely a 2 player game with multiplayer aspirations, it is mostly because the battle style can leave the uninvolved players hanging for 5-10 minutes for the battle to resolve. Some people would say "perfect, Snack time" or "great, I am going to hit the restroom" the fact that such things happen at least twice per 30 minutes for the 3 hr game....better just to keep it at 2 with alternate races to play.

RATING: 7
Fantasy Flight's big boxes full of cards and plastic have a record with me that I'd politely describe as uneven.  Too often  I have found the game inside overwrought.  So Forbidden Stars was a pleasant surprise in its straightforwardness and lack of bloat.  The time-consuming combat system has drawn some criticism, but it can present some  interesting decisions for those involved.  In addition, the cards that make combat more than chucking a bucket of dice, do generate one of the trickier judgements in this game, which is how much effort you should put into building your deck.  

Elsewhere, everything from the simple economy to the order placement to the warp storms and the objectives buried in opponents' territory works well with an absolute minimum of fiddle.  It feels as though every decision is significant, right from the initial placement of modular boards (strategic tip: don't allow anybody a chain of planets with no intervening voids  to all the objectives they need).  Forbidden Stars is a long game, but it remains engrossing to the end.  As noted by SirHandsome in his comments, the objectives work pretty well to solve the problem of endless back and forth squabbles, but do lead to piling on any faction that falls behind.  

Production quality is to the usual good FFG standards.  The artwork will appeal rather more to teenage boys than it does to me.  I'm not convinced by the two rule books, which revive bad memories of Brass.  Do yourself a favour and print off Universal Head's summary.

WOW WOW WOW, this is an EPIC game of space combat!

While I have great love for the background, the models and components are beautiful, and the game mechanics seem to have potential, in practice the game is just not that enjoyable. 

The combat is kludgy and rarely seems "fair" in its outcome, and the races are unbalanced. It is far easier to win by infiltrating in a few cultists than by grand strategy or by developing your tech tree, which seems odd for a game about grand strategy and awesome space technology.

Played many times with different player counts, feel like I need to try it again, OVER and OVER. GREAT in all configurations! Lots to think about, but has a little something for everyone. Amazing mix of strategy and tactics and keeps you tense throughout. I love the feel I get from this game. Will my preprogrammed actions work out this turn? Will somebody block me? Did I place the tokens in correct order? Do I use my precious order for my own gain or do I "waste" it to block my opponent? Ugh! So much to think about. Just love it!
One of the longest games I own and yet one I have played the most! Miniatures definitely help a lot to empathise with the little guys that are about to die! (or survive). Very emotional game for me :)

Was my most anticipated game for 2015 thus far, though it might not prove the very best. That's not to put it down, because Forbidden Stars does an excellent job of capturing the conquest of the WAR40K universe with some intuitive, streamlined mechanics that make turn order and combat pretty easy to manage. Components are superb, the four races feel quite unique from one another, and it does use a lot of tried and true mechanics from other FFG games, but puts a few new spins on them to refresh them. Struggle over objectives, gather resources, build your forces. The game will really shine once they put out another 2 factions for more options.

Welcome to Logistics: The Game.  In Logistics, you have a narrow window to somehow move your troops to a place that matters.  We've made this as restrictive and annoying as possible, including a semi-random wall that shows up to ruin your 3 turns of planning.  Turn order matters immensely, and some players will get to go last more often than others.  Truly, the pinnacle of game design.

Initial Impression: This is another FFG game, so of course the artwork, cardboard components, and minis will be high quality and dripping with theme. This game centers around the mission tokens and having to give your mission tokens to your opponents ensures that every player will interact with each other. Brilliant idea. Planets and sectors have limited value other than for production so ownership will be constantly changing. The real heart of this game is in the order tokens. Which ones to place, where to place them, timing of the placement, and the order to place them. Lots of difficult decisions that make for a brain burning game. The combat system is thematic and can be simply grasped after the first few tries. Being card assisted, it also provides many decisions, while not significantly slowing the game down. I'm eager to try this game again and possibly experiment with another one of the 4 asymmetrically thematic races included in the game.

I was a bit frustrated about the restrictions in the game : there were a lot of things you couldn't do and for everything you wanted to do there was a fullfillment that wasn't right. Fighting is complex and unsure : very hard to determine your chances. Not my cup of tea.

Things I like:
-Secret Order Token System (similar to A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, but better IMO)
-Works very well with 2 players
-Engaging Dice/Card Combat System that keeps luck from playing too large a roll in battles
-Combat Card "deck building" system
-Modular Board
-Unique factions
-Awesome components
-Stellar Artwork (pun intended)

-I'm not playing it right now
-I won't be able to play it tomorrow
-I won't be able to play it the day after that . . . .

Pro's:

1) Massive fan of the warhammer universe, so the theme pretty much speaks to me directly which makes be biased towards liking the game.
2) The aesthetics of the game are fantastic: The miniatures, the board tiles themselves, the little plastic city, factory and bastion pieces. Seeing your empire taking up sectors of space makes you feel warm and fuzzy.
3) The combat system and the deck upgrade system feels great when you pull it off. This is probably my favourite combat system I have thus far encountered in any game despite the length it can take to play.
4) Each faction feels unique and through the cards and miniatures captures the style of playing them pretty damn well.
5) Epic scale is as Warhammer 40K should be.

Con's:

1) The game is long, and certainly playing a 4 player game pretty much requires a full afternoon.
2) I really hope to see some more factions come out. Tau, Tyranids and Necrons even though this now seems unlikely because of licensing (edit: definitely not happening now).
3) I wish the ultramarines were replaced with a more generic Imperium faction, with some reference to the imperial guard, the adeptus mechanicus, the administratum, ecclesiarchy and the rest of the poorly run bureaucratic elements within the imperium of man.
4) I really dislike the fantasy flight split rulebook thing.

Thematic and heavy, Forbidden Stars is a good game that somehow feels like it was afraid of being even better: as a matter of fact, when playing it you can feel the rich Warhammer 40.000 theme simply drifting on the surface rather than actually dripping into every rule, action or choice as you’d expect from such a game.

For instance, accomplishing an objective is rather dry theme-wise and has no real in-game effect besides three lines of flavor text only that most players don’t even care to read (or listen to, when you try to read that piece of text aloud).

Nonetheless, I like this game although it still feels kinda rough.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
This IS the most epic space game to come out since TI:3.  I really like the order token mechanism in this one, which they just stole from Starcraft.  I also actually really enjoy the combat, although I can image if you are not involved in the combat, it could be boring to follow along (only played 2p so far).  I think once I get this played with more players I will actually enjoy it more, however this will end up being like War of the ring & Game Of Thrones, where they are big epic games that I really enjoy, but I only get to play this once a year.  This one is a keeper, and I actually am really excited to see where they take this game with expansions.

After one play (need to play more!) I have mixed feelings. The expansion seems too slow. There are to many moves required to move from one place to another. The battle system is flawed. I like the card/dice mix, the deck building part and the three round of battle with only single roll. But the routing is strange. It's hard to kill a unit because first they are being routed which in fact means nothing because they can be un-routed with cards and that practically means that the damage you dealt was just for nothing. 

Too long and too unintuitive (especially the combat).

This game is such a good design. The combat is the most interesting and fun of any game I've played. Suggestions that long combat is boring for the other players turns out to be not a problem: combat is fascinating to follow and there's so much to think about no-one is ever bored. The only weakness of the game is the limited player count and the impossibility of future expansions.

RATING: 5.5
Pros: Great asymmetrical abilities. Quick predictable battle system. Unit abilites have a huge impact on the game. All units are useful. Great victory condition.

Cons: Extreme runaway leader problem. Player elimination and often early. Turn order determines your strategy and often decides the winner of a battle. Imbalanced starting positions. Obvious upgrade paths. Battles usually go the predetermined way and take too long for that. The loser of a battle is greatly punished.

This started at 9/10 but fell quickly.

Pretty much Starcraft on steroids. Love the amount of miniatures that comes with this game and combat is just plain fun so long as you buy new tech/research. You really have to plan out a strategy in this game and if your a competitive player you will absolutely love this game.

It's really fun building new bases and unlocking new tiers of units to use. Probably the only thing we didn't like about this game is the warp field. It's still hard to believe that a single game piece can cause such a ruckus! Lots of fun.

Es un juego de lucha y conquista espacial.. entre cuatro razas del mundo de warhammer. LAs razas dan características asimétricas. Gana el jugado que primero consiegue tres objetivos (que son mundos que conquistar en el tablero).

El sistema de acción es oculto. El jugador dispone de ocho fichas de acción de las cuales en cada turno se juegan cuatro, boca abajo en el tablero.. los otros jugadores pueden jugar acciones sobre las tuyas, con lo que hay puteo e interacción... hay que planificar bien las cosas.

Está bastante bien. LA experiencia del juego es similar al starcraft, pero lo han simplificado bastante en duración y complejidad.

Great 4x game. Although lots of mechanics, they integrated together smoothly and aside from some combat nuances, this seemingly very heavy game didn't take too much to learn. Satisfying sense of tech progression, nice card mechanic for building your combat deck, and entertaining combat. Our game didn't take tooo long, but the biggest knock I can see is this game has the potential to drag on well past its welcome. We played 3-player and I'm glad we didn't play 4-player, as some tables in our club were still playing this at 5 1/2 hours when our group finally packed it in (after completing this and playing a game of IKI).

A fascinating mixture between a euro and a wargame with many interesting mechanics like worker placement and deck building, both something you usually won´t find in wargames. Beautiful components, great minis. Fantastic artwork. Still, after one play I feel like the game plays a little static and drags on a little too long. Maybe that reflects the spirit of the Warhammer battles though: Decades of battle with millions of deaths on every side and no real change in the overall situation at all  :)

That is one hell of a game.
Although I sold my Warhammer 40k army I'm still a big fan of the lore and the universe.

The combat system is what drew me to that game and after I played it there is much more that makes me want it. The order tokens are a pretty cool sytem with the stack building. Really really cool.

The clever action selection with order tokens and gorgeous components can't make up for the combat resolution which slows things to a grinding halt. It reeks of typical FFG in-house design: overwrought and needlessly complicated. At the core is a decent wargame that, if the combat rules were streamlined, could play in an hour or so--but the usual FFG treatment has turned it into a bloated mess.

Okay so first off complaint about presentation: when we were going through the rules to this game as soon as I saw the forge icon beneath certain units I was like "Wow, that's hard to notice. I bet we'll forget about it a lot." Guess who had to call her second game a wash because her opponent forgot he had to pay forge tokens to build certain units and illegally built a bunch and started blocking her? THIS GIRL. WHOOO. Dammit, I would have won too.

That ONE complaint aside the rest of the presentation is good. Like, really good. I got this game on the heels of replaying TI3 for the first time in years and remembering just how bad the presentation was for so many things in TI3. Here everything (except the stupid forge icons!) feels smooth and simple - not a hair out of place.

Finally, someone has made a thematic area control space game that I, a lover of all things clean and elegant, can get down with. This finally feels like the game that will bridge the gap between myself and certain friends who balk at the idea of playing anything that doesn't have a million chits, 800 pages of rules, and flavor text on every single component.

And while this game doesn't have all of those things - the rules are long, but fairly straightforward. There's no flavor text, but the art and naming conventions make the theme very clear, and there are [i]just enough[/i] chits to get the job done [i]and not one more[/i]. But this game brings everything that is good about American games to the table and cuts out all of the fat normally associated with that school of design.

The flow of the game is dead simple, but strategically things are not quite so clear-cut. There's a lot to consider with every one of your actions, and thanks to the hidden information of the order tokens every choice feels tough and taxing (in a good way). It's not [i]exactly[/i] bluffing, but there's a level of mind games here I really appreciate that feels lacking in similar games.

I'm going to go off on a tangent about something a little weird here, but I think the Dominate action and asset tokens exemplify just what's so special about this game. It's a fairly minor feature, but this is [i]exactly[/i] the kind of tertiary system so many of these kinds of games get wrong. Instead of being somewhat divorced from the core gameplay loop, it's integrated right with everything else. And instead of just bringing a ton of content to the game to internalize and account for, it's the bare minimum amount for maximum effect. Every single one of these tokens feels useful in the core gameplay, and I think the whole thing speaks to just how well thought out this game is. Instead of including yet another system just for the simulation aspect, even the smallest of mechanics feels relevant and important.

Also worth pointing out that the combat here is much better than the standard roll-to-resolve system so many thematic conquest games employ. You can still feel pretty restricted by the dice though. Most cards are about manipulating the dice in some way, but it's entirely possible to roll such that your current hand of cards is useless, which sucks when it happens but the upgrade system gives you lots of opportunities to decide on which ways you're more reliant on your dice and which you're not. So yeah, bad luck can screw you and that feels as crappy as ever but in this game it feels more like isolated incidents, as you generally feel responsible for the deck choices you make and how that impacts your rolls.

That said... I'm not exactly sure what would cause one to choose different combat upgrades in different games. They don't feel particularly situational, so I could see just taking the same path over and over again. It sounds weird to say but I think Kemet's power tiles just had so many different combinations that while you can certainly just go the same route in that game every time, it wasn't as tempting to do so as it is here (at least, it didn't become so rote so quickly) - and added to that that other players can snatch up the tiles you want before you get them, etc., Kemet's upgrade system might actually feel more dynamic even though there's less random factors feeding into it.

I'm not sure I have a lot of complaints with the design of the game per se, but there are certain things I find strategically difficult about the game. Moreso than others in the area-control-by-conquest genre. For one, it can be difficult to keep in mind the hard limit of 8 dice per combat encounter, and accordingly tailor the units you take into battle. For example, in my second game I screwed myself by routinely bringing around enough guys to give me 8 dice right off the bat... with a handful of cards that each added a (now useless) die. This is the sort of thing it's going to take repeated plays to figure out, because the whole thing feels a bit unintuitive.

All in all, I'm pleased to finally have a thoroughly American game that I genuinely enjoy for those hangouts with my American gaming buddies - who previously found Kemet too Euro, Nexus Ops too simple. With Forbidden Stars I think FFG has taken a firm step forward in design and I now have high hopes for their future endeavors.

Update: Finally got in a 3p game of this after playing our first few games exclusively at 2p. I like 3p a little better, but still great with two!

Lots to like here. The command tokens add a great tense strategic decisions.

RATING: 9
Rated 8 after one play with three players. I was curious how similar this was to StarCraft. StarCraft is a game I really like that is also hard to get to the table. 

All said and done, I'd say these two games are 60% similar. The order placement and resolution is the same, but in Forbidden Stars, there's less crazy diversity of units, and combat is noticeably different. No more skirmishes. Instead, players play a sequence of three cards, with each card affecting damage, shields and morale.

I might like this game even better than StarCraft. Every order is useful, every building is useful, every tech is useful. The only legit knock is that combat does take a little while, but I suspect that gets faster with familiarity. 

It doesn't replace StarCraft because of the differences in player count, but it does scratch the same itch.

Update: three plays, and still loving this. Two of those, however, have been two player with the Orcs, and both resulted in a early crushing win for the orc player. I suspect the game is better balanced than that! But it does highlight that a two player game can end pretty abruptly. Curious if three players is actually my favorite count because of checks and balances between players.

Update: I've now played this 7 times and I can say that I greatly enjoy it as a two player and three player game. I've yet to play four players but hope to have the time to do so. I sold off StarCraft and I do not miss it. This game, for me, is a strictly better option. One of my favorite combat games.

Four 3-player games each 2-2.5 hours without rushing and yet it feels epic. The objectives mean it often feels close unlike a lot of similar games where the winner is known half way through a six hour game. There is a lot of scope for cunning play and those plays are rewarded. 

Plays well with three but there are traditional multiplayer wargame issues that in some turns it goes two against one leaving one player way behind in resource generation and the ability to generate new units. The limit of four orders per turn does help with this. Catching up when you fall behind is possible. Two payer is very good

Very heavy but thematic and involved space wargame.  

Pros: The last-in-first-out mechanic for activating systems is a unique twist and adds a lot of strategy.   Most of the plastic miniatures look great.   Lots of chances to outsmart your opponent by thwarting their plans, definitely rewards being able to react and re-plan on the fly.

Cons: Looooong especially if you have players prone to analysis paralysis.  Combat is lengthy and complicated for a game that technically hosts up to 4, I can't imagine playing this with more than 2.   The "base unit" miniatures are extremely disappointing - instead of a Space Marine, Ork Boy, or Eldar Guardian, you get a banner that represents a unit.   Really pales in comparison to the Falcon/Land Raider/etc. minis, which look great.

Every step of this game involves a gut wrenching decision. How you build the map, where you start your units, where you put orders, what order you place them, what order you execute them - IF you execute them, or use them to draw events to, critically, control warp storms. Speaking of, I love how the warp storms change the lay of the land. It feels like an entirely different map after they move every time. What you're worried about changes drastically from round to round because of it. And the combat is spectacular. It's such an interesting combat. The fact that you could get crushed but still win the battle via morale is SO interesting. This is a very well thought out and designed game. It's darn near perfect.

A solid 4x strategy game. The 40k theme fits extremely well and it's a shame we wont see an expansion. I've played it 2v2 and 3v3 which I think is the sweet spot. I don't think I would want to play 4v4 because of the fact it tends to drag with downtime during combat that you're not participating in.
The combat is a fantastic mix of dice and cards which I love. and typical fantasy flight polish means it looks fantastic on the table as well.

A worthy continuation of [gameid=22827] and [gameid=38796]. Those games have very similar mechanics, but that one fixes all glitches and flaws of its predecessors. Unfortunately, a choice of units is poor - both mentioned games are better in implementing own available units into a game. Many units are represented by banners while FFG could just make plastic figures of units instead - e.g. a single Space Marine would look much better, and it would improve gaming experience (empathizing theme etc.). Besides, you are limited to 4 players only. Well, there is a room for an improvement in possible expansions...

It's still a very good strategy game with any number of players. It can take a while, especially if you have new players to teach the rules to them, but you won't regret any time spent with it. Overall high quality of all elements - cards, figures, pictures etc. can be also appreciated, but it does not justify its price - you could expect more with it. That's why a final rating is a bit lower than it could be.

After only one play, wow, this game shines. Things I was worried about - combat fiddliness, the backwards deployment of orders - those have been expelled.  The game plays smoothly, provides a lot of fun tension, interaction and has amazing expansion potential.  It really forces you to think about what your opponents are doing, and the best way to order your tokens to accomplish your goals.  I expect I will be playing this one for years to come.

Update: makes me sad that FFG will never release an expansion for this. Maybe there will be a re-theme down the road post GW divorce.

This is a rapid-firing bolter filled with awesomeness for me.
Forbidden Stars delivers epic scale, disencourages turtling, looks awesome and feels just very very 40k to me as a longtime fan of the Universe.
Cool turn-order system, very tense combat, nice card drafting and upgrading, well balanced between the races without feeling samey. 
Only potential problem is the fact, that the combat-system can lead to downtime for the third and fourth player because of how involved it is.

RATING: 9
This is a great 4 player strategy game; thematic, asymmetric yet well balanced, has good mechanics without being too complicated...once you play it through, of course. Not an area control or conquest game (although it looks like one!), Forbidden Stars is won by capturing objectives. It favors a balance between force building and aggressive play, and is not hobbled by a tendency to turtle to victory. FS is, after 7 months, still my go to long strategy game. Better than GoT; nothing like Agricola, Power Grid, or Terra Mystica (my other favs). Yeah, it may take hours, but the time literally flied by. 

There are four main components to the game: initial board creation, grand strategy/order placement, unit and deck building, and combat. All are important, with about equal weighting; board creation may be closer to 1/3 of the game.

Board creation is highly important, but fairly easy for players with a game or two to keep reasonably balanced. It does have the potential to really favor one player or another. This can create a need for an almost a semi-cooperative stop the leader play style, which I find interesting, but which most players probably see as a learning experience! It is a great mini game. Some complaint might be reasonably made about having such an important win-factor determined right at the start of a 4 hour session; I find that it is worth the experience and added replay value, especially with players who know enough not to make an egregious error (or who are smart enough to take advice!)

Combat is a -lot- of fun; dice are there, but their use is well designed and they do not make/break a combat round after the fact. How they roll is (usually) much less important than how well prepared your forces are and how well you play your cards.

Drawbacks: 
This can be a long game, especially with new players. I've clocked 9 hours with 4 players including explanation. After a game or two, I think most groups get into a 4-6 hour grove. Experienced players can hammer out a 4 player in about 3 hours. Note that 3 player is usually much faster; maybe 2-3 hours. Still a good game, but lacks some of the depth. 2 player is quick, but a very different game.

The rules can be a bit obtuse, with some of the details and edge cases being non-obvious. Definitely read the FAQs, official and non-official. Usually these are not game breaking;  I've known one large gaming group to play with broken rules (allowing dice replacement when already at 8 dice) and still have great games, for months. Balance suffered a bit. 

There may never be an expansion...

RATING: 10
A truly outstanding game with a tons of interaction, atmosphere and tactical depth. Excellent and original combat system that gives many choices and strategies, bluffing and anticipating your opponent's moves and a bit of randomness(although partly controlled) which is great because you can never fully calculate your attacks. Four assymetrical factions and every of them is really different from each other and requires different approach towards them.

Game is heavily focused on combat and somehow forces players to play agressively and gain their objectives; you aren't going to win by sitting and turtling, gathering your units at one place. Economy is reduced to minimal, but it's not overly simplistic(1 main resource and three additional). Therefore I wouldn't say it's a 4X game as there is expansion and extermination, but little exploitation and no exploration. It's a strategy game with combat being a main thing and a pretty big dose of atmosphere. I'm not a fan of WH40K but still I feel the faction I'm playing; I believe being a fan of the universe only makes that feel stronger.

There are very few issues and I can point out two: it is a long game as it goes on for six hours(if there are four players), the downtime could be irritating too because combat might take even five to ten minutes and only two players participate at the same time. Of course it might be interesting for others to watch(and even to notice choices and moves players make in certain situations) but it might be as well just time to make yourself a tea. The second issue is that the first player is often facing a little disadvantage during the map construction process as it is possible to place the tiles the way that it is quite easy to just attack on the first turn and gain the objective. There's a thing such as a warp storm that can delay the attack, but still... Yet those problems are cosmetic and don't affect my whole impression at all. The game is amazing and I recommend it for everyone who enjoys grand space strategy games and is not afraid by the length and heaviness(in some cases your brain may be likely to explode :D).

Great combination of elements.
Completely asymmetric factions, interesting decisions to make through all aspects of the game (order placement, order resolution, unit/structure/upgrade purchases, great combat system)

Plenty of room for varied and creative strategies and approaches to the game, and all packed into a reasonable playing time.

Different at all player counts, the game excels as a strategy game with its two part system of planning and operations phase. Competing with players on when to drop order tokens on top of systems and having to plan ahead since tokens get resolved from the top down. Combine that with the tight resource management in order to play buildings, units, and deck build into stronger combat cards makes this game a highly strategic affair.

There is a bit of an advantage to last player but that will only come more into play once players understand how to maximize their race's effectiveness.

RATING: 7.5
Brilliant, beautiful, thematic! But oh so long! And, as I've come to notice with FFG-games as of recently, the manual, while nicely designed is painfully unclear about some things and looking them up is a pain even though there is an actual alphabetically ordered rules manual.

Still love it to pieces... but my god it can drag on; especially with 4 people. While the fights you aren't involved in are interesting to watch in the beginning, as the game goes on they become more and more like long pauses that (for me) break the flow of the game for the players not involved.

Still need to play a few games to rate it; I suppose it's somewhere between a 9 and a 7

Update:
Still like it very much, still horribly long game, but I do love it... If it wasnt for the rules. Oh god, the horror. SO very unclear so very unnecessarily complicated to the point where people begin staring at their mobiles because the other two players need 10 minutes to find something in the rulebook. AT LEAST -1 point for the rules, especially the manual

I just love the combat mechanism and the victory conditions that help make this game an even and enjoyable affair with 3 players. I haven't played it enough to rate it further, but it feels very fresh and unique. The last game I played I had tremendous bad luck. As SM I rolled 4 Eagles in 46 dice throws over several turns and got mauled by Chaos. Normally this would really put me off a game but the fact that it didn't this time means this game is special to me.

One full game in, results were positive. Very tight game with tough decisions and game play that can be as intense as it is frustrating, but the frustration is very much deliberate. With clear objectives and no hidden information on the board, it doesn't take long for the action to start. There's a bit of luck with the warps to keep things from getting too predictable, too.

I think this game has pretty much fired Twilight Imperium for me.

- Solid game-play

This is THE WH40k game I've been waiting for!!! It has so much to offer in terms of strategy and tactics, not to mention the diversity of races. And the theme...oh it is drenched in it! Cant praise it enough, its definitely my groups favorite.
Now it can get a bit long, but if you go into it knowing this, its not a problem (in fact, it can be a plus). There is a lot of talk of downtime, and personally, i didn't see that as a issue. Its usually just about a couple of minutes, not a 15 min snooze fest. And besides, i find it interesting to watch, let alone get a peek at the opposing players tactics. The only other thing you should do, and that just maybe a thing with my group, is that the players really need to get the know the rules before the first playthrough, or it will get a bit confusing. 
Once you get it down though(2-3 plays MAX) the battles get intense and new strategies and tactics seem to open. I have never played the same race twice in the same way. The fun factor is trough the ROOF! I can see this hitting the table often and for manny years to come   

After two years --> we play this game on a regular basis, almost exclusively, every week. It still kicks ass !!!

Love it. Love it, love it, love it, love it, love it. 

I really liked this game. A lot. Which surprised me as I usually haven't got the time of day for Games Workshop, but kudos to FFG - they've taken the best of GW, filtered out the rubbish and created something remarkable.

I'm not going to discuss the mechanics particularly. There are far better writers on here who've already done that, but suffice to say I didn't find it anywhere near as arcane as I expected. 

First off, everything about the game screams quality. You know that sinking feeling you get when you open the box and see crappy, badly printed little chits and cheap dice? Imagine the exact opposite of that. I was quietly blown away by the production values of this, not just for the models but the boards, the cards and, yes, the rulebook too. 

The game is fun. That should be a given in this hobby, but I frequently find myself slogging through a game without actually enjoying it, just going through the motions. It's tense, engrossing, funny at times and almost never dull. The nature of order positioning means that there is only limited downtime, and it's unpredictable at that. Grumbles about combat are, I've found, a little misplaced, and certainly I've not seen any of the '10 minute combat rounds' that have been  reported elsewhere. A bit of mental arithmetic is required, but it's more important to one-mississippi the card play - analysis paralysis will KILL the vibe of this game.

The races are asymmetrical which makes for a generally fun and often balanced game, although I find the Spess Mehreens to be perhaps slightly underwhelming. They probably need a more competent player than myself though.

The only slight grumble I'd have is the space combat, which is rather unfulfilling and doesn't feel at all like fleets clashing in space, but I guess that's probably just me. I'd have preferred something like a deck of dedicated fleet action cards or similar, but maybe that will be ironed out later on.

Overall thoughts? I like it. Rather a lot. Bravo FFG. Bravo.

The game itself is basic and pretty good, but there are 2 major problems for me:

1) No home world that you want or have to keep.  Basically its nomads in space
2) The combat is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo drawn out.  It takes too long and bores everyone else who is stuck watching.  

Sadly, this game is out of print so there's no chance for an expansion.

Offers many interesting choices through a fascinating turn-sequence mechanic in which player actions are based upon the placing of face down tokens. The hidden information allows for bluffs, feints, blocking and all manner of short/long term military planning. Oftentimes your grand designs will not come to fruition because of this very mechanic, however you are all sitting in the same chaotic space boat, dealing with an ever-changing landscape. The game is tense and engaging but suffers from significant down-time in games with more than 2 players when resolving combat. It's epic but reigned in by the objective tokens which players need to claim to win - another brilliant design choice which gives this game it's own identity, setting it apart from similarly themed fare such as Eclipse or Twilight Imperium.

Wow, what a great game. A delightful blend of theme and mechanics, lots to think about strategically and loads of story being told in an emergent way, growing out of the gameplay and player choices. The combat is particularly good: no mindless dice chucker, it's a really good combination of a limited amount of luck, lots of on your feet thinking, some bluffing and reading your opponent, but all ultimately dependant on how well you've been training and preparing your forces for battle in previous rounds. Really looking forward to diving deep into this game, it has a huge amount of replay potential.

Clever package which takes most of the pain out of wargaming and gives plenty of options. The overall strategies for each side match the lore pretty well and it looks beautiful. However the combat system felt rather lack lust, quite complex and few really interesting decisions. Equally but reducing the consequences for losing a battle and generally neutering the damage potential of ultra aggressive play the game loses a lot of tension. Not sure on this one yet, its good but is it great?

RATING: 5
I want to rate this higher, but I can't.  It is so nicely-produced that I am compelled to want to like it.  Great sculpts, lots of colors and terrific art design just makes this game really pop on the table.

But some things don't do well when they pop - among these things are tires, balloons, and Forbidden Stars.  The biggest hang-up I have with this game is how overwrought and drawn-out combat is.  With no rules for tactical retreat or avoiding the fight, your choices are either a) die horribly or b) suffer three rounds of ridiculously slow and tedious combat every. Single. Time. You. Fight. And possibly die horribly in the process.

In a game where the goal is to collect objective tokens that are ostentatiously placed beneath or near your opponents for obvious reasons, you ought to have a much tighter combat mechanism than this.  I am no stranger to long games and I quite enjoy some of them - Rex and TI3 among them; two games that have combat pacing that makes so much more sense than what we see in Forbidden Stars.

Part of the issue is just crapola design, but part of it is also exacerbated by the fact that your unit variation isn't all that varied.  Sure, build up to your highest-tier by wasting precious planet space with cities, but your reward is a slightly-beefier version of your lowest unit.  The only reason you might want to consider doing this is to save on the space economy since planets can only hold a certain amount of plastic, BUT the cost of doing so is basically taking a knife to your own heels and slashing about willy-nilly on the promise that maybe, just maybe you'll roll well enough with more chances to survive to the next round of (tedious... did I say tedious?) combat.

If this game was meant to capture the glory of the Starcraft boardgame (that I've never played), I hate to think of what that game actually played like since I hear it's even more tedious than this one.

I'm glad I played it once so that I won't feel bad about never playing it again.

Look, I really like Starcraft TBG, but Forbidden Stars just improves that system so much. It is true that with more than two players, combats in which you are not involved can feel a bit long, but you can solve that by paying attention as a spectator! The rest of the game is super tight and everything just works. The combat mechanics are a masterpiece IMHO, and I also love the Storms and how they block passage between sectors of the galaxy. To me, this is the new generation of classic FFG ameritrash. I hope they bring us some more titles like this one.

Forbidden Stars has me full of mixed feelings. The order mechanism is incredible; orders are played from the bottom up, but are resolved top down, which emphasizes careful planning, timing, and cunning. The combat resolution is notable as well, as a series of well played combat cards will go a long way in mitigating the luck of the roll, and turning the tides of battle. Unfortunately, this combat comes at a cost; time, and the same can be said for most aspects of the game. Forbidden Stars is undeniably well designed and fun to play, but it is plagued by length. I don't find its strengths to warrant several hours of play, but for those interested in an intriguing space opera war game, Forbidden Stars is likely the best.

Love this game. Everything about it is awesome; theme, mechanics, components, all excellent.

The planning phase is a delight and the decisions and strategy keep you engaged, the unknown information and bluffing that go along adds a really nice element.

Seeing your plans unfold or dashed is excellent fun and the combat mechanics are the best I've seen.

My only complaint would be the length expect at least 4 hours with 3 or more players. Even longer for the first play.

English. One of the PVP-games out there. All the factions feel and play very different. Learning the game will take a bit and the rulebook is very long. That said, while there is a lot complexity in decisions and options, the rules aren´t hat complex. The only thing missing to make that game a 10 would be a nice expansion with more factions, more cards, more types of planets and more units for the excisting factions. Sadly this will never happen.

I like the objective-based victory condition and the last-in-first-out command system, and even the combat/upgrade elements. However, Forbidden Stars is just too lengthy when played with four players, especially considering the random elements brought in by the event cards.

Not a replacement to ti:3 as many think it is.  The game has a nice game of thrones feel to it with rpg elements, (you level up your deck to fight with), along with dudes on a map and orders given.  Then chuck a few dice and all is well.  It is a pricy game with a long play time, but I found usage in it many times since release.  If you can part with the cash then it's worth the addition to your collection.

I really enjoyed this one and I am looking forward to playing again soon.

The game is reminiscent of starcaft but without the run away leader problem, as your combat deck is limited to 10 cards only so each upgrade you put in means you have to remove something else.

I really like the set up as there is actually quite a lot of strategy to placement of planets and the objective markers on them, if you simple slap them down wily-nily you will have quite a difficult time, collecting all your markers. 

I really like that it is not an area control game in that, yes whilst you hold a planet you can get resources from it but all you really need to do is hold it for a turn get your marker and then move on. 

The warpstorms change the conditions of the map is really nice as you can guarantee that next turn you can get where you want to go, but i also like that each faction has its own way of -sortof- mitigating and bypassing the warp storms

Each faction played quite differently and as the chaos player I could already see at least 3 different ways to build the combat deck for different styles of play.

I'm a fan of the stacking rule and the moving barriers, although I would have liked it if you got to play all of the cards you drew at the end, you just got to decide which order, and it would go around the circle multiple times.  This would incentivize buying upgrade cards.

First play with 4 players went incredibly smooth regarding the complexity of the game. High AP spike in turn 1 since everyone had to familiarize with his race and rules and plot a plan. But from turn 2 on AP was barely a topic. Although I achieved a early victory in turn 4, everybody was very entertained and required a rematch asap without me asking for feedback.

My last 4 players game was grand. Picked up 1st objective in Turn 1 easily but the other players started to hinder me from Turn 2 on, delaying token nr 2 until turn 3. Turn 4 I really screwed up since I got seriously picked on and misplaced some orders reducing my forces considerably. But still in turn 6 I started two attacks on objective worlds with minor forces and won. If the Eldar player wouldn't have been able to orbital strike one of those two world into oblivion I would have been victorious although being almost wiped out.

This game is very forgiving at least in multiplayer games. there are very often opportunities to recover from big losses or screwups.

I so much thought that I was going to enjoy this one more than I did. There's a lot in here to be admired. I love the artwork and love the detail on the minis. The game also feels quite different from anything else I've played (though I've heard FS borrows some key ideas from Starcraft). It has the general Ameritrash wargame stuff: dice, attack and defense numbers, different purchase prices for units, etc. How cards are handled is pretty nifty too. I like being able to upgrade my deck to my play style (aggressive, defensive, or other). I think combat "felt" interesting for the most part, but it really does seem like you can reliably guess how combat is going to go and a couple of times you might even decide to skip combat just to save time. Because neither faction had the ability to retreat before or during combat (I believe one of the factions can?) there was never any need to play out combat as you were always all-or-nothing when it came to unit commitment. Things felt tense in the game, but I didn't see anything more to do than build forces and then send them to war. For all the asymmetry, each player had the same goals and had to do the same thing to reach those goals (again: buy units and get into battles you could reliably win).  The worst parts about the game are those you already know about: incredible downtime, a gamey Action activation system that didn't really feel thematic, and a game that feels like a slog without feeling all-together epic.  I'm blown away by the asymmetry of the Combat cards and Events in the game.  That stuff is fantastic! But I feel games like this do better with more than 2 players (though it does work fine with 2) but I think people like this most with 2 because downtime with even 3 would be a bit painful (4 would be crazy, unless you're all experienced with making the game move). When it comes to games like these, I like 3+ players because while you're being offensive, you have to keep minding your neighbours. With 2-player battle games, it's always a back-and-forth game of attrition until a player finally breaks. I also doubt 2-player games end often without the tie-break and winning on "most planets" or "most units" feels a little anti-climatic.  So, overall, a fascinating game and one that very much held my interest and does try to do things differently in good areas when it comes to Ameritrash space battle games.  But this is a game that you need to a) love; and b) play a lot of in order to get the best experience. I neither feel (A) or wish to do (B) so I think that's it for me an Forbidden Stars.

Thoughts after one play with 3 players:
An interesting game with lots of components and lots of fun things to do. Many strategic decitions and nice combos. It is alot to take in and takes alot of time. I would like to play it again with a different faction when I have a whole day to play it. And when all players know how to play the game. 


Great action placement. You place a hidden action on a tile and those actions pile up so that only the top action (last placed) can be played first. Some very strategic decitions and some bluffing can be made here, that is great fun but can also cause analysis paralysis. 

Deck building aspect is good but you dont get do improve your deck that much during the game. 

Battles take way too long and most battles have an obvious result. You attack in places you know you will win. The battle decide only if you can manage to kill off on opponent unit before dying. A couple of important battles are faught that are fun, but most are not. 

- Can take too long time to play, our game took 6h and we where not even finished. 

To be continued...

Very good area control, resource management, battling game. FFG have streamlined the old rules and improved the mechanics - something they seem to be getting better at all the time.

All the bits are typically good quality, functional and plentiful - the minis are excellent. Very good.

Only small negative is the amount of play time - games take a long time and players not involved in battles can be left hanging around. Probably best 3 or 4 player, but more timely as a 2 player.

One major problem with this game is how long each battle takes. It should be much shorter, with 1 card played (and discarded) rather than 3 that can be reused each battle. The current system bores the players and triples game duration. Other than this, it's a very good game.

Excellent game.  The mechanic of placing orders on top of each other leads to a lot of interesting situations, as you find yourself trying to work your turn backwards, and there is a lot of room to sabotage your opponents turn.  Combat is varied and fun and the game board and models look beautiful.

This is a great "Starcraft-light", but better in every way.  The speed of play, the simplicity but lethality of combat, and the straightforward mechanisms allow the focus to remain on the strategic elements.  And, the shortness of the gameplay keeps the game much more interesting than Starcraft (which would drag after 3 hours).  Definitely looking forward to playing again.

Overall fine game, but small mistakes can have huge impacts and if you want to avoid this, AP is the price you have to pay. The cards (combat and warp) that have a huge impact, too, are a bit to random for my taste, while I'm ok with the use of the dice.

Maybe to much back and forth. The whole game is about fighting even though it may not look that way at first glance.

RATING: 5
Played twice. Both games were not much fun.

I think the combat idea is super clever, with cards and dice linking. But it's surrounded by this sludge of problem after problem that removes the fun. Chief among these is the downtime; what do I do when players spend 10 minutes doing a fight that one player will obviously win, and doesn't impact me at all?

There is also a fiddly-ness that isn't necessary. Some cards have a gun symbol, or a gun symbol on a square, or a gun symbol in a circle, written into its comments. This feels like thoroughly inelegant game design, and while I know how they work, I can't help but feel that this is one of the many, many, dragging areas.

If disaster strikes you, or another player makes great gains, you can reasonably confidently predict the outcome of the game. And then you'll have to play for another 2 hours. There is no incentive to defend properly if you're just helping decide which of 2 other players will win.

The final one I will mention here, is that you have SO MANY COOL MINIATURES in front of you. Look! You've got big nasty ships, and crazy ground units, and... you'll practically never see them. Getting 2 cities on the board requires a certain confidence of territories and income that isn't often feasible until 2/3rds the way through. The majority, or the entirety, of the game is fought with basic units. It's just not as cool as it feels it should be when you're lining up your potential army. 

I like 4X and big games. But I have not had fun with Forbidden Stars after giving it 2 fair tries, so I will not be playing it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Even though other games Ive played are rated as heavier, this game definitely seems to be the heaviest thing Ive played
 There are a lot of sub-rules and exceptions... As the games teacher this was pretty difficult to teach and control. That being said, once it started to flow, it got a lot better and I can see why it has recieved praise. The combat mechanics are awesome. You really can get very tactical with it.

The planning phase is a little mind bending because of the stacking orders mechanic. This lead to a lot of "woops, I meant to put this other token down" moments. However, again, this seems to be a strength of the game, not a weakness. Once you can wrap your head around the system it works very well and is quite strategic.

Overall... This is an 8 for me with the potential to go higher. I expect it will be a better experience!

Here we go again...Why waste time stealing ship designs from Warhammer 40K and making the sculpts so large that the map looks crowded? Can't they freaking buy a license and make a strategic Battlestar Galactica game or old School Star trek game with a big bag of "Axis and Allies" scale starships? The sculpts are hedious!

And you should have at least 6 types of ships and that bag should have at least 300 total ships ( better 400). You can get decent detail in 1.5 inch ships and .5 inch fighters

This is a great 'conquest' game.  I like the way you win by claiming objectives.

The components are great.

I can see some resemblance to Runewars but this one suits me much better - it's faster & more fluid, & doesn't have hero interruptions.

I like it with 2 or 3 players.

Game is stunning, and very good. I would wholeheartedly suggested it every time if not for some of the obvious (as in: I knew them before I bought FS) cons. 

FS are long both in setting up and gameplay. They are best with 4 players that are willing to play for few hours. Although rules are easy after 1-2 rounds, explaining them is quite hard (I feel like best way to learn a game is to play 1-2 turns and start over once everyone understands how game plays).

Despite that I really hope to play this game a lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This should, on the face of it, be a great game.  The board is dynamic (the rules introduce or cut off routes through space); it's fast-paced as players race around the board collecting objectives; although there are lots of fights there's no benefit to eliminating another player (indeed, it's probably harmful as it'll slow you down) so generally player elimination isn't an issue.  The combat mechanic is very clever; it's card-based, and your deck can be upgraded as the game progresses.  For some reason it just didn't inspire me when we played it though.  I think it suffers from the same player snarkiness issue that I've become used to with TI3; people just seemed to get very irritable with each other while playing it.  I would play it again, but I'd have to be in the right mood.

Great representation of large scale planning and battles in the 40k universe. Initial tile placement is reminiscent of placing terrain in the wargame and troop placement and deployment is key.

Hidden actions and the way that actions stack also allow for some bluffing and being able to deny your opponent from being able to do what they want to do in the order they wanted to initially.

Controlling both the space battles and ground combat really makes you feel like you're in charge of an entire force and have all that at your disposal.

Good quality models, not Games Workshop level of good but still quite good.

With more than 2 players combat can be a bit slow for the player not participating but after a couple of plays things speed up quite a bit. Plays really well at all player counts except for the downtime during combat at times.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2015)

At last I got to play this fabled game. My desire to play it was rather low because I really never enjoyed StarCraft: The Board Game in the first place, however Forbidden Stars is a better game in my book, but not by much.

The rules are easy to grasp, but there are many of them, the game explanation can take from 30 to 45 minutes. The game components are awesome as is usual from FFG. The miniatures are very detailed and they look great on the table. The game´s art is also very good.

I love space´s themes, but as I have never played (or read the books), Warhammer´s theme is a bit lost on me, however I kind of enjoy it.

We played with the basic setup, I think the game would be much more interesting if the players build the board. I’m not sure how this works rules wise, but the downside I see is that in this way a player can easily get screwed from the beginning, while conversely, a player can have a strong position. This is only my gut feeling, I will play this way next time to see for myself. With the basic setup, the game forces you to fight with all the players, I like this.

The deckbuilding aspect of the game is streamlined (I really liked it), now you can at most have 10 cards in your deck, so it is very probably that you will draw you most powerful cards in each combat. Each faction has different cards and the combat part is very fun for the combatants, not so much for the other people. So far, this is my biggest complaint about the game, the combat is very slow, so the downtime for the players out of the combat is very high. I was bored when I wasn’t involved in a combat.

I’m not sure how I feel about the storms, they can help you or hinder you in chaotic ways. You can plan to attack next turn but if a player wants to screw you he can move the critical storm near your target. The order system works very well. Love the asymmetric factions.

Play time is high, at least 4 hours with fast players with lots of downtime.

Bottom line, I would have loved this game when I began my gaming career, now, my desire to play it is low. Forbidden Stars has a lot of downtime (the worst sin a game can commit in my book) making it boring at times. I would play Twilight Imperium 3rd edition any day over Forbidden Stars, but this kind of game interest me less and less over time. It is way too long for what it offers.

Current Rating: 5.0
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
2-4 players. This is a space "epic" set in the Warhammer 40k universe. Easily my favorite game of all time. Asymmetric factions trying to control objectives (specific areas of the board). Hidden actions like in Game of Thrones and a very cool combat system of dice, augmented by a deck of combat cards. There is a meta-game within the game in the setup of the board itself where players choose where to place map tiles and enemy objectives. On the longer side, especially with new players, but it's worth it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
One play only. Very good secret order placement / space 4X game. Warhammer themed minis are up to Fantasy Flight's usual standard and give the game strong visual appeal on the table but there's a decent game underneath the eye candy.

Slightly overwrought graphics on the cards could do with being toned down a little but that's a minor nit-pick.

Not a particularly short game, so if you've been beaten down early it could feel like a long way home.....

Played a demo at the recent UK Games Expo.  While not a full game play-through it gave me enough of an experience to believe this is going to be a ton of fun.  The order system and combat are really good (can see inspiration from both Runewars and Starcraft here) and I'm really excited to see where FFG take it.

Looking forward to more...

UPDATE:

Ok, played the game twice now (both 2 players using the default set-up).  Great game and flows a lot faster once you understand the Order and Battle systems.  I'm not sure how long it'll take with 4 (probably a long time) and I'd be slightly concerned with downtime during a Battle.  However, for 2~3 players, it's right up there.

Not as EPIC as say Runewars but more streamlined and simpler and not the worse for it.

Forbidden Stars is a superb tactical combat game. The depth of the design offers enough options to keep strategic planning at the forefront without overwhelming the player with choices. This balanced approach is augmented by the asymmetrical powers of each faction, which add rich theme and flavor to the game. The timing and placement of order tokens is a fantastic framework for executing actions. The most impressive design choice to me is the combat engine. The combination of dice, a customizable deck of cards, the critical function of morale, and the wide array of units make for a very satisfying combat experience. The cache of high-quality miniatures and stunning artwork put on the finishing touches. A phenomenal space combat game!

RATING: 3
Somewhere along the line, FFG lost its mojo for this sort of game.  Forbidden Stars reduces the vast scope of interstellar war to a couple rag tag warbands squabbling over a few front yards on the galactic block and reduces 40 millennia of endless war into an 8 hour day at the office.  The overwrought combat system of Horus Heresy returns for an encore and once again drives players to waste a considerable amount of the game playing out one sided fights; in a four hour game, I think we had one engagement where the outcome was in genuine doubt.

RATING: 6
It's "fine" and I'd play it again if pace improved (a 4p pace of an hour-plus a turn for an 8-plus-hour game is not, to me acceptable), but it has a theme I really don't care about and feels like simply a pastiche of other FFG games. The comparison to Starcraft--which I haven't played--is, I'm willing to accept, most apt, but the traces of other games are there as well--map building akin to Twilight Imperium; system activation sort of, again, like TI; orders systems found (in different form) in AGoT, Runewars, and Rebellion; combat not entirely dissimilar to that in the third edition of Fury of Dracula and in any case overblown). Again, it's in no way a bad game, the light deck building is kinda nice, and the theme is evoked. It's just a game that is emblematic to me of what I've increasingly come to find tedious about Ameritrash and FFG in particular.

Pros - Excellent action selection mechanism.

Cons - Combat downtime with more than 2 players is unbearable.  Very text heavy leading to very slow learning games.

Conclusion - Fun with 2 players even though its not my style.  If it was 2 player only I'd give it an 8. It's not good at 3 and I would refuse to play with 4 players.

Another one bites the dust. This could've been so amazing. Don't get me wrong, the game is amazing and one of the best of its kind.

Unfortunately another victim of the GW/FFG breakup.

Balancing is great and since its not about holding the areas you just conquered and more about when to know to strike and knock your opponent out it remains tense and interesting. 

Yes - combat can slow you down in a four player game. I personally like to watch my enemies dish out their combats, though, since it gives me insight on their decks and strategies which in return changes how I attack them. If you can't stand this probably not your type of game.

RATING: 5
There are reasons to want to like Forbidden Stars, and that's even if you don't count the usual stylish FFG components and neat mechanized and fleet minis (beside which the infantry pieces look somewhat disappointingly abstract). There's a reasonably epic dudes-on-a-space-map experience with an unobtrusive economic element, non-trivial combat and faction-specific toolboxes for players to explore. As in many of these games where you sequence orders and abilities, correlating numbers and conditions, hoping to have what you need when you need it so you can get more, familiarity and precise planning are greatly rewarded. Consequently playing time may be about two hours per player. With two players you lose some of the epicness, the turn order sensitivity of the order system is maximized, success is a result purely of manipulating and matching tactical subsystems, and there's a good chance that early swings of fortune will snowball. With three or four players there are more strategic considerations but playing time may be considered overlong. It's more difficult to appreciate the intricacies of combat when you're not involved, especially in cases where the outcome seems a foregone conclusion. I still need to see how it works with a custom map layout, since it may mean you are less likely to reach the final turns. Or maybe the two-player game is really cool when you get the hang of it. I wouldn't mind trying to play four for a whole day but I'm not sure others would be up for it.

2017-06-15 - 9.5 - Awesome game! I'm glad that I finally managed to play it. Now it will be easier to get to the table. We played with three for about 3,5 hours, I guess (+ 30 minutes for the rules), but it didn't feel that long. The game was engaging all the time, provided many interesting decisions and excitement in combat. It's the best game I played of a kind, where you get some resources, spend them on units or upgrades and fight on a map. Much, much better than Cry Havoc, Cyclades, Mare Nostrum, not to mention Kemet.
What I just realized - there is nothing I didn't like about this game!

It scratches the Twilight itch in a pinch. I know it doesn't have much in the way of the same mechanics, but as far as a space combat game, it does the trick. I would consider this a great complement to Twilight in that I can play this with 2-3 people, while I only play Twilight with 4 or more. Great game. I really enjoyed my first couple of plays (even though Eldar seemed over powered with their domination of the skies, probably because of a lack of experience on my part). Excited for some new races!

Definitely the best space war game ever played. The factions are greatly designed, asymmetric units powers and setup. Incredible turn flow, it doesn't take long and resolution can be quick if all players are concentrated.
Movement rules are balanced and combat is a hell of a fun to play! But unfortunately, it slows downs the game if playing with more than two.

- Best played with 2

This games have flaws. Like missing nations because they lost license. Or the length of the game combined with the fact, that it has absurd amount of downtime.

There is much more better games than this.

Based on reviews and videos so far giving this an 8.  I have this game pre-ordered with matching deck boxes. 

I nickname this game "Forgotten Stars". 

Pros:
+ Looks very accessible and streamlined in terms of a large scale game (if there is such a thing)
+ Minimal sprawl and fiddly for a game so huge.
+ MOST Plastic pieces and other components look amaze-b@11$



Cons:
- FFG news releases make the rule book look like it was scribbled in between coffee breaks. 
- Banners instead of troop figurines (This was probably a GW requirement to keep people from getting "cheap" marine/orc minis. 
- Flag units are cheap and bend/break

Lenght is a bit of an issue, so it probably won't hit the table all the time. Other than that, it's an amazing game. Could do with a few more races, but that won't be happening since FFG lost GW's license.

Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same – to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is another sprawling classic by FFG with a good bit of neat looking minis. The game itself is fairly streamlined until you hit combat. Each of the four factions play quite differently. Combat is interesting but a bit convoluted (it is FFG after all!). I expect about an hour per person to play once everyone knows the game. Until then, I expect it will take much longer closer to 2 per player.

Right from opening the box for the first time you can tell this game has been produced with a lot of love. The components are amazing and the art work is beautiful. 

The game has a great set up mechanic, giving everyone the chance to get involved in the creation of your universe. The different factions are all balanced well and feel very different to each other. They also play just how you would expect them too, if you have experience with the 40K universe.

I would always be up for a game of Forbidden Stars.

after round 6  i got whole idea how to plan strategies and of course its late for this game .
i like how  each factions characteristics close to its original universe
like its damn hard to kill ORC`s   and how CHAOS SPACE MARINE`s faction is tricky.

be noted  : losing in this game hurts a lot  because this game is all about planing to conquer your friends bases and watching to lose your home base hurts a lot.
one of best area control games i played ever.
this game takes about 3 hour for 3 player

I'm told this is a lot like StarCraft but I haven't played it to compare. This game is good except for the covering up of players commands. If you don't have a command on top of a stack you are stuck so placing your orders last is a big, big advantage and likewise placing first gets you run over a lot. If this were done a different way I would rate it a lot better.

Great strategy combat oriented game, excellent combat mechanics, asymmetric races, simple to play difficult to master, masterfully designed in a way that only significant mechanics are included in the game (there are no mechanics that you use occasionally - each mechanic is crucial part of the game).

RATING: 9
Gameplay:

+ solid, elegant and straight forward mechanics
+ no unnecessary rules that feel misplaced, i.e. everything feels right
+ very engaging and interesting combat mechanics, almost like a card dueling game. the combat system is superb. it requires bluffing, outthinking, planning, correct timing. victory does not solely depend on who has the most or more powerful units or who is more lucky.
+ very cool upgrade system, almost like a deck building game
+ a lot of confrontation; active and aggressive play is necessary to collect your objectives
+ non-stop action
+ very exciting and engaging from beginning till end

- a bit of downtime in a 3 or 4 player game, during combat, but quite honestly all such games have that issue, so I don't even see it as one


Components:

+ high quality components, and a lot of cool stuff
+ fantastic artwork on cards and board tiles
+ very detailed, cool looking and unique miniatures for each faction with standies!
+ a big box
+ a learn-to-play book and a reference guide, which makes learning the rules easier and more accessible
+ the rules are very well written and structured
+ some zipper bags...

- ...but not enough zipper bags for all tokens
- no box insert (as usual for FFG)

One of those rare games that hit the sweet spot between pleasant tactile aesthetics, solid rules and excellent replayability. and feel like a polished 2nd edition right on their first print run. Forbidden Stars scales well from 2 to 4 players, is accessible to beginners but remains interesting for veterans, and provides a combat resolution mechanism that actually feels satisfying (as opposed to some other good strategy games where anticipation builds up till armies finally meet and fizzles out almost immediately after throwing some dice around). And my understanding is that due to the legal dispute between Fantasy Flight and Games Workshop, this game won't be available for much longer, so I'm glad my wife picked it up for Christmas.

Current favorite FFA game (other interests Conflict of Heroes, Descent, Imperial Assault, Mage Wars, Star Wars Armada). Fan of the WH40K fiction/fluff/IP (not GWs rule sets).

This game has a lot of interesting mechanics (modular map, warp storms (walls) change map pathing every turn, hidden information in combat and order placement, upgrades for units and actions using 4 card decks, asymmetrical factions). Compared to earlier Risk implementations this is not about getting more territory - instead you chase objective areas which are different for each player. Due to this there's no constant un-fun beating on the weakest player but instead a great mix of constant shifting chaotic and opportunistic battles from the first turn on. Fronts and enemies often change on a per turn basis. If the currently weaker faction doesn't hold any of your objectives anymore, there is little incentive to further attack them/remove them from the game.

FUN: streamlines Starcraft, which is a game I like very much, but don't get to play a lot. Some changes are definite improvements, like faction-specific events and the more direct deckbuilding.

UNIQUE: this game is 80% Starcraft, but the combat resulotion is a quite unique blend of cardplay and dice-rolling. Here the dice stay mostly static after the initial roll and the cards do most of the changing.

NEGATIVES: unfortunately, I like Starcraft more because there the units feel more unique and I much prefer its win-condition on points. I'm also slightly dissapointed that all the streamlining did not result in a faster game, so I don't think I'd choose to play this over Starcraft unless I want to play with one opponent.

This is an incredible 3X game (doesn't really get there all the way, but tries its best). Really glad I picked this one up before it left circulation.

I love Starcraft. This game simply took all the good things from Starcraft and made it worst.

-Combat became more random.
-Faction strategies felt very uni-dimensional with a single plan to play the game.
-The tension in the board is considerably reduced due to the 50% more tiles in play.
-The complete separation of air and ground forces are pretty annoying (reminded me a lot of pre-expansion Runewars heroes.

The plus side, for now, it is more affordable than Starcraft, so if you like the system, it is a considerably cheaper entrypoint. On top of that the unit detail is amazing, and it has great art (normal for the WK40K).

With all the downside, it is very unlikely that I will play this game again, I would just push to play Starcraft.

With the possible exception of the GW produced Space Hulk BG, pretty much the only FFG/GW boardgame that has interested me in the slightest, and that's only as it's a reworking of the excellent Starcraft game / system. Purchased 09/2016 upon termination of the GW/FFG association. While I am currently (permanently) boycotting ALL GW related product due to their draconian business practices, I figure that the royalties on the final printing currently for sale have already been paid for and my purchase will not generate another future printing production run.

New players will need guidance as mistakes are very unforgiving.  Losing order tokens due to not doing things in the proper order is practically suicide.  Upgrading your combat deck is far more important early game than one would assume for a typical world-conquering game.

Early, low-tech nunits tend to drive too much of the action.  It takes too many development cycles to get enough tech and get relevant ocmbat cards in your deck for tech 2+ units.  It's almost like you are better off building one city and jsut sticking to tech 1 upgrades.  

Bastions are ridiculously strong on defense.  Do not attack into a Bastioon unless you have a lot of good combat cards - you will not win these combats and an opponent can conceivably hold with just tech 0 units and a single Bastion.  Not a fan of this.

Warpstorms can be crippling in the early game if they block you off from expanding because you need economy early to do anything.  That means that if you are goign 3rd during the events phase, you get third pick of which warpstorm to move ... this can be horrible for you.

It takes too many resources to go up to tech 2 and make tech 2 units.  Also, in a 3-player game, the possibility of getting two people ruining your orders is extremely high.  This is doubly damning because there is very little to help a player who is behind to come back into the game.  Momentum is huge in this one.

Event cards are very swingy for such a random effect, too.  And having to replace a useful scheme with a useless one is irritating.

The win condition is also clunky.

This game cries out for an expansion that will never happen due to licensing problems. 

Still, as it stands it brings together a really clever order planning system and highly elegant combat. 

Also the first time I encountered FFG's "learn to play" and "rules reference" double rulebook system, which is amazing.

A very nice conquest game, it accomplishes alot  with a very few components in a relatively short amount time compared to similar games. Especially the action selection- and combat system really shines.

The only downside I can think of is that more combat card options would be nice, maybe we will see that in a future expansion.

It's not bad, though the overall feel isn't quite right. The action programming mechanism is interesting, but it doesn't feel very warhammer to me. Warp storms moving about keeps the board feeling fresh at the cost of ruining your plans. I enjoyed the combat, though mostly in how the cards break what is otherwise bland.

Excellent jeu de conquête spatiale, plus rapide et intéressant à deux joueurs. Matériel somptueux (le prix du jeu s'en ressent...).
Les règles sont assez vite assimilées et après quelques parties on peut enfin se concentrer sur la stratégie. Le thème est parfaitement retranscrit (ceci dit je ne connais pas particulièrement l'univers de Warhammer 40K)

RATING: 8
If you are a 40k fan, this game is amazing. Highlights every faction with lore-like abilities and it has that endless war feeling to it. No imperial navy or guard tho..

+ Upgrade mechanism for battle deck. Needs an order to upgrade and resources, but strengthens your combat capabilities with better cards.
+ Order token placement system. Forces you to think ahead and try to outwit you opponent(s).

- 3 and 4 player games there is some downtime for players, who are not participating in combat (combats are always resolved 1 vs 1). This also brings the playtime up as a single combat can take anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes.
- First few games were long (5 to 6 hours), but that will probably come down when players have some experience with the game.

Great steal-the-flag (not area control) sci-fi strategic wargame. Streamlined, quite cool to play, with clean mechanics. Very fun, too, exp. the battle system works truly well: a single dice rolling + cards/resources management. Clever.

A pity that GW beheaded the much-needed pouring rain of expansions (Tyranids, Necrons...).

PLUS, you can use the ships for your inevitable Starfleet Gothic custom fight! :D

Game is in the 8/9 range... but I love the theme, so that brings it to a full 10.

This game has potential.  My only problem with it is that it's a long game that plays over 10 turns and it's hard to recover from a setback.  For example: in my first game I had an encounter with the orcs on turn 2 that wiped out my factory and basically left me irrelevant for the rest of the game.

The game has some great ideas and well-thought out systems, but the pieces don't gel together. I'm not a huge fan of the combat system (more arcane than it needs to be) and the game is too long for an evening. YMMV, but when stacked up against other 4-player strategy titled, it begins to pale.

An area control game, which works great for 2 players and with a Warhammer 40K Theme? I cannot resist this game. Not too ameritrash, strategic decision makes this game my favourite game of all time.

This is a very big game. However, it is "epic" in that it takes time and dedication to play through. Mechanics are simple, design is elegant, and concept is good. I rate it at "6" because I must dedicate time - and player commitment - to the game. However, every game is a story of great wars and victory (or defeat).

Cool game. I am not good at it and get crushed regularly. I tried to turtle a little, which was a bad strategy as you NEED to go out and claim objectives. You don't need to hold them all, just get there and claim them once per game. So launching targeted strikes etc is the way to things done in this game. It's fun, thematic and the combat is unique. Build that combat deck and you'll be unstoppable!

There is too much to this game to give it a bad score BUT there are issues that I have with it.  I am not crazy about the combat.  MANY if not ALL combat goes down to a draw and seem pointless in the end.  They can go long.  Factions seem to be unbalanced.

One word - amazing. I have not played a game with better combat than this. I really like how the cards and units work together to determine the results of a combat. Especially how you can influence the dice to your advantage through rerolls, direct conversion of dice, or spending dice for a temporary boost.

The technology tree allows you to form a long-term strategy and watch how it plays out in practice. This gives the game a lot of replayability as you consider different tech paths.

I also really enjoy the order phase. The order tokens are placed face-down so you can bluff and make your opponent think you are doing something different. They are also resolved in a "last in first out" manner similar to the stack in MTG, which allows for a lot of counterplay.

The game can be played with 2 to 4 players. I think it's best with low player numbers. If you play 4 people there is a lot of downtime.

Forbidden Stars feels like a board game adaptation of an RTS so I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys Starcraft or similar PC games.

This is some gooood combat from FFG. Components and theme are great. The combat is fun and strategic. The biggest issue is some difficulty with the rules and dual rulebook setup, and the fact that if players don't grasp not to hold grudges they WILL lose the game. Otherwise this is a lot of fun, and a rare combat area control game that really sings with 3 players.

I don't know what makes a game 10 out of 10 but I do know that ever since I bought this fantastic game I constantly have to fight the urge to play it whenever a chance to play any game comes along. Furthermore I have never played a game before where I lost every game for 9 games in a row and each and every time I couldn't wait to play it again.
I own quite a few games that are in the Top 50 on BGG but it is a real struggle, a constant battle, to drum up enough enthusiasm for anything else than FS at the moment. I suppose one day I'll reach my maximum enjoyment capacity and move on to other games but right now this game has me hook, line and sinker. Can't wait for the expansions!

RATING: 5
It's too long and overstays it's welcome. For a 4-player game, this has a lot of (somewhat acceptable) downtime.
But, the time it takes to complete a 4-player game of players wanting to win, is way too long. We might as well play TI3, though I'll probably not play that game either, ever again.
Combat as the Orcs and Space marine (which I have played) feels like punching into a pillow and not as aggressive or powerful as I wanted it to feel.

I have played 5ish games now and i will post my first impressions.

+ Battle system is very interesting
+artwork is great
+each faction is very different from the others
+the war field can help turn the tide of battle in a very exciting twist.


- I feel the game is missing a single player mode or new scenarios to make each game different. 
-The game takes way too long, by the end my play group members just want to walk away from the table. 
- down time during other peoples attack phase can be brutal




This game is super fun, I enjoy the theme and the game play,but I cant give it a 10 because its not that great. to be a higher rating it would need some streamlining or a really good expansion with more win conditions, or maybe a legacy component.

RATING: 7
The production level is excellent. The theme is there, but it fades out after a couple of turns. The game is slightly asymmetric, with each race having some different stats and powers. The rules are not really complex, but they take a while to explain. They present no revolutionary mechanisms, I've seen all of this in other games. But they work, they create a tactical and strategic game that starts out simple, but it evolves into something more and more complex during the game.

I think it might excel as a 2 player game, but with more players, issues start to manifest:
-> Way too long, and battles where you're not involved are reeeaaaally long and boring.
-> Too random: if more than 1 player join to attack you, you'll have a very hard time. On the other side, one mistake from another player might allow a third one to win.
-> The frontier movement is really annoying. It will spoil your carefully planned actions once and again; and most of the times your rivals won't even knew they did.

A phenomenally high-quality asymmetrical 2-4 player wargame from Fantasy Flight featuring some truly mind-bogglingly fantastic components!

Although the gameplay itself is fairly straightforward and easy to learn, there is lots of room for tactics strategizing while keeping the benefits and drawbacks of the 4 factions in mind.

My only real criticism is the overly convoluted combat mechanics that tend to really drag when playing with more than 2 players.

Due to the poor combat resolution, the game has been sold.

The 40k version of Chaos in the old world. =)
Very well implemented setting, lots of change from game to game, and scales well. Combat is interesting, and done in a novel way. Love the way you need to move around from systems to capture objectives and defend, no need to stay around for too long in one place. Wonderful minis.
Maybe a bit long for 4 players, and the initial map set-up can hose new players totally, but with experience these problems go away.

Good space conquest game.  I'd heard it was based in some way on Starcraft.  I personally thought Starcraft was rubbish so I wasn't at all interested in getting this.  Played a mate's copy and I've got to say it's good.  Components are excellent too.

Only real drawback is that combat is very drawn out and if you're not involved in the fights then downtime can be quite an issue.

Comment after 1st play. 

Fluff and stuff! Ameritrash at its best... well, almost. Say what you want, but the combat system really is too clunky and creates downtime for those not involved in the fight. More speed and simplicity is what we'd need here. Though, I can imagine that this convoluted system may turn into an asset for experienced players who seek depth and meatiness in Forbidden Stars.

RATING: 6
Rating based on a single, overlong play.

To tell the truth, I am not sure I like dudes on a map. Playing armchair general is just not a narrative that really excites me. Even when playing a confrontational game, I long for a more visceral and inviting scale.

Here, I didn't really feel the epic of the game, or rather, I didn't relate to it on a intimate enough level (not sure it means anything). I couldn't help but feel no relation to the narrative which took place before my eyes. It sure took place, but I felt like I was not invited to (or sucked in) that place. Too bad.

Then, there's the game itself. I only played on the preset map, which is famous for being awful. Well, it was. But nothing in the game, no mechanic, seemed to give birth to a moment that I would want to experience again within a more tolerable overarching narrative and pacing. Well, the order mechanic felt smart, though, but it just didn't coalesce into an exciting experience. I was expecting a lot from the combat mechanic, the tension between morale victory and extermination, the intricate card play, and it fizzled. In theory it seemed up my alley, but in the end, it ended up like another clunk in an overall painfully sluggish cacophony. I was happy to try the asymmetric factions. I ended up playing the Smurfs, which didn't feel exactly exciting. Perhaps the Eldars would have suit my tastes better. I'm not sure I want to find up.

I'm sure I didn't give the game a fair chance. But it just failed to convince me to give it this chance. Perhaps it's a problem of stars not aligning, but I don't feel any trace of hunger to confirm it (the game feeling long). Still, there could be a good game here. It just didn't ring with me enough for me to take the plunge. Perhaps someday so will try this game again. Perhaps the experience will then click into a wonderful epic of blood and tears. But for now, I feel confident in leaving it in the lap of the gods.

I really enjoyed this so far.  It's an epic space conquest game with lots of strategy, upgrades, asymmetrical factions and dice-chucking.  There was lots of agonizing (in a good way) over the best use of your limited actions, material and movement... that's a big plus for me as each person realized how critical every move is.  I don't know much about the Warhammer universe but that didn't stop me from enjoying this.  Everyone else really liked it too.

3 plays - a Fantastic game, with a few fiddly rules that come together once you have your head around them. A different take on "dudes on a map" game, with the tightness of the map (and trying to forge military paths through space) and the focus on objectives (as oppossed to holding area) being the biggest influences on gameplay. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Based on one play: Your objective is to get objectives that are scattered across the board (which can be custom made for variability), so this is a fighting based game, you cannot stay in one location since there are no other objectives and you must find a way to your objectives (you can avoid fighting some time, but it will be slow). The main mechanic is that you place order tokens to activate certain actions, but the fighting is very slow and causes the others to wait around a lot. If you really like games like Starcraft this may appeal to you, otherwise it is not really original and no better (or better yet worse) then other battle based games. And don't expect to be done it two hours, at 4 players think more 4+ hours.

Definitely not the end-all be-all game that it's touted as, but it's a very enjoyable space conflict, dudes on a map type of game. A little bit of resource management, a little bit of conflict and a little bit of deck construction. I would like to try this with the actual setup process instead of just the intro setup rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rating purely as a two player game, have yet to play with anymore players. A gritty, tense and slightly unpredictable strategy game. It encorporates deck building, area control, resource management, bluffing and dice chucking. Even with just two players the battles seemed to drag at times but many were nail bitingly tense. Beautiful components and great quality art.

Whilst expansions will be a welcome addition I think the base game provides a huge amount of bang for your buck and will offer challenges to many players for months and years to come.

update
Played my first 3 player game recently, every decision had meaning, the card play meant battles were closer than they appeared at face value and thats probably why the game took us 6 hours. Also despite battles taking time all players are invested since the nature of the board means that everyone has a vested interest in what is happening. What is their opponent carrying in their hand, how do they use their units and what will they be left with when the dust settles.

My go-to space epic. Even knowing very little about the Warhammer universe does not dissuade me from adoring this game. The factions are varied and interesting. The individual conflict-resolution is deep. Probably best at two or three unless people know what they are getting into with the possible downtime.

1st play of this feels very epic; lots of decisions and planning, pretty heavy on the SYN (Screw Yer Neighbor)scale in a good way.  Combat is innovative but not sold on it yet; was a lot of bouncing off each other's shields and coming down to morale but that might be inexperience.  
  game is LOOOOOONG.  took 5 hours for that 1st game.  should shorten with more plays.  Very fun.

A key problem with this game is that it doesn't feel like a 40K game (especially problematic since it's suppose to be a thematic game). 

Turn order is insanely important, which, as the game plays, feels like a very "gamey" element. Another issue is that play grinds to a halt whenever combat occurs, as it's a bit of a process. 

It's also just quite long to play. Unless you have all day, not worth playing with 4; it has the classic 3-player problems; and, there are some many other great 2 player games..... not sure where this is suppose to fit...

Terrible. Would not recommend.

Perfect game for all GoT fans who cannot find minimum 4 players but don't mind long gameplay, which can be the only negative thing about Forbidden Stars. Cool mechanics, beautiful components, modular and dynamic board and goals pushing players to be offensive in order to win - my new favourite, ex aequo with Game of Thrones.

Now my preferred choice is: 2-3 players: FS, 4+ players: AGOT. Give me expansion!

On paper this game is perfect. The way actions get laid into regions in stacks, and then resolved from top to bottom is great. The lower luck combat system using these asymmetrical thematic cards is great. The different ships and units are really interesting. The way that over the course of the game all four players will have to interact with each other via space punching is great. The way the board changes at the end of each round is great. All of this, and this game fell so flat with my group that we ended the game at the end of round 3. Everyone there loves twilight imperium, yet hated or at best, wasn't very excited by this game. One player complained that he couldn't hold territory, because he had to send his forces around the board collecting his objective tokens. Another player felt that while the combat system was interesting when you were in it, the downtime between turns was way too high if you weren't in it. I'm at a complete loss as to what to do. It's not like combat in Eclipse is so fast.  The group that didn't connect with this game is pretty much the only group I'd bring this game to. To my eye, there wasn't anything wrong with this game, although once we got rolling I don't know that I would have chosen to play this game over eclipse.

9.5 - I may go back and reconsider this but after 5 plays I feel like this is a solid 9.5.  The game is a vicious tug of war with a fair balance of tactics and strategy.  It's probably the heaviest game I currently own and after two back to back games I feel a zen sort of wiped and not burnt out.  I love the setting and the only real complaint I have is the length of play because I suspect a 4 player will drag.  At three players this game is great, but at two this game is simply amazing.

*****
At 4 players the only part that really drags is combat.  Combat isn't really long, but with everything else in the game moving so fluidly and quickly combat drops the momentum.  I still love this game at two and three and I enjoy it at four.

This monstrous game feels like a Frankensteinian amalgam of the core mechanics from Robo Rally, Game of Thrones, Dominion, Risk, Wiz War, and a big bucket of beautiful Games Workshop art for good measure.  
And the oddest thing about it?  It works.  Mostly.

The grand strategy and planning part of the game is magnificent.  Combat however... is slow, unintuitive, and a bit boring.   
I've played this a few times now, with multiple different groups, and combat has never been exciting.

I really enjoy playing this game with my wife.  In the years since she first bought me this game, she has become a lot more competitive skill-wise at this game.  A game has almost a 50-50 chance in going either way with us.  It's not a staple (due to play-time), but one of those games that scratches a specific itch for us.

Recently, a couple of my friends said they were finally willing to read the rule book of a game before playing.  Due to the complexity and gotchas of this game, I'm not willing to teach it to new players (because it would result in "you didn't tell me that" syndrome).  I chose to do this game, and don't regret it.  We had a good time with one of my friends really enjoying it, and the other still willing to try another play (he ended up mis-understanding some core rules during turn execution too late to take the moves back, which really brought his enjoyment down).

Favorite aspects:
Token placement on the map (bluffing) phase - This is a mechanic I haven't really seen used much in many of the games I play, but it works so well I'm surprised other games haven't taken it up.
Models - The plastic in this game is top notch.  I really love the feel of playing with them as the theme is so intertwined with the mechanics.  It's just wonderful how great the quality is for a board game.

Pros:
Very much like the build system to get resources and unlock abilities to build bigger better units using command requirements.
Battle system - I really enjoy the battle system where you use and build on a deck of cards.  It's like you're playing both a board game and a deck builder in one.  This would have been part of the favorite aspects category, but I feel the battles will cause a ton of down-time for other players when playing with 3 and 4 players in a game.
I originally didn't like the rule book setup, but as time wore on, I actually see the justification.  When we dug this game up after a couple of years having it shelved, the quick-play rule book was pretty easy to follow and we only needed to reference the rules reference a couple of times.

Cons:
Too complicated for a lot of players.
There is down time in a 3+ player game.  I find that down-time really tends to make some people in my group tune out and therefore not have a good time playing the game.  I don't recommend playing with over 3 players.
A lot of rules are not intuitive compared to similar games, which can result in unhappy players and makes it really hard to teach.

A brilliant design(4X-wargame hybrid?) that feels great at the  two-player count.  You don't have to be a Warhammer fan to feel the gut-wrenching agony of losing your troops on an obscure, alien planet. The rules are well written, but some concepts are counter intuitive at first--especially combat, which is satisfying and well thought out. This game has character and has a unique look and feel. Really shines for two players and packs a war-game wallop into an interesting and unique asymmetrical contest between factions. Rating based on x2 player experience.

One of the best hidden orders of strategic and tactical warfare that strikes a good balance between building up you economy while creating a compelling imperative to expand fight other players (turtling will lose you the game). The science fiction and 40K theme comes through strongly through its tech building mechanics via deck building, upgrading of units and on top of it all, having Asymmetric factions. One of the best game that I played of this genre that has all the best elements I like in such a game.

The only criticism I can find would be the downtime to fight the battles could be abit long for the watching players.

RATING: 8
Im „Warhammer“-Universum angesiedelt, ist „Forbidden Stars“ ein Science-Fiction-Wargame für zwei bis vier Personen; für eine Partie dürfen ca. drei Stunden veranschlagt werden. Gegenstand des Spiels ist der Krieg zwischen bis zu vier Fraktionen mit spürbar unterschiedlichen Einheiten (Space Marines, Chaos Space Marines, Orks und Eldar) bzw. deren notwendig zu Konflikten führendes Bemühen, eingangs des Spiels und für alle Teilnehmer sichtbar festgelegte Planeten zu erobern. Jede Spielrunde ist dreigeteilt: Am Anfang legen die Spieler reihum und verdeckt Marker auf das Spielbrett bzw. in Planetensysteme, in die das modulare Spielbrett unterteilt ist. Jeder Marker verweist auf einen der vier Typen von Aktionen, die der Spieler durchführen möchte. In der mittleren Phase werden diese Aktionen – sie reichen vom Erwerb von Karten, mit denen die Kampffertigkeiten verbessert werden, über die Ausbeutung von Bodenschätzen bis zur Bewegung von Einheiten und dem Kampf mit den Gegnern – dann ausgeführt, wo dem Timing eine wichtige Rolle zukommt. Die Schlussphase, in der Zufallsereignisse abgehandelt werden, erlaubt u.a. auch die Auffrischung angeschlagener Truppen. Besonderen Spaß machen die Kämpfe, die mithilfe eines innovativen Systems ausgetragen werden: Bei Kampfbeginn würfelt jede der beiden Parteien eine Anzahl spezieller Würfel – sie zeigen Symbole für Treffer, für Schaden verhindernde Schilde und für die Moral -, die abhängt von der Kampfstärke aller beteiligten Einheiten. Erzielt man genügend Treffer bzw. schafft es der Gegner nicht, die Treffer durch Schilde zu blocken, dann zerstört man einige oder alle gegnerischen Einheiten. Das ist aber noch lange nicht alles: Jeder Spieler verfügt über eine fraktionsspezifisches, im Spielverlauf ausbaubares Deck von Karten, die Treffer, Schilde oder Moralboni hinzufügen, eigene Truppen vor Schaden bewahren, den Gegner zwingen, bestimmte Würfel noch einmal zu werfen u.v.m. Über drei Kampfrunden wählen und spielen die Kontrahenten gleichzeitig ihre Kampfkarten. Befinden sich dann immer noch Einheiten beider Seiten auf dem Schlachtfeld, entscheidet die höhere Moral über den Sieger. Dieses System eröffnet nicht nur eine weite Bandbreite an Kombinationsmöglichkeiten, sondern erlaubt des öfteren auch zahlenmäßig deutlich unterlegenen, aber „moralisch gefestigten Kräften, den Sieg davonzutragen.

26-06-2015. Rated after 1 (incomplete) game, but would have finished next round). 

FS is a conquest game with an order system. Players take turns to place orders on a stacks in systems they want to execute the orders in.

The orders let you:
Move troops and attack. You can use ships and ground units to move troops between planets. Ships function a bit like a bridge to transport units from planets to planets connected with ships. This only works when there is no enemy ship in the same region as one of your ships.
Buy factories, anti-air guns and cities. CIties let you build better units, factories let you build units and ships and anti-air blocks.. well.. anti-air.
Dominate. Get bonus tokens from planets and active racial ability.
Strategize. Improve your combat deck or buy upgrades/techniques. This is nicely streamlined and gives you MOST of the differences between factions.

You use the order tokens and resolve them in turn order, from the top of the stacks to the bottom. If there is no order from you available, you are forced to pass.

Combat is quite involved. First you roll the dice equal to the amount of units present in the area. Then, you are able to play reinforcements (basically an semi-permanent free cheap flying or ground unit). You can then augment the die-rolls by playing cards. After each card is played, you count the number of gun symbols on the dice, substract the amount of damage protected with shields. Resulting damage is assigned to troops killing and routing units you assign damage. After 3 such rounds, the player with most morale left, a resource that can be gained from the units, cards and dice wins the combat. So you can focus to try to eliminate your opponent, or basically force them to turtle and win on morale. Both are valid. 

Hmm. Hmm. I am very much of two minds regarding this game. On the one side I feel that it is too similar to other FFG games of yesteryear, Starcraft, Game of Thrones, Runewars & Warrior Knights come to mind. First, I rate this game a 7. Why? For me, it is several things. Like I mentioned, it's too similar to older games. Forbidden stars changes combat, but really doesn't do anything new or innovative. Combat -for me- feels slow. I don't think it's bad, it works great! But it's only fun if you are involved.. and really boring when you are not involved. 
Production is typical from FFG. Great mini's, artwork etc. All excellent.
I went into FS expecting it to be a homerun. To my regret, it is not that for me. I am not sure why, but it feels too samey to other games I know and like, that this one feels a bit same with an overwrought combat system that slows the game down.. 
I like the game ultimately, but I don't think it's as great as made out to be. It's good, not great. Just a fun game to play once in a while.. unless I find myself playing Runewars instead.

reddit 2015 recommendation. "Really enjoyed Forbidden Stars the two times I've played it. It's so disorienting to play a game like that with brutal battles, long held grudges, and furious backstabbing where you really can't fault your opponents for what they do. It's just business man, you're on my artifact. If you had just left like I asked, we wouldn't be in this situation..."

"I love forbidden stars, the combat is great, and it does a good job of solving the "I'm going to fuck you because you fucked me" problem that arises in a lot of games."

Great StarCraft board game refresh in beautiful Warhammer 40k universe. Gameplay is tense. You feel thrill during placing orders, resolving them and combat which is very tactical.

Everything is focused to optimize your way to acquire objective which are placed on the map at the beginning of the game. Great, great experience. Can't wait till next play :)

RATING: 8
This is an excellent game. A typical Fantasy Flight affair with stacks of cards and mountains of beautiful plastic pieces and cardboard tokens. The emphasis is on combat; the economic engine to build up your forces and capabilities is nicely streamlined. There are many moving parts interacting with one another, making for a lot of interesting decisions. The different factions all have their own character. At the same time, this is not too overwhelming.

The basic order system comes from FFG's Starcraft game. Also like Starcraft, one buys cards to upgrade one's forces. However, combat includes dice, so its not all about the cards. I much prefer this: it is both more tense and more accessible to new players. Personally, the other great bonus over the earlier game is the theme: Starcraft means nothing to me, but Warhammer 40K is a game I played quite a lot as a child. All in all, it takes the best parts of Starcraft and removes the worst.

I've seen many comments about combat and downtime. So far this hasn't been a problem for me, not because battles are quick, but because they are so gripping that I'm always interested in a clash between two other players. This might change as I get to know the cards better and am less interested in seeing how they interact with one another, but hopefully by that stage we will be playing through the battles quite quickly anyway.

This is an early rating which assumes no balance issues or other significant problems will become apparent after more plays. So far however it looks like Konieczka's best game by far. It takes best things out of Starcraft - order mechanic, varying player powers, multiple units and possible upgrades and substitutes all problematic elements (too complicated resource management and unit production, fights, fiddliness) with streamlined variants inspired partially by Runewars, adding a bit of new ideas into the mix. The shifting warp storms which block different sectors off are ingenious, as they all but eliminate the problem of static teams forming, even in 3 player games.

Yeah, this is good. I like the bits of StarCraft that have been ditched - the combat and the tech tree. But what has been added, particularly the way goals work, really makes this game a solid improvement on the earlier iteration. I might be tempted to replace StarCraft with this.

Bought like new condition from Board Game Barrister.  First play through took awhile to get the rules down and figure out what we were doing.  Really liked the game.  Played in three phases that are easy to follow, but the best part is the planning phase where you are secretly selecting what actions you want to take and trying to figure out the best strategy for timing all of them.  Meanwhile your opponents are doing the same thing and can take actions on the same space as you, making things interesting and complicated.  Really look forward to playing this one again.

Picked this up a while back after the announcement of the termination of the FFG/GW licensing agreement. I've always had a soft spot for the lurid dystopia of Warhammer 40,000, so I was curious how this would be expressed in a kind of 4X experience.

It is an FFG game in pretty much every way - no mechanic can be simple or familiar, they seem intent on hewing to the model of bumpy crunchy chrome bits on an uneven base design. But what crunchy bits! The orders mechanics I can take or leave, but the mini-deckbuilding upgrade system is cool. The faction theming comes through very strong. We did not find combat cumbersome or time-consuming once you know how it works. Even so, I think I would prefer this as a pure wargame, two players only, hammer and tongs, no quarter asked.

Overall the game has earned a spot in my collection for now, though I think I prefer "Epic" scale battles in this universe.

Only 1 play, seems great, but the combat system is letting me down. Positive points for originality and managing the combat deck to match your units, but in grand-scale multiplayer games like this, I'd rather just roll dice and be done with combat, with Starcraft being at the upper limit of my patience with these abstracted details. I like these long-drawn-out combat sequences only in adventure or 1v1 games, or if I feel a strong attachment to the units.

Rest of it has a great island-hopping feel and fluid situations due to objectives and starting positions being everywhere. Building takeovers happening immediately can lead to some thoughtful combos, whereas with Starcraft, it seemed more straightforward in guaranteeing last attack and hoping the 3rd and/or 4th players don't gang up to cap you.

Another epic wargame. Great game, though unplayable with 4 players due to the length of the game and the lengthy combat if players are not that familiar with the cards (which is everyone to be honest). I am usually not a fan of games with too much downtime. This one however is an outstanding game for three players. And I like how this is a pure wargame. Nothing of the empire building variety. This game is about fighting for objectives and outmaneuvering the others to do so.

Ain't no Starcraft killer, but Starcraft doesn't kill Forbidden Stars, either. They are both great games. Forbidden Stars is probably a Horus Heresy killer though!

The combat system is what much of the game is about, and luckily it is very interesting. One of the most ambitious combat systems FFG's tried yet, and it is well thought out. If FFG did not take a chance with this combat system then this game would be way too dry (the rest of the game is much more soulless than Starcraft)

Objective system for victory is a nice innovation as it reduces the tit-for-tat gameplay that most conquest games suffer from that can hurt the game's arc (I take your area, you take mine, I take mine back, you take yours back, repeat). However, the downside is that it leads to players who are already down getting trodden on more than normal, because they might hold easy objectives whereas in a normal game all focus would be on the leader...  this leads to players who are too far behind to be a threat, as well as runaway leaders. Still, with player education, I think most players will eventually realize that you still need to be clear on who the leader is and prioritize hampering them if it's not you.

Works great at all player counts from what I can tell! Expect a long game with 3 or 4 players, but the game never feels long, as it has a nice development curve and plenty of action.

It is nice to see FFG give us an ambitious standalone original game for like their glory days. It seems they have both learned from past design mistakes (a positive) and become also become a  bit more conservative and reined in most wild ideas (negative)

Have a couple of concerns, such as I'm worried that the upgrade paths and array of choices may narrow down to a couple optimal builds as experience and understanding is gained, but so far that is unfounded, and this game has been a blast to play and I'm just having fun exploring the strategy space.

Even after 1 two player game, I can tell this is something special. Tough decisions, multiple strategies, hugely asymmetric, gorgeous bits, relatively low downtime, and satisfying combat. The game is easy to learn, thanks to the quick start guide. It's easy to get into your first game, and learn the complexities as you go along. Luckily, the rules aren't nearly as complex as they first seem.

It remains to be seen if combat will produce too much downtime in a 4 player game, but I don't think it will be a problem if everyone is familiar with their deck before hand.

Even after one play, I think it replaces Age of Conan, Conquest of Nerath, and Clash of Cultures for me. Maybe even Eclipse. Probably the best 3x games I've played.

RATING: 2
Boring and tedius - uneccessarily complex for so little a game. I bought this game with high expectations because I love a good epic. Unfortunately it doesn't play well - too much stuffing around trying to get things happening before anything exciting happens. There are a lot of rules, which is fine, but it's just not a smooth game and there are way too many 'incidental' and 'exception' rules. Myself and friends played a few times and all we achieved after 5 hours of play was a lot of screwing around and a couple of pathetic battles which were a major let down. The game looks great but doesn't live up to its potential. Gamers yawning at my table is no good for my reputation so I put it up for sale and some other sucker now owns it. If you're looking for a good epic I suggest you move on and take a look at Eclipse, Twilight Imperium, Rune wars.....

Fun big game. Lots of plastic pieces, clever combat system, not horribly fiddly (compared to other big box games). And nicely asymmetrical powers for each of the sides. If you don't like conflict or abhor science fiction, this may not be for you, but otherwise this is well worth the price. (And I'm NOT a Warhammer guy. The game stands on its own.)

A few minor dings to be aware of. The game is longish, especially for new players. The combat system is clear enough, but figuring out how to use it effectively will slow things down at first. (And beware the AP player in THIS game!) Overall the components are great, with some exceptions. The sculpts for the low level ground units are stylized flags, which I think are a little lame. The big ground units and space ships are so cool it makes the little guys look sad. And I wish the objective tokens were more striking, since they are the central goal of the game. These are all minor points and maybe shave .1 off my score for this game.

RATING: 7.5
1 play, 3er (intro game)

Really interesting dudes-on-a-map game of asymmetric player powers, racing to gain control of n (=player count) objectives. 
- Combat powers are very different between the players, based on combat decks further customizable by in-game deck-tuning. Combat uses these cards (based on race), plus dice (based on troops in the battle) in a great way, allowing for some randomness but also a lot of thoughtful play mitigating some of the randomness.
- The intro game has a set layout but in the full game, you even get to custom-build the map!
- Maybe the most interesting, and most mind-bendy, thing is the order system: players place 4 order tokens each turn, one at a time, into various systems on the board. Orders are stacked, and only resolved top to bottom (LIFO) -- you have to plan your actions, place the orders in reverse order, and hope against/account for other players putting orders on top of yours, screwing up your carefully planned sequence of orders!
- The planet stacking limits (varying from 2-4), and the fixed maximum game length (with objective-based win condition) prevent turtling.

VERY cool system, although we played it immediately after A Handful of Stars and in comparison, that game just seemed so much smoother! However, I very much want to try this again, with a different race, and with only 2 players. The game does a good job accommodating 3 but for a conflict game, I think I'd prefer having just one opponent.

I like this game and the strategic challenges that it provides.  At time of writing this I have played it three times, twice with four players and once with three players.  I cannot say which I prefer most.  Each was good.  The only thing that I don't like is that it takes so long (five hours for three players and seven hours for four).  But I will say that (1) it will probably get quicker with more familiarity and experience, and (2) it does not FEEL like 5+ hours, which is the important thing.  The game is tense and engaging.  Much enjoyed and receommended.

It's a good game, I think, though I don't know that I'm 'usually willing to play'.  I like that it is combat heavy, and that the combat is good.  I tend to think of games like this as a setup for whoever gets picked on the least, but I think this game does a lot to fix that.  The theme shines through, and the minis are cool.

On the other hand, the combat makes for an awfully long game, and it is awfully complicated, with a number of fussy little rules you need to remember.  I wouldn't call it a clean, elegant design.  Also, I am somewhat afraid of just how important the map setup phase is.  I feel like you can make damning mistakes just during set up.

Same old Star Craft,...plus some added strategy.

That being said, Star Craft is not accessible or affordable to many, and so this is a currently in print game that has great figures, and a neat little added strategy component in the way of objectives that you have to control strewn across the board.

The game takes up a lot of room, though.

Also the different factions may not be balanced perfectly.  Don't know, haven't played enough.

Forbidden Stars is an interesting mess. There are a lot of things in the game that don't work - player elimination, insta-win abilities, massive downtime - but somehow it just about all holds together and works. It really shouldn't, but somehow it was fun, felt like it moved along well and had a satisfying end result where it felt like the best player won (it wasn't me). 

I wouldn't play with 4, but this was a genuine surprise.

RATING: 6.5
Played it three times at the time of writing this review, twice with four players once with two. I was surprised how much I enjoyed the game, especially the mechanic of placing order tokens and trying to outwit your opponents appealed to me. Each faction is very different from each other and it is a lots a fun to exploit their special abilities. The components are also amazing, but that's what you would expect from a Fantasy Flight Game. The theme did not sway me over, but I have never been a fan of the Warhammer universe.

There are three major issues with the game which brings the score down. Firstly, the combat system. As much as I liked the combat in the first few rounds with the dice and card play complementing each other, later the whole system became a bit a clunky with too many exceptions and special effects to look after. The other issue also comes from the combat and has to do with the enormous amount of downtime, especially in case of the four player games. The second issue has to do with the production which did not provide enough strategic depths to it. Conquering planets and building up your empire seemed secondary to all the other aspects of the game. Admittedly, I tend to prefer meatier Euros, that's why this bothered me so much. Finally, the length of play was also a beast with 6-8 hours with four players and about 3 with two. Even though the two player game provided a much more manageable length, the whole strategy part became much simpler facing only one opponent which made the whole experience quite underwhelming compared to the 4 player games.

All in all, as much as I liked the game despite these annoyances I don't think that I would seek out to play this one. The simple fact is that there are much better sprawling head to head combat games which provide similar (or better) strategic depths without the annoyances, downtime, and overall playtime of the game. Having said that I would not mind playing this one in the future let's say once a year.

Absolutely superb. First 2 player 4.5 hours, 3 player: 5 hours.  Absorbing all the way through.  We did not find combat dragging or introducing too much downtime in a 3 player game.  The combat is the best in any big box epic game ive played.  I think even 4 player the downtime we will find acceptable for a game like this.. This now goes to the top of the heap for big box multiplayer games for me.  Less fiddly than TI or Runewars, streamlined round/phase sequence but very deep, Cool upgrading system, the action tokens are great fun.  The theme and components are awesome.  Just a brilliant game.  Shame there will be no more expansions but the game feels complete anyway. If you like big box epic games that play in roughly 4-6 hours range, get this.  Best in class.

RATING: 7.5
Very cool space combat game that rewards attacking over turtling.  It does a few things very well.  First, the combat is very interesting and varied with the choice of combat cards and use of dice.  I'd have to say simultaneous combat card selection is my favorite type of combat, and the way that cards remain in play for 3 rounds adds a new layer to it.  Second, the order stack.  The first in, last out system makes order placement a chess match.  You need to plan out your whole turn and start from the last action.  There's also a lot of strategy revolving around when to place your orders because an opponent can place an order on top to delay your resolution.  Third, each factions plays very differently.  Different units, different combat cards, different upgrades.

The biggest drawback is definitely length of game.  60-90 minutes per player is probably about right, and AP-prone players could greatly increase that.  I do like that the game has a fixed number of rounds though.  

If you aren't as much into the explore aspect of 4X games, this might be for you.

RATING: 9
Played a full three-player game now and it was epic. Took about 6-7 hours as it was all of our first time playing. I've only played one game of Twilight Imperium so far, but for me this is a TI3 killer.

The thing that is most memorable about my game of TI3 is the few epic battles that happened. You had hours of buildup, then a few crucial battles near the end. In Forbidden Stars you have epic, crucial battles throughout the entire game. You never attack somebody just to be attacking, you attack to try to improve your position and get to your objectives.

And the game uses one of the best (and most unique) battle systems that I've played. You roll a number of special dice, then you take up to three turns playing cards that can potentially affect the dice or the units. If you wipe out the enemy, you win the battle. If that doesn't happen, you see who has the most morale, which is a symbol that can be given through the dice and cards. There are plenty of tough decisions because sometimes you just want to survive a battle and play defensively, and sometimes you need to completely destroy the other army.

Really good game, just not sure how many more plays I'll get because of the time commitment.

Update: Played a four-player game and while it was good, it was just a little too long. The battles are still engaging even if you're not involved so downtime wasn't really an issue. I just don't like devoting six hours to a single game very often. So for me this will be a three-player only game in the future.

RATING: 8
Love the theme, love the combat mechanics.  Game is a bit on the chaotic side (no pun intended), but that's part and parcel of the enjoyment.  Suffers from the usual imbalances of a multiplayer free-for-all, but mitigates them by putting peoples objectives explicitly on the map and by encouraging smaller combat and raids.  c.f. similar games where you are encouraged to attack anyone and everyone, and where you basically need to build up one huge force, the loss of which basically means losing the game.

Very very VERY good balanced and thematic game with very nice and fresh mechanics,  very different races and unexpected good gaming even for only 2 players. Played it with my wife and we both were wondering how much fun we could have just with us both as players. Also, the minis are GREAT (will use them for my Rogue Trader RPG campaign as well ^^) and the quality of all components second to non. One of the best games I ever played (And I also play Twillight imperium often, so It's not only because it's "just a nice space game ^^)

Tentatively an 8 and definitely could rise from there.

This game did everything that I'd want in a 4x game but did it coherently and smoothly and in under 2 hours.

There are just enough factions and abilities that I feel like with 10ish plays you'd have made mental notes of the vast majority of them and be able to play the game at a "higher" level and with the very lean play time that is not a massive commitment.

The turn structure is very cool, the stacking of action tokens really adds some neat stuff to the planning.  The movement rules really keep the map nice and clean and keep things readable.

The card play during combat is both unique and interesting.

I can't see myself saying no to a game of this.  I left my first play very pleasantly surprised that someone had basically taken all the good parts of a game like TI3, condensed them into a delightful 2 hour window while improving the win conditions, the combat, the action selection, the planning...it's just a flat out better, shorter and more coherent game.

Another epic game from FFG. I wish they had supplied rules for Basic and Advanced game. The Advanced game is what you get in the box. The Basic game would have been the same game but with a simpler combat system. The game as it is, it is very well designed, but it has a mini game when battles occur and battles occur many times. The combat system is very thematic, but still it takes quite a bit of time to teach and resolve the combat mini-game. A golden opportunity was missed. On the other hand, the combat system is what brings the factions into life, although this could have been achieved by more diverse and rich event decks for each faction.

Nicely fits a strategy niche between deterministic Game of Thrones and die rolling TI3.  The combat mechanic is a big plus, so is supporting 2p, and it being harder to turtle. I do wish it were shorter though, as the time commitment seems to approach TI3 without adding in all the diplo aspects.

Played a number of times. Each part of the game seems very well designed but something about the whole isn't quite there.

Very good and I really enjoy it but cumbersome and involved. No one part of it is too difficult but it's an assault on the brain trying to learn it or teach it.

This keeps going up in my estimation. The combat is great. Yes it takes time, but anyone can win most battles with clever card play. It takes some time, but as long as you hit the mid game, everyone is so involved that the time flies. The placement phase is a real brainburner, and almost always goes a little wrong. The only downside to this is when you get a group together, take the time to set up, then someone gets all their flags in 2 rounds due to mistakes by a couple of players.

Some really, really neat aspects, but suffers from some downtime.  The game drags a bit with the amount of down time.  It's interesting how small space feels in this game, it's very much back and forth and making pushes that leave you open to be attacked in another area rather than a sprawling expanse.

I don't think I'd ever want to attempt it at 4 players, or at least there are other games I'd rather play when it gets up to that 4-6 hour range.  I do think that it offers very engaging gameplay for 2-3 players though, which is a rarity for this genre.

Combat was incredibly drawn out even when the outcomes were abundantly apparent. Bloated play time and space as representented by a 3 x 3 grid with the ridiculous warp storms to limit movement is just silly. Space never felt so... flat. Flatter still was the game play. Yuck!

Epic Space Opera.  Tons of important choices, and limited actions to make those choices.  Really enjoyable with 4 players.  Some have complained about the combat taking too long, but we didn't really have that problem.

Not my kind of game: too long and too much downtime. It is also difficult to engage in what is happening on other players turns. The combat system, while interesting, makes combat take too long as it splits off into a sort of mini-game. 

Design-wise it has some clever aspects too it but I prefer something much more elegant. It is not necessarily bad at what it does, just not the kind of game that interests.

Played it on four players. Seven hours with rules explanation and we didn't finish (stopped in the middle of turn 7, game was decided anyway). Combats are very very long (but interesting for participants) meaning lots of downtime for non participants.
Won't play again on four (rated 3 for this player count), but could be good on two and maybe three so keeping a 7.

My first play of Forbidden Stars was pretty abysmal, resulting in something of a rage quit. However, my second game went much better—thankfully.

The general gist of the game is you’re one of four Warhammer 40k factions attempting to recover enough objectives to win within eight rounds. You’ll do that by conquering certain planets which will require some movement (and combat), upgrades, building/recruiting, and domination (extracting resources). Most of these actions are straightforward—with combat being an exception—but the way you plan your turn is very interesting: you have eight order tiles (two of each action) and you play the tiles face down on the sector tiles and resolve them from the top down. If there are other tiles already there, you play on top, so you can now prevent that person from using that action for a bit. The game ends in eight rounds, and the person with the most objectives wins, in case of a tie you use planets, if that ties, you use units.

Like the first game, I played the Ultramarines, figuring I’d like to try the faction I failed so spectacularly with the first time. After thinking about it for a bit, I realized that the Ultramarines are all about morale—they want to just outlast the other guy and win by surviving. My strategy revolved around upgrading a lot of cards and focusing on defense, rallying units, and throwing wrenches in my opponent’s combat plans.

The final score in the fifth round was 3-3-2. The first tie breaker was the number of planets and we were tied at 7. The second tie breaker was units on the board and my opponent had 14 and I had 9.

I’m glad I gave this game another shot as it’s a lot of fun, but I’d recommend taking some time to look over your faction’s cards before starting the game, just so you can figure out their strengths and weaknesses, and an overall game plan of how they should play.

Warhammer does Starcraft focusing on claiming objectives and area control of the Herakon Cluster navigating around the unpredictable warp storms. I like the player turn order to produce action stacks.  The dice based combat system is tricky to understand using set collecting of guns, shields, and morale supplemented with card play to route and possibly destroy units—can take a long time to resolve but is one of my favorite combat systems.  I like the economic system and how it feeds your tech and structure upgrade tree dependent on your civilaztion growth. Upgrading actions is a cool concept new to me. I like the draft system to place modular terrain and objective tokens.  A lot of advantage comes from using and understanding the card powers and timing of their use. Big, heavy box of plastic and cardboard with a longer playing time which is expected.

+++ The turn mechanic, as you 'pile up' orders
++ Thematic, if you like Warhammer 40K
++ Beautiful board and pieces
+ The setting of the galaxy by the players at the start
- Dice, although battle cards can reduce luke.
- Endgame kingmaker

The game is cool I guess, I am just not a big fan of W40K universe.

I expected to like this, but even I didn't realize how deep, and fun it would be to play. There is a lot to explore here, and I would love to do just that.

The setup is fun, where each faction is handed it's home Sector Tile, and two more, all double-sided, then select one to place along with any of your starting troops, and two goal tokens of your opponents. Brilliant!

Good game, rich and interesting. Way too long though, and clearly not for everybody (player conflict - easy to mess somebody up). I like the asymetry between the factions but I need a few more games to really see they´re balanced. I like the combat system but I dislike the "routed" concept. I feel like some battles should have been executed faster when it's obvious which side should win, instead of getting into the combat system again when you attack a poor base soldier with a ton of elite troops.

[i]Forbidden Stars[/i] has me scratching my head, trying desperately to put together my thoughts coherently. I really want to like it.

Nearly every system in the game has something about it that I like, especially the ordering device (using chits), but the sum of the parts just doesn't do it for me - mainly because everything takes so long to implement.

On paper, the combat appears awesome, but in practice it is slow and, in the main, predictable. The nice aspect is that you roll the dice, and then make decisions based on the outcome - normally, in games such as this the exact opposite is true.

The deck-building is cool and immediate, but everyone takes ages deciding what to do, dragging the game to a stall. And that goes for every feature of the game. There is a large decision space provided here in every facet, and that I applaud, but it comes at the expense of speed of play, and accessibility.

For me, [i]Forbidden Stars[/i] is an exercise in frustration. While clearly a *better* game than [i]Axis and Allies[/i] - I found myself wishing for some giant space battles involving cool minis to actually just get bleeding going. I'd prefer half the faff of the system to be removed, and a bit more of the immediacy and danger of a dice conflict, aided by a clever card-based system.

Surely, if I can deduce the outcome of the conflicts before they occur, with a high degree of accuracy, why bother with such an overwrought system? It gives you the illusion of control, when strength in numbers always seems to bear fruit - more so than in [i]RISK[/i] or suchlike, because it's difficult to turn a losing battle around here, hence the boring, forseeable outcomes.

A large number of conflicts are settled using morale - in theory this is attractive (especially to the Napoleonic wargamer in me). But in a game about plastic starships and mechs slamming each other to bits on alien planets, having NOTHING be truly destroyed after a mega-battle, just sucks.
*gamer pushes large invasion force onto planet* "[i]I win because I have more winged morale icons than you![/i]"
Does that sound enjoyable?

The game also makes some strange thematic decisions: why can't you orbitally bombard an undefended city? *shrugs*

Clearly, to stop perfect planning, they also added in 'warpstorms'. My problem with them (the warp walls) is that, in a game that already disheartens my enjoyment in other ways, it adds another frustration and time-sucker. And occasionally, the ONLY deciding factor of the game-winner becomes the semi-random resting place of the warpstorms. That blows.

In summation, I prefer games to have more 'action' for the time investment. If I was to choose a big-box 2-player game to play for the afternoon, I'd rather pick [i]Battle of the Five Armies[/i] or something similar. And I'd select any 3-4-player game that doesn't take 4-7 hours to complete over this.

[i][b]Forbidden Stars[/b] is a convoluted, hand-cranked machine that you fill with excitement, enthusiasm, cool minis, great dice, and time. After cranking this bloody machine, very few fun sausages are pushed out.[/i]

My favorite game system.  I have had more fun playing these games than any other in all my years of gaming.  TTS is a tad better (but not as pretty) because I find the situation at Chickamauga more interesting than that of Gettysburg.

I love the CWB series that this game was developed from. Although much larger in map and counter count, the regimental games are easier to play as the unit strengths are there in front of you - no checking back to the rosters.

Given the time, space and players, I'd play THG again and again. However, I'd prefer the Chickamauga game simply because it feels less 'programmed' than Gettysburg.

Very fun game in the limited amount I've played.  I own all three CWR series games and prefer them to the CWB series.  I wish someone with the skills and talent would produce a VASSAL module for these games, I know that I would be able to play them much more.  Probably the only way I would ever be able to play a full campaign.

No other regimental game represents Gettysburg quite like this one. A joy to play, but it would best played with a bunch of ACW buffs (it enhances play to play it with other guys.)

Overall, the game captured the tactics and reality of Civil War combat very well. 
Artillery rules had problems in the game, but this was fixed in ....
 
...this system has evolved into new Line of Battle Series...as such I have reduced the rating here. In reality when I will play this game again, it will be with the new LOB rules

One of the things I like about this game is the order writing and waiting for them to arrive to the leader and how things may change by the time the leader excepts the orders and starts to carry them out.

Huge game.  Really need teams to play this one, with players each handling one or two corps.

It's a blend of the Gamers Civil War Brigade series games with the combat mechanics from the old GBACW games (from the '80s, not the current GMT versions.) While I like those systems, this game is just too big, and it can go off the rails fairly quickly if the CSA can blast through the thin Union screen north of Gettysburg without taking too much damage, as happened in our game. 



The strength of the system is it's command and control rules, and the key to that is how orders are accepted (or not) by Corps commanders and whether Corps commanders press their attacks (governed by Corps attack stopage rolls when units start taking fire).  By shifting the game down to regimental scale, the system adds 4 to 5 times the die rolling and counter management as the brigade scale games, with a corresponding increase in playing time.  The few instances when you get get one of your regiments to flank the enemy line dont justify the decrease in playability.

The Regimental Subsystem (RSS) works better in A Fearful Slaughter because it has far fewer units and faster playing as a result.

Regimental Sub-Series (RSS) games on American Civil War.  An ambitious project that try to bring the war on par with Europa on WW2.  The result is mixed.  Some like it while some don't -for the same reasons: huge maps, thousands counters and the troop order system.

Very nice basic system but playing the three days (possibly stretching into a fourth) worth of battle in 15 minute turns gets a bit repetitive.

Best played multiplayer as handling more than two corps becomes a bit too much like hard work.

I finally got a copy!  After positive experiences with This Terrible Sound, this game pastes the same mechanics onto Gettysburg.  I have yet to dive into any of the larger scenarios, but I am really liking this.

RATING: 9.5
There just isn't any better game to provide the best feel for a regimental level Civil War system.  The command system is priceless and the regimental level is how a civil war battle must be seen and played.  This is the best connection possible.

A word to the wise however.  This is a monster of a game and you will invest a lot of time.  It will be one investment with a really good return, however.  I have found it to be a tremendous reflection of the histories written of the battle.  At this point I have only played through the afternoon of the first day but the play has been very exciting and the wearing effect of action on the regiments is obvious.

I have to admit that I am a bit of a detail junkie and played with casualties allocated to the individual regiment rather than to the brigade.  It works the best taht I have seen.  It also shows how you can have a strong lasting brigade perofrmance over time despite hot action.

Well worth the time and commitment.

A very good system with an excellent command system. Downsides: Too detailed combats (Defensive Fire, offensive fire each requiring 3 dice rolls (5 dice) per shot (4 if a leader is present): 2D6 Fire combat result, 2D6 Morale check 1D6 stragglers. On the whole the system is an impressive simulation, well worth a try, but a real monster that will take ages to play through

A rather brilliant simulation of the battle of Gettysburg. The rules have been adapted from the Gamer's Civil War Brigade series and if anything they work better at the regimantal level than they do at the Brigade level. 

The big change at the regimental level is no extended lines. This actually makes turns go faster. Also this game has more scenarios than most Civil War games making it easier to recreate a number of specific events that covered the three days of fighting. This game is a true treat for anyone who has studied this facinating battle.

Best Gettysburg simulation out there, if you can find and afford it. Pretty large tablespace demands, but manageable.  Wish I still had my copy or that it would be preprinted. A ten if you a Gettysburg historical buff like me, nine otherwise.

The CWB is one of my favorite series - The regimental subsystem adds a lot of counters, but it isn't as complex at if first appears. I always like the 1st day at Gettysburg - I found the meeting engagement as both side rush in reinforcements to be a good scenario.

Rather than attempt to play the entire battle, I focus on the scenarios which give a detailed approach.
 
What's not to like. My reenacting unit 17th Conn is present. However, it is a 'D' morale unit - sigh.

Played once, and this game exposed me to a few problems with the RSS rules, most of which were addressed by the never-published CWR rules.  Last Chance for Victory has the Line of Battle rules, which are an improvement over the RSS/CWR rules.  LCV does not have the cool optional units of THG, unfortunately, and I prefer the THG victory conditions.

Loved the show, love this game at least as much. Gritty theme and game mechanics mesh really well, production values are solid. It combines worker placement with player interaction by trading, threatening, bribing and fighting. Friends that never saw the show like it a lot as well. 

Only downside I can find is that some clubs (Lin Triads, you suck...) seem underpowered.

1st play: Resource conversion game with a unique theme.  I've never seen the show so the theme was pretty neutral for me.  There weren't enough action spaces on the board and the combat system felt like participating in combat cost too much for both sides, making it seem like the optimal path was to avoid conflict as much as possible.  This isn't so bad except that with a game about illegal drugs and gunrunning, I go in expecting to be fighting other gangs a lot.  Still, the game was decent, and one of the better television IPs to be converted that I've played.

No second play.  I think this was designed for fans of the show.  If you don't have any feelings one way or the other about the show, or the theme, then the game doesn't really jump out at you.  Or at least it didn't for me.

Felt really limited in options. Confrontations were fun... we didn't have any negotiation but it was our first game in the style and we didn't really have any context for it. Maybe future games... hopefully as I'd love to get into more negotiation games in the future.

RATING: 4
Worker placement, area control and three resources; contraband, guns and money, which is also victory points.  Control of the areas allows conversion of those resources and reduction of heat.  Heat limits how much contraband you can traffic for money and can cause the loss of workers.  Combat - sorry, throwdowns - for control of an area are a bit of a lottery.   This does at least encourage negotiation to avoid the fickle dice plus guns plus reinforcements.  The euro elements in this game seem bland and stale; the interactive elements aren't enough to lift it above mediocrity.

Production quality is decent, except for the flimsy cards.  The artwork is quite evocative.  The rules are fine.

I'm not even that into the TV show or the subject matter here, but Sons of Anarchy does a great job of bringing that feel to a medium-light strategic game. Not a lot of randomness here, even though you roll a die for combat you can mitigate the result heavily with Guns and Dudes. The components are great, like Contraband miniatures, and the graphic aesthetics very representative of the show's mood. Gale Force 9 knocked this one out of the park, as they usually seem to do with their TV licenses.

This game captures the theme of the TV show and of outlaw biker game crime systems in an elegant game system with tight, well written and easily learned rules. 

Some raters have called this a worker placement game. such a description does little justice to this game. In fact, although it has elements of such, the game is nothing like a worker placement system. This game is, at its core, a poker game where the hand revelation phase can be filled with crime and violence. Like poker but unlike a worker placement/resource management game, the winning player is the person who manages and manipulates the other players more effectively.

On top of this, the game is just plain fun. Elegant design, tight rules, small playing area footprint, quick setup and great thematics.

An excellent mashup game that mixes area control, action selection, negotiation/bluffing, worker placement, and combat. And somehow it manages to do this while keeping the theme ever-present. The fact that you don't use every action space every game and each round has random events means the game is highly replayable. The components are also high quality with thick cardboard tiles/pieces and lots of chunky plastic components. A great thematic Euro that doesn't overstay it's welcome. A very under-rated game.

The gameplay is great, and i think the time is a bit faster then recomended. 3 players was about 45-60 minutes. But the more players add more time to the game. I don't know if the game is fun with 6 players but i doubts it.

The best strategy is to get as many members in early game as possible it seems.

2014, 3-4p, 60 min. AVOID. Euro-like worker placement + combat (with dice and blind bids).  Lots of hidden information and blind bidding (for combat and for selling contraband).  Sounds like way too much chaos and uncertainty for me.

BGGer SeerMagic says (paraphrased): uninteresting choices, chucking 1d6 for combat is annoying, and trading resources for a few more of another type isn't fun (especially when you have to fight other players to take control of a tile/location before you can use the resource conversion ability).

BGGer Sorp222 says (paraphrased): At its heart its a goods converter (their are three currencies - cash, guns and drugs with cash being where you get your Vps at the end). The locations (mainly) just allow you to get or convert the currencies. You can only use them if you control them - and to control them you need sole use so you have to fight. Now fighting is fun but hazardous - you can gain heat (which limits your drug dealing each round) and can gain injuries. A bloody turf way between 2 players in a 3 player game can leave player three grinning through the handlebars of his Harley...

BGGer the_pete says (paraphrased): The hidden information goes a long way towards keeping things lively as players alternately try to project force or weakness. The game mechanics result in a "Cold War"-style approach to violence and conflict. A player who fails to adequately protect his assets will have them taken from him. At the same time, aggression only gets one so far, and a player who spends too much time and energy on picking fights is going to be overextended and vulnerable. The threat of violence is always there -- the employment of violence requires careful consideration.

This has got to be one of the most underrated games out there. It's quite an anomaly because it is approachable(small ruleset with few edge cases), well paced (a timer mechanism that keeps the game going at a good pace), tight (a game of four noobs all finishing within two bucks of each other), and a crazy amount of fun that is stimulated in the creativity of the players. The clubs are asymmetric in the "High Octane" version of the game (and there is no reason not to play this version) but the sides become more asymmetric by the angles each player chooses to pursue. The game encourages all of the temporary alliances, betrayals, and smack talk of Cosmic Encounter but adds a little thematic appropriateness to the mix. It is a close cousin to Spartacus not only because it shares the same publisher and designer, Sean Sweigert (who deserved more acclaim in his lifetime). Unlike Spartacus, though, there is very little risk of bloat or downtime. Play time and pacing is snappy. While I feel I like Spartacus a bit more, Sons of Anarchy has less weight to it and almost as much punch. Note that this will be a group dependent title; if your group prefers Euro games and multiplayer solitaire - and especially if they don't like screwage - this game will quickly reduce itself to a fairly mild exercise in maximizing value by trading in three sets of goods (guns, contraband, cash). However, if you're prepared to get down in the dirt; the game has a lot of laughs all around and memorable moments in the box. Get it while you can!

RATING: 9
Worker placement for AT gamers :)

Loads of theme and opportunity for trash talk here - helps if you like the show (doh!) but it's not necessary to play  

Core of the game is worker placement (with limited actions that you can increase) and 3 currencies to juggle - Cash (which are also VP), guns (which can be converted to cash and are really helpful to resolve conflict) and contraband - which converts to cash (mostly and easily) or sometimes guns.
The locations (mainly) just allow you to get or convert the currencies. You can only use them if you control them - and to control them you need sole use so you have to fight or intimidate/negotiate your opponents to ride away and leave you with it.

Fighting is a bit hazardous - if guns get used, that draws heat (which limits your drug dealing opportunities) and can injure your dudes, so best to have some prospects around to take the hits.

Not completely convinced it works with 3 - as there is the usual problem with any interactive 3 player game, two go to war and the 3rd wins, or 2 gang up on a 3rd and that's no fun for player #3.

I suspect with repeat plays this problem will reduce as players get better at spotting who's winning and adjust their play accordingly. 

This game isn't going to work with the player type who holds grudges and will spend the rest of the game attacking you just 'because you attacked them first' ... rule book even has a section "Sportsmanship", telling you not to be an ass.

Overall, with the right group I'd pick this over most worker placement games without a second thought (Age of Empires III and Lords of Waterdeep might take a 2nd or 3rd thought though).

Light-to-medium weight game in which players spend action points riding to and exploiting locations while recruiting and promoting members to your motorcycle gang. I have not watched the show but it appears that the game has incorporated the theme very well. I did like the asymmetrical gangs although there seemed to be a little of imbalance. Some of the components are very cool and detailed (e.g., the guns and contraband bags),  but I wish the recruits and members' minis were slightly different from one another. The gameplay is fairly simple but it definitely works best with aggressive players. Our group tends to go for multiplayer solitaire Euros so I feel that the experience may not have been optimal. I think fans of the show would definitely enjoy the game and those who like very confrontational games.

A game I got cheapo cheap on Amazon. When I brought it out the gang groaned and said something along the lines of, "seriously??"  but... it was a huge hit. The beers may have helped but the laughter, smack talk, threats, bullying was fantastic. An economic euro with gunfighting! The ultimate hybrid. Negotiation, area control, bluffing, combat, economic simulation. The winner managed to fly under the radar the entire game while the rest of us were shooting it out. The reveal of how much cash the players had amassed was priceless.
  The subject matter is what it is but as a fan of crime fiction that is a big plus for me. I predict that in a few years this will be a grail game. Love it love it.

update: Finally got to play it again. Still awesome. There was a tie that ended in a huge brawl between the gangs for winner. 
Grim Bastards expansion is a must for much needed extra $ tokens and the Black Market card (which my base game was missing). A fantastic gaming anomaly: an elegant game with dice-rolling combat.

RATING: 8
Fantastic. None of us had seen the show, but it worked perfectly as thematic violent worker placement game. Some of my favorite moments from the game were: 1.) A 3-way Mexican Standoff at a liquor store resulting in 6 "dudes" (they're not called meeples in this game) sent to the hospital. 2.) A lone prospect calling for backup as a whole gang rolled up on him. 3.) Aroop's life of crime resulting in one of his members having to take the fall and go to jail. 4.) Getting greedy dealing too much contraband on the black market, flooding the economy, and forcing all us to sell at a lower price.
The sign of a great game is one you want to laugh and talk about when you're done.

This game is more fun than I could have expected.  The stark contrast between the subject matter/theme and the types of people with whom I play this game make it hilarious.  The tiny guns and miniature bags of drugs are all adorable and add to the humor I find in this game.  The language used within the game (such as "umleaded" for normal mode and "high octane" for advanced mode, or that fighting is "throwing down") assures that I will never be able to take this game seriously.

The rules are solid and mechanically interesting.  There is plenty of variety between plays.  Most importantly, it's stupid how fun it is.

Open negotiation meets worker placement with dice combat. 

Pros: Good card stock. A normally swingy and random single D6 combat resolution is made a bit less random with unit modifiers and simultaneous hidden gun modifiers that add tension to the already tense dice rolls. The balance of contraband, guns, heat, and action points make this game a tight race for the most cash. Random event card draw affects board and changes player tactics.

Cons: Despite thematic game, the miniatures are only of mediocre quality. It is nice that they look like bikers on motorcycles and not plain meeples but the detail is squarely in the functional board game territory. Not a big fan of negotiation and the resources can be counted despite the hidden player shield, but the game play is solid. You see all the event cards in one game, even if the order is random.

RATING: 6.5
It's a shame that a 6 looks bad on this site, but this is not a bad game.  As the BGG guide says, it's something I would play in the right mood, but not necessarily something I would gather friends around a table to play; the friends would probably be there for some other reason and then this would come out.  It's better than OK hence the .5 but it's not quite a 7.

With that out of the way, this is a simple area control game with a crime theme.  I've never watched the show, not for lack of any interest, but because I'm lazy and it's not on Canadian Netflix.  Get on that, hey?

What makes it fun is that it's got the right kind of weight for high-stakes conflicts.  Sure, most of your guys will go home unless shot, but at the same time, losing a valuable space on the board due to a bad die roll puts this firmly in the good ol' AT bucket - a bucket I enjoy, I might add.  In other games like, say, TI3, where it takes 20 real-time years of your life to build a significant force, losing it in one giant f***-off battle can be heartbreaking.  In SoA, however, getting your guys up to scratch is fast and furious and you gotta come at it with a win-some, lose-some attitude.

For what it is, it's great fun for chucking dice and talking smack.  Gg!

Surprisingly awesome licensed game, with play mechanics that match the gritty, real world theme perfectly.

Unfortunately SOA seems to have been largely overlooked, to the point where GF9 has delayed the  major expansion they had planned indefinitely. This is a big shame, as more locations and anarchy cards would have been great. There are plans to continue the tv show after the 7th season (as a prequel) so there is still hope for the game to be expanded further.

Buy this one, it's amazing.

You don't need to be a fan of the show to be able to appreciate all the illegal dealings you find yourself trying to take advantage of over the course of the game. With the right amount of guns and dudes and sites to fight over you'll start to see the need to create some compelling offers that your rivals will have to truly consider, or risk getting involved in some pretty costly gunfights.

Played at Salt Con.  Your basic worker placement/area control/dudes-on-a-map stew.  Something like Le Havre except with fighting instead of an economy.  Sure there is an economy here too but it takes a backseat.  For what it is, not a bad game.  Mechanics that actually inspire fighting is a refreshing change.  The combat resolution was quick and painless.  And the game length is appropriate.

Great variation on the worker placement genre that sits somewhere between Lords of Waterdeep and Argent: The Consortium.

The various possibilies with the location tiles and the anarchy cards keeps things interesting throughout and every thing moves along at a nice pace with the throwdowns making for some fun interaction.

And while I've not watched the show (yet) the essence of the theme of biker gangs doing dirty deeds while trying not to gain too much "heat" really shines through.

I've only played the game once so I'll update these comments later. The game is super easy to learn, the quality of the components is top-notch, there is high replayability. I only have a few concerns. The goal of the game is to have the most money. If you're not playing in an engaging group, at some point, it can be difficult to build a strategy since you don't know how much money, contraband, or guns your opponent has. At one point in the game, I was just accumulating money for the sake of it. The only player interactivity occurred when one player would decide to throwdown with another to be able to exploit a site. But because there were so many other tiles that gave similar exploitations, so if you wanted to avoid a throwdown, you could easily do it and still gain as much money/contraband/guns as you'd need.

Sites that allow you to steal stuff from another player definitely introduce the need for a strategy because if a player does not have the supply to give you, you can peek behind their blind and see what they have. This provides enough insight for you to build a strategy. Unfortunately, during my first play, none of the sites gave us the ability to steal, and the only opportunity we had to steal was when an Opportunity Card came up in the Anarchy deck and even that only lasted one round before it had to be discarded.

That being said, the game is intriguing. I'm not usually into these types of themes and I hadn't even watched the show, but this game is fun and easy enough to play that it doesn't phase me.

Surprisingly good IP based worker placement game. I don't watch the show so I can't comment on how true it is to the source material, but I can definitely see the gang connection all over this game.  The components are great, there are plenty of location tiles for added replayability, the rules are simple and make sense. Well done GF9. That this kind of production was not done for the Back to the Future game make me sad....

Big fan of the show, so I have been looking forward to trying the game for a long time. 

First game played and negotiation galore, I love it!

I would or preferred artwork to be made for the game instead of the shots from the show though but that wasnt a big deal.

The biggest annoyance for me was the minis for the members of the Lin Syndicate and the One Niners being on motorbikes which just completely pulled me out of the theme.

The game is fun with the right people but it really needs four people to help avoid two people slugging it out and one person winning.  There are several things I think need to be looked at like the limited number of members, the tiles ( some are very powerful while a few are absolutely questionable), how the hospital works, etc.
Some of the end game issues are problematic enough where I hope we played it wrong because it just felt like it was missing something.

Still have hope for the game but it feels like it could use an expansion/update.

A couple of interesting twists on worker placement: the combat, the fact that they stay on after using them, and separating the number of workers and the number of actions make for an interesting package. However, the board's size, and the completely random set of tiles for each game can make for some real lackluster games, especially at the end, where you can be left with a few actions you can't use on anything worthwhile.

The quality of this game is sadly very unstable, and highly depends on the tiles that will come up.

Severely underplayed and underrated.  It's a worker placement game with variable player powers, hidden resources, and a number of resource systems that interlock tightly and affect economy and combat.  The thing that is excellent about this game is that the game is so baked into the theme.  The license isn't important, but I feel the license hurts this game.  The show is OK... but the game is excellent.  

Three resources:  Drugs, Guns, and Money.  

Drugs are sold at the end of each round through a hidden fist/simultaneous reveal; the more drugs sold, the less money each player gets per bag sold.  Selling drugs raises HEAT.  Too much heat?  Can't sell drugs.  Can sacrifice a member to reduce Heat so you can sell drugs next round.

Guns help in combat.  Each member involved in combat MAY opt to bring a gun.  Members + Guns Used x 3 + 1 roll of a d6 = Winner.  Each gun used results in a enemy wounded, but using guns raises heat level.  Wounded enemies roll for survival at the end of each round, 50/50 live or die.

Money is victory points.  

Resources can be traded between players, and all are kept behind screens.  So how do you get resources?

You activate properties.  You must first control a property, meaning no other gang is on it.  Each full member of your gang has a cell phone.  Your cell phone tokens are your activation tokens.  Some properties get you drugs, or allow you to trade a gun for several drugs, or vice versa.

The properties are the board, and there are a few that are in every game, and then the rest are revealed in rounds.

This is essentially a small, highly streamlined and thug version of Twilight Imperium.  It's not as epic, but it scratches a LOT of the same itches.

One of the most enjoyable board game I've played.

Love the show, and this adaptation into a boardgame was  LOT better than expected...  Players who didnt watch the show were fine playing, but the folks who did enjoyed the locations, and a lot of nostalgia for early seasons events came thru...

Wished they gave a cash/guns/contraband "hiding board" for the Grim Bastards expansion, but I guess have to wait for it to officially come out...

While I am not a fan of the show it was evident from the start of the rules explanation that Sons of Anarchy is another in a line of games from Gale Force Nine that does the seemingly impossible, make good/great games based on licenses from popular culture. The mechanics of the game fit well together and are quite logical with each other and the show. The components are really well done and I especially enjoyed the full fledged member pieces on bikes. The game plays quickly enough and ramps up as each gang competes to see who can be the wealthiest by the end of the game. Money can come from different sources including selling illicit substances, selling guns, graft, and bribery from other players. I definitely want to give this game a few more plays soon as I saw a good amount of potential in what I have already seen. Unfortunately though the game style is just in a crowded space for me. There are definitely plenty of other games that "feel" the same as SoA, so really don't feel any need to own this as well. If you are a fan of the show you should definitely pick it up as soon as you can.

Probably the least interesting of Gale Force Nine's tabletop games so far after outstanding games in Spartacus and Firefly, Sons of Anarchy is a worker placement game hidden in the Sons theme with some typical gf9 dice rolling combat. The game is decent, a bit long for what it is, but still entertaining.

UPDATE 2: Sold it.  While I still think it's an excellent game, Scythe and Viticulture replaced it for me.

UPDATE: Downgrading to an 7.  While I still think this is a criminally underrated game, some games can be downright frustrating due to the dice rolls or other players being too passive resulting in a runaway leader problem. 

A highly engaging worker placement game with politics, diplomacy, and deal making.  It's like this awkward marriage between typical worker placement games to get resources like guns and money, while having the "dudes" move around from place to place with conflicts that end with guns and dice rolling. I usually loathe worker placement games like Lords of Waterdeep due to lack of player interaction. Sons of Anarchy drips with theme and player interaction from the first round.  However, it doesn't scale well with 3 players.  This game is best with 4, while 5 and 6 drag a little too long with some players being "out of the game" early due to not able to do much.

My main gripe with this game is it can be repetitive.  There are numerous Locations and Events that can occur, thus making the game "feel" like it has a ton of replay value, but it's more an illusion.  All of the Locations in the game is a simple variation of exchanging one item for another (e.g. 1 drug for 3 guns, or 2 guns for 4 cash, etc).  Very few locations in this game have some sort of interesting effect on them.

Madcap thoughtful combative fun. It's tight! Meaning there is a strong sense that victory is well earned... The fighty worker placement is brilliantly done. All the resources - including order tokens - work well together. Want to play many more times. Edit: second play, and this one is a real winner. Fast heading into my all time favorites list.

SAMCRO: MoM is yet another TV show based hit from GF9. Its got to the point now where we joke that if any TV show is turned into a board game by GF9 its going to be great automatically! Along with [i]Spartacus[/i] and [i]Firefly[/i] they have shown that it certainly is possible to have a good board game based on a TV show, and all those rubbish ones that came before have no excuse any more!

SAMCRO: MoM is an Ameri-euro that combines worker placement, action management and resource management with a strong theme, player negotiation and a twist of luck and violence. Its smooth to play and easy to follow, but much deeper then its Spartan rules and sleek design suggests.

One of its chief design features is also its only real bane- as with [i]Chaos in the Old World[/i] whether the  game really works or not is completely down to your own group's dynamics. If you don't get into the theme and try to swindle, negotiate, bribe and steer your opponents the game can fall a bit flat and dry. However if your group really tries to push all the angles they can on each other and keep a close eye on other player's games as well as their own you will have a real blast.

Despite there also often been a bit of an anti-climax in the last round we've also had close tallies and exciting reveals at the end of each game, and everyone never seems to quite have the amount of victory points you expect them to!

There's some modular elements, with only a fraction of both tiles and the event deck being used each play. If there is a shortage or abundance of one resource the experience is drastically different, which is great for re-playability.

SAMCRO: MoM also captures the feeling of the early SoA seasons really well.

I'm looking forward to new expansions- increasing variety will only add to the game's strengths.

Progressive Rating: 7-8.

RATING: 8
Guns, drugs, and double-dealing. All in a reasonable play time with a semi-random board and cards that ensure no two games will play exactly the same. 

Also has one of the cleanest and clearest rulebooks I've read. 

The game has a nice flow to it, and you're always involved trying to work out what's most profitable for your gang. But sometimes it's hard to take the smart road when you want revenge!

Played: 4 times.

Well, this game is very good.  Simple rules, yet interesting enough decisions in when and how to fight for different locations, and plenty of easy negotiation/trading.  Amazing how well it mirrors the actual TV series.  Just like Spartacus (by same publisher), you don't need to have seen the TV series (I did not see Spartacus) to feel the theme come through.

This game feels very unique. It's not quite worker placement, and it's not quite dudes on a map, but it definitely feels like it falls into those categories somehow. There's a little too much negotiation needed for my enjoyment, however, and the game doesn't really scale well. It's excellent at 4, decent with 3 and 6, and awful with 5.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The theme is captured perfectly, with beautiful images from the series. Components are absolutely wonderful.

However, the game play is not as deep as I imagine. The battle/brawl mechanic, which requires die rolling, is not feasible as the main strategy is hauling in huge team, and that's when the battle becomes one-sided. As some clubs are much easier to play than others.

Anyway, this is a fun game to play if you are a hardcore fan of SOA and want to enjoy all the related.

I think Michael Barnes said it best in his review on NoHighScores.com, "Gale Force Nine’s crack in-house team of Dill, Kovaleski and Sweigart turned out Spartacus in 2012, Firefly in 2013 and now in 2014 they’ve hit paydirt again with yet another TV show-based title. Sons of Anarchy: Men of Mayhem is going to cement this publisher and these designers among the absolute best working in the business today. The GF9 gang has turned in what is quite likely the best crime-themed board game published to date. It doesn’t matter if your experience with Sons of Anarchy is that you’ve followed it since its debut in 2008, if you binge-watched the entire series on Netflix last week, or if you have no idea what SAMCRO stands for. The universal themes of intimidation, exploitation, gang rivalry, illegal enterprise and explosive violence should appeal to anyone interested in the entertainment value of bad people doing bad things." And he continues with "At this point, I would be first in line if they announced titles based on The Young and the Restless, Full House and 16 & Pregnant- because they would probably be awesome." Lol. It's just that good. :)

Again a very thematically fitting game by GF9 based on a TV series and like the others very well designed with fun game mechanics. It does feature worked placement mechanics, which I usually dislike, but it does not feel like dull worker placement. Thanks to the other mechanics (secretly moving contraband, being chased by police, sending men to take the fall, tons of throw-downs with other gangs) it really feels like you are commanding a biker gang and of course that includes stuff like sending guys to collect.

Also great artwork and I think great material that really adds to the fun with little guns, contraband bags and tons of dollars. The biker minis are medium-low quality and rightfully critizised for that, but that does not really hurt, as there are just a ton of them (especially with both expansions) and, even as a passionate mini-painter, I would not consider investing time into painting them.

Sons of Anarchy: Men of Mayhem is essentially a worker placement base with an AT theme draped over it. You take turns to move 'dudes' between action spaces, activate them if no one else is there and fight if they are. Almost all of the actions just let you convert between three resources - guns, contraband and money. There are mechanical parallels to Greenland and thematic ones to San Quentin Kings but compared with the thought that went into those themes, it felt rather cheap and tacky. It would have been OK at the advertised 60 mins but dragged on for over twice that, and the last round was anticlimactic as few of the action spaces had any value. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's really thematic, and though I don't watch the show, but as a biker gang theme, it really tells a story, it's a shame it didn't do well, a big box expansion would be welcomed.

The base game is already really good and has high replayability as it is.

Bumped to a 9. This game is just flat-out fun. I can't imagine it being played anywhere without raucous laughter, jeering, swearing, and mockery.

=============================================================

Exactly as advertised. Wild, bare-knuckle worker placement game of guns, gangs, drugs, and money. Absolutely not for cerebral types who play boardgames in studious silence. This is all about intimidation, smack talk, bluffing, bribing, and weaselling. Number-crunching will only get you so far before you have to make a call whether you can take and hold a key money laundering location in the face of more numerous or better-armed rivals. 

There are few built-in balancing mechanisms, so if one player is running away with it, you deal with it the way it's dealt with on the street - collusion and temporary alliances. You can trust no one, but you'll have an advantage if you can secure short-term arrange of a mutually-beneficial nature.

Lots of variability with the varying set-ups and locations used in play each game. And the distinct gang abilities add a lot. Definitely use them.

3p game, not that great. Need to play it again with full count and with negotiation, because we played it as a Euro.

Testing out a 2p variant and it played really well. Followed the suggestion of fellow geek for black market distribution. Main set up consists of 5 default locations and 4 random (2 less than 3p), but still testing out if just 3 would be better for higher imteraction. Anarchy cards are reduced to only 2 instead of 3. We had a surprisingly good time, threw down a couple of times and felt a good amount of tension btw rounds. This is definitely a game that will shine with 4 or more, but the variant proved worthy and we'll definitely keep on playing with 2. I gotta say that I bumped the rating to a 7. We had a lot fun this time around and I suspect the score is subject to go even higher. Oh yeah, and I love the components. The little contraband duffel bags are adorable lol. Anyways, I'll say more after I put in more work.

Played with 4 and I just gotta say... Wow! What an amazingly fun game. I am very impressed at how much the dynamic of the gameplay changed with the open negotiation. I am soooo glad that I didn't get rid of this game.

RATING: 8
Any game by Gale Force 9 is high on my Try list. Sons of Anarchy did not disappoint - an entertaining blend of euro area control and Ameritrash negotiation and conflict. The production aesthetic - beer mats and little toy guns and bags of 'contraband' is inspired, and nicely reflects the campy 'grittiness' of the TV show. Fits a similar space in the game collection as Spartacus, losing the high point of that game's arena battles, but with smoother mechanisms and quicker play to make up. Variable set up is a big plus, but you may wish to pick up at least one expansion to be able to play with 5.

RATING: 9
Fantastic worker placement game, blows the dry and themeless Lords of Waterdeep clean out of the water, adds negotiation, real (!) backstabbing, fighting, etc, all in a highly interactive game. I especially like that with clever chaining of your exploitations, you can make a really great little money-making engine (as long as no one will contest your sites, which is bound to happen soon) - reminds me very slightly of Dominion (although I'm not too fond of Dominion in general, but it works very well here, because SoA is an actual game with other people and stuff). 
I'd rate it as highly as one of my favorite games, Dead of Winter although the only thing they have in common is that they're both highly thematic and interactive. 
It may be important to add that I don't even like the show and am not the least bit interested in a life of crime (I find it quite silly, actually)! The game is so much better... (and the decisions you and the other players will make in the game will be much less idiotic than those Jax Teller and his friends and enemies make all the time. The silly (to me) theme just adds to the experience for me. I'm not really into this kind of theme at all, but it's easy to roleplay here and just laugh with and about biker antics.

Easy playing, thematically rich, good marriage of mechanics and story.

At its heart its a goods converter (their are three currencies - cash, guns and drugs with cash being where you get your Vps at the end). The locations (mainly) just allow you to get or convert the currencies. You can only use them if you control them - and to control them you need sole use so you have to fight. Now fighting is fun but hazardous - you can gain heat (which limits your drug dealing each round) and can gain injuries. A bloody turf way between 2 players in a 3 player game can leave player three grinning through the handlebars of his Harley...

Nothing new in game play, but what it does it does well - quick game play,  v little chrome for AT style game. Sense that will be better with 4 then 3 as more crowded.

Antecedents are solidly German - but Guns and Coke instead of sheep and cloth.

Combat and negotiation mixed with worker placement, which combine pretty elegantly. Unique faction powers and event cards keep the game interesting.

Un juego bastante temático, pero demasiado corto en duración.

Necesario jugarlo con más de 4 jugadores pero recomendaría de 5 con el uso de una expansión (una banda adicional) para que el conflicto entre las bandas sea mayor.

Jugarlo con personas que disfruten de fastidiar a los demás ya que jugarlo con personas casuales es poco frío y sin mayor conflicto por los territorios o la explotación de áreas.

I like the novel setting for a worker placement game, and the ability to throw down with rival gangs adds some teeth, but I don't think it's as mechanically interesting as wp genre.

This is another winner from Gale Force 9. The theme isn't something that you would want your kids playing, but this is a good solid game with worker placement & fighting going on when someone is weak or in your way. Swapping out the tiles each game gives it a new feel every time you play.

RATING: 8.5
Criminally underrated and underappreciated.  This is a wonderfully good game.  Lots of tension, treachery, and power plays, served up with a big dollop of thematic goodness.  The hidden information goes a long way towards keeping things lively as players alternately try to project force or weakness.  

This game also highlights one of my favorite mechanisms in gaming: "Cold War"-style approaches to violence and conflict.  A player who fails to adequately protect his assets will have them taken from him.  At the same time, aggression only gets one so far, and a player who spends too much time and energy on picking fights is going to be overextended and vulnerable.  The threat of violence is always there -- the employment of violence requires careful consideration.

A lean, mean, resource-management machine!  Props to the publisher for not censoring or shying away from the source material.

Yes, if you're a gamer you've probably played other games with similar or downright identical mechanics.  This is fine though, because this game takes the familiar and throws it into the boardgaming equivalent of a pressure-cooker - every move counts, battles with other players are always tense, and the winner of the game will walk away wondering how they survived.  Highly recommended and one of my favorites from 2014.

Side note: I knew nothing about Sons of Anarchy before playing.  Only after playing this game did I choose to start watching the series.

I was a huge fan of the first few seasons of the show, and of Kurt Sutter well before SoA ever aired. GF9 have done a fantastic job capturing the theme of SoA in this boardgame.

The components are great, you feel like you're running a bike gang, and the play time is very reasonable.

I look forward to additional plays of this!

RATING: 6
I've not seen the SoA show, and honestly, I only had a vague inkling that it was a show about bikers at all. But I had heard that the game was actually a good game, so I was up for trying it. That being said I was a little worried that maybe the biker theme would be a turn off or that it would be a high conflict/slapfighty game that wouldn't work for me.

As it turns out, this game does have conflict, but it is more of a economic resource management game. You play as one of four biker gangs, which each have variable player powers and start with different numbers of bikers and wanna-be bikers. You get a certain number of actions per turn, usually four, plus one for every biker. On your turn you can recruit a wanna-be biker, promote a wanna-be into a real biker (with a buck and a gun), move dudes from a spot to somewhere else, do the action where you are (if nobody else is there), "throw down" i.e. fight to kick somebody out, or pass.

The throw downs are determined by the dudes you have on that space (worth 2 for real bikers, 1 for wanna-bes) and guns (worth 3). But after a throw down is called, each player can pay a buck to bring workers from another location (1 buck for each different location). Then you select how many guns you want to commit and reveal simultaneously, losing any guns you use. The loser vacates and if guns were used, some people go to the emergency room (where they'll later roll to see if they live or die). And if you use guns, you take "heat" which is a symbolic representation of the police taking more notice of you. If you ever take too much heat, you "take a fall" which involves losing a guy.

At the end of the round, there's an option to sell contraband, where everyone reveals simultaneously. The more contraband that is sold, the less each is worth... so there's some thought about how much to sell and how much other people are also selling.

There are a lot of tiles that come out that give you the ability to do stuff. Most of the stuff relates to converting money, guns and contraband into each other at different quantities and rates of exchange, but there are also ways to heal your wounded guys, reduce heat, take start player and do a bunch of other stuff. Additionally, every round there are some random penalties and/or special action spots that appear just for that round.

The game ends after six rounds and the guy with the most money wins.

I liked the game. The idea of fighting over the ability to do different actions is a neat one. The economic manipulation aspect of the game is a bit dry, but the theme goes a long way to masking that. It's fairly straightforward, fairly quick and fun. It's a good solid game.

"I'm playing this for my family. We're going legit."
"You want to go legit? You got 3 heat tokens, Jackie Boy, and the Mayans control the contraband."
"I know what I'm doing. keep those blinders up and let's roll out."

This game blends together several mechanics: worker placement, area control, resource management where some resources are hidden from other players, and negotiating/bluffing/shady deals between players. And there's just a little dice randomness (used in fights) to spice it up.

The theme fits the mechanics wonderfully, but I've actually only played it with people who were unfamiliar with the show. They really got into the game and enjoyed the game, in spite of not getting some character/location references (which I explain in a non-spoiler fashion) . I was a big fan of the show, for the most part.

There's 24 Location cards and 36 Anarchy cards, but each game only uses 11 of the former and 15 of the latter, randomly shuffled, so no two games will play the same.

Really, this is a surprisingly deep game and the price is hard to beat. Licensed property games may get a bad rap as a cheap cash-in but this has gone over well with my gaming groups. The build quality of the cards, tiles, and units are all superb.

I suggest buying the Grim Bastards and Calaveras expansions as they will allow you to play with more players (up to 6) and/or play as different gangs with different abilities.

I liked the game quite a bit, more than I was expecting.  This is the Euro, worker placement game for the person who wants direct confrontation and theme.  It's pretty fun how the game works out where people naturally sort of setup their gang dominance on certain locations until a rival player comes and initiates a turf war to kick them out.  The heat meter drives everything, a constant tug of war.  Though the threat diminishes when you can just start cycling out your initiates to take the fall for you over and over.

Wish the game mechanisms emcouraged more trading and negotiating, still a lot of fun table talk.

Juego de la misma editorial que mi querido Spartacus y que está un paso por debajo de él. No obstante es un juego con muchísimo enfrentamiento y que me parece muy muy temático (quizás tenga algo que ver que el tema, sin haber visto la serie, me apasiona). Realmente en mis dos partidas no ha habido mucha negociación, quizás por haber estado más centrados en el enfrentamiento y en la pelea.
Para mí, un juego de 8 al que pretendo darle mucho tute porque además promete una gran rejugabilidad ya que se utiliza una parte ínfima, en cada partida, de todas las losetas de localización y cartas de anarquia que trae el juego.
Muy recomendable!

Reminds me a lot of Istanbul but for big kids. It certainly incorporates some Ameritrash with the combat but that and the theme are what make this game shine.

Gale Force Nine continues to absolutely crush it when it comes to licensed games. Those used to be words to fear, but after Spartacus, Firefly and Homeland I am willing to blind buy anything they put out.

I have a feeling this one isn't going to do so well because of the subject matter, as it makes Spartacus look like PG fare. This is a game where you find yourself opening a porn studio where you get bonus money if you supply the starlets with enough drugs. This isn't light subject matter, by any stretch. 

Still, it is an incredibly fresh take on worker placement, so snatch it up before it becomes hard to find if you can stomach the subject matter. I don't think I know of any other Worker placement game that encourages deal making and negotiations at the level found in SOA. The event deck is a hoot too, with DEA and ATF raids throwing a huge wrench into the goings on.

It may be a morally challenging game, but it's a fun one. Doubly so if you actually watched the show.

This is my kind of game: interaction, theme, blind bidding, negotiation, backstabbing, and on and on. I've played it only once and the group I played it with was perfect for it, a group of friends who know each other and no one is going to get hurt over a backstab or two. I think you need that kind of group, I wouldn't play this with a group of cube pushers.

I'm very wary when it comes to franchise games, and the box of this game is just hideous. But, a friend of mine brought SoA:MoM to an impromptu game night and insisted we played. I must say I was really pleasantly surprised. The game is very tactical and the position of the starting player is very important. Usually I'm not a fan of highly confrontational games but here it fits the theme. You have to pick your battles and strike at the right time. High replayability due to the large stack of location tiles.

Dude placement and turf control for up to four gangs including Samcro. Not as intense as the writing in the TV show but this game is still a solid PG13/R for adult situations for plenty of running drugs, gun fights, and chicks. Place the regular city tiles for Charming PD and the hospital and random city tiles. Fight and negotiate for control of your turf and extort the proprietors for the benefits. Interesting dynamic with gunfight and contraband reveal from closed hands.  You got to have a fall guy if there is too much heat. Keep your stash behind player screens. Coolest components. Greatest stacks of cash I've ever seen for a board game.

A great worker placement/area control game. You and your gang have to compete with other gangs to control areas that your workers can go to in order to do those actions. I've never watched the show, but people I've played with have and say it also ties the theme in pretty well too.

Worker placement with full negotiations, fighting, back-stabbing, and gang members being your workers, awesome! I'm already a huge fan of GF9's thematic games, and this does certainly not disappoint. It's one of my favorite games.

There's a lot of replay value, with the combination of the random setup of the board, and the Anarchy Deck's composition. The quick play time of about 90 minutes is another huge boon, and the theme is just plain and simple fun in spades!

Sometimes it just feels good to be the bad guy.

With the worker placement and resource conversion for cash (VPs), there are a few ways to play although it seems it's at its most fun when there's a lot of deal-making and deal-breaking going on. It seems like there's nice replayability too with different locations to use each game. Really good fun.

Mindenképpen fogok még vele játszani és utána átgondolom a dolgot. Egyelőre egy nagyon erős 8-as, ez felfele és lefele is mozoghat majd egy pontot, az idő fogja eldönteni, h mennyire lesz klasszikus.

Enjoyed first play, this will get a lot more plays for sure. Good combination of worker placement, area control with a lot of immediate interaction. Amazed a tv-show game turns out to be a solid interactive euro. 
I think it's a very good game for people wanting to go the route of heavy negotiation games. 
It doesn't step into the pitfall of many ameritrash games: no take that or dice-fests. 
The many different tiles will keep the game fresh each time. I expect a lot of replayability also it seems to take 90 minutes of play just as it says on the box.

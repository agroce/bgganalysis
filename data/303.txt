RATING: 6
A game that has dated.  I played and enjoyed the first edition many times.  The "designer's cut" second edition raised the number of action cards from 10 to 20, both lengthening the game and making it more random.  Even the first edition now seems long-winded, with too much mathematics and too little control.

Apr-09: First game for ten years or so.  We were in need of an 8 player game.  This is a worthy game.  Most enjoyed.  But with 7 or 8 players only 7 cards are dealt to each player which is not enough to create the same party pairs you need.  So, too much luck is introduced for 8 players.  Recommended only for 5 or 6 players.

[11/4/06 ]I really like the whole game premise. However, I do recognize the first edition we played has a number of issues. From what I've heard about the 2nd edition, it seems to be a whole lot more refined. Very much looking forward to playing that. I'm confident the newer edition will also allow me to bump up my rating.

Enjoyable negotiation game with some good backstabbing moments. Bit long though.

RATING: 7
Excellent game of negotiation and strategy. However the scoring is somewhat complex and this can cause some analysis paralysis in determining who is ahead and who to ally with. The game can be improved with some fixes. However, the basic concept and system are excellent. Accomodates up to 10 which is a big plus as well. Keep in mind this is a card game and can be played much quicker, with the right crowd it can be a beer and pretzels game. This is one game I want everyone to try. It is very difficult for people to see the strategy in this game. You need to explain how important it is to get a third party involved in each election or it boils down to a landslide in most elections which sucks the fun out of the game.

Clever card game set in the European Union.  Players play cards to the table over a set number of rounds, then try to get their cards in on a coalition to form government in the current country.  This game has seen a couple of editions, both rather chaotic thanks to the event cards.  The second edition without the event cards is my preferred way of playing.

Koalition is a light(-hearted) card game. Up to 8 players fight for control of the most influential politicians and parties in Europe.

Huge swings in majorities are not unheard of, and the influence of any single player on the outcome is rather limited but it's interesting to see ad-hoc alliances being formed in the middle of an election to either secure majorities or to get a foot in the door and make a junior partner more attractive. With the right crowd, not a bad game.

Just like with real elections, the score-keeping has all the charm of a 20th century spreadsheet...

Play different political faction cards out of your hand to compete for majority points in countries. At game end, more majority points awarded for the most played political faction.  After playing the first time, the special cards (egg on leader's face, etc) were taken out to get rid of the randomness. Then it seemed whoever was in the seat to form winning alliances was subject to peer pressure or false perceptions on who was winning. That seemed to reward who could manipulate the best, shout the loudest or who could prevent other people from proposing alliances. It's been played more times in our group than it deserves.

I remember playing this with about 12 people.  The table talk enhanced the game, which made it an enjoyable experience.  So I currently give it a 6.  I need to play it again to re-rate.

It's played in 15 rounds, where each round is an election in one of the EU countries. Your hand is meant to last for 3 or 4 rounds and is made up of cards ranging from low to high value across 7 major political parties. With each card play, the decision is whether to play a card in the same party as those previous, improving your position but also handing VP's to your allies, or striking out with a new party and hoping other players will join you (and are able to join you given the cards in their hands). The other consideration is that whoever plays the highest value cards in the winning party gets a bonus. So the game necessarily devolves into determining who's winning (scores are tallied after each round) and playing cards so that someone else gets the spoils next time - ripe leader bashing. The game slows down with lots of counting and evaluating the effects of play, so downtime is present, and an element of same-ness creepingly invades the game. Action cards are also present which can dramatically affect the game-play, and you'll either get good ones or not, so the deal can be very important. Interesting enough, but for the time (3-4 hours for the full game?, we bailed out half way thru), I think I'd prefer something else.

I like the theme and the general play - especially if played quickly without proper counting. Unfortunately all that countng of scores can be a little too fiddly. Not bad if experienced players can rip through the game in no time.

I played 5p and didn't use action cards as that's not my style.

Interesting game potentially. The cards have 7 parties which are basically suits, and numbers representing how many votes they are worth. You get to play a certain number of cards (like 2-4, one at a time in turn order). Then the person who played the highest sum for each suit is the leader of that party, and negotiates with other leaders to try to form a majority. You score for being the leader of parties included in the coalition, the larger the better (as the parties vary by size), and you also score for playing cards of the parties that get included, even if you don't get to be their leader.

A high percentage of the time, what seems to happen is that it becomes clear very quickly that one of the two major sides (top hat or rose) is going to prevail, and so players stop trying to compete and just try to play cards that either support the leading party or a party that might be able to form a coalition. (There are restrictions on which parties can be together in a coalition.) That results in landslide wins which is kind of dull.

It might be more interesting if you simply got nothing when you don't lead a party. That would decrease the likelihood that one party would have an outright majority. But on the negative side, there would be more occasions where you can't play anything useful.

Some substantial luck in what cards you get. It's also possible but tedious to calculate who is the leader that needs to be bashed, etc.

A wonderful game that can literally be taught in less than 3 minutes and yet still needs so much skill to play. That being said you only have 5 cards/moves to make so games do not take very long. It also takes little space and is easy to transport. Downside is it is 2 players only for some and some people are just better at abstract games which means the better player will almost never lose. In conclusion, it is a great game and not to be missed.

A smart chess/the duke game, but a lot more light and quick to learn and play. It can be considered a bit simple in some aspects, but it requires a lot of strategy. Suggested as a filler too and very portable.

1st play: Wow - very cool, streamlined abstract game that reminds me of the Duke, but with less of a memory element.  The production of the game is excellent (Although I'm not a fan of the box at all), and the pieces look nice on the board.  Tons of variety in the movement patterns available, but with the limit in each game, no two games will play the same.  

2nd play: Some combinations of movement choices are better than others, and many of them don't allow "jumping" so it sometimes feels like your only choice is to sacrifice a piece to clear up some of the board.  I love the quotes on the movement cards though, and I'm really like the duke-style abstract feel.

If you are a fan of abstracts, but are looking for a challenging experience in a very short time frame, Onitama is for you. 

The new Arcane Wonders version is a treat. The component quality is excellent, and everything is extremely legible and easy to understand. 

The game itself allows for a lot of variety given that you only use five movement cards in every match, which helps keep things from getting stale. 

Overall, a real winner for any abstract fan.

This game looked interesting with a mechanic where the cards that define legal moves for the game cycle between players, each player having only two move cards in front of them at any one time and a third waiting in the wings.  But I found that play in every game tended to devolve into a sequence of "avoidance" moves until suddenly (and generally unexectedly) both players could see that one player will win the game in two moves.  My reaction at the end was generally along the lines of "Oh, look at that.  I guess I/you won."  Overall a disappointment for me, although I know some people who really like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very nice abstract game with quality components (at least the Arcane Wonders edition that I have) and very quick play time. One game lasts for about 10-15 minutes so it allows multiple games to be played with your gaming partner. You can introduce people into the hobby with that easy and beautiful game but you can also play with gamers at the same time. Highly recommended!

RATING: 9
I don't play chess, and even after playing Onitama I still don't feel inclined to. But I love Onitama and I think it's a great, short game for 2 players. The very first time I played it, I was down to my master and the opponent had 2 students left, and I still beat him! I think this just shows how well balanced the game is. 
I was inclined to rate it lower because when I opened the box there was a red student missing, but their customer service was quick to reply and have already sent the piece in the post, so bonus points for that.

Chess-like abstract movement game. Difficult (for me) to plan too many steps ahead because of the changing cards. Enjoyed the challenges of playing this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
What would be a mediocre four pawns and a King abstract is enlivened by cards that determine how a piece may move.  Five of the deck of fifteen are randomly dealt each game.  The cards circulate around the table as they are played, with each player presented with a choice of two moves per turn.  Planning ahead is important, yet it is limited by uncertainty about the choice of moves you will have. Importantly - because this ain't the deepest abstract - playing time is brief.

Production quality is reasonable, although my board came slightly bowed.  The artwork has minimalist good looks.  The English rules are well written.

I love this game and have to imagine I will always opt to play it given the chance.

A light little filler abstract that feels like chess light (including being light on entertainment). Using only 5 cards of the stack of available ones helps keep each game from feeling completely identical but does nothing to make the game feel like anything but an incredibly boring slot. There was nothing here that made us want to play this one. Traded it away.

Our favorite abstract. When i saw this game announced as a Dice Tower Essentials Game I was excited but when I learned it was an abstract I was ready to pass. But after being talked into playing by one of the guys from Arcane Wonders at Dice Tower Con 2015, we fell in love with it. A two-player game in which each character has a small number of cards to play, you attempt to either take your opponent's main pawn or place your lead into the opposing home spot. You accomplish this by playing a card that you have then you place that card aside which allows your opponent to take that card the next round for their use. So you have to be very careful or you might just give your foe the move to beat you.

A very solid and fluid playing 'chess' game.  It's super easy to teach but offers quite a bit of thinking.  The replay value is quite high since only 5 of the movement cards are used in any one game.  Play time for the game's complexity is spot on.  If you enjoy games of position, this is an easy one to recommend.  Approachable to kids too.

You've gotta hand it to Tom Vasel, he's pretty damn sharp so far at picking out memorable games for the Dice Tower line with Arcane Wonders. I'm not sure I like the visual aesthetic of this edition more than the original I had seen in videos, but it still looks pretty good, and you'll soon forget all about a minor discrepancy like that, because this is just a really engaging, fast and fun Chess-like abstract with a card programming movement twist that you'll want to play again and again in short order. It's like reaching for that first Oreo in the package.

RATING: 7
In this abstract game, players move their pawns by selecting one of two cards in front of them. But, after a player uses a card to move a pawn, that card is discarded towards the opponent (the opponent will take it after his/her turn). Thus, players are trying to find optimal ways to capture/move but also attempting to avoid giving their opponents opportunities. 

Overall, the game is quite clever and has a remarkable production quality. Furthermore, each game has a different set of movement cards, which add to the replayability of the game. If I had to complain, I would say that the games can drag depending on the cards available and how risk-adverse the players are. But honestly, that aspect is found in many abstract games and isn't universally disliked. 

Very good game... if you like abstract games, definitely check this one out.

I enjoy chess, and I love that I can get the feel of chess in a shorter time that has more variety between plays.  It's super easy to teach, which is a big plus as well.  The board and pieces are beautiful.  The pieces have such a nice weighty feel, like a high-quality chess set.  And that is very satisfying, really.  The one thing I don't like is the first few turns often have a very similar motion of each player hesitantly moving forward a bit.  I don't know if the expansion cards help alleviate that a bit.  And even that isn't a big deal.

RATING: 5.5
Good filler/travel game for two people. I rarely play filler/travel games, however. This means its a six when I am home or have other games available, but is an 8 if I'm short on time or travelling and brought the game along with me. Those considerations probably means I should rank this game a bit higher. But when 95% of my board gaming gets done at home, this gets to stay a 6 for now.

Edit, March 2017: Have been pulling other games out over this and, therefore, this has stagnated on the shelf. I still enjoy the idea of this game, but other games get played more. I will probably keep my rating of this game at the present level moving forward.

Awesome two player abstract that borders on being a microgame. 5 of 16 possible moves (on cards) are laid out on the table- each player has two and the fifth is in the middle. Players take turns making one of their moves and switching it out for the one in the middle. That's the entire game, but true depth comes from being able to anticipate how your opponent will move and being careful about what move you put up for grabs. Essential for a reason.

This is an excellent 2 player abstract that can be aptly described as mini chess with variable moves. Each game uses different moves determined by the 5 move cards in play.There are 2 cards in front of you, 2 in front of your opponent, and 1 in between. You pick one of your characters to use one of the move cards in front of you, then swap that card with the common card, then your opponent does the same.

Very easy to learn but difficult to master. Games are usually 15-30 min and there are plenty of different move cards to make every game different. Also great component quality
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I'm amazed by how much depth this game has while looking so simple. Despite the fact that it's easy to swallow all of the open information on the table when it comes to possible player moves, it still manages to be chock full of tense and surprising moments!

Taught it in less than a minute and game length lasts just the right amount of time for what it is (15-30mins). Immediately wanted to play more games of it after it was over. Especially since each game could mean drastically different move sets available offering a lot of variability.

I haven't played many abstracts, but this certainly makes me curious about what else is out there.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
This is a very clever abstract chess game.  There is a ton of variety in the box since you only use 5 cards each game (And I think there are 13?).  The cards really dictate the pace of each game, making each game feel very different.  While I did find it interesting, it is probably a little too much like Chess for me, but I would be happy to play this one more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I'm giving this one star for each of the NINE TIMES I played this game today (on the day that it arrived). Most of the games in my collection have never even been played nine times in all the years I've owned them, let alone all in one day. This in itself showcases the high level of accessibility Onitama offers to all. In fact, the only game I can think of where the rules may be simpler is Tiddlywinks. As a result I'm happy to state that, as a person who always struggles to convey rules adequately, this is ridiculously easy to teach. 

Alas, this simple structure belies the beautifully intricate variety on offer, and so Onitama peaks as one of those rare games that completely lived up to my expectations. If you only wish to own a single 2-player filler game in your lifetime then this may very well be it, although I hasten to call this a 'filler' game as you can easily fill in oh-so many hours with this beauty. 

And beware the Tiger card... If your opponent possesses this then you may be in trouble.

PS. I love the box and insert, too. Great job, Arcane Wonders!

RATING: 7.5
Onitama gives me the same feels as playing Chess, which usually is a bad thing because I'm not a huge fan of Chess. BUT...the simplicity, the smaller board and fewer pieces make Onitama a far more enjoyable experience. I love the variable movement cards that allow for a completely different game each time. It's a difficult game to rate because the design is fantastic, but my desire to play it falls somewhere beneath that.

Listen... I have trained traditional Shaolin Kung Fu for several years and what I've learned there about the different animal styles is captured in this game and it's done pretty well. The different cards let you act like the real animals... and the art style connects to that as well.

My MG2016 score: 135/150.  My #1 choice at Mensa Mind Games 2016.  It's a pawn battle, but movement is driven by the choice of 2 cards of 5 in circulation between you and your opponent.  You need to time a series of cards correctly to get in position to be able to take without being taken.

From box to table to fun in 5 five minutes. Clever, tactical, strategical and filled with 'aha' moments. This is a must in any collection.  Also great for the young ones. The box says 8+ but trust me my 5 year old was up and running (although not very competitively with her older brother) after two plays. Ratting may go up after the highly anticipated expansion.

5/22/16 Raising my score to 8.75. This game is soooo good. With close to 100 plays this game is getting better. I was down 4 - 2 and came back to steal a stream win. It was so satisfying to see my plan unfold. Cannot wait for Sensei's path.

I was deliberating between this and The Duke as a two player abstract to play with my wife. I'm not sure I made the right choice, but I can say this struck me as a very good game.

The rules are incredibly simple, yet the gameplay was deeper and thinkier than I expected. This felt like Chess condensed. Good plays forces you to think multiple moves ahead.

I'm not there yet on the strategy, and I'm not sure how my wife will take to this. I do think this is a keeper though.

Update: Eh... maybe not. I picked up The Duke at about the same time, and both fit a similar slot in my collection. The Duke wins out... I just find it more fun.

A neat little abstract that is a bit like a game of chicken as you move your pieces around the board. I do like how out of the 15 movement cards you only use 5 in a game so it definitely has replayability as they can mix and match in a number of different ways. It plays quick and I'm looking forward to seeing this one come out in a wider distribution so I can play it more.

People familiar with chess seem to grab this game easily. You use 2 cards at any one time to move any one of your pieces rather than each piece moving in its own special way. This concept rings well with non-gamers as it narrows down the decisions to make to just a couple that are easier to see.

I recently had the chance to play Onitama at Geekway to the West 2017. I love how each game can be different since you only use 5 movement cards per game, and the fact that both players keep using those same cards in turn. It really makes you think ahead and keep an eye on what your opponent is doing or may do next turn. I absolutely loved playing it and will be adding it to my collection soon!!

The production quality of Onitama is wonderful, and it has everything I love in a quick two player game: easy to learn, difficult choices, and quick to play.

I think this is an excellent game; however, if you like more predictability and the ability to play a game over and over and get "good" at it, I would recommend checking out Hive.

Full disclaimer: I love Chess. However, I do not have the time or energy to get good at it. Chess is a game where the stronger player will win almost 95% of the time. Onitama is not like that.

Onitmama evokes that same feel of chess, but helps balance any skill gaps between players by adding a hint of randomness into the game with the 'move cards'. This randomness is not insurmountable and yet it helps mute the advantage that season players have over newcomers such that games between players of unequal skill still feel tense. Additionally, the alternate win condition of reaching the other shrine adds a finality to the game that chess lacks. Skilled chess matches can last for hours, but if an Onitama player pushes for a "Way of the Stream" victory then the game is sure to end soon (one way or the other) due to the exposure of that player's Master.

All of this collides into the perfect mixture of skill and chance that keeps games short, interesting, and balanced. Chess without the decades of training required to enjoy it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I like chess. So i love Onitama. Every move has to be predicted and calculated before you make your decisions. If you don't like that style, the game is not for you. But if you enjoy a nice battle of minds, with perfect information..It's your game!

Love the chill tactics of this game. It feels relaxing to play, but the restricted options for movement create such tight tactical field.

The randomized movement cards are also amazing. Had a game where only one of the five cards was able to hit directly in front. My wife held the card for the entire game, refusing to use it, resulting in a diagonal dance with the constant threat of a frontward stab from her. Very fun round.

What is the appeal? So many better two-player abstracts out there. Games drag on forever. Just not fun. 

I think the weakness with the Onitama is that there is just not enough in the design that propels the game forward. Movement options are too constrained and gameplay is stifled. Games can really drag until someone decides to just charge forward. Master and student pieces have same movement options.

We also found that the additional motion of having to exchange movement cards - in addition to moving pieces - disrupted the zen-like flow of what should be a simple abstract.

Onitama is an perfect information abstract. Each player has two movement cards and there is separate movement card off to the side. During each turn a player will use one of their movement cards to move a pawn to complete the objective of the game. When they use their card, they exchange their used card with the card that's off to the side. People keep doing this until a player has won. There are more movement cards included with the game than you will use in a single sessions, which increases its replay value. It's also a pretty quick game if neither player is overthinking things. It's pretty popular, but I'm not overly fond of churning permutations. So, I'm not the target audience. I'm sure people who like abstracts will like this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of many great 1v1s I've been lucky to play recently. Elegant, complete information, but really grips and gets people thinking. It's like chess in set up, but unlike chess insofar as it doesn't seem to massively benefit experience - everyone is working from the same information each game, but it's a bit different. I'm sure of course that experience helps, but I usually feel that by the end of a single short game my opponent has 'caught up' with anything I've learnt from previous games... and that makes this really exciting!

Let me first start by saying I do not like abstract games, nor do I find much innovation in games that rely on variable piece movement on a square grid. I've just seen sooo many attempts by new game designers to recreate chess as the only viable way to make something "new".

Now all that said, Onitama is greatly helped by a very sleek look, easy intuitive gameplay, variable gametates (the first time I encountered this with these type of games), and fast gameplay. I can very much respect this as a valid addition to the genre.

While Onitama is not a game I would ever purchase, likely not need to play again, it is very solid and something folks ought to really try once. Many will likely be hooked!

Onitama is a two-player, perfect information abstract game with a random starting set-up. On a 5x5 board, both players start with five pawns on their side, with the main pawn in the middle.

Each player has two open cards that each display a possible move for any of his pieces. There is a fifth card that cannot be used by either player. On a player's turn, he chooses one of his cards, moves one of his pieces according to the chosen card, then replaces the card he used with the fifth card. The other player then chooses one of his cards, moves accordingly, and exchanges that card with this fifth card — which is, of course, the card the first player just used.

Moving onto one of the opponent's pawns removes that pawn from the game. Taking the opponent's main pawn, or moving your main pawn into your opponent's main pawn's starting space, wins you the game.

[b]Rating based on 5+ plays, 2 player[/b]
Crafted on 03/11/16 Onitama is a 2 player luckless perfect information abstract which is somewhat Chess-like in nature. Each player controls 5 pieces (1 onmyo or master pawn, and 4 students) and the goal of the game is to either capture your opponent’s onmyo by ‘The Way of the Stone’ or to occupy his starting temple space by ‘The Way of the Stream’*.  Movement is determined by cards, of which each player has a choice of two at a time. There is an additional card in play which replaces the card you used to move a pawn, while your used card then becomes your opponent’s replacement. Each game lasts about 10-15 mins. While simple, the game is fairly thinky as you not only have to work out which pawn to move with which of your cards, but also need to observe which moves your opponent can currently make, and which future moves you are handing them with your discards. 

I’m not really a fan of Chess or Chess-like games to begin with, and this is not a game that endears them to me. I love the idea of it, and I’ll play it, but despite winning several games I still always feel like I’m trying to get my head ‘round it. My gaming partner who [i]does[/i] love Chess thinks that the board is too small and that the gameplay is restrictive and limited because of that. There are definitely some combinations of cards that make the game feel very strange where you can only move at indirect angles if you don’t have direct movement forwards. This can make the game go on a little bit longer with all of the avoidance. With all of that being said, I’d play it on occasion, but had it been a commercial copy it would be sitting on the trade/sale pile. As it is, I have a simply awesome DiY copy and as such it will remain in my collection.

*As per the Arcane Wonders rules. The original Japanese rules are slightly different thematically and with regards to movement.

There was a weird setup where all the styles were just slightly different variations of moving to an adjacent space, except none of them could move directly forward, so it ended in a long drawn out stalemate of sorts. Could just be the way we played it, but it felt off.

Very quick set up, very few rules, nice components. Chess-like--but the card play varies your pieces' capabilities; and each game varies by the random draw of cards. For these reasons, and because each match is relatively brief, it's best to play several games at a sitting to give each player a fair chance.

Some matches can be dull if you happen to pick cards that don't allow many direct forward moves. A few cards seem to be very powerful, especially the Tiger. Most of the cards are relatively weak, allowing few options. Some commentators feel the game is simplistic, but I feel it's very subtle and complex. Planning ahead is both necessary and difficult--you can't be sure that you get the card you want in the right sequence; and, conversely, you may have to discard a dangerous card to your opponent.

A very well-thought-out game, with great replayability value.

This is a solid 1v1 abstract game.  The limitations put on the available moves and the fact that the limitations will be different game to game allows for the variety to remain high and to ensure the game doesn't get stale/solved over time.  Each game will be one you haven't played before or, on the off-chance you have, you won't remember the winning strategy.  You're constantly having to stay on your toes and think on your feet.  Well done.

There is a huge amount of variability with this game.  Like really huge.  Not the normal "a lot of variability".  I'd agree that it is chess-like, but instead of being about learning the history of the game, it is about figuring out ways to deal with new situations. Plays quickly (at least for newbs!) and it comes with a nice neoprene mat and decent figures.  I dunno... it could go up in ratings with more play, I wouldn't be surprised.

What a nice surprise!  I don't like abstracts but this does away with a lot of the problems I have with abstracts, namely the static, unchanging gameplay from game to game.  There's even a "theme" such as it is.  The compact package, roll-out mat, and cool little pieces just add to the charm.  You can knock out three games of this in no time flat.  

It takes a special game in a genre I don't like to get my attention, and this is one of them.

An interesting idea for an abstract, but part of me wishes there was more development here- maybe a more fleshed-out game? And there's something a little tedious about having to continually scan your cards, your opponents cards and the common card to make sure you don't make that ONE WRONG MOVE! And that's what this game feels like: highly tactical with any sense of strategy being more of a headache than anything else. Move around pieces until you slip up and then your opponent goes for the kill. That being said, it's an interesting design and I like the components (even if it's overproduced). But way too tactical for my liking.

This game is probably the closest you will get to Chess while being very simple. The action cards creates variability in the play and the theme is nice, using an eastern style and zodiac type names for the actions. Good component production

Very easy to jump into and play. There is some planning/forward thinking but it's probably only a few moves in advance and the actions are very simple in this game

This game is more abstract than most abstract modern boardgames so take that into account when deciding if you might like this or not.

 Essentially a dumbed down hybrid of chess. But that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The game is fun and light to play if one isn't in the mood for a heavy game of chess or other abstract game. The game moves very quickly, and the cards used in the game make for interesting decisions. That is the heart of the game- watching the cards your opponent has, & figuring out what he/she might do with pawns the next turn or two.  You really can't look too far ahead in this game because you don't know what cards they will have, but I guess that's an advantage to this game.

It feels like fast chess, which is great because my biggest complaint about chess is its speed. The reason that it's so much faster is two-fold. Firstly, there are much fewer options, especially at the start of the game. You only have 5 pieces, only a 5x5 grid and only 2 movement options. I think limited options are great fun in abstracts and as the game continues the options decrease. The second reason that it's fast is because while it's completely non-random after set-up, you can't plan ahead too many turns because some your options are decided by you opponent. That's a brilliant mechanic and it works really well. The game is also highly replayable with all the different cards and the production is beautiful. The reason it's "only" a 7 after all of my praise is only because I'm not usually a big fan of abstracts.

I am giving Onitama 8.5 because this game is something I shall be playing this game very often and will be delighted to teach others as well, it's notoriously simple to set up and to teach and it was a pleasure to play too.

I loved the artwork, the calligraphy on the move cards and the playmat is just simply great and lends a lot to the theme of the game. People often compare this to chess, but it isn't chess, except the part where you move towards your opponent and you cut your opponent's pawns (students).

I would go ahead and say that this is simpler than chess to teach and play. 
But don't get me wrong, there is a complex game that hides in this simplistic gameplay.
You really need to think 4-5 steps ahead before you move.

Overall, loved it - highly recommend it. Can't wait for the Sensei's Path expansion.

RATING: 8
Wonderful abstract game that is very easy to teach and flows very nicely. The moves you can do are on cards, and when you use them you hand them over to our opponent. The matches are short but full of interesting mind games.

Of the 16 available moves (and 2 extra promos), you only use 5 per game, so there's no way to develop a dominant strategy since it might not even be possible on the next match. They also add a lot of replayability-

Tiny enough to quickly hit some of the deep weirdness of the movement mechanic (that's a good thing).

Downsides: The weirdness also sometimes means it takes your dumb mistake a while to play out even after you've realized it was dumb. And some combinations of spirits are less interesting than others. But both of these are nearly nullified by games being short.

Recommendation: Teach it with the Japanese theme (two creepy siblings animating puppets with magic) instead of the US theme (generic martial arts), and turn the small pawns around to face their master for extra creepiness.

Like the variability based on cards drawn. This creates a modular aspect to the game that makes it an exercise in adjusting approach based on a new environment each game. I like this in principle but the game feels similar regardless because it seems to be highly tactical vs. strategic. Perhaps this will change. The coolest feeling generated is the tension when you know you may be giving your opponent the tool needed to destroy you. Again, this is a great element but it doesn't feel as dramatic as it could - perhaps both of these "drawbacks" are due to the concise nature of the game. It's highly  paired down and is therefore brief and lean - maybe I am missing what would come with a bit more of a dramatic arc to the game. It feels like a duel/dance but one that jumps too quickly from setup to climax...where's the building tension? Perhaps what contributes to this is the metronome like way that cards are circulated from one player to the other...you can hold back a card and keep it out of play, yes, but so far this hasn't led to big cymbal crashing moments. It feels more like a quick war of attrition - first to make a mental lapse is the one to lose..maybe like end game scenarios in chess (not a chess player but am stretching to describe this experience).

This is a delightful little game! Picked it up on a whim at a net runner tournament and ended up playing it late into the night in the hotel room.

Its a hard one to rate for me as I don't feel like there's anything wrong with it and I love basically everything it does, but I can't push it higher than an 8 as it's not something that will go down in my playing history as one of the best games I ever played - there's just not enough meat on its bones for that. However, that's not a fault of the game, it's intentionally a small quick interesting game.

Brilliant!

RATING: 9
Similar to chess but each game is different.  This game also is significantly shorter than chess as it is played on a 5x5 board instead of a 10x10.  And because of the variety, it is harder than chess to just develop a winning strategy that works every time, but you have to adapt to the cards that are available.  Good of you have someone who likes chess but is so good at it than he/she never loses.

RATING: 8
Onitama shows an excellent way to inject some randomness and variety into an abstract game, while still keeping the overall feel of a deep strategy game since both players have perfect information. 

This variety is provided by a random set of "move cards" chosen before each game. Those are the only ways that pieces can move. This means that some of the tactics will remain the same game to game, but others will not. But these cards provide more than just a variety of possible moves. By using one of the moves, you lose the ability to use it again and grant the ability to your opponent to use it again. So while a certain move may provide an advantage for you, in the long-term you may not want to allow your opponent to make the same kind of move. 

For such a quick-playing and small game with few pieces, there are several layers deep into the strategy you can go here. The production values are excellent as well, which really does matter, as a large part of the appeal of abstracts is in their aesthetic.

Ontiama works well as "the only game you play" or a simple diversion for two players. That wide appeal is not easy to achieve in games of this ilk. I am continually impressed by this game, even though it isn't really my favorite style of game to play.

Interesting mechanic but it didn't pan out well for us.  Each player would horde any 'good' card to prevent the other player from having access to more powerful moves meaning the same cards with comparatively simple/boring moves were the only ones being used.  It ended up feeling more like a game of chess with slightly more powerful pawns, but pawns nonetheless.

RATING: 5.5
This is my favorite Chess-lite. The gameplay is really smooth and easy but still has the opportunity for a little bit of forward thinking. Unfortunately there is a veil of depth here: you usually can't move pieces more than one space forward which removes the tenseness of games like Chess and even Hive where you can make big moves. There are no big moves in Onitama. That said, the depth of the game is in the subtlety of taking advantage of your opponents limited options. I like it mostly because it's got a Chess feel but can be played while watching TV. It's definitely not a deep game but one with enough subtleties to stay fresh. Instead it's a straight forward but quick and enjoyable Chess alternative.

Wow - I am very impressed by this game, not least because I tried to design something similar a little while back and failed miserably. The rules are somewhat vague in some respects, but it wasn't difficult to interpret them in a meaningful way. My board was slightly warped, but other than that, I am very happy with the pieces as well. 
This little game could become a modern classic in the abstract two player category. Very simple to explain, you can start playing after a minute or two. But with the 15 cards involved, no two games will be alike, and there will hardly be anything like a standard move. Experience will help, but experienced players will have to study the situation in each game as well, and their advantage might not be as big as in other games.

Highly recommended; it plays like chess but with an emphasis on judgement rather than strategy memorisation. The only issue with it is one of aesthetics. The art is clearly early chinese and the martial art is obviously based on kung fu with it's heavy imitation of animal movements however the box and manual both claim that Onitama is set in ancient Japan, as though the publishers thought it would sell better. Still, an elegently simple game (I learned how to play while waiting for others to finish their turns in another board game) that I will be playing over and over.

A very good Chess-like game with very  deep tactical choices and very quick play. This should be almost any abstract game player library for a warmup or quick pickup game.  Or, even for something to keep you fresh while waiting for your next game at a Chess tournament!

For everyone else, this game should be in your library if you have a good friend that loves abstracts but you get tired of them without quick action.

I had a brief look at this in my FLGS so many times, then bought it yesterday on a recommendation. It's sooooooo good, I was really taken aback. Very interesting a creative gameplay, lots of variety despite looking rather basic in appearance, super-quick rounds so it never gets dry or annoying when you lose, gorgeous production too. We absolutely love it, I can see why TV put it in the 'essentials' list.

Picked up at B&N on Saturday and played about 5 games.  It's a beautifully designed game, from box to components, including the artwork.  Very impressive packaging design and a nice addition to the collection.  Play is good and requires strategic thinking but at times the limited moves could make the pace of play slower than ideal.  Most available moves are one ahead, back or diagonally with some exceptions.   A game played with such cards only could be frustrating.   However, we have taken an aggressive approach to the game play and have found it speeds up pace and overall enjoyment.

Chess like. Each player has two cards in front of them, each of which lists a number of valid moves. When you take one of the moves, the card you used goes to the center and you get the card that was in the center for your next turn. So, there are only 5 cards in each game, selected from a deck of cards that come with the game. You're trying to capture the other player's master or get your master to their home base. Only five pieces per player, one of them the master and the others not. Any one of the five pieces can move on a turn and you can capture a piece by landing on it. Kinda cool, but too chess-like for me.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (May 2016)

I haven’t heard about the game before playing it, so I didn’t know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised by it.

Onitama is a two player abstract game, It is reminiscent of Chess, but it is a lot simpler and quicker. It is also reminiscent of The Duke, but it is a much better game IMO.

The rules are very simple, you can explain them under 3 minutes, however the game is more deep than I initially thought it would be.

Arcane Wonders did a great work with the packaging and components. They are of great quality and the pieces look gorgeous on the table.

I love that is has zero luck after the variable setup AND I also love the variable setup, guaranteeing a huge replayability factor.

Bottom line, Onitama is an ok to good two player game. I will probably buy it in the future but I need to play it more to see if it really is for me. It has the perfect ratio of game length Vs. depth. Perhaps it can get an upgraded rating from me with more plays.

I like this one.  It's a quick little abstract that I can take to the coffee shop with the girlfriend, or pull out for a 10 minute game with my son before bed.  The variable cards present you with a slightly different play experience every time.  

One of the positives for this game is that I am no good at spatial puzzles, whereas my son is.  He can see moves I can't, and it means that he can beat my with good tactical play.  It's nice to play games on an even footing with him.

Conversely, it's got very little depth, and I find that two evenly matched players can make for a game that wears out its welcome as players jockey for one or two cards, unwilling to take the risks that will break the game open.  Games like this can come down to which player blinks (read: gets bored) first.

Such a solid little game that sets up in probably about 30 seconds.  5 move-sets per game only so all information is known.  The mouse pad board is nice, pieces are nice, but you'll want to definitely sleeve those tarot-sized cards so they don't get damaged.  You do ALOT of swapping those cards around during the game.

Chess is a fantastic game. However one of its poblems is that it tends to only work well with similarly matched opponents.

2018-01-26 - 6 - Quick, clean and clever abstract strategy game, where you give your opponent the move you just used. I want to play it again, because I suppose we didn't draw the most interesting set of cards. It has a potential for a higher rating.

RATING: 4
Played with pyarmids and homemade cards. The problem with this game is that the flow is off. You spend a lot of time flicking your eyes between your cards, your opponent's cards, the one exchange card, and the board. That makes it feel like your attention is always uncomfortably divided, so you can never deeply concentrate. It would be better if you could just look at the board and plan a move. There are more fluid 2-player strategy games perfect information out there, like [thing=20269][/thing] and [thing=316][/thing].
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very quick two-player abstract game which reminds me a bit of The Duke.  Cards decide how your pieces move, and once you use a card to move one of your pieces, that card then goes to the center of the table, where your opponent will then get it next turn.  It definitely adds a new dimension to the game when you know what move you are basically giving your opponent to use against you the following turn.

Want to grab this at BGG Con if it is available.  The release date per Arcane Wonders is October this year, 2015.  They are going to change the board and the pieces a little bit (mahjong tiles?).  It just looks like a neat game.

This game is a surprise hit! It feels like the best part of playing Chess--thinking out your moves with a few key pieces and figuring out how your opponent will counter--only it plays in under 10 minutes. It's quick, can be explained in about a minute, and lends satisfying depth to the small board. The variable setup ensures that each game will play differently. Definitely a hit.

My brother got this for me for my birthday, totally unprompted, and it's turned out to be a really good addition. 

Onitama solves most of the problems that make me hate Chess (sorry, chess-lovers), namely the fact that most chess players tend to play like it's a pissing match of who can predict more moves and/or who has memorized certain set strategies. Being as I don't feel like my personal value is dictated by my ability to hold a ridiculous amount of spacial information in my brain while looking really pompous, chess has always greatly annoyed me. Onitama *does* still incorporate spacial strategy and future thought, but with enough randomness to be interesting, and enough simplicity not to become a pissing match. 

The game components are fairly nice - if I were the type to paint minatures, I would definitely get some to replace the standard plastic dudes, as they're kind of creepy and not that well-made, but given the game's price range they're perfectly adequate. I am kind of amused that the game board is basically a giant mousepad, though. My social justice side finds the theme a little culturally appropriative/stereotyped, but it honestly could be a lot worse, and at this point games appropriating Japanese themes is so par for the course that I should probably stop wasting my brain power getting annoyed by it. On the flip side, the artwork is nice.

Like Hive, the two-player aspect has pluses and minuses - Onitama is a worthwhile addition to the couples-game lineup, and helps redeem me as I am better at Onitama than Hive compared to my husband, but on the flip side I can't see it getting played very often outside of that context. It's also less portable than Hive, although again, it doesn't find its way into the game bag to go very often. 

I can see a lot of potential for expansion (I know a couple expansions exist, and haven't looked into them), as gamplay will probably see decreasing value once we've actually played most of the permutations at least a couple times, and I hope to see both different move cards, but also different board configurations and maybe some special rules added. At the same time, the simplicity is really appealing. 

My brother, who is an avid practitioner of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, assures me that this game actually does a really good job of emulating the strategy and experience behind actual martial arts, which I can't confirm personally, but definitely believe. For that reason, I do think this is a really excellent game for the one or two other people besides my brother who are both serious martial artists and also board gamers. (I jest - I'm sure there are whole dozens of you!)

An interesting take on the chess variant style of game. Each piece can move in several ways dictated by the movement cards you currently hold. Each time you take a move you discard it and take a different one. There is some good planning to be had here, but still simple enough to be accessible.

A cleverly randomly-generated chesslike, keeping things elegant by allowing everything to use one of two randomly-dealt moves, with the moves cycling between players when used.

I really wanted to like this game a lot. The concept is great, the variability is excellent, but my goodness does it drag. I have played it 3 times with a couple of different people and each time there has been a point on the game where I wonder, how long is this going to take? Both of the people I played with reported feeling the same. I hope it gets better, but I am a bit disappointed. 

Could just be that we all suck at the game.

Update: played with a few other people who purposefully handed me the winning card just to end the game. Not good...

I have read several descriptions of this game that say it's like a light, short version of chess. I do enjoy playing chess, even though I am not very good at it. With Onitama I just didn't feel it. I have only played Onitama a few times, but because the cards change in every game, it doesn't seem like I can really get better at it after the first few plays.  The changing cards are the main reason that to me Onitama feels nothing like chess, and why I don't find Onitama to be very interesting.

RATING: 7
A game that is very reminiscent of chess, but with variable movement abilities for each and every piece on the board. Players take turns moving a piece with one of their 2 movement cards and exchanging the used one with a communal one. The first player to kill the other player's "king" or get one of their "pawns" in the space the "king" started in is the winner. Very solid and quick tactical abstract game.

This is chess light but also a lot more than that. I do however love chess, but my wife does not so it does not really hit the table for us anymore. This one my wife actually enjoys as much as I do so that is always a plus for me. The ability to see what your opponents next possible moves are, makes for a lot of tactical thinking and the choices of using a card but then also having to take into account that you are now giving that card to the other player is great. Very good abstract game.

Onitama is a two-player, perfect information abstract game with a random starting set-up. On a 5x5 board, both players start with five pawns on their side, with the main pawn in the middle.

Each player has two open cards that each display a possible move for any of his pieces. There is a fifth card that cannot be used by either player. On a player's turn, he chooses one of his cards, moves one of his pieces according to the chosen card, then replaces the card he used with the fifth card. The other player then chooses one of his cards, moves accordingly, and exchanges that card with this fifth card — which is, of course, the card the first player just used.

I'm not a big fan of chess. Never get into it much. But Onitama is like a modern, slick and fun variant of it. You always got the choice between two move patterns and try to break the other player by capturing his figurines. It's fantastic! Everybody should try it at least once. You can explain the rules in about 3-5 minutes and play it with friends, family and your gaming buddies.

RATING: 8.5
[First thoughts: Man, this insert. It's perfect. Love how the box can be stored both vertically and horizontally, really nifty what with how small it is. The mat is as good as I expected, which is great since it's a mousepad-style board (hard to be ruined). The pieces look great. They probably could have been even more efficient with space, but it would have been harder to set up (if they had an insert where they put the mousepad rolled up underneath the figures it could save a few cm, but the way they have it is so much better for accessibility. Can't wait to play it.]

This is a game that has done a great job making a chess-like mechanic feel easily accessible and less daunting. You can tell this game is replayable after the first game, which I immediately wanted to play again. I enjoyed the game a lot, it really surprised how strategic this game was due to its small size and the limited options you have a turn. It's clearly not a game that you'd want to play for 3 hours straight, but give me 30 minutes and I could easily play 3-5 games of this (depending on the person I am versing of course). Great quality game in terms of both components and gameplay mechanics.

This game is really clever with its constantly rotating possible card configurations, and presumably has very high replayability with the the number of different combinations of movement, but it doesn't really bring a sense of excitement.  And sure you could say that to some degree about most abstract games, but a lot of them also have more progression of having more pieces to capture and possible cat and mouse chasing of certain pieces, or the board gradually being filled up, etc. Here, the pieces move so slowly that it just feels kind of anticlimactic when things happen.

[microbadge=131][microbadge=1256]

Nice twist on the general abstract-symmetrical-checkmate formula that has existed in many forms, including (obviously) Chess.  Onitama has a nice balance to it by simultaneously limiting your abilities while at the same time democratically allowing all of your pieces to function the same (wincons aside).  The game suffers a little from a forced one-for-one trade mentality, but that generally leads to a more interesting end game, so I forgive it.

An interesting filler game which plays a bit like chess.  It is much deeper than it appears on the surface.  You deal out two movement cards to each player and one in center, all face up.  These are the only movements you have and you play one card to the center and take the remaining card.  The other player repeats. You win if you either capture the other players master or move your master to the other players home.  If you like chess you will love this.  AP players or players who cannot tolerate ap should probably stay away.

RATING: 8
Fast paced abstract strategy game with really well designed components in a cool magnetic box.  Lots of variables in play, tense from start to finish.  It kinda reminds me of, and this is going to sound crazy, i know, Thumb War.  You're constantly jostling for position, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.  \And because of the small amount of pieces at your disposal, every strike is life or death.  Super fun.

RATING: 7
Nice two-player game that is quick to explain and quick to play. Simple, but with lots of replayability due to the huge variation in possible games, since each game will be using five movement cards selected randomly from a mini-deck of 16 cards.

Simple summary: there's a 5x5 board with each player having five movable pieces (four apprentices and one master) lined up at their egde of the board. Each player gets two cards, and a fifth card is placed "in transit". Each card shows a possible set of moves for a piece. Any piece can be moved in the same way. Whenever a player makes a move, the player swaps the card they used and the "in transit" card, meaning the cards keep getting passed back and forth between the players. The object of the game is to either capture the opponent's master piece, or place your own master on the opponent master's starting square.

Onitama's presentation is delightful, from the scultped pawns to the artwork on the neoprene board. The box is a weird size, but it's eye-catching as well.

The game inside is a solid light abstract. What makes it hum for me is the random setup, with only 5/16 moves available each game. It's hard to be sure based on one play, but I strongly suspect that every game will have its own unique tempo because of the moves involved.

For example, my first play had only one card with a straight-ahead move on it; that became the pivotal card in our mix. And even though I can't plan ahead in, say, Chess, I have no problem thinking ahead a bit in Onitama. Thanks to the way cards cycle, you always see what you're getting in two turns, and you know what you're going to give your opponent in two turns; it's really clever.

I'm looking forward to seeing how much depth Onitama has in subsequent plays.

A pretty great 2-player game. The way that the movement cards are randomly dealt out at the beginning of the game makes each game feel very different. What's cool is that each game even more different the better you get at the game. So the more you play the game, the more varied each game becomes, which is cool.

The game is pretty fast-paced, but will eventually come to a screeching halt when you realize that you have a very important decision to make.

I would definitely recommend this game to just about any consistent 2 gamers. It works best if you both advance in the game at about the same learning pace.

A game of chess with 4 pawns and 1 master. Instead of each piece given a predetermined movement, 5 movement cards (out of 20ish)are drawn pregame and any piece can move once of those. This allows for greater replay than chess and also that the strategy changes from game to game.

Video Review: https://youtu.be/awBmf7ATDj4

Onitama is a simple but deep 2 player abstract game that takes minutes to learn and sometimes play, yet gives back much more. Each player has four 'pawns' and one master and wins by placing their master on the opponents home space, or capturing their master. 

Each game you select 5 random cards that give you patterns for movement, two are placed in front of each player and one in the middle. All are face up. When someone plays a card they move it to the middle and take that card, that means you know every possible move right from the start. This creates an engaging tactical game that is beautifully presented.

If you are looking to have a light chess style experience with someone who does not know chess nor has the desire to learn, this may be your game.

Visual and a novelty but no reason to favour this over chess. Somewhat annoying to pass the cards back and forth and always orientating them. Game states can be deadlock and or 1-for-1 too easily.

Eh, prefer chess and other abstracts where movements stay consistent or are pictured on the piece itself. The flip flopping can be analyzed but I dont like how it keeps branching so its hard to plan long term imo...maybe im just inexperienced though. The idea is interesting and it plays fast and i like some abstracts but its just not my cuppa tea, this one. I think theres probably decent replayability at least though.

[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b]  This games really replayable since there are 16 different movement cards, and you'll only draw 5 randomly for each game.

[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b]  The strategy starts to catch on somewhat well as you play your first game, but I will admit when there are pieces all over the board it's difficult to determine what you want to do.

[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b]   This game can kinda avoid analysis paralysis because not many things can happen in one single turn.

[b][COLOR=#FF0033]Con:[/COLOR][/b] Certain creatures can be kind of boring if they're drawn together, like the horse and the boar. They don't have a lot of mobility and they keep the movements of characters a lot less sporadic.

[b][COLOR=#FF0033]Con:[/COLOR][/b] The box is awesome, but kinda problematic if you're short on space.

[i][COLOR=#33CCFF]Final thoughts:[/COLOR] Really good abstract, though, I've only had one play of it. I want to get some more plays in before really determining what I think of it.                [/i]

I wouldn't consider this as a 14+ years of age for this game, more like 8+. Super simple game for my taste. I would propose it as an introductory game to chess. Gametime typically only last a few minutes so a couple of games can be played per sitting (a race to 3 could be played in 10 minutes). Only for 2 players.

This is a game that I admire more than I enjoy, or want to play. Every game consists of a random selection of 5 of the 16 possible moves, ensuring every game rewards the player who is first to master the move combo's needed to create a winning board position. On a turn, you have 2 of the 5 move-cards at your disposal, meaning all your pieces can move like (eg) a knight or a pawn this turn. After your turn, that move-card moves to the opponent's in-tray, and you get the move-card that your opponent used last (which might be like a king say), so you get a turn's look-ahead as to the possibilities. The move-cards flow between the players like water flows down a babbling brook through a dappled forest ... for an abstract game, it provides a wonderful sense of Zen-style graceful martial arts, flowing from one move to the next. For all that, it still feels too abstract for me to want to pull it out and explore, but I can certainly see how it holds appeal to those who like this kind of condensed-board challenge.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very simple game with moments of deep thinking.

I get why this game is so popular. There are only 5 cards to deal with per game, but it's unique because you have to devise strategies on the spot based on the constraints of those 5 cards. I found that even if I had thought my move through, there were still times when my opponent would come out ahead... and I never saw it coming.

I played this with my brother the first two times. The first game lasted 40 moves and I got cornered. The second game lasted 4 moves because of ill-advised aggression.

Definitely something to bring out when you want a perfect-information abstract that is deceptively complex.

Update: Jenn likes this game by some miracle.

Exciting new abstract game with simple rules and fairly fast play style. Liking forward to play this a few more times. 

After playing it a few times I feel that this might not be a very tight game design... I'll have to try a few more times to find out for sure, but the cyclic nature of how you move your figures, whilst interesting in theory, seems like it might be a little counter intuitive, slowing down the game play and harming excitement.

It only replaces chess if you didn't particularly care for chess to begin with.  That said, I found it to be ok.  When I play an abstract, I like the gameplay to be smooth so that I can focus on the moves.  The constantly switching cards was a bit clunky.  The cards are what make the game, but the card shifting I found to be somewhat interfering.   I prefer the gameplay of the Gipf series when I am in the mood for an abstract.

It's like a weaker version of The Duke. Not that that's a bad thing, but if I had to choose between the two, it would be The Duke 100% of the time unless I only had 5 minutes to kill.

I don't like how easy it is to just keep bouncing back and forth. I wish the cards were more focused with moving you forward instead of just seeing who is brave (or dumb) enough to start the march forward. Nice components and super simple to learn/play, but falls a touch flat in game play.

2p abstract game that was getting a lot of attention a few months ago upon release. I had been curious about it and I saw it being played at SaltCon so I asked my friends to bring it over so I could give it a try. I have been on an abstracts high recently and this just didn't live up to my own hype. While it has come interesting ideas with the card movement, I still enjoy Santorini or Tak more of the recent titles. This game I would happily play again, but won't seek out to purchase.

This is a quick, fun, clever, well-produced, tactics-heavy game that I'm totally obsessed with right now and want to play all the time.

I think having dual win conditions makes for some great tension. Prioritizing one condition over the other may be critical to realize early on once the 16 choose 5 card combinations is known (half are symmetrical and half are asymmetrical, trending both left and right). The last game I played I lost by the seemingly less common enter-your-opponent's-temple-square condition and it felt like my opponent's Master was an NFL running back crashing through his offensive line of Students, dodging my would be tacklers before finally (and barely) diving into the end zone for a touch down. Exciting stuff!

The length and variability of this game is such that it feels best to play in groupings of 3 games, drawing new animal move cards each time. This way you will see all but one card in your best-of-3 match and have a meatier experience.

Hope this gets an app or online play somewhere soon!

RATING: 7.5
​A Chess-like game which owes a lot to The Duke, this is quicker and more varied than the former, much easier to get into and play than the latter. Five methods of movement per game (from a base 16), and only five pieces each on a 5x5 grid: the options are kept pleasantly low. As well as the on-board tactics, there are some to be found in holding and/or cycling the five cards as needed, and paying attention to what your opponent can and can not do after your turn. Love the roll-up mat, the cards, and even the odd shaped box. Great for kids; my only doubt would be longevity. Check it out, mate.

2P game.  Basic version of chess-like abstract.  All pieces move the same....the movement is determined by 5 cards (different cards in each game) which are rotated....each time you make a move you pass that card to your opponent.

You win by eliminating your opponent's king, or by moving your king onto your opponent's home square.

Such a great game.  Kind of like a simplified chess, in which you can force your opponent to only take certain actions.  Don't bother with the expansions, as the cards are not nearly as much fun as the base game.  They add a few completely useless cards like Turtle, which in one instance caused a no-win scenario for one of the players.  We went back and reviewed it and there was absolutely no way the one person could win because of the Turtle card's inability to move your piece forward (so you are unable to play it as your first action).  It was over in 3 turns.

This is a game that gets more and more interesting with more plays. I really like this and hope everyone gets a copy to play. 

The components and packaging are brilliant! I think the choice of plastic for the pawns is unfortunate however as they seem to have an unusual strong, unpleasant smell. It's no wonder so many people have turned to building their own editions. That said, I'd love to see more game boards printed on neoprene mats. they are a surprisingly practical choice. 

Gameplay is fluid and in a handful of games you begin to play at a moderately sophisticated level. The relatively short playtime is a virtue also - especially for those to get really invested in games over a long period of time. Losses don't hurt as much here. 

Highly recommend playing this, even if you avoid playing abstract games.

Fast, clean, extremely modular.  There is a lot of control over what your opponent can do, and a lot of fluidity.  The game is less about judging the power of pieces and more about setting up board states where the weird set of moves in play work for you better than your opponent, or using a weak move in an ok way so that your opponent is stuck with it.

It's an abstract game that is all about special powers -- a delightful combination.

If you are an experienced chess player that can see 5 or more future turns, do not play this. In most card draw configurations there is one card that provides a move different from the others, and the one who draws it will just sit on it for the whole game until able to make a game-deciding move. In many card draws it is just stalling until someone gets tired and makes an opening for the other player. After 10 games I have no interest in playing it further. If you can only see 2-3 moves forward I think this would be more fun.

Reminds me of Chess meets Tic Tac Toe somehow. It's an interesting abstract game, especially in how every game will have a different set of 5 movement options available. Being able to see what moves your opponent can make next turn with only 1 to 5 pieces available, and how your choice this turn will determine what moves he'll have the following turn, creates a puzzle that is much easier for players to calculate than more complex abstracts.  But this game jumps out at me as one that a computer AI could solve instantly, which isn't per se a bad thing. Ultimately it doesn't grab me much as someone who is not a big abstract fan, and I don't see it having sufficient depth to attract big abstract fans.

A great example of a handful of rules making a very elegant design. I also like how each game can feel pretty different because of the different subset of cards drawn. You have to pay attention not only to what you can do, but what your opponent can do, and what capabilities you will give to your opponent in two turns if you play a given card, so when is the best time to use it?

:thumbsup: Chess for people who dislike chess (like me). It stimulates your abstract reasoning skills in a fun way. No need to learn the tactical nuances of different playing pieces and their moves. You only have to concentrate on how to either capture the opponents Sensei, or get yours on the opposing temple. There’s only five moves every game, clearly depicted on cards, and you have to plan ahead which move you give/get two turns from now.
:thumbsup: Very fun graphic design, with a mousepad playmat and the kind of box you can easily store in what little room that’s left on your boardgame shelf.

Better than most abstracts that try to improve on chess by having some novel piece movements. The fact that you are passing the movement cards to your opponent makes for some interesting planning. Sometimes the draw doesn't have many interesting pieces and so a single powerful card gets stuck on one side because it's more valuable to retain as just a threat. I can't say I'd always rush to play this, but it's pretty good.

I don't usually play abstracts but this one seems to be a touch more interesting than many others: awesome production (love the box with its magnetic cover, the mouse pad board, the nice plastic pieces, and the oversized cards), simple and somewhat quick game play. I kind of wish the cards had movement images printed in both orientations so that both players could easily see allowable moves for all 5 cards. That would, of course, make the cards less pretty -- but more useful!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game reminds me a lot of another 2-player abstract strategy game called The Duke.  In this game each player has 2 tiles in front of them showing different movement patterns and there is one more card off to the side.  On a player's turn they move a piece according to one of their 2 cards then exchange that card with the one off to the side so each player's movement options are constantly changing among the 5 possible options.  The goal is either to take the opponent's large piece or get your large piece to the opponent's large piece starting space.

I like this concept.  My copy came with 15 or 16 cards so there are a variety of different movement combinations your game can have.  The production is also beautiful with chunky plastic pawns and a think mouse pad-style rollup mat in a stylish box.  It is also super easy to teach the rules to anyone.

I simply find this, like a lot of abstract strategy games, a bit dull and boring.  I never feel much excitement or tension from these sorts of games.  Occasionally I do and I love games that offer that like Tigris and Euphrates but this one like the vast majority of these types of games just don't offer that.  Plus the 5x5 play area feels very cramped.

This is really a case of this game is for the right person.  It is accessible to everyone but many will find it a bit unexciting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Not a bad game.  Not great either.  Adults could enjoy this but I can really see this shining playing with your younger kids.  Easy to grasp the strategy but requires planning.  I like that the cards are exposed.  My issues with the game and my wife's opinion as well was that it failed to grab us unlike Blokus.  I can see this coming out on rainy days during our yearly beach vacation to occupy a couple of people before a larger group game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In chess the movements for each piece are predefined, in this game, there are 5 possible movements (randomly selected each game), of which you only have an option of 2 each turn. These movement cards are an interesting twist, but this game is still too much like chess for me. I also don't play 2 player only games often, so this hurts it's rating for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Onitama is a solid game. It offers something similar to chess, but plays much quicker with an emphasis playing very carefully, since the first mistake is usually enough to doom you. Games can be both quick... and drag a bit. It's hard to explain until you try the game, but even if a game lasts 20-40 minutes, players can play too carefully, hold on to dangerous cards like the Tiger or the Dragon, and with the limited movement offered, can give the feeling of standing still and observe one another.

It's beautiful and well-thought, a great addition to a collection, just don't buy the expansion, which just adds a few cards, rather similar to the ones here (there are enough already).

This rating is based on my first play of the game.  I am not a big fan of chess; never really was.  This game is very chess-like in it's execution, but is way more enjoyable, in my opinion.  For one, the game is very fast, even at it's longest it should not take more than a few minutes.  But also the way that the pieces move by way of the cards is really intriguing, especially as it means that no two games will be the same.  A definite winner in my books.

My current favorite 2p filler game, don't expect this to change soon. Fast, exciting, accessible (can play with my heavy gamer friends as well as my 8yr old son, which is a huge plus to me), onitama really strikes gold with a minimalistic ruleset, high replayability and short playtime (~10 minutes brainburner).

It all manages this by using the opponent to set your board. Making it really key to watch what you'll give him in order to force him to give you what you need at the right time, on top of the card driven area control part.

Highly recommended!

I often say that Small World is a Risk killer because it is so similar yet fixes so many issues with that game.  In that same sense, this game is a Chess killer.  Not that Chess is a bad game, but for me the competitiveness in Chess and skill is at a level too far beyond normal human beings.  Onitama really flattens the skill level between two players by focusing on a smaller number of pieces and only a few limited moves that change as time goes on.  

There is a small amount of randomness at game setup (the moves you can make) which also helps mix things up.

A faster, more streamlined version of Chess that still captures the feel and tactical choices of Chess. While simpler it still manages to produce the complexity of Chess through the variable setup. All possible moves are available to players at some point in the game, so there is an added dimension of timing. Some of the more complex combos and strategies that are available in Chess may not be available in Onitama, but the pay off is a variable game without the long, drawn out end gameplay and quicker to the punch. Ultimately I prefer it to Chess.

This game is outstanding. Simple to learn, difficult to master. It is constantly changing in the sense of what moves you can do and when you can do them. In the same vein of Chess or Checkers but with a totally different twist. I really enjoy the simplicity yet depth of play. I recommend this game to anyone who appreciates strategy and critical thinking. Game play can be fast or it can take some time. A must have for any serious gamer.

I really love the whole production of the game as well, from the box to the play mat and pieces. The cards are large with great art and flavor text. Everything fits well into the box with plenty of space for the expansion. Top notch on quality! ! !

Interesting take on the chess type of games. I like the changing cards that determine the moves of the pieces, and that the game plays reasonably fast. However, to me Onitama does not feel as deep as the traditional games in the Chess family. Thus, it is a good, light, fast-playing supplement to my other chess-like games. I would prefer Onitma over [thing=36235] [/thing] anytime!

Played a homemade version (the Arcane Wonders version hasn't been released at the time of this comment). I'm not a big fan of abstracts but this one is pretty fun and seems to allow for some clever moves because of the cards. The fast play time is a plus, and it seems like you would want to play best of 3 or best of 5 each time.

Note that you can easily play this game on any 5x5 grid and using just a few pieces. A cheap chess set would work fine. Each side just needs four pawns and a king. The cards for both versions are posted here: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1538872/difference-both-editions. You can just print them out as is or make your own.

Like chess, only fun!

Love the idea of all pieces being able to move the same, but the moves you can make are limited to the two movement cards you have depicting a specific pattern. You have only two options and only 5 (starting) pieces, so it's very simple.

But! The movement you make means you now give up that card. Your opponent will get that card next turn. Have you given them an advantage? No matter, now you get the card THEY used on their last turn. Brilliant. You absolutely have to think multiple moves ahead, but there's a lot of uncertainty and many considerations to be made that prevent you from being able to do that in any kind of straight forward way.

Even though the word "zen" has become cliched and meaningless in the modern western vernacular, I want to use it here to describe this game.

About [thing=160477][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
Is an abstract, two players game. It has perfect information with a randomized set up, which means a tad of luck in the distribution of the starting cards, but after this point, no luck.

It occupies a small table space, has great components and has an amazing gameplay. But we sure take much more than the 10-15 minutes of playing time to finish the game.

It seems like a timeless classic, while truly being a new game.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
As per the description: each player has two open cards that each display a possible move for any of his pieces. There is a fifth card that cannot be used by either player. On a player's turn, he chooses one of his cards, moves one of his pieces according to the chosen card, then replaces the card he used with the fifth card. The other player then chooses one of his cards, moves accordingly, and exchanges that card with this fifth card — which is, of course, the card the first player just used.

Moving onto one of the opponent's pawns removes that pawn from the game. Taking the opponent's main pawn, or moving your main pawn into your opponent's main pawn's starting space, wins you the game.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
- Which card to use - considering several things: your remaining card, your opponent cards, and not only where and who to move, but also that the card used will be given to the opponent;
- Which piece to move;
- Where to move.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Great production value;
- Beautiful gameplay;
- Complete control by the players once the set up is done;
- While we never finished a game in 10-15 minutes, is still a quick game;
- High replay value (as only 5 of the 16 cards are used in each game);
- Easy to teach and to play;
- Language independent;
- Competitive, but not heavily confrontational or vicious.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Only for 2 players;
- Strategy is present, but it also has a strong tatical nature;
- While it has a theme (and the movement cards have nice text and the patterns have some thematic relevance), it is truly an abstract game.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
It starts from looking at it, as [thing=160477][/thing] is a beautiful game - the mat, the pieces, and cards - everything done with a mix of simplicity and care. Then comes the smooth gameplay, making you feel like this game is one that has been around for a millenia, and you are just now learning about it - dammit, orient, to keep your amazing secrets so well! One might talk about how it represents well the use of the weapons of the enemy against himself - probably Sun Tzu played it. The sort of game that you buy to leave it set up on the shelf.

After grinding your mind against that of your opponent in a nice environment (as the play isn't truly mean or particularly combative), you go find some informations, and realize, baffled, that game still has the dew of newness (2014). Simply brilliant - it seems like a design that was waiting in everyone's mind, but as Columbus egg, was necessary for one to be the first to give form to the idea, and now that someone (Shimpei Sato) did it, it appears to be so simple and easy to be done.

I'm not particularly fond of competitive 2 players game, yet [thing=160477][/thing] impressed me very much. Clean, smooth, easy, smart - perennial.

Fantastic game. I try to avoid buying games that my friends already own, but this one became an exception right after my first game at a friend's place. It has an obvious chess-like feel to it, but the rotating moves between players and between games keeps it fresh. The lightning quick set up is also a plus and even the box is top notch.

20+ games in and still enjoying this as much if not more than when I first purchased it.

Played at Gen Con 2015. I'm not an abstract strategy gamer but this game was awesome in the simplicity of rules & setup compared to the complexity and options in play. It's a perfect information game, but the constantly changing pool of moves kept things engaging and interesting for me. Also games went by quickly (5-15 minutes each for the 3 games I played with another novice). Plan to buy when it's available.

A shogi insipired game that is a simplified version of Navia Drapt. I used to own Navia Drapt and the game was an excellent hybrid of Shogi and Summoner Wars all roll into one. Onitama borrows heavily from these games by reducing the game board to 25 squares, 2 types of playing pieces (a single king and 4 pawns) and 5 possible movement types that alternate between players. The result is an excellent, short and tactical two player game. I really like the simplicity of Onitama, but am wary how much one can plan ahead. Perhaps more plays will reveal better short term tactics that I am presently quite ignorant of. Still, to enjoy this game, one has to enjoy playing Shogi-style games, something that my spouse happen to dislike.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Such a simple but intuitive game. People tend to liken it to Chess, but too me it feels a little bit closer to Shogi, because the pieces tend to move shorter distances than in a game like Chess. Very cool.

This isn't a Lords of Waterdeep, Carcassonne, Ticket to Ride, or Mystic Vale.  It's not a big, meaty game or something you're going to pull out every time you want a gateway for new gamers.  However, it is a really unique game that does what it does very well.  It's a fantastic 2P game that almost takes the game of chess and simplifies it...but then cranks up the difficult again.

You don't need to memorize anything in Onitama.  Every game is different.  You'll have different cards, which show which moves you can make, available in every game.  One game you may have no cards that let you move straight forward and another game you may have none that let you move sideways.  Sometimes you'll have cards that favor bigger moves (2 spaces at a time) and others favor smaller moves.  Most often you'll end up with a mix.  Having your  moves locked to a pre-determined set of 5 cards is what makes this easy.

The fact that your available moves change every hand is what makes it hard.  You might want to use a certain card to put yourself into a good position for your next round - but realize the card you'd be giving up would let your opponent capture you.  Trying to think 2 or 3 moves ahead can cause a lot of AP, but this sort of game is prone to AP so that shouldn't be surprising.

We've had games last 5 minutes...and games last nearly an hour.  It's a lot of fun either way!  It's easy to sit down and teach someone in just a couple minutes.  It is a small box that travels easily without too many pieces to worry about losing.  You could easily take this when traveling, if you want a game at the office, or if you want a game at the coffee shop.  Because it's so easy to teach, you can play with just about anyone you can find who is interested.

Is it our favorite game?  No.  Do we pull it out every time we have a game day?  No.  But it's something absolutely worth keeping in our collection because there's nothing else quite like Onitama!

A quick and simple chess-like game for two players. Extremely easy to teach but hard to master. Replay value is off the roof with this one.

The design on the cards, pieces and especially the playmat is great but the production quality of the pieces and cards leave something to be desired. The cards are thin and floppy and the pieces have a very uneven surface.

RATING: 6
Very very impressed by this chess-like spatial abstract. Onitama really epitomizes the concept of variable setup, as every game 5 cards are drawn (from a deck of 15) that determine how pieces can move. I can see playing this over and over as every combination of cards will make for a different game. I need to own this.

RATING: 8
Onitama is a chess variant, or more specifically an offspring of chess. Players have five pieces (one king and four pawns) and those five pieces all share the same five moves. The trick is that they all only have access to two of the five moves at any given time. When any piece uses one of the two moves, they gain the move their opponent used last turn as a replacement and likewise, the opponent gets access to the move the previous player just used. The moves circulate between the two players, over and over again until a King is either captured or manages to move completely across the board, to the opponent's side. 

It is simple, beautifully produced and an absolute must have for anyone that enjoys abstracts, particularly chess-based ones.

Growing up as a kid, my cousin was really big into chess.  I played hours of chess growing up, and that was the main board game that I played for years.  The biggest issue I had with chess was that the strategy was super heavy and the game went super long for what it is.  When I first played Onitama, it gave me the feeling of chess in a much FASTER and, less brain burning way.  I enjoy the simplicity of Onitama so much and it is a fantastic game that is elegant.  I love that the strategy is not just what your move is but, also what moves you give for your opponent to do.  Fantastic game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I really loved the idea of giving the moves to your opponent in quarto, but here you are doing that by using the move which creates all kinds of interesting dynamics and decisions. The game is simple but not easy and fast but replayable, because the setup is variable, which makes this my favorite* abstract game.

Japanese themed, two-player, perfect information, abstract strategy, minimal game. Be the first to get any one of your four monk pawns across a 5x5 grid to the opponents home square. Pawns advance by selecting one of your two movement cards. Cards named for martial arts styles like ox, rooster or monkey, clearly show allowable grid movement. The card played becomes available to the other player. Has a Gin Rummy feeling when you discard the card your opponent needed to beat you! Can play in less than 10 minutes. This is Chess-light which is just right for me. Perfect theme and I like their direction to produce with nicer quality as a coffee table style game.

This is a shorter, simpler and more variable form of chess. All pieces move alike but the exact moves you can make depend on cards randomly drawn at the beginning of the game.  These cards cycle to your opponent as you use them, which requires a new level of strategy and planning.  Despite this, it's an easier game to learn and teach than chess.

RATING: 8
Very quick to teach, doesn't take long to play, but still has nice tactical decisions. The execution is beautifull!
Only caveat is that I think there could be more crazy move cards, as to make the tactical options even more enticing (but that might have thrown off the balance).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I don't know how such a simple game can feel like a instant classic, but this one does. And you can quit reading this and order yours right now. You need to have this in your collection. 

It's basically 5-pawn chess, with two different move options (shown on cards)given to your pawns on your turn. All move options rotate from player to player, so each game only has 5 total move options in play. Whoever attacks the other "master" or moves into his "dojo" first is the winner. Sounds simple, but it's really fun! 

From the time you open the box, read the rules, and get set up, it's truly only 2-3 minutes. Games are quick as well - they average about 10-15 minutes. But everyone wants to play again after that first game. It takes a few plays for most people to realize you have to look at your opponent's cards to know where NOT to move your pawns, and those are usually the longer games.

My only gripe, and it's trivial - but the cards have grey and red symbols to designate which player goes first. But the pawns are BLUE and red, not grey and red. So they should change the cards in subsequent editions.

[microbadge=39352] Part of the epic PiFF I received from [username=burgsrus]

Onitama is an extremely strategic and tactical game where you’re trying to plan out how to get the upper hand in the match without giving too much away. Probably the most interesting part of the game to me is how you’re essentially handing off movement cards to your opponent that could be used to destroy you. If you have a movement card that you really don’t want your opponent to be able to use, you can hold onto it; however, that means you’ll be stuck using whatever card your opponent decides to give you. The two different winning conditions are extremely interesting as well.

RATING: 8
Rating based on 3 plays of the most basic 2 battles.  Much like Memoir & C&C Ancients I love this game.  Be fun to get into the more fantasy aspects as the first 2 battles are historical, but still great.

Played the 3rd battle with Goblins.  Enjoyed it but not as much as the first 2.  Hope my enjoyment of the whole game is not waining already...

Update: Rating 6->4

After picking up Call to Arms, what I had anticipated would make the game more satisfying to me, I am now over the Battlelore hype. CtA should've been included in the base game, and even then, it is still a very weak scenario generator. 

Upon seeing the new goblin and dwarf units (which cost $40 altogether, ouch!) I see that none of the expansions are going to add anything besides some pretty minor tweaks. Small changes in the boldness rules, minor alterations to attacks, etc. In other words, nothing new.

After playing some heavier wargames, I've come to realize just how small the decision space is for this game. After only a handful of plays, the tactics become trivial, and the lore cards don't hold any tension.

Very, very boring.

=========================

I am still really on the fence about this one. The lore cards don't excite me too much, and the three wings of the battlefield have always bothered me a bit. I think the lore cards could be made more interesting and balanced in such a way that they provide much more tension. As it stands they just feel like total chaos, particularly the Cleric cards. I do really enjoy the Theif cards.

I do enjoy the different unit types and the emphasis on formation with the boldness rules.

I still haven't tried the landmarks or Call to Arms, but I'm hoping those additions will bring the game to the level I want it to be at.

This combination of tabletop and normal boardgame has nice miniatures and a really good rulebook which makes the start quite easy even for beginners. Also the playingtime of about 90mins is compatible with non-gamers. But eventhough I only played a few games until now, I already find some rules to be too simple and not realistic enough.

The Command and Colors system is a fun system.  It gives you wargame feel without all the muss and fuss.  My main complaint about this game is the time it takes to set-up.  It's also a bit longer than it's predecessors just because there isn't much ranged combat.  Still, a lot of extra depth for the C&C system and the magic adds a lot of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Well, the Commands & Colors games keep getting better. After my first game I must say that I'm pleased. This is a game that demands to be played over and over again... hopefully I can rise to that challenge, as I think it will be well worth it.

Ich leibe dieses Spiel. Es bringt viel Strategie mit sich, aber man braucht Würfelglück. Es gibt sehr viele Variationsmöglichkeiten das Spiel zu spielen. Machtkarten und verschiedene Einheiten ermöglichen unaufhörlichen Spielspaß. Und mit diversen Erweiterungspacks hat man dann auch noch sinnvolle Ergänzungsmöglichkeiten. Am schönsten it es, wenn man die Figuren selbst bemalt hat.Das bringt richtiges feeling mit.

RATING: 6
I did play all the scenarios from the booklet. I did enjoy those but felt like the victory was more rewarding a good card draw than anything else. Playing without Magic is ok but with it, the balance is gone for ever... Nevertheless, to play with children or on occasion, the game is fun to play and enjoyable. I felt like I could do without and sold it... I don't regret it so far.

RATING: 7.5
I always enjoy playing this, though setup is a bit of a pain - finding those tiles and putting them where they need to be, then getting all the figures for each unit together.  That's the price you pay for modularity and all those unique plastic pieces, however.

The game itself is a lot of fun when played.  And I haven't even gotten into Lore usage yet.  

Demands more plays!

Very solid. It's a bit of a step up in complexity from Memoir '44 which I love. Haven't played enough yet to appreciate the full set of rules. Looking forward to more plays. The only down side right now is the set up time. Extremely long compared to the play time - even more so than Memoir in my estimation. I eventually traded it away for Smallworld - and it was a good move for my gaming crowd.

Very good, very good. Completely different to Memoir'44 despite being related. However, a couple of things kept bugging me:

1) All figures were grey in color, hence it was difficult to recognize them in a quick glance. Paintjob needed.

2) If the scenario has a equal balance, the player taking the initiative in attacking is always considered to be the underdog. Why's this? Because, you always have to keep your troops in formation or they're sent to peril and once you start moving keeping the lines takes considerable effort.

Update 2010/12/21:
3) Third thing buggin me is the inbalance between dwarves and goblins. Dwarves are just much more useful because they can operate alone. Goblins are just plain useless unless you're trying to hunt down a single figure on the board.

Maybe it's just me but somehow BattleLore succeeds in annoying me despite being a good game. Hence, I do not always want to play it but will never turn down a game instead. Battles at Epic scale are a different story.

After the first few games this seems to be a great game - components are of course top class, it is short enough to be played in one hour and rules are simple but yet allow room for tactics!

RATING: 6.5
From the same universe (commands and colours) I love much more Memoir. Battlelore has a nice thing (lore and magic) but the units don't have a big range and most of the time it all ends in the middle of the board. Battleback has some good parts and some bad parts and I don't like it. The colouring system drives me mad, in contrast with the simple system from Memoir.

RATING: 3
Well, it's just not all that....It tries to be so many different kinds of things that it seems pretty good, but it is pointless compared to Commands & Colors: Ancients.  It's okay, but the games rarely have any real tension, and there's really not much to the tactics.  Lack of leaders (as in Ancients) really hurts, and I doubt bolting Heroes onto it will matter much -- might as well skip this toy and go straight to Ancients.  

I've tried Epic a few times, and I do have to say it was more fun that way.  I just think that BattleLore and Memoir both suffer from feeling like there's too little room to maneuver.

Personally, I find Battleground Fantasy Warfare to be far better.  But now that FFG owns BattleLore, let's see if they can improve it....

Medieval fantasy, miniatures in moderation, tactical missions, and flexible expansions? Great!  This is another game that my wife has, surprisingly to me, actually enjoyed.  Perhaps it's the fact that you can only plan your moves so far into the future...  I've even got her considering painting the set!

This game is a big money grab that leaves me scratching my head.  Fantasy creatures aid the French and English in the Hundred Years War?  Yeah, that's pretty stupid.

Playing wise, it is a toned down [thing=14105][/thing], with tacked on Magic rules, which I admit are really cool and the best part of the game.  But beyond the magic, it is frustrating because C&C:A is so much better.  I don't think the Magic can carry the day.

Fantasy battles set in Medieval times. If you like Memoir 44 you should appreciate this. Solid mechanics and enjoyable.

Easy to learn and play game.  The combat system is simple and keeps the game moving.  However, combat is 'dicey' and also depends on the card draw.  Game length is short and the game allows only two players.  The components are of excellent quality.  Would like to have more plays.

In the Command and Colors series this is a worthy addition but not the  best of the 4 games currently released. Battle Cry had some problems and the system doesn't seem to work as well with modern warfare (Memoir '44). Ancients certainly is more streamlined while still employing some of the interesting formation elements and tactics. The creatures in Battlelore are cool and the war council/lore cards are a nice addition. But I think the 'cleaner' Ancients is maybe a better system. Also, it seems the lore cards in Battlelore inject more chaos into a game that already has a lot of luck. Still, Battlelore is an enjoyable game.

This is a beautiful game, with some problems. Setup almost takes more than the play. Lore cards are rather hard to tell apart. But the most infuriating thing is that the luck factor is significant. A particularly bad loss due to dice hate left an ashen aftertaste - dropped from 8 to 4.5.

A fun game where you have a hand of cards for orders you can issue across the sections of the battlefield, if you end up with excess right orders, chances are your opponent has excess left orders, which correspond to the same sections of the battlefield when you sit opposite of each other.  The main complaint with this game besides a huge luck element (which can be fun at times) is the incredibly long setup time (which is never fun).

A decent game, but oddly enough, the fantasy theme is almost a turnoff for me.  It's just a bit too much chaos.  I expect I'll enjoy the C&C:A implementation of this system much more.

Besides, I'm an "expansions" whore.  I can't resist expansions, for some reason.  And given how rarely I would play this game, and how little I enjoyed it, it just wasn't worth keeping.

RATING: 7
The Commands & Colors engine is a favorite of mine. It is quick to play (setup can take longer -- so play the scenario twice, once from each side), has a nice mixture of control and chaos, fog of war, and a good easy to learn/hard to master-ism. BL is just as good as CC Ancients, but I like the fantasy theme (and lore mechanics).

The basic game is probably an improvement over Memoir '44, but the improvement doesn't go far enough. I have doubts about the advanced game, since the Lore cards are not well integrated into the gamesystem. However this will fancy the fantasy buffs.

A bit more complex than Memoir 44. In my opinion Battlelore has better theme, better mechanics and feels more epic. Definitely the better game. Still it is a gateway wargame with cool miniatures and components. One of the most entertaining wargames I have ever played.

Have played a few basic games, only started to get into the strategy, and would be keen to see how some of the more advanced rules develop. But enjoyed it very much, seemed simple enough to be quick but complex enough to feel like a tactical wargame. (

RATING: 9
New release in the Command & Colors series. Interestingly, it plays VERY different from Memoir'44, one of my Top Ten games. Interesting gameplay, and the additions of Lore and the War Council are very well implemented (besides the problem with the level 3 UberPriest). It seems more luck based than it really is, because it takes some games to learn how to put battle formations to good use. Magic is important and affects your strategy but it's balanced and MOSTLY not game breaking. The Cleric is overly powerfull, though, to the point where several Cleric Spells need house rules, imho (although there seems to be no consensus on that matter). The Goblin expansions and the Hundred Years War are really cool as they allow you to deploy a completely Goblin Army and add several interesting units.

The design decisions about army customization in the Call to Arms expansion have been VERY disappointing.

(Rating downgraded from 10 to 8 then to 9)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.75
Probably the best of the Borg systems, which actually lend themselves more to melee and magic than "shooter" types of games. BattleLore needs more play to get a firmer rating and there are some ambigiuties about Morale and Retreats, but most of those issues will be decided by the impeccbale designer and Days of Wonder. My only concerns about its replayability are the over-reliance on using Days of Wonder's website for generating scenarios, meaning that 2 people cannot meet at a game store and independently sit down and ramp up a game using pre-formed armies. This is a game that will require scheduling and planning a session, closer to an RPG than a light wargame. As well, the rules are not going to be available in PDF, so rule problems will also require add-ons, not on-the-fly published revisions. With a game this complex and add-ons coming aplenty, a more versatile rules publication system would be in order.

I like the theme, components and magic system. I'm not a real fan of combat with dices, i mean, it is cool if i can play many games in one go..

I have reservations about the somewhat gamey, arbitrary victory conditions, but otherwise this is a solid, satisfying system. Set-up can take some time, but really - if you're pulling out a game like BattleLore, you've probably committed the afternoon to it already anyway.

Great components.
With medieval scanarios, when both players know basic tactics (i.e.: bold units), it's nothing more than luck game - luck in action card drawing and luck in dice rolling.
It's better in lore scenarios, but luck factor is still too big.
Anyway - great, light wargame for everyone.

Fun game. But I don't think I'll ever buy it as I have Memoir '44. Don't get me wrong I like a huge fantasy battle (except maybe when the army of the dead take down Mamukils in a Ghostbusteresque Visual effect fest) as much as the next geek but it just feels too similar. 
Battle back and the Morale rolls arereally good additions though.

This is a game that is neither a board or miniatures games, but a hybrid of the two.  The miniatures part is obvious while the board game part comes in the form of the straight forward rules.  There is nothing revolutionary in the game design, especially if you have played Battle Cry or Memoir '44, but the game does present some unique variations on previous editions of the rules.  The beauty of the game lies in the simple game play and its expandability.  The game opts for playability over simulation.  While dependent on luck of the dice, play does offer and require sound tactical considerations.  If you are a fan of visual games or games with bits, then this is a good candidate to consider.

So far it's been two sessions with three people and me missing every third game.

RATING: 8
I want to like this more, with C&C:Ancients being one of my few 10's, but I feel Ancients is the better game.  There is more of a sense of strategy with the Leaders in Ancients.  I also like the blocks better than the figures.  They're so much easier to move around.  A few times I've had my opponent's pieces end up straddling the line between my hex and his, and it takes a moment to figure out who's is who's because they are all the same.  Looking at the board is like looking at a sea of grey plastic.  The dice are annoying as well because it is difficult to tell the difference between green and blue hits at a glance, and I'm not color blind.  I don't want to seem too negative about the game as it is a good game and would probably rate higher if I didn't have Ancients. The magic system is nice and I suppose I could use the Ancients dice to see the results better, but I feel I have a better game already, so why would I want to play this?  Hopefully they will add leaders in an expansion.  I hear they are working on a "Heros of BattleLore" expansion which I hope accomplishes this.  That could raise the score a bit and bring the game off my shelf again.

Without lore cards it's inferior to C&C:A, with lore cards it's too fiddly for something this light and luck driven.  After many, many games of C&C:A, it's going to be hard to go back to this.

RATING: 9
First, I will point out that this only didn't get 10/10 because I think the 'Call to Arms' expansion should have been included in the main game (this expansions allows players to set up 'custom' armies instead of playing set adventures).

It's just fantastic! It is FUN. The designers got it Right. It is not overly complicated, simple, contrived, realistic, brain-bending, luck-based, strategic, long, short, deep, whatever. It's just a fine example of a game that 'works', in every way you would want from a game.

Technically speaking, the bits are are great quality and there's masses of them, the mechanics are fluid and clever, luck plays an intriguing but not overbearing role and nothing is really ever complicated but somehow it feels like a 'proper' wargame with terrain effects/ troop stats/ creature types etc all getting a shout.

The replay value is immense, with scenery setup, army selection, War Council selection, special terrain, new releases etc all giving you more choices than you can cope with in each setup.

Battlelore is full of beautiful game pieces and runs and the tried and true "command and colors" system.  The basic game is plenty fun (but seems to lack the tactical richness of GMT's Command and Colors: Ancients). 

However there are multiple expansion packs that are both affordable and expand the game play significantly.

The dark side is that those "affordable" expansions start to add up after a while :)

Edit:  damn these are some pretty components but I just don't think the game-play can stand up to Command and Colors: Ancients. It's hard to justify owning both.

Ez után a játék után a Memoir'44 nagyon leértékelődött a szememben. Szinte minden szempontból jobb a Battlelore, talán egyedül a téma az, ami a Memoirban jobban megfog. De egyébként teljesen más szintet képvisel a kettő. A Battlelore szabályának kb. negyede tartalmazza a Memoir'44 szinte teljes szabályát (minimális módosításokkal), A szabály többi része pedig rengeteget újdonságot hozzáad ehhez, teljesen más jelleget adva a Memoir-os alaprendszernek. Sokkal jobb lett a kockadobások mechanizmusa a 3 féle szín miatt. Ennek köszönhetően már a Battlelore kezdő küldetései (középkori kalandok) is jobbak, mint a Memoir. A haladó (fantasy) küldetésekbe pedig olyan új elemek is beépültek, amik teljesen más szintre emelik a játékot. A zsoldosok még kb. megfeleltethetőek a Memoir veteránjainak, de a szörnyek abban értelemszerűen nem ismertek:) (Ami viszont nem tetszik, az a pofátlanul tudatosan felépített lenyúlás, számtalan az alapszabályban előre bejelentett kieggel: az alapjáték pl. csak 1 szörnyet tartalmaz, a többit lehet gyüjtögetni, néhánynak már a képe is benne van a szabályban előre, hajrá:)
A játék igazi újítása a tudás megjelenése, ami egy teljesen új paklit hoz a játékba. A haditanács szintjeinek szétosztása nagyon sok taktikai lehetőséget rejt magában. Maga a tudás pakli pedig kimeríthetetlennek tűnő változatosságot ad a játéknak, és épp a Memoir talán legnagyobb hibáját orvosolja: ha esetleg nincs megfelelő parancskártyánk, akkor is lehet valami hasznos a tarsolyunkban, és nem ragad be a seregünk hosszú körökre.
A fentieken túl a morál is plusz színt hoz a játékba.
A 2 parti alapján kiegyenlítettnek tűnt a játék, 1 körön belül teljesítette volna a vesztes is a győzelmi célt.
Erősen ajánlott a megvétele, ha valakit nem zavar, hogy nyelvfüggő.

It has arrived.  Numerous bent figures in the mass rank and file trays.  Generally very pleasing, but I discovered quickly that Scenario 9 calls for two Hobgoblin Archer units when only one is provided in the game.  While it's simple enough to make up from spare Archer figures, and there is an awful lot here to proof, I don't ever remember this happening in a Commands & Colors-series game published scenario.  Overall it looks like heaps of fun once I'm done playing with hot and cold water to stand the lads upright.

The C&C system is probably the best out there for light, hex-n-"counter" wargaming.  BattleLore is the best looking, and eventually, will likely be the best developed of the games in this series released to date.

Out of the box, however, I believe it pales in comparison to C&C:Ancients.  C&C:A comes with a wider variety of full-featured scenarios, and the evade and battle back rules add tactical richness somewhat lacking in BattleLore.  Hence, BL gets an 8, where I rate C&C:A a 9.  I just feel that, without taking expansions into account, C&C:A is simply a better game than BL.

BattleLore's fantastic rules, fast gameplay, and subtle tactical decisions make this game a winner. However, I am no fan of the decision to combine the Historial and Fantasy battles together into the same setting. 

The game has grown a bit stale after repeat plays, as a result I've dropped the score slightly. It's still a very fun game, I just think it has not lived up to its potential. I'm hoping FFG will re-release this game and include the Call to Arms and Heroes components into race specific releases that contain unique figures. I'd also like to see some "quest" style adventures now that we have a system for heroes. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Adds magic (and off-board commanders) to the Battle Card Driven system.  While this adds some interesting decisions, tactically it's not up to the standard of Commands & Colors: Ancients. 

Additionally the various "magic" spells (eg the lore cards) are a killer as their power overides the tactical decisions and it basically becomes a competition in collecting (and using) the more powerful cards rather than a positional battle.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Appreciate: excellent game parts, very "real" feel, great diversity of the game introduced by multiple scenarios and the large variety of troops, capabilities, cards etc.; nice strategic opportunities offered by the interesting game mechanics.

Don't appreciate: setup is awfully long and cumbersome, attack does not factor in troop count, defense (except for battle back) does not exist so red troops are beatean just as easily as green troops.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I've only played the first a couple of scenario a few times. This is my first C&C game and I like the general idea of C&C mechanic. However, set-up takes too much time and there are a bit more rule details than I expected, even before using the lore.
I think the simpler C&C like Battle Cry or Memoir 44 would be better to me.

I wanted so badly to love this game.  While it's a game I will play again I just don't get all the hype.  Admittedly I only played the introductory scenario so my rating will likely change after Lore is introduced.  But, my problems with the game at this point are physical.  I found it hard to distinguish my pieces from my opponents.  In fact, at one point I ordered my opponent's pieces to fire on mine.  He missed the fact I was ordering his units and dutifully removed casualties and retreated towards his side of the board!

I am looking forward to playing again and introducing new units and Lore.

I usually dig fantasy themes but this game does absolutely nothing for me.  There are just too many things about the game that don't jive:

Maybe FFG will do something with the game that makes me want to revisit it, but for now, onto the trade pile!

This game comes alive when the full war council is added.  If you have any experience with gaming in general, don't bother with the first few scenarios, just jump in and use all the rules; there are not that many of them, and your enjoyment will increase tenfold!  My problems with BL is that the minis are about 50% bent and wonky, which can be remedied with the hot/cold water shock treatment, and that it is a PAIN to setup.

This is a fun game. I like the mechanics. They allow for a nice mixture of strategy and luck. This allows new players to be engaged and have a chance. Lends itself to memorable gaming moments in the heat of battle (or at the begining taking down a red with two archers on the first two rolls, how many times will you roll two reds twice in a row, only rolling two dice). The different expansions keep things different game to game. Also the community that plays this always is putting out new battle scenarios and rules which can make a fun evening. The only downside is the set up time, but I printed out another rules set so both sides can set up at the same time.

Goblin Skirmishers?  OOP.  Goblin Marauders? OOP.  Dwarven Battalion?  OOP.  Hundred Years War?  OOP.  Scottish Wars ...very soon to be OOP.

What will we have?  $15-$26 for 1-10 singular plastic figurines by fantasy flight games.  

The last I checked, this was a richard borg wargame, and not heroscape.  

All this wouldn't be bad, and I'd cross my fingers and hope for more in the future...but I guess the guy from fantasy flight games said, "don't hold your breath on the reprints" ...and it seems like they're focusing on battle of westeros more than anything right now.

Really, really disappointing.  Because I think the special races of armies were the best thing this game had in it...  better than dragons, creatures, or heroes.  ...and it seems like less than half the support memoir '44 gets.

04-25-10:  Ok, in hindsight...foresight...whatever.  Fantasy flight appears to give a hoot about this.  They're doing some good stuff.  A little overpriced?  Yes.  The right things for this?  I was wrong, and this is indeed a heck yeah.  The dwarves are too 'weak' as far as having a flavor, goblins are good, but the heroes, dragons, and creatures? AWE-SOME...  and they're republishing goblins.

Sold:  Basically it wasn't getting to the table, and I didn't see any reason why it would be getting to the table any time soon.

Memoir 44 plus creatures and magic?  It's as good as it sounds.  Superior to memoir in my opinion, but people definitely have their own preference.  It all comes down to whether you like WW2 or goblins and dwarfs.

RATING: 8
The culmination of the C&C system (so far). I like the game as it has just enough detail and depth to hold my interest but Is playable with my 7 yr old son. I don't really like fantasy games so the 'lore' aspects I can take or leave yet I realise this is a large part of the game for most people. I gave this an 8 because I will usually play this and have played on Vassal but I suspect that I will find C&C Ancients much more to my liking.

As much as I enjoy the strategy of war games, they stress me out. Especially when I'm playing my fiance. My desire to crush him makes it almost impossible for me to play without developing beads of sweat on my brow at every turn. (Okay, it's not that bad, but you get the picture.) I love the theme, especially the battles that are some what historically accurate. The introduction of Lore brings in some of the fantasy elements that I usually enjoy in games. I also like the components, even if it is a pain to set up and take down. One day, we'll have a bigger place with a gaming table that is not our dinner table, and we can leave this one set up for days or weeks at a time. I've probably played this game 15 or 20 times, and I still like it a lot. I don't even mind playing the same scenarios over again. With the random command cards and the dice rolling, it's still different every time.

RATING: 7
Very fun game.  Theme is a little confused but my brain is open to ambiguity.  I am favoring games like this now that I am tired of painting miniatures and want to play games with non-gamers as well as gamers.  The Borg sytem just hits the spot at the moment.  Probably not a realistic simulation of medieval warfare, but if you stretch your brain a bit the command cards are an elegant way to simulate command and control problems without tons of fiddly rules.  01/08.

Solid command and colors game. Have not played it enough to decide if the extra additions in relation to Memoir improve the game for me or not. The being on the battlefield sense that Memoir gives me is just not here. Will try a few more games to see if I can get into this one. Otherwise it will go on the trade list.

Just did not cut it for me and my wife. Traded away.

RATING: 7
(BGG, you better not mess up my paragraph breaks! :angry: )

Helll Yeeeah! I love the card driven choices. I love whoopin up a good combo of lore and command cards. I love to take out that last little dude in your unit. I love to be BOLD!

Strategies to work on for next time - Let no single hp unit escape. Secure those VPs. No time limit, so mainly hit enemy where he can't hit back (flanks, scouts, runts). Ensure own troops can always "battle back". Ensure clear paths of retreat. Get behind enemy units to turn retreats into kills. Use Lore cards that turn lore into hits. Use more lore cards to extend movement. consider how cheap lore cards may be employed regularly.

Learn the command card deck. Study command cards and lore cards prior to playing. Use knowledge of cards, their quality and quantity to advantage. Use knowledge of quantity of cards to assess availability of certain cards in order to correctly judge viability of thrust into certain areas. Know strong cards and save for best opportunity. Use "BattleLore" card to get deck shuffled and reset card availability.Cavalry and Archers can make good use of range so put them on left/center and center/right hexes.

Green guys have weak attacks already so station them in trees. Mobile green guys can get into range quickly, so only use for quick finishing attacks.

Order of general destruction:
Weakened, unsupported, non-bold red unit.
Weakened, unsupported, non-bold blue unit.
Weakened, unsupported, non-bold green unit.
unsupported, non-bold red unit.
unsupported, non-bold blue unit.
unsupported, non-bold green unit.

Order of final destruction (end game = a one turn win):
Weakened, unsupported, non-bold red unit.
Weakened, unsupported, non-bold blue unit.
Weakened, unsupported, non-bold green unit.
unsupported, non-bold red unit.
unsupported, non-bold blue unit.
unsupported, non-bold green unit.
supported, bold green unit.
supported, bold blue unit.
supported, bold red unit.

Attack weakened units first, then attack normal units. Avoid attacking Bold units unless they have weak attack (green or terrain hampered). Make use of mobile units (mounted, rush) for finishing blows. Use archers to push back closing units.

Alan Paull says: "...In most turns you will only move two to four units, and you might cast a spell every two or three turns. This means that you can concentrate on your broad strategy, how you will deploy your forces to achieve the tactical effect you want. There is strategic skill in where you decide to concentrate your forces, although implementation of your strategic plan will depend on the command cards at your disposal. ...best to play a poor card just to get it out of your hand..."

Yes, get it out of your hand and make small adjustments to your lines and setup. Try to create a good set of complementary cards to make a sustained push along with some lore. 3 or 4 good push actions, combined with some Lore power each time, should be all it takes to win any game of BattleLore.

Rule Clarifications -
* terrain modifers only affect base dice
* a retreating unit loses it's bold status during a battle, even if it retreats into a supported position
* a non-supported unit can be made suddenly bold if a retreating unit causes it to be supported.
* ignoring a flag = bold, bold = ignoring a flag

Latest tactics to try when opportunity arises:
* Use weaker faster units (goblin cav) for chasing and running down lone weakened, unsupported, and frightened units.
* Don't present opportunity for opponent to run down weakened units, obscure them behind stronger units or else move them into supported positions so they can at least offer battle back.
* Establish supported strong units in important locations (strong positions) so as to ensure powerful battlebacks and protect against lack of cards.

Weak hand Cards/Strong hand Cards - See cards in terms of suppport in hand. A lone section card is weak if it is unrelated to a plannable sequence, even if it is an individually strong card on its own. Strong hands are made up of multiple related cards that will allow multi-turn action sequences. Consider using weak hand cards to shore up a strong position just prior to executing a multi-turn sequence of strong hand cards.

A strong position is a supported position, with clear retreat paths that provokes the opponent into an ubalanced battle where you roll more dice than your opponent.

Rules to remember:
* At end of turn, first draw command card, then draw lore
* Lore cards played "alongside your command card" are activated BEFORE ordering.

Awesome [i]Commands and Colors[/i] game which would have been better if it had wooden blocks instead of the hard to manipulate plastic figures. :)

I ended up trading my copy away and cannot imagine ever playing it again, hence the lower rating.  The game is a 9, but the fiddliness of set-up and the added time time it causes makes the game drop in my eyes.

Now, if someone sets the game up and I can just sit down and play it, then I am in!

RATING: 7
Dissapointing design aspects: 1) difficult to tell the difference between green and blue helmets on dice (this is easily fixed); 2) difficult to tell the difference between banners and pennants on the board. We are trained to deliniate side via color, not shape (this is not so easily fixed); 3) hills and forest look very similar, especially when occupied. I probably would think more highly of this game if it wasn't so heavily hyped. They really whiffed the theme badly in my opinion...I just don't like the direction it ended up taking as the fantasy theme is about as boring as one could imagine.

RATING: 1
My favorite game. I love Battlelore as a game, it is without competition the best game in my collection and I have not had as much fun with any other game. 
If you want an actionpacked light wargame with lots of decisions, suspense and carnage, don´t hesitate to buy it. 

The grade reflects the way battlelore has been handled as a gamesystem. Used to be a 1, but the sale to FFG has made me more exited about the system again, so i raised it to a 5. 

new update: 
FFG is just as silent as DOW. The grade goes down again.

update december 08:
FFG started talking, I´m beginning to feel enthusiastic again.

Februar 09:
FFG seems to have bought over the PR guy from DOW. No real news since the game was bought. This sucks. I´m loosing my respect for the company, and i am ready to give up on this game, i don´t think it will ever fulfill its promises. :(

I played BattleLore before I played Memoir '44 (and played it more) but I find I like Memoir more.  Though I'd probably like medieval combat more than WWII, I don't much like the fantasy elements and the magic cards detract from, not add to, the experience.  Plus the board set up is just this drab sea of grey... no wonder so many people paint the figures.  And it costs quite a bit more to boot!

I prefer the presentation and simplicity of Memoir.

I've since played Battle Cry and it's probably my personal favourite. Though I'm curious to give 2e BattleLore a try.

Richard Borg and Days of Wonder pool the knowledge gained from their experience with Memoir: '44 and pull out all the stops in producing a truly fantatstic and lavish sequel to the Memoir' System. For the uninitiated, the game is about clashing medieval/early-renaissance/fantasy armies and using might and magic in careful combination to win battles. This is accomplished through careful (and sometimes frustrating) card-play which reflect both command/control problems and the fog-of-war. What really sets the game apart from Memoir and similar games is the use of Lore (which is collected from a missed throw if a special face is also rolled on a die). Collect enough Lore and your Wizard (or Rogue, Cleric, Commander, or Warrior) can perform battlefield wonders to help even the score. Another introduction to the system are Creatures which also have fantatstic, Lore-related abilities. Finally, DOW puts the game in a bundle where all the assembly is pretty much done for you. Figures are ready to play with and stickers for the banners already applied. The rules are 80  pages long, but are straightforward and easy to learn. This is because careful language, symbology, and examples (visual and written) are used to explain every rule.

I have really enjoyed this one.  Being a long time fan of Warhammer boardgames, this is a much quicker, but still satisfying fix.  At one point I started down the long road of painting all my minis.  I was planning on making small bases for each of the 3-5 man units.  I started by chopping off the extra banner stand (they look like dead tree trunks.)  That's as far as i got before I decided that it wasn't worth it. Now - I regret it.  It's such a pain to have to "find a knight with a standard", "find an archer with a standard." Ahhh, live and learn.

I prefer Commands & Colors Ancients: the magic in BattleLore is cool, but can be unbalanced. The magic adds another luck element to a game that already has dice and cards. Plus, DOW is milking this for all it's worth, turning into expansions what should've been in the base game to begin with.

This card driven style of game may be one of my favorite kind of games. After the long set up time the game plays very quickly.

Very nice Fantasy game with a lot of rules for every single units. But as it is provided with the rules in card-shape alike, it hass made us very easy to play it without knowing all the rules from the rule book.

Especially with the unit expansions coming  such as monsters, dwarven and goblins, it has become more interesting   to be played again and again.

I'm just not a wargamer.  I wish that I was because I have several friends who really ARE wargamers.  Battlelore is definitely the BEST wargame that I play: I like the simple unit types and capabilities, forcing action options down to a small selection of randomly drawn cards, simple dice hit/miss rules, the fantasy theme! etc.  But, in the end, I am just not a wargamer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Can be a bit of a chore setting up (bagging the different units marginally improves matters) but the gameplay is a lot of fun if a little prone to luck. Unlike the Ticket to Ride series where each subsequent release fine-tuned the system and relegated previous installments to the back of the shelf, I think Battlelore brings something different to the table but doesn't 'replace' Memoir 44. They have a different feel and all the extra features and options with Battlelore don't necessarily make the system better/improved, just...different...and good!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I will confess that I have not played this as much as Commands & Colors: Ancients. One would think the introduction of fantasy elements would add more possibility to the game system. For me, at least, the first couple of games felt like the "more" that was added made the game less; it felt looser and not as tight as Ancients. I would happily play it again, but not over the prospect of playing Ancients, at least until I reached a point of fatigue with Ancients I haven't reached yet.

I love this game. It plays very fluently and every game I've played was finished in under an hour. More important: it feels just long enough. It is also easy to explain to new players, because I just take a simple game with only one or two types of terrain, and without lore or creatures.

The downside to this game is the long setup time (easily 15-20 minutes), even though I've bagged all components seperately.

First play went well, only a few mistakes made on our part.  More plays are going to happen, when we get time for a 1-on-1 game.

This still sits on my shelf hardly played.  The biggest problem is that it takes quite a while to set up, at times longer than it does to play.  I love the idea, but I just need to find the time to pull the trigger and play it.

A good and versatile game that can be played with gamers and non-gamers alike. This is mostly because of the high randomness and the step-by-step introduction to the rules. Gamers get the rules in 2 steps, non gamers in 5 (with me)

The reason I don't give it a 9 is the high randomness as well. It makes it highly playable with non-gamers, but it makes strategy sometimes a secondary to luck.

Doesn't get much better than this! It's almost a 10. I think this is the defining game of 2006 and it will be a classic for years to come.

Setup takes a bit, and you have to set it up at least twice to allow both players a fair chance at the selected campaign.  Once engaged in battle, a great time.

Have only played through the first scenario twice.  Setup time is a problem.  Would like to try a scenario that calls for use of "lore".  Guess I'm just not much of a war gamer.

Reserving judgment until a few more playthroughs.

*disclosure I'm a big fan of C&C: Ancients.  I think its the best incarnation of the C&C system*  I haven't played Battlelore yet.  Although the production quality is exquisite, I'm not sure I'll like this game.  The lack of leaders and unit diversity (compared to C&C: Ancients), coupled with the universal army pool leaves me unsatisfied.  To be fair I'll need to give this game a try with the full lore rules in play.

*edit* Decided to trade this away.  I'd rather play C&C: Ancients.

RATING: N/A
I like this game in theory a lot more than in execution. Gameplay-wise I prefer C&C: Ancients.

edit: Thinking about it more, maybe the game is better than I thought, I mean the magic/lore/whatever it's called is kinda cool and adds another layer to the C&C formula. The monsters are cool too (the closest Ancients has is the elephants). All that being said, I guess I'm still glad I traded it away because I'd feel compelled to own all the expansions........or maybe that's just what I'm telling myself so I don't feel bad about trading it away.


Dammit, maybe I made the wrong choice in going with Ancients instead of BL.

edit: ha, with BL 2nd ed coming out, I'm glad I didn't stick with this. Especially since Terrinoth is a way better theme than an uncomfortable cross between historical/fantasy

I was against this game only because it was C&C:A's prettier cousin.  I like the presentation:  the board, the handy-dandy reference cards, the smaller hex grid.  The biggest con is the imbalance in the lore deck.  The priest is overpowered with the hills/rivers/forests are alive (and angry) cards.  I have witnessed several instances where one of those cards has become a "You Win" card (either for me or my opponent).  That is why my rating decreased.

One play, at a con. I actually didn't mind the randomness in the command cards: you can at least choose when to play each card. But the dice just drove me nuts: it often boils down to how many sixes you can roll, and I wasn't rolling them. Very frustrating.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent game, lacks the sheer beautiful simplicity of Memoir, but neither is it overly complex.  The complexity that does exist isn't overwhelming, and adds a depth and variability not present in Memoir.  The expandability of the game is obvious and I feel there is a huge amount of room to move, without making the game a mix/match of a myriad of little 'exceptions to the rule' like many other miniatures games.  

With the Call to Arms expansion, the Epic expansion, and after i have played more i expect the rating to rise.

I dislike the set-up and take-down time of this game.  That is one of the only real detractors for me.  Still, it is not as long as many of the miniatures wargames i used to play.

update:  I bumped up the rating again.  I really enjoy this game with full lore rules, creatures and the Call to Arms expansion.  The game is great fun, and can be significantly taliored from one game to the next so that each feels very individual.  The lore council is fantastic. What I want to see now is a 'setting' behind the game world!!

Update:  I am really enjoying playing this game.  The addition of the Battle Savvy rules is fantastic and the game really sings.  I love the different situations and thought processes you go through playing this game.  The luck of the dice and the neat combos with Lore and Command cards, heroes and creatures.  This is becoming a real favourite of mine - a wonderful, immersive and fun game.

Update: This has really become one of my all time favourite games.  I love the thought that goes into the game, as well as the play of the cards and the luck of the dice.  A really excellent game - especially when combined with the expansions.  To me Battle Savvy is a must play rule that adds to the game (see my comment for the Heroes expansion for more on this).

Battlelore is a wonderful game experience.  I love playing with the different elements of the game - from the War Council - with it's influence over the level of control you have over the battlefield (command cards) to the lore cards.  From the various units, unit abilities, weapon types, terrain influences and so forth.

I used to play a lot of table top minis games, I really like the tight and balanced feeling that Battlelore has, while it manages to bring the flavour of such table top games as well.

The game looks brilliant all set up.  The design of the system is thoroughly interesting and excellent.  A great game I really look forward to playing.

Battlelore has the same problem as Memoir 44: the action cards are limited to a specific flank (left, right or center) which can make for boring, tiresome battles if they do not correspond with your army's placement. The theme is nice and the pieces are too, but the game's just not that good.

The pseudo-collectible element left me cold, the lore cards seemed potentially unbalancing, and the set-up was often longer than the game itself.

12/25/06 - Christmas gift from my wife. I watched it demoed at my FLGS and thought it looked like something I would enjoy but I wasn't about to spend close to $100 Cdn for a two player game. I told my wife about the game and mentioned I liked I what I saw. She ended up getting the copy that was demoed for half price (still a lot of money for a 2er game but it is chock full of bits - plus she said she'd play it with me).

Down a point - card draws and dice rolls can frustrate you even though you might position your units in the best possible way. Also, this IMO takes forever to set up and put away - this one's a killer to those of us with OCD.

I really liked this game when I first got it, but have since lost interest. The large amount of setup time and cleanup time often do not justify getting it out. The strategy doesn't seem too deep and the game can be frustrating when you don't have any units in a section, but all of your cards are for that section. I also find the Lore cards unbalanced and in many cases distracting from the game. FF and HR espically, but even a fireball out of the sky to kill any random unit seems misplaced. This last pont especially has taken away a lot of the game for me.

RATING: 5
UPDATE: My patience with BattleLore has now officially run out. The basic problem with this game is the eternity it takes to set up. I think the game is OK, but the last time I played it took, like, 30 minutes to set up and tear down a 40 minute game. No thanks. I'm going back to M'44 and C&C:A.
---
UPDATE: I've lowered by rating, becuase after the first flush of play, we really haven't had much desire to go back to BattleLore. It's fun filler, but it's just too generic, too bland, and the scenarios are too samey. I forsee playing it again, but I really hope the Call to Arms expansion can give the game some range (I admit to some skepticism). I have little interest in the Epic version, and am not sure about the specialists.

Sorry about the excessively long comment.
---

I've played half-a-dozen times, most of the scenarios and all the rules (including DIY war councils).

The core medieval system seems to work pretty well. The core game lacks the variety and flavor of Command & Colors: Ancients, but it's also simpler and cleaner-playing (no clunky leaders). I have some concern that the advantages of support might be a little too strong; since all C&C scenarios are basically meeting engagements, you can't be rewarding the defender too much. But, overall it's hard to tell, and I don't yet seriously suspect that the balance is at all off. Regardless, the core system is solid, but if all you want is C&C: Medieval, and you aren't interested in the Fantasy element, you can safely save your $70.

The Lore system seems to work fairly well too. It seems to add a fun Magic: the Gathering-esque element to the game without some of the frustrating limitations of the Command cards. And the more action you take, the more Lore you generate, which is a nice (if subtle) impetus to do stuff. I have some minor qualms that the out-of-character penalty is a bit extreme and can randomly hose you for drawing the wrong cards, but it's not too bad.

Scenarios have been a big bugbear for previous incarnations of the system; it's a good-news/bad-news thing for BatteLore on that count. All the scenarios I've played have seemed reasonably well-balanced (by the standards of C&C:Ancients and Memoir '44, which are admittedly quite miserable). On the other hand, you only get 10 of them, and they seem to lack range - balance seems to have been ensured by giving both players more or less the same forces and then lining them up on fairly sparse battlefields. Most of scenarios I've played all felt awfully samey, and there is little if anything to distinguish the French-like and English-like forces. Two scenarios I played had terrain objectives which, in the best C&C tradition, played no role whatsoever in the game.

It's interesting to note just how different the three C&C games are (Memoir '44, BattleLore, and Command & Colors: Ancients). All three have very different feels to them, even if you discount the magic in BattleLore. Owning one need not preclude the others, and not liking one should not deter you from at least trying (and not pre-judging) the others.

So why only 7? So far, I'm inclined to say BattleLore is a little soulless. The battles have "historical" intro writeups, but they're short and opaque and I really couldn't figure out what the heck was supposed to be going on most of the time. The Lore cards are cool, but there is a fair amount of overlap between the classes (a number of cards do basically or exactly the same thing, just with different titles), and the lack of focus - most of the time you'll get access to most of the classes, it seems - gives it an all-over-the-map sort of feel. My first War Council game, I hired a 2nd level Rogue and never saw a Rogue lore card. A later game saw me with no Rogue, but drawing nothing but Rogue cards.

Also, the setup time for this game is a little over the top. Between setting out the terrain tiles, pulling the figs, finding the right banners, and assembling the Lore deck, in can take 15 minutes to set up a 45-60 minute game. It's not a show-stopper for me, but no question it's a little out of hand.

I'm also a little worried by terminology. "Bold" is not used consistently (sometimes a Lore or Terrain effect will just say "ignore a flag and may battle back") and how "Bold" or "Bold"-equivalent effects stack is murky. And card wording could be clearer. The "Speed" card and its several variants all say a unit can "move one extra hex and still battle". How does that affect medium infantry, which can move one hex and battle or two hexes and not battle? It was really not clear to me if they can move two and battle, or three and battle, or three and not battle, or what. These sort of execution details are really important for a game of this sort.

Overall, I've enjoyed the game. But I think BattleLore's long-term (and even medium-term) replaybility is going to hinge on the expansions: a) giving us a wider and more interesting range of scenarios and terrain; b) having an interesting range of troop types; c) giving the class/Lore system a little more focus; and d) giving us a more coherent game-world. It's cool that Days of Wonder is being ambitious here, and I'd like to see them pull it off. But I wish that the actual BattleLore box showed off the system's potential a little better.

RATING: N/A
The fourth in the Richard Borg card-driven series. The (very) ancient theme juxtaposed against magic and fantastical creatures is a nice mix. Lots of possibilities for future expansion kits may be a plus -- or an unwelcome money drain. Time will tell. The plastic figs are nicely sculpted but aren't as much to my liking as the blocks of Commands & Colors: Ancients -- not as colorful and not as easy to move about. Too, having to disassemble and reconfigure the Lore deck at the beginning of each new scenario is not an endearing feature. I'd much rather play C&C:A when looking for a Euro/wargame hybrid using similar mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Memoir is still my favorite of the series, although the lore aspect of this one is a pretty neat addition as it adds a lot of unexpected twists.  However, I'm a bigger fan of the ranged fighting in Memoir than the skirmishing of BattleLore.  There are so many times in this game when it is to your disadvantage to attack, which annoys me since I really like chucking the dice.  All-in-all, it's still a really fun game if you like the C&C system!  One that I would rate an 8 or 9 if it didn't take so darn long to set up and pack away again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Excellent game with terrific miniatures and other components. I love the historical battles and different scenarios. I'm sure I would rate it higher if I'd played past the second scenario, as each one introduces new mechanics and objectives (this makes it easy to ease new players into the game). The game is quite long and takes a long time to set up, and if you just jump in to the advanced version without doing the scenarios in order, forget it, you'll be completely lost. But if you have the time to commit to learning, this is an extremely rewarding game.

RATING: 8
I almost skipped this one thinking it was nothing more than a rethemed Memoir '44. I'm so glad I didn't. It adds a lot to the system while without sacrificing Memoir's light, rapid fee. The Lore system is obviously the biggest difference. But even smaller things like the morale system add some much-needed depth to the game. And the scenarios also feel a lot more balanced in general.

Lore is a wonderful addition. It adds some chaos, sure, but I'll take some spicy chaos vs. Memoir's dry feel ANY day.

The game really starts to shine when you start experimenting with the War Council. This is a really fun way to add replayability and experimentation to the game - something many other combat games lack.

So what's not to like? Well, for starters this game needs an overall rules summary somewhere. If you haven't played in awhile and just want to refresh, it's such a hassle to sift through 80 pages. Barf.

And while the system feels pretty lean, there's still a few fiddly bits. Terrain and weapon effects, some of the rules regarding Creatures... just lots of small things that are easy to forget and don't really add enough to justify their existence.

And, as with other games in the series, it still feels weird/unintuitive that it's just as easy to hit the stronger units as it is to hit the weak ones. Not a huge deal in THIS version of C&C as there's Lore to balance things out a bit, but it does mean the die is mostly made up of misses.

Finally - the setup time is a monster. Everything from the design of the game (the reliance on scenario play being a big one) to the production quality (organizing all those minis. ughhhh) affects it, and though I like the game I've been known to turn it to down just because I don't feel like investing in the setup/teardown.

All in all, my favorite of the C&C games. There's ways it could be improved but there's some uniquely fun and interesting mechanics here and the pace of the game is just right.

Beatifully presented Commands and Colors based game. I prefer this to Memior 44. Has a similar support system to ancients (with other units supporting rather than leaders). Only real downfall is a long setup time for what is a fairly light game experience. Downgraded rating from and 8 to a 7. Just seems hard to get to the table, compared to say memoir.

My criterion for rating games


http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1)Sense of wonder: a great deal of variety in the game through the unit powers, different scenarios, lore council, the command cards, and the dice. No scenario would ever play the same twice. Fantasy is my favorite theme. I always feel so into the game when I play a fantasy game.

2) Meaningful/fun decisions. Full of decisions from beginning to end on how to play cards, how to move troops, how to use lore and lore cards, and whether to get lore or lore cards. Even if you fall far behind a couple of lucky rolls and a great lore card can turn the whole battle around.

3) Player interaction: You are killing each other. Pretty much the best kind of interaction! :)

4) Components/artwork: Tremendous miniatures and the artwork on everything is amazing. Its Days of wonder and I love their art style.

5) Game length/complexity: Perfect game length. Game setup is way too long with the lore and the call to arms, but the scenarios play out very quickly and can be reset to be played again very quickly. In a 3 hour session you can play a scenario 3-4 times with different setups.

RATING: 7.5
This game has earned my 10 rating.  I like everything about it.  Problem is, I keep getting so many new games, and now I have become significantly more busy at work, that I haven't been able to play for quite some time.  However, it is still probably one of the best games I have ever played!

I will still rank this game a 10, because I think it is that good.  However, the set-up and break-down time of this game can get overwhelming, and takes up almost as much time as actually playing the darn game!  To really get the best out of this game, I recommend that you play at least 2 scenarios each time you bring out the box.

I dropped this rating to a 9 for a few reasons.  First, there are other games that I would like to play more often.  Secondly, there are other games out there that are better (according to the Geek, there are 35+ games that are better...).  I have many of those games, and agree.  Third, I think that for me, there has to be a finite number of games that I can rate a "10" because I can't play everything all the time.  So, I decided that of my "10" games, this one has to go down.

The only two games rated lower on the Geek that I still give a "10" to is Descent and Tide of Iron.  And that is because I would rather play ToI over BattleLore if presented with the choice because I like the theme better.  And Descent fills a different niche.

But BattleLore is still a great game, and a blast to play.  I just don't want to play it as much as I used to because of so many other games out there that I want to play.  Get it?  Good!

EDIT:  Occasionally, I will go through my list of games that I have rated and commented, and make changes and edits as my game tastes change.  About two years ago, I dropped this to a 7.5   I like the game and the "C&C System".  But after many plays against the same opponent (who moved away, got married, and had a son over the past 5 years), this game has sat in my closet, buried under other stuff that will get played with my wife more often.  So I have not played in a very long time, and although I am disappointed by that (because I really like the game), I get the impression that I will never play it again, despite how much I actually like it.  And that makes me sad, but I am okay with that.  Such is the life of a game collector who has lots and lots of stuff, but can't play everything all of the time.

RATING: 5
A big problem I have with the Memoir system is the vast amounts of luck involved.  There is luck in the card draw and in the dice rolling.  Now this system comes along and adds lore cards to add another random/luck factor into the mix.  On another note, I really do enjoy the addition of formations and the differing levels of units.  If any memoir game could win me over it would be this one - but instead it just barely reaches my 'maybe could want to play more' status.

RATING: 9.5
This game has the entire package for me; theme, replayability, interaction and great bits.  

It's also customizeable right out of the box, allowing you to play with almost any group... for people that are new to "the system", to full scale battles with War Councils.

Great stuff!

Great game.  It carries the enjoyment of Mem' 44 through and adds Lores to the game. Much less shooting than in Mem' 44 and the grouping of your troops really does matter.  The additional expansions are adding even more value to the game (I just wish they were cheaper...).

Largely by virtue of the theme this one will probably get the most play.  My wife and I are both fans of fantasy, so that will help.  Further, this system probably has the most potential for variations and expansions.  The lore system also adds quite a bit.  So, for bells and whistles, this is the best of the Commands and Colors line.  It's also very beautiful in terms of production values.

When I first played this game I was floored by it and gave it a 9.5. After some more plays it is starting to fall from my graces. There are always other games I would rather play. I am not sure if I am sold on getting any of the expansions. (15+ plays)

On second thought, I still really enjoy the game. I think my biggest gripe is that the game  doesn't encourage aggressive or offensive play. There is a little too much emphasis on troop support formations to make sure you can battle back. 

I now own two copies of the game after picking one up at a game auction for $11. I am excited to try out an epic scenario.

Sorta like Warhammer for wusses.  Basically it's a big board of hexes, a bunch of terrain tiles, a giant pile of plastic figures, a book of scenarios, and a book of (fairly) simple combat rules.  A real wargamer would probably sneer, but it's still quite nice.

Only 3 plays - good game, still learning it... The system, miniatures, and excellent support systems help this succeed as a fun game.  I'd like it more, possibly, if I did not have to play with the goblins. But I'm expecting more good things as I learn Lore and the more advanced rules.

I've only played once so far, so it might have been an abberation, but one player got completely screwed by dice rolls -- you know, the sort of rolls from Risk and the like where one unit kills about 20.

I was a bit down on this game when it first came out.  But I knew also that DOW wasn't giving us a completely finished product.  With most of the rest of the foundation set, this game is finally getting to where it should have been.

While the theme doesn't quite grab me the way Memoir does, it has its own level of excitement in the Lore aspect.  This truly is a unique game from the rest of the C&C series and will probably finish as the most magnificent of the bunch.

First off, a little editorial.  When I first opened up Battlelore I have to admit that I was very, very underwhelmed and even a little disappointed.  Sure, the graphic design and artwork is pretty close to best-in-the-business and the seasoned Commands and Colors system promised a great game out of the box but my initial response was that the $70 retail price tag was outrageous for a game that included no more components and nothing quality-wise beyond what we've come to expect from a $50 DoW or FFG game.  By all appearances the exaggerated pricetag went to help DoW pull out all the stops in making this one of the most accessible and idiot-proof games of its class- all the stickers are applied and many figures are already flagged, every counter and terrain tile is punched out, there's two of every reference card, and the rulebook is almost obsessively thorough (i'm surprised it doesn't have a diagram showing you how to hold the dice).  This is great and all, but really, who is going to buy a $70 board game that isn't already predisposed to it or that doesn't already have experience with games of this type?  I'd rather all those production dollars put toward making the game "friendly" had been spent on better quality miniatures, more diverse units out-of-the-box, or cutting the cards so they could fit in card sleeves.  On top of that, the game feels incomplete out of the box- the continual promises of more content, more units, and more scenarios throughout the rulebook and promotional materials feels like a cheap come-on and for $70 I expected something a little more comprehensive (like C&C:A or even Memoir '44). I do like that it's a system, and I do expect it to expand in some interesting ways (hopefully including scenarios with victory conditions other than unit elimination), but right now the game is really just a tease for greatness to come.Which is the problem.  After 6 months of play and the first expansion, I don't see any sign that BATTLELORE will be nearly the "evolutionary" experience it's been marketed as and the initial rush of such a beautifully produced game with a good solid system has worn off and all that's left is a sense of "that's it?"  The tactical mechanics of the game have revealed themselves time and time again to completely fail to appear anything like 100 Years War-era warfare (can you believe how underpowered the archers and the longbow are?) and the extended setup/breakdown time pretty much limits play- there's no reason to spend 30 minutes to set up a game of this relative depth.  It's one thing to set up TI3 or DESCENT for a great evening of deep gameplay but it's another to spend as much time putting these stupid figures (which amount to nothing more than poker chips or counters) into formation.  I like the C&C system a lot, but if I want to play it I find myself wishing to play ANCIENTS over BATTLELORE for any number of reasons, including better command cards, more interesting strategic possibilities, and better integration of the theme into the system.  BATTLELORE is _certainly_ not a bad game at all and there's plenty to recommend it but I don't think any number of supplemental add-ons are going to make it into anything more than it already is.  The CALL TO ARMS expansion is almost completely disposable and should have been included in the base game to begin with.

BattleLore is certainly a step up from Memoir '44 in complexity. The overall production is pretty good. The morale rules make the battle quite a bit bloodier as the defending unit may battle back when you attack them. The Lore cards add variety to the game although there can tend to be a bit of a "take that" feel to them. Only including one creature (the spider) in the base game was a disappointment.

Played part of a game with my 7 year old yesterday (2007-07-21) after he spotted it on my shelf.  We were playing the first scenario, Agincourt.  It's not as quick to play as Battle Cry, which he really likes, so he was put off by that, but he finds the pieces and other stuff absolutely fascinating and he can make out some of the magic stuff so it was a fight to get him to stop the game and get ready for bed.  However, it is rather involved and mostly aimed at the fantasy stuff, so I'm not sure I want to keep it and he hasn't asked to play it since then.

I immensely enjoy playing this game, but one of the things that was hyped about the there would continuous support of the game. Sure there have been a bunch of expansion initially, but to be quite honest some of those expansions ought to have been in the base game and others are quite frankly lame. My god they have Scottish dwarves riding cows for Christ's sake! Talk about idiotic. Where are those blister packs of monsters that were promised? All these little overpriced expansions are just another way for DoW to suck money out of us. I don't mind buying expansions, but can they at least be worth while and reasonably priced? Why do you need two expansion each for the dwarves and goblins? Oh gee wait! They want to suck more money out us. Goody!

So Days of Wonder, where are the monsters? I only see the initial spider and the promo hill giant and earth elemental. They are nice in their own rights, but shouldn't there be some more? Where are the dragons, trolls, hydras, basilisks, minotaurs, anything? How about some new freaking armies? I want elves, undead, orcs (not more of those mamby pamby goblins), barbarians, etc... The list is endless! How about some bloody heroes or a campaign system? Wouldn't it be cool to play out a whole war against another opponent with link battles and building up your resources. I have seen few games with such potential as Battlelore and it is just a damned shame it is all being squandered. Thus until DoW gets their act together with this game it gets a "1" from me as a protest. (Not that that means a whole hell of a lot)

Enjoyable medieval & fantasy game similar to Memoir'44 but different (Melee vs. Fighting at distance). Nice components and a lot of [u]goodies[/u] in the pack (more fantasy units would be great...). C&C:Ancients is better but BL comes with a Lore System (& War Council) and the Lore Council adds new tactics, so is different enough. Comparing the two editions, the [i]1e[/i] is better than the [i]2e[/i].
Like the others Borg's games, they are very many ways to adjust and adapt the BL game (ex. the "Medieval Lore" rules).
[i]The large D&D miniatures can be used as new Creatures. BL minis can be used in various miniatures games as well. The Warhammer Fantasy minis can be used to replace the BL expansions or adding new fantasy units.[/i]
[i]My [color=red]Solitaire[/color] variant: for the "enemy" side, take only two cards. Select one and discard the other. Try to play the robot efficiently, with most units bold etc.[/i]

I wanted to like this game but I got sucked into the hype and made an impulse purchase. By the time I realised that this game is not what I was expecting/hoping for I had already paid for it. Fortunately I was able to sell it off without loss. I learned not to make impulse buys from this game but that is all it will ever give me.
Takes longer to set up and pack up thn it does to play. Figures are poorly shaped and detailed and many are so mishapen so to be unplayable. Every aspect of the game comes down to silly amount of luck. Victory conditions are lame. Unit variety is minimal- until you get into the money machine of expansions ad nauseum. Card system seems unbalanced.

Quite good light tactical war game. Skill v luck ratio is about 50:50. The control of the flow of the battle is bit too limited to my taste. I especially dislike retreat rules: retreating units can often maneuver to a better position. (rating down by 1) The short length is a big plus, unfortunately the setup is exceedingly long. However, the set-up can be shortened considerably with 1) proper organization of standard bearers; and 2) using any type of footmen/cavalry figures for other members of the unit, e.g. using any type of human sword or bow to represent additional hit points of a blue sword unit.  Also, mercenaries seem to be unbalanced  in the basic set: goblins are much weaker than dwarfs. Scenarios do not compensate for it sufficiently.
 
The game looks great (if not overproduced), especially the rulebook (rating up by 1). Although I have not played enough (maybe 20 or so games) I have a nagging feeling that the game does not have much replay value in long term. Maybe a few expansions would help this.

Very beautifull game and quite intense with much variety, but there's more luck involved then I would like.

After a few plays: the luckfactor pulls my eyes out. Dices and handcards (although the latter in a less decisive roll) determine the outcome. At second thought, there's not very much variety when it comes to tactics and strategy. One always has to play in the same manner and then its just relying on the dice.

Update: Still haven't played the "lore" version, but still a good game.  The luck in this game is still strong (almost too strong), but I will continue to play it.  I have all the other expansion bought, jut waiting to pick them up in Dallas.

CC:  Ancients is still the better game.

Feels like all the other Command and Colors games, however, this one get a leg up as it has dwarves in it.  Can you possibly go wrong with dwarves?  I think not.  Good, light medium game.  It is not the best wargame, nor the worst.  It fills a nice niche of a light wargame.

Feb. 18, 2008 -- Good, but not great. Having the right card at the right time can make all the difference -- whether it's command cards or lore cards.

The setup time of this game is a bit daunting sometimes, but the overall play of the game is excellent. Most turns are filled with tactical decisions and tense dice rolls. The spell cards add to surprise tactics, and can really help to create "AHA!" moments. At times they can seem a bit imbalanced, but I enjoy how they bring an element of surprise. The only frustration for me, as with most war games, is that the best laid plans and strategies can be completely defeated by lucky/unlucky dice rolls.

Richard Borg wept.

Bloated, overwrought game that curdles the elegance of thee Command and Colors sytem. At times, the action on the board feels absolutely secondary to all the bits, cards, and tokens that one has to manage--none of which really foster tense decision-making. And the ponderous amount of set-up time ... fuggeddabouddit.

First game had a familiar feel what with having played many games of Memoir '44.  Same game with more bells and whistles, but really the same experience - including my AWFUL dice rolling luck!  Battlelore adds insult to injury what with the possible battle back when defending from a supported position.  It was unbelievable just how many times I attacked a weak but supported enemy position only to roll none of the needed element, but instead rolled plenty of battle back opportunities.  Aargh!  Still, if you can look past the luck factor's dominance in the game, Battlelore offers a fun gameplay and potentially infinite expansion opportunities so that the game should remain fresh.

Setup can take some time, especially with several expansions. Otherwise it looks very good with painted miniatures. Somewhat luck heavy and some lore cards can throw the balance off a bit. Still emphasis on formations and positioning. Fun, and plays quickly.

Fun wargame. Wild swings of the dice can bring victory to the undeserving, but that's OK: in moderation, it's something you have to plan for, in excess doesn't happen too often. And it plays quickly - 30-90 minutes - which is a huge bonus.

Unlike many, the Lore Council isn't the reason I like the game - I think I enjoy play slightly more without the Lore Cards. (I love the various non-human units, though, so I can't say I prefer "historical" play.)

RATING: 10
I bought this when it first came out for about $60.  I had been reading about it before it became available.  This is my all-time favourite game.  I have bought all of its expansions.
This game ranks at the very top of several categories for me (in no particular order):
1. Value per weight.  The box weighs about 5 pounds without any of the figures in it.
2. Most components per dollar.  The base game came with 210 miniatures!  I only tried to fit them back in the box a few times, now I keep them in storage containers stacked 6 trays high.  With the dozen expansions I have, those trays are full of figures.
3. Replayability.  The Lore cards add great replayability, let alone all of the scenarios and specializations available.  The Call to Arms expansion adds additional replayability.  And then there are a thousand additional unofficial scenarios available online.
4. I love the theme of medieval warfare.  That's what this game provides.
5. Not counting initial setup and takedown, a complete game can be played in 1 hour.  Trade sides and try again, or move on to the next scenario.
6. The production value offered by Days of Wonder is amazing.  The 80-page full colour rule book is the best I have ever seen.  The cards and components are amazing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A lesser C&C game, but still a fun, breezy wargame-light.  The lore rules still feel tacked-on to me, and I'm not sure if the added flavor is worth the added complexity, but the theme is still enough to get this to the table as a change of pace from Ancients and M44 from time to time.  I'll be looking hard at the forthcoming 2nd Edition.  Maybe an upgrade will be in order.

The game set-up time can be frustrating, but it's worth it when you get several games played in quick succession.  The ability to play each side in back to back battles is interesting.  We like the quickness of turns, simplicity of combat (custom dice roll) and moving figures around the board like generals.

Good memories playing with my brother and my sons!

RATING: 8
September 2015 - it's been a while but two more games using the Troll map, beasts, Epic, heroes & a variety of units really make this game shine. Up to an 8, now. 
-----------------------------
August 2010 - okay, it's starting to click since my 2 games this year, the first was Witches Hut using the Heroes, 100YW & Scottish Wars figures & then the second the Troll Bridge with the Dwarven Battalion, Goblin Marauders & His Nibs really pushed the game up to another level. Much more satisfying & rewarding. Up to 7.
-----------------------
I've yet to really click with this one. I love Ancients & Memoir but this leaves me feeling a little let down. The scenarios feel too symmetrical compared to Ancients (which I love) & Memoir '44 (which I enjoy a lot).

I also have:
Call to Arms
Epic BattleLore
Hundred Years War
Scottish Wars
Dwarven Battalion
Goblin Skirmishers
Goblin Marauders
Heroes
The Troll
Dragons
Creatures
Code of Chivalry
Bearded Brave

Plus expansions

I like this a bit more than Memoir 44 due to the Lore Deck, which allows you to play cards at a cost of lore tokens to produce a special offensive or defensive effect. Due to having more "moving parts" in the rules, it can take a bit longer to refresh myself on the rules after an absence, particularly when adding expansion material.

I haven't played enough of the Second Edition to rate it, but I haven't experienced anything in that version that would make me abandon this.

I like the concept, but the scenarios and some factions (I'm looking at YOU, Goblins) appear unbalanced. Perhaps they are designed to introduce key game concepts that are better suited for DYO and the later expansions?  also have Hill Giant and Earth Elemental figures.

A great, 2-person, social game. Fun, manageable, plays in a nice hour or so (including set-up), some real card-management subtlety (reminiscent of Knizia, just it's not dominant), beautiful to look at.

It never sees as much of the table as I would like, and I'm as much to blame for that. I like the game, but generally prefer to break out something meatier.

Cool strategic boardgame. I was worried at first that the scenario-based system would make it boring, but I need not have worried.

Command and Colors is already a wacky system, this game just throws more wackiness in. By trying to walk the line between a fantasy and a medieval themed game, it just didn't make the cut. I much prefer Ancients, and I hear Napoleonics is very good but I am uninterested in that period.

RATING: 3
Unplayable for a few reasons. Requiring two supporting units ("bold") for battle-back turns the battle into gamey triangular groups of units shuffling around. The creature rules are messy and not forward-looking at all (everything but the default Spider has ambiguous rules). The worst rendition of the Commands & Colors ruleset.

Best in its genre because of the lore system (allows for better replayability), although the theme does not appeal to me; in general, scenarios are better balanced compared with similar games; setting up takes a bit long in relation to the playing time; miss of full grip on battlefield because of dependence on available cards is no problem to me, as the game is short.

A solid Borg design that fits better to the C&C system than M'44, and with the Lore mechanic that makes it fresh. Lots of fun. The figs have the same propensity to bending as the other DoW Borg games, but can be straightened with a little hot water bath. Update: Just tried a game with the Custom War Council rules. Terrific fun. With six lore levels I dropped the rogue and went with a 3rd level Mage against a full council with a 2nd level Commander. I had loads of fun tossing fireballs and magic missiles but eventually the command card advantage did me in. My opponent was  able to draw both "Foot Onslaught" cards and demolished my center.

So far the game seems to be worthy of all the praise it is receiving.  Amazing bits and the gameplay is solid.  I love the new mechanics on the Commands and Colors battle system, particularly the morale system.  Fast and easy to play, the game still manages to offer plenty of tactical goodness.  

Yes, poor card draws and bad rolls can hurt a player but play a few rounds and you'll see things average out.  The fun is trying to pull off amazing moves even when you have little to work with.

EDIT: Bumped down a bit as I feel Command and Colors: Ancients is the better of the two.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played my friends copy. The component quality is top line. Especially the manual and the ancillary components. Yes the figs are bent, this matters not at all. 
As far as the mechanics, I can't judge it off of one play of the newbie mission. I do like how the number of active units is capped really low by the card mechanic. Dice for combat works well and everything seemed fine. I'm sure more plays and enabling more features will give me the depth I'm looking for from a 90 dollar (Cdn) game.
Update: 8. Easily 8 . This is a beautiful, fun game with a superb tempo and generates reiable post game narrative. Lore effects are varied and entertaining. command card system gives nice balance of luck and planning. 
Negatives? Price and some component problems (dice).

Another in the Commands and Colors series.  Beautifully produced but badly handled after the first set. The expansions were frankly kind of dull. Loved the monsters. But the game was essentially a battle game with a few spells thrown in, and I think it had problems reconciling the two very different groups who wanted different things. Still was a fun game now and again. 

Second edition a big improvement so I traded the first edition away.

12/11/2009: Played for the first today with a friend's copy. Quite enjoyed the first scenario, Agincourt. As a C&C Ancients and M44 veteran, BL was easy to get into and played like a lighter weight version of C&C Ancients, which was fine for a light evening of gaming after a long work week. I think my initial rating of "7" will go up when we get into the "Lore" and "creatures" rules.

My second favorite in the C & C series.  Outstanding producton values.  I prefer the fantasy elements over playing it as a "historical" 100 years war game.  Lore is interesting, how you accumulate it by rolling poorly.  Nice to customize the lore deck depending on which commanders you bring to the table.  I wish there were more scenarios available, and I also which they would be clearer on exactly how creatures were to be deployed.

The Call to Arms and Hundred Years' War expansions have reawakened my interest in this game. We play with the Medieval Lore deck and deployment decks, which offer terrific variety. It is the house medieval game. The fact that it is C&C driven helps, I'll admit. Set-up is a little fiddly. NOTE: CtA and HYW plays are incorporated into the main game plays count.

RATING: 7
This has replaced M44 as the 1-1 with my son game of choice.  There is just more going on in this game than M44 and frankly the lore element adds a lot of color we find quite enjoyable.

To reduce fiddly setup time we use a single unit figure and 2-3 glass beads to represent unit strength.  Less cool looking than all those figures on the board but less set up time means more fun in my book.

Simply far too much luck to out-weight the limited (but certainly existing) skill in the game. If *both* my card and dice luck have to be firing in order to execute a plan, that's just too much focus on luck and not enough on the plan for my taste.

**************

>>I'm now finding the randomness not really a problem at all if played in the right spirit. I think good tactics does still tend to win out over luck most of the time. This probably rates nearer a 10 when playing with my partner (even though she does tend to slaughter me).
 Setup time does tend to be a bit long, though not totally unenjoyable.
 The expansions are good, if little pricey (but then so are most expansions). I'd like to see more creatures avaliable. The Heroes expansion sounds interesting too.

>After a couple more games I still find something slightly disappointing about it, though the use of the War Council has added some good stuff. Despite some reservations though, the game does keep calling me back to play again.

 After my first few games I've found this to be pretty fun but still find myself slightly disappointed by it. While I quite like some randomness in games I just feel there's just a touch too much here, mainly on the command cards which can sometimes really stifle your plans.
 I do like that the games play  fast, so that if it is going badly its not drawn out for too long & you can just play again. I really look forward to playing with the full War Council.

Yeah, the tactical model suffers from the I-can’t-do-anything-because-I-don’t-have-a-card-for-that-flank syndrome that plagues this genre, but what I couldn’t stand in Memoir ‘44 I cheerfully accept in a fantasy milieu.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The Lore cards add a chaotic new dimension to the game which has both benefits and drawbacks, adding some neat tricks but increasing the unpredictability of combat.  The move to tie Battle Back to Bold makes for a more aggressive game - it's not enough to sit back and let the enemy come to you.  The reduction of retreats to 1 hex per flag for all normal units really increases the utility of cavalry over those in C&C:A.  Complaints: The deck of reference cards is immensely annoying, scattering important rules and interactions over several cards.  The minis are fiddly to move and hard to tell apart on the board and, contrary to the sculpts included in the base set, medieval armies are not made up entirely of Level 1 Fighters with short sword and shield.  The unit symbols on the dice and flags really should have been distinguished by more than just color - didn't DoW learn anything from the TrR board/cards? All in all, I like it less than C&C:A but more than M44.  It's not something I'm going to buy, but I'm glad I have a few friends who own it.

RATING: 6
OK entry in the fun series, but I wouldn't play it before Battle Cry, Memoir, C&C: Ancients, or Battles of Westeros.

Played a couple of times without using Lore, and the system here seems to punish the attacker severely unless you make a slow, deliberate advance of your entire line.  Too slow for this light of a game.  I'd like to try it again using Lore to see if that helps, though.

The evolution of "Memoir '44" with an appealing fantasy pastiche.

The rating reflects my initial impression of the game after four games. It`s a light wargame which I really enjoy despite the fact that there is some luck introduced through the dice and cards. But since the game doesn`t last longer than approximately 60 minutes I don`t care too much. Looking forward to try out the full blown scenarios.

Maybe it's just the lack of opponents but this one didn't hit the table in years. Part of it is the fiddly setup, another reason is that Summoner Wars scratches the same itch but is, at least in my opinion, a lot more fun to play.

There is a lot to like about this game.  I like how the scenarios progressively ease you into all the rules, and the more elements that are added, the less the die rolls impact things.  It's still quite luck-heavy though, and it's really annoying when the command cards you drew don't allow you to order all of your troops; at least it doesn't take long to reset the board and play a rematch.

RATING: 6
An excellent fantasy battle system.  The support rules make the battle form in to cool multiple fronts, and the simple rules tweaks in each unit type really make them feel different.  Would be a 9 with more scenarios; there are only two full scenarios out of the box.  Would be a 10 with a good campaign system attached.  The core system is solid enough that adding things to it should be easy, but out of the (heavy, expensive) box it is just an 8.  "Just" an 8, heh.  Without mile-high expectations, that would be a triumph, but I wanted a 10.  
-------------------------------------------  
Update: 8 -> 6 and 9.  Why both?  This game is a 6 out of the box.  No truly full scenarios and no instructions for some of the units it comes with, and a month later nothing has changed.  But this game is a 9 the way I play it.  Made my own army creation rules, my own terrain creation rules, my own monster rules, my own extra terrain type rules... It's all so very good.  But I don't want to mislead someone looking to buy the game since I don't come in the box.  6 for you, 9 for me.
-------
Heh, reading comments from 5 years ago is funny.  All games are great when you first get them.  That's why you got them.  But then you get a newer game and can honestly say "Oh, that crap I put up with before because it was the only choice is actually crap".  This whole series can be around a 6.

RATING: 6
Players play out battles on a large hex playing board, ordering their units via command cards.  Strange fantasy themed game sees medieval style battles fought out during the 100 Years War, of course with goblins, wizards, dwarves and giant spiders lending their support (the chronicles must have left that last bit out).  The next game in the Battle Cry series, and it strongly resembles the most recent release, Command & Colors: Ancients by GMT.  Players on their turn play a command card, which dictates what type/flank of troops to activate.  Activated troops can move and/or battle.  Battles are rolling a bunch of dice and counting matching hits.  When the last troop figure in a hex is eliminated, that counts as a victory banner for the winner of the battle, and banners determine who wins.  It's a fun system, doesn't require  too much thinking (although I haven't won a game with this system in ages), just slap down cards and rumble in with the troops.  Rules are semi-programmed, adding in fantasy creatures, Lore (magic), etc.  Certainly looks very nice, although the box is a bit flimsy considering the amount of stuff that was packed in it.  Lovely, lavish rulebook.  Looking forwards to seeing where this game system goes (I'm sure there'll be more!).

Really wanted to like this, as i believe that there is space for a simple, fast playing wargame system out there. The limit on the units you can activate plus the magic system screw things up in my opinion.

RATING: 8
This game is a lot of fun.  I like the replayability (endless?) and the caliber of pieces and everything.  The rules are fun too, especially with the scenarios helping you add some every time.  And you can build more and more troop types, which strikes me a little like CCGs, but I still enjoy it a lot.  Most of the games have been pretty even, except for my last utter destruction.

So finally Days of Wonder delivers something that people have always wanted: a fantasy-medieval boardgame. None of the other titles like Warhammer Fantasy or Wizard Kings had the accessibility or quality fill this niche. So this was a long time in coming! 

System-wise Borg has improved the general rules for morale and also done a great job of differentiating unit types in an elegant manner.

Regarding the production, Days of Wonder again aims too high and gets snagged. Lots of production issues should have been fixed: soft plasics are inferior for paints and they even warped. Low-quality dice, lack of a follow-on product, and too few scanarios in the base game also add to the woes. I applaud their ambition, but they clearly have problems executing their production vision.

I prefer the rules to C&C:Ancients because of the use of leaders, a better command deck, and widespread battle-back.

So far, it's pretty good.  One thing I'm not crazy about is the victory condition.  I tend to try to set up my lines for the long haul or as a force that can break through the enemy lines.  That has led to many a defeat as my opponent plays the correct strategy of isolating weakened units so she can finish them off!

UPDATE Dec 2013:
I think I overexpanded this game.  Dealing with the new units is really clunky, and the color based system is so bastardized that it became more of a hindrance than a hep in figuring out what the units do.  I went as far as helping Universal Head bring his BL player aid up to date just so I had a chance at keeping the units straight, but it was still a hassle.  When BL 2nd Edition came out, I realized that was closer to what i wanted to get out of this game, so BL1 was sold.

I'd give the edge to C C:Ancients due to the effect of on-field leaders and the strategic depth that offers.   The Lore part of Battlelore is a nice idea but pretty random, though, and makes this a very interesting light wargame.  It's quick and dirty and loads of fun.   I'd like to see leadership or special on-field characters addressed in expansions rather than minor variations on the units.

But here's the main problem with BattleLore:  the fantasy theme is totally vanilla, bland, generic, and without any passion or interesting setting. Too bad, really.

This is the best of the C&C games. Quality is great although I did have to spend a lot of time reshaping most of my minis into the right shape. The "bleeding" dice problem has been addressed by DOW and will not cost me a cent; nice. My son wants to play this all the time now; no more Memoir44 for him and you know what? I don't mind at all. The expandability alone is worth it. I stopped "collecting" Heroscape very soon after the first few expansions; not so for this one... Looking forward to new stuff soon!

Enjoyed the game played. Reminds me of Memoir '44. Since I invested a lot in Memoir '44 and am not playing that much, I won't buy Battlelore.  I find that there are a lot more to remember than Memoir'44. Also since am colored blind, I had difficulty with the red and green flags.

Enjoy the theme.

RATING: 7
Fun game with some problems. The following comments should be understood as a comparison with other games using the C&C system:

The positives are the Lore system and the excellent range of possible expansions.

The negatives are the monochrome plastic pieces (it can be really difficult to tell which pieces are on which side) and the lack of any historical rationale even for the "historical" scenarios (medieval warfare with no lances or pikes?) Components are generally overwrought. Set-up time can be absurdly long. The rulebook is so massive as to make it almost useless as a reference.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
No doubt the best of the C&C system so far. I've been partial to both M'44 and Ancients from their inception and I see BL as more of an evolution than the same game with different clothes.

I am firmly in the camp that loves games that expand and grow. BL is designed for that and in a smoother fashion than M'44 and Ancients. Here we will be able to pick and choose how we want to craft our BL system as opposed to the otheres where we pretty much have to grab the entire expansion or nothing. Either way is fine by me but I look at BL as an elevation in planning and production.

Not only does this game play as smoothly and tensely as it's older brethren, it also looks fantastic when in use. I already knew I'd like the game but until the second play it hadn't occured to me that part of the warm glow I was feeling was due to the visuals and heft of the components in use. A great job. Unless you hate, hate, hate a random element in your games or hate, hate, hate fantasy, you'll probably enjoy this stellar game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Fair.  After almost a year of owning and playing heavily, I found that Battlelore occupied an odd niche.  More complex than Memoir '44, but not as deep as C&C:A.  Yet it takes more time to set up than either of them, which is a huge drawback for a game that's supposed to be designed for time-constrained modern lifestyles.  It still looks great, and plays great, but I decided that I no longer need this since I already have the other two.

RATING: 10
Beautiful game with extremely easy to follow rulebook. Its system is intuitive and the game slowly introduces you to all of its concepts by a graded system of scenarios. Lots and lots of miniatures and a game you can play in, or under, an hour. My girlfriend, who has never played a wargame before, loves it, and the tactics, like flanking, came natural to her, a result of the BattleLore mechanics being so smooth. Recommended to everyone that likes the medieval fantasy theme and wants a break from the 10 million WWII war games out there.

Almost gave up on this after playing the initial couple of scenarios. Given that C&C: Ancients was my most played game of 2006, this just seemed to fall flat with both my sons and me. Though gloriously produced, it somehow didn't seem as refined. Dice rolls didn't feel like they accomplished anything, and the rules for Strike Back seemed unsatisfying. Adding in the squeamish goblins and stalwart dwarves helped a little (if you weren't playing the goblins, that is.) Creatures were a hit-and-miss. Then we added in the lore and war council for a whole new game. Multiple levels of strategy, tough hand management and different ways to attack make this one stand on its own. Note that the comments on the dice and banner colors being hard to read are spot on.

A great new addition to the Memoir 44/ Battle Cry line of games that adds the fantasy elements that you would expect. Now there is more focus on maneuvering and magic plays an interesting role and is handled cleverly. An interesting new addition are the various "commanders" that you can use to gain several advantages during the game. The game is so similar to it's predecessor to make old-timers feel very  comfortable, people who didn't enjoy it that much will not like this game as well. Production quality is very high.

Another great game that no one else is playing (at least not around here where I live). From the same designer as Memoir '44, so the mechanic is very similar, but with a medieval fantasy theme. Takes a little more time to set up than Memoir because of the banners and the War Council and Lore elements. The Lore and magic component of the game, along with the special monster units, is *really* cool. I really wish more people played this game. My son and I like to play this from time to time, He's 10 years old and he really enjoys it.

The fantasy theme works well with the C&C system - Freed from historicity, the C&C system doesn't come under as much scrutiny here. The scenarios also appear better balanced compared to Memoir'44 and C&C:A. No 6-0, 6-1 hosings here. The lore aspect gives players more tactical options, which goes some way to ameliorating the "screwed by card draw" problem. 

While the French/English battles are ok, I think things get really interesting with the goblins. The bold/frightened aspect of the goblins makes things really tense. The goblin army can appear strong but can also crumble really fast! 

It's still not something I would buy though. The price is high - $70, not something I can justify with such a light game, and for only two players. I'm immediately drawn to comparison with Clash of the Gladiators, which is cheaper, takes up to 5 players and offers good decisionmaking and dice-rolling fun. Of course, CotG doesn't have nice minis like BattleLore, but I can live with that.

For me, Battlelore's hype has kept its promise. Its gameplay mechanics are intuitive and enjoyable, its components are top-notch, and its generic "Hundred Years' War   fantasy" theme is quite easy to set aside. At less than an hour a game, it's a perfect way to spend an afternoon. 

[b]Update:[/b] Dropped from a 9 to an 8. Part of this stems from my frustration with DoW's expansion policy; I got burned by the Call to Arms expansion and haven't picked up any of the Specialist Packs. It's become difficult for me to get this game on the table because nearly everyone I know would rather play a shorter 2-player game such as Mr. Jack or Yinsh. I'm hoping to get a few plays in soon and revise my rating afterwards.

Haven't touched the advanced rules / lore stuff yet, but already this seems like the best of the C&C games. Good compromise of complexity between Memoir and Ancients, and looks miles better than either of those games.

Still probably will never get it to the table due to setup time.

Haven't played a scenario yet where my goblins didn't feel pretty much useless, especially in the face of dwarves.

Update:
Never really got to get into 1st edition due to lack of play opportunity. Hoping 2nd ed offers more opportunities :(

RATING: 6
A good game, but probably my least favorite in the C&C system.  Fantasy's not my thing, and the lore cards greatly complicate the system's biggest flaw: setup time.  I'm also not a fan of the removable flags, and lore cards add a lot of unneeded randomness.

I have played this game once. My left flank heroicly charged headlong into battle whilst the right flank sat there and watched the invading hoards.

 The left flank fought relentlessly (with terrible dice rolling) to the last man. The right flank just sat there being slaughtered.

Stupid cards, stupid dice.

I enjoyed Battlelore, much more than my few goes at Memoir 44. I just played one easy set-up, Agincourt, and as the French side I won (which always improves a game in my opinion). But I just found the whole thing much neater and faster and less disturbing. £45 is a lot of cash on one game though. Anybody care to give me a copy?

I have had some terrific sessions with this game. Setup and take down are my least favorite parts. Otherwise a great play every time! The further you get into this system, just on the base game, the better it gets. Early scenarios are understandably slow to help on the learning curve, but when you get to the real meat, it's just super tasty.

Another Command and Colors game, using cards to control the action. This one has a fantasy theme. It's a solid enough game, but I'm afraid that the fantasy theme is a bit thin for my tastes. I'd like something a little bit more, fantastical? Still, overall, a solid addition to the C&C franschise.

[b]Another Borg light-wargame, but this one comes with spells. The base game would have been better with more monsters, but a solid little wargame I'm happy to play. [i]I would trade this if the right deal came along.[/i][/b]

:thumbsup: PROS:
- Colorful, gorgeous, good minis (and lots of them)
- Reference cards make game a bit easier to learn
- Spells are strong, but fun
- One of the stronger Richard Borg war games
- Great instruction booklet
- Campaign introduces rule complexity a bit at a time
- Lots of fan-made maps out there
- different levels of each troop type is genius

:thumbsdown: CONS:
- Base game only comes with one monster
- Expansions are expensive
- Ho-hum, another Richard Borg wargame
- Lots of little rules new players will struggle with
- I want my side of the board to be one color (color system a bit counter-intuitive)
- Some spells are STRONG and can wipe an opponent

Gorgeous game with tons of minis, spell cards, etc. Tons of (overpriced) expansions too! I rediscovered my enjoyment of BattleLore (1st ed.) this week, which was nice because I've been trying to sell it (at a massive loss), and now will keep it as I enjoy it more than the loss I would take by selling. Borg's C&C with spells and nice graphics works well. I do wish expansions were more interesting, and cheaper, but with a wealth of fan-made scenarios out there, I'm sure I'll have years of fun with this.

Like it much better than Memoir '44.  In fact, even though the games are very similar, I don't like Memoir '44 at all, and I love this game.  It has more depth, but at the same time is easier to play.  Also available on line only, is a very nice Battlelore editor at Days of Wonder, for creating printable new scenarios--Do wish the editor could be downloaded.  Outstanding rule book & summary cards, with teaching scenarios which greatly speed the learning curve on this game.

RATING: 9
After years of saying I wouldn't, I caved.  The shocking part: my wife is not only on board with this, it was sort of her idea.  She likes it so far, after two plays.  I'm a pretty experienced Memoir '44 and C&C: Ancients player, and it's definitely what you'd expect if you've played those games. For me, the reasons to play BL as opposed to other games in the series are the War Council and Lore, which really elevate the game into something different from the rest. Creatures are cool, but can have little impact on the game, depending upon how well they roll.

My least favorite thing about BL: the scenarios included are way too gradual about introducing all of the cool concepts. I get that they wanted the game to be easily accessible for newer gamers. But for C&C veterans like myself, it's frustrating. I've started jumping right in with the later scenarios, assuming that eventually we'll be using Call To Arms pretty much every time we play.

For a game that I've barely played, my wife and I have accumulated expansions at an alarming rate. In fact, we are now only missing [thing=45543]Heroes[/thing] and [thing=30232]Hundred Years' War[/thing]. I've decided I can live without both, considering the pricing and availability issues.

I picked this up to play with my son.  I like the Command and Colors system best with C&C Ancients but am going to give Battlelore a try....  

I've played quite a few times and Battlore is very fun.  All the C&C system games really boil down to light card games with a touch of hand management (I'm up in the air on how much hand management matters).  Luck of the draw and dice are very strong in these short battles.  The C&C system is lots of fun however and Battlore is a fantastic box-o-toys.  This is a great intro wargame and a perfect father vs kid game.  Just introduce it in stages and don't sweat all the details.
 I haven't really jumped into the lore system so far because it seems kind of tedious and the rulebook is so wordy but I'm enjoying the game without it.

Update:  I've cooled on Battlelore.  I like the base game but the Lore system is too much work.  I'd play C&C Ancients instead.

A fantasy dice-fest with simple tactical features. The base game is pretty solid and nicely balanced, but really comes alive with the expansions with army building, custom units and large maps. 

+ Different races, skills and monsters.
+ Simple Lore mechanic which balances poor dice throws. 
- Luck is heavily involved. Wargamers don't bother.

To truly appreciate Battlelore you have to consider the TTG, Boardgame, and RPG elements that are mixed effortlessly together. I know of no other game that can do that. Buy it, buy all the expansions and you'll see.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Easy to learn and play, everyone I know seems to like it regardless of how much they play board games, and there's lots of interesting strategy in it, no 2 games play alike.

EDIT:  After repeated plays, the long set up times combined with the chaotic gameplay does eventually start to get old.  Also, many of the expansions are pretty lackluster, and in particular the new paper map / troll expansion is a big step in the wrong direction.  I still love this game, and it will still come out, but not as often, and I doubt I will buy much in the way of expansions.

EDIT:  And now it's been bought by FFG - hopefully this means good things!  I doubt my rating will rise back to 10 again though - I've moved on to deeper wargames like Conflict of Heroes, and while I credit Battlelore as being the game that brought me into wargames, I don't see myself playing this anywhere nearly as much as I used to.

Some rules make this one a little better than Memoir'44, some other rules make it a little more random. For me, it feels absolutely identical to Memoir'44, and I do not feel the "medieval-fantastic" theme. Spells? They almost feel like standard Memoir'44 cards. Customization? What's the point, it is still a fundamentally random game. It's a very good game, I just don't think it was needed after Memoir'44.

Looks so much better than it actually plays.  The official scenarios (well many of them) are too balanced, in other words the winner is determined on luck.  Games are actually pretty boring to play compared to other C&C games and setup time is far too long for such a simple game.  The rulebook is bloated and yet still has some unclear sections.

   My rating is based on the game plus expansions.  The base game would be rated lower mostly because of a derth of included scenarios

At the same time very similar and very different than Memoir '44 (one my favorites).  The requirement for both melee combat units to be adjacent and the morale rules presented very different challenges.  I feel that BL might be more tactical than Memoir '44 because unit positioning is much more critical.  First play without the lore rules.  I will see what they add in future games.  I think I still prefer Memoir '44, but this is a solid game.

It's not really bad, but it just didn't click. Like Memoir 44, I find setup to be long and boring. It's good to play with the boys but I doubt it will ever see the light of day again : it only plays with two and so isn't really a family activity, I like Memoir better if I have to pick one of them (I don't find the lore cards add anything to it except fiddliness), and anyway in the circumstances where I could play one of these I will most likely play Combat Commander instead, which is just plain better in my opinion. Battlelore has the advantage of being a little simpler but the drawback is it's far less deep, and the boys manage Combat Commander fine with a little help on the finer points.

Battlelore is an obvious amalgamation of Memoir and C&C: Ancients. But no problem with that!  It's a great game to put together a scenario and just start battling away. As long as you can accept the luck of the draw of Command cards and Lore cards, you'll be golden.  The game is all about managing what you have been given and what you can get.  And Richard Borg is probably the master of that when it comes to Ameritrash battle games such as this.  I don't find anything boring about this game at all.

The addition of the Lore system has really allowed Borg's C&C engine to shine with me.  In fact it has done it so much I am reinterested in playing the older siblings.  Battlelore is a near perfect light wargame, with a few twists and attractive presentation.  There is enough strategy here to keep you thinking, but it never bogs down in needless minutia. A great game with a promising future, with plenty of expansion potential.  Hopefully this one stays supported.

UPDATE:
Still a strong game over all, but with the difficulty of finding players matched with a long set up time my desire to play this is waning.

Fun little game, but far too fiddly for my tastes.  I did enjoy my 10 or so plays before I sold my trade-obtained copy off.

I like this game, but I don't rate it as highly as I do C&C Ancients.  When you take away the Lore system I think that C&C Ancients has a better implementation of the combat system.  The Lore system is interesting, and is why I rate this game as highly as I do, but the combat is the core of the game, and C&C Ancients does that better.

Memoir '44 is a simpler system than either BL or C&CA and is rated as high as it is partly as a result of that and partly because it simply has a different feel to the gameplay.

I find Battlelore a more interesting version of the C&C system than M44. It's a shame some arguably key rules are only available in the expansions though.
I tend to use the limited lore rules as some of the big spells are a bit overpowered for my tastes. Set up and tear down can be a drag, too, so it's best to play several games in a row!
And despite these gripes it's still an awesome game and well worth the time it takes.

RATING: 7
I really loved this game, but the system and how it is handled sucks. Many years have passed since the release of the core game and still there are no new races (UNDEAD!). FFG re-release the old goblin, dwarf and human figures instead of giving the players something really fresh to get excited about.

The Call To Arms expansion was particularly disappointing. It prolonged the set up time significantly and was just a random army generation system that doesn't give players enough control. Also, due to some specialist cards, it made some units useless and others necessary to win (mounted knights). The weaker units didn't make it to table at all outside the provided scenarios. 

This game desperately needs new races, new magic deck and a huge scenario/campaign book. It also needs the army creation rules to be revisited and tweaked.

Being a fan of Battle Cry and Memoir, this one is just a total shoe in for me.  This game takes Borg's C&C system to the next level with the morality feature, the variability of the war council, the economic aspect of the lore, and the expandability of the races, creatures, and unit strengths.

I have been a miniatures gamer for a long time going back to Blood Bowl 2nd edition and Warhammer Rogue Trader. Nowadays I do not have the resources - time and money - to invest in buying and painting an army but Battlelore scratches the itch. Although it is taking years I am painting up the pieces. 
Another game I can play against my children so that always bumps up the rating.

RATING: 7
The basic game mechanics are nice and simple, offering a pretty good tactical game without too much hassle. Bravery rules are a very good addition to the original gameplay, as they add a completely new layer of holding your lines. However, fantasy theme feels quite lackluster and pasted on, and the set-up-playing time ratio is quite bad, decreasing my enjoyment of the game. Also some wild swings caused by the prominence of the dice and the probability curve can be somewhat annoying at times.

9 to 10...A beautiful war game with a fantastic game play.A lot of battles and a very good game box.The only bad that this is not 10 is the expansions...Game has a lot of them in high price and in the basic game you can play only ten missions...

Days of Wonder is good with the production quality.  Sometimes it masks an otherwise just ok game (Cleopatra), other times their production really enhances the game.  The latter would be the case here.  The game system is famous already, and it works great in this Fantasy setting.  The replay value is great with this game, but I am a little fearful of the expansion packs coming out for this thing.  They want ya to be addicted, I am sure, but thankfully you can get by with the base game.  Hopefully they won't over do the collectible nature of this game.

This game was somewhat different than what I expected when I looked at the back of the box.  I had received several recommendations from friends, so I purchased it.  When I got it home, opened it, and read the rules, I was at first a little disappointed, mostly do to my expectations.  However, once I began playing it, first with my brother, and then online using the Vassal game engine, the game really began to grow on me.  I found myself wanting to play more often and with different scenarios.  So far, every game I play feels different as there are so many variables even in the same scenario.  I highly recommend this game.

After all the hype about how differnt this version of the Borg system will feel... it seemes pretty much the same as the other Borg Games to me.  Fortunately I very much enjoy this system.  I do like the fantasy theme and the Lore aspect is a nice plus.  Now, to paint or not to paint.

RATING: 5
I really appreciate the production value that days of wonder games puts into its games. Unfortunately, their games are a bit too light for me. After 2 games of battlelore I think there is just too much luck for a satisfying game experience. What cards you draw and what dice you roll are too determinative. I'm going to give it another play or two before I give up on it.

This game looks great!!  But it doesn't seem to be readily available unless you want to pay over MSRP on Ebay.  The expansions see tough to get as well.  I don't want to invest on this since I'd have to go scavenging to get each piece.  Then again, that might make it even more fun.  So for now, I'm holding off all together.  I keep bouncing between this, Battle of Westeros and Memoir 44.  Too many games, too little time and money.

UPDATED 9/3/10:  Ended up getting it for a sweet deal!!  Love this game.  My favorite boardgame so far, regardless of my 1-6 record against my 8 year old.

Light and fun wargame with beautiful presentation. Long setup (the worst disadvantage of this game) and luck factor present, besides the game is not well balanced (for example choosing 2 strong specialists in warcouncil is not a good idea).

Excellent Value.  The number of pieces and quality of the rulebook and quick reference cards are all great.  (Although, some of the figs are a bit injured).  I'm a huge Memoir '44 fan and this is right up my alley.   Two Big Thumbs up!  Additional plays - Still Love it.
Bought a second copy, ready for some gigantic epic battles!
Aug 10, 2007 - It's a bit more Obese than it's brethern.  Which is probably better for some, but I prefer the elegance of both Memoir '44 and CC:A.

RATING: 6
Prior to recording my plays on BGG, I've probably played this game more than 20 times.

I prefer Memoir 44, C&C Ancients, or C&C Napoleon to this version.  Something about the combination of having lots of unit types with special rules combined with the fantasy setting doesn't work for me.  I can deal with unit variability in the other C&C games because I can relate the special powers/exceptions to some historical context.  I also like fantasy games.  I think its the combination here.

RATING: 6
A great game I would highly recommend for gateway gamers looking for an easy-to-learn conflict-type game. It looks good, plays great, and is easy to learn and understand. The chrome will get non-gamers interested right away, but the price tag may frighten them off, as well as the sheer size of the rulebook.

The biggest downfall would be the set-up (which, if done efficiently, will still take upwards of 30 mins or more), but once you're set-up, it's easy to play several scenarios at once. The medeival scenarios are quick, but once Lore enters the picture, and choosing a War Council, things have a tendency of slowing down even more during set-up.

The gameplay itself is rather fast and furious (unless you're playing with some one whom takes 20 minutes to decide which single unit they wish to move), and rather luck-based. If you're a big strategy war-gamer, stay the hell away from BattleLore, as you'll likely just be disappointed.

However, if you're up for a quick, easy battle game, go for it. This one works well with children too, as the oodles of minis, and ease of play make it super-cool for the kids.

I've since lowered my rating as the set up time is ridiculous. It's been years since I've played and it's doubtful I will again - 30 minutes to over an hour to set up is far too long for this family.

I like the fact that this game starts with easy scenarios and then builds more and more complexity as you go along. It makes it easy to learn and fun while you build up to the final battles. I have played nearly all of the starting scenarios but have not had a chance to play the expansions for this yet, although I own every one of them. This is one game that my wife actually likes enough to play with me and she is pretty much the only one I ever get to play two player games with, so that is a huge plus for me.

I have only played a few games of this but have found them enjoyable. The board setup time is kinda long (owing to the many bits  - this could likely be remedied with a homemade container of sorts), and the luck element runs pretty high, but I do like the idea of card driven combat - however, it would be nice to see some sort of mechanic that revolves around knowing what your opponent might have and then being able to try and guess or analyze their strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The system is solid but the scenarios are "samey" and the whole Hundred Years War With Giant Spiders background just doesn't cut it for me. I committed deeply to the game, buying several expansions and painting them all, but over time this title has slipped in my estimations and just doesn't get played so often as the other titles in the series. 

There seems a bit less maneuver here than in C&C: Ancients (the obvious measuring stick for this game); rather than advancing in line your units have a tendency to break into three or more mutually-supporting elements, and there they stay as they fight and die. I think terrain is a bit better handled here than in CCA, but I do miss leaders and evasion. Missile units have longer range here, and thus can do more damage over time -- you don't have the mad scramble of running your lights up to missile range and only getting off one volley before the enemy line crunches back into you. There seem to be fewer retreats in this game, but the odds are no different ... it must be due to an increased attention paid to keeping your units in supporting position, to ensure they remain "bold" to both resist retreat and earn the all-important ability to battle back. Likewise, you find yourself hunting for those unsupported flank units that can't hit back. 

Overall, this game feels as "medieval" to me as CCA felt "ancient" ... it's not a simulation, but in the aggregate it feels as authentic as any of the substantially more complex medieval wargames that I have played. And experiencing this game has caused me to even better appreciate what a wonderful game CCA is, as well. I'm happy to have both in my library, but I'd like this game a lot more (and play it a lot more) if the background world wasn't such a pratfall.

RATING: 9
The core rules, of course, are similar to Memoir 44, Battle Cry and C&C: Ancients. The system lends itself well to the fantasy setting, mostly due to the fact that the base game did a great job of integrating different races and the war counsel into the game flow.  At this point however, I think the franchise has missed grand opportunities to expand the game.  Instead of over-potent units that dominate the system, I would have preferred different races (such as undead or elves), more war counsel members, a wider variety of decks for existing counsel members, and campaign books (similar to M44).

An excellent game in the Richard Borg series. The theme appeals more to me than Memoir 44 and the streamlining of the system and addition of the Lore rules mean it's likely to get a lot more play than Memoir.

Edit: Now played with Lore and creatures and it definitely adds that extra something to the game. Couple that with the fact that my girlfriend is willing to play it and I've bumped it up to a 10.

Further edit: Great game but the setup time is a bit of a problem and is making me drop the rating back to 9. 

Edit: I've only got a couple of the expansions but was planning to get all of them. Now I'm not so sure as it just seems like it will make it overly long and complicated for something that is based around a simple system. I'm leaning more towards Memoir '44 of late.

What a wonderful "light" cosim.  Played it both with veteran players as well as with my 10 year old nephew.

The ultimate way to play BL is with the expansions "Call to arms" and "Epic BattleLore"

underwhelmed.  expected more fantasy elements.  Rating reflects my feeling on wanting to play.  I think Memoir and BattleLore are good games, I just have to admit that I don't like playing them.  Cards and dice elements just don't give me the feeling that I am really in control of what is going on.

In a word, filler.  Filler with a long setup time.  Each move is pretty much staight-forward, based on the cards and unit you have.  No real tension involved.

Wow, the most gratifying box opening experience of my gaming life.doesnt  hurt that the game is actually as good as the buzz, its simple, fast, deep and FUN for crying out loud, perhaps one of my best buys ever.cant wait to get the expansions and call to arms to play pick up games and the rest of the scenarios. (edit) years have passed since my getting BL, and it has seen a lot less play than I preferred. Set up time seems to be its biggest deterrent, and the proliferation of WHFB in the area havent helped. I'll stick with it as i know it has its uses.

I like it, but I think I prefer the rest of the series.  This one just seems to long to set up for the battles.

The lore while not overly complicated seems to be the main ficus of the game.  Win the Lore battle and win the war.  That and it's still convoluted, and so for a C&C game, I find that not as fun as a purer C&C game.

Another Commands and Colours game from Richard Borg.  I especially like the support and morale rules, they make it more important to keep your formations together.  But this could also become a drawback, if neither side is prepared to advance because they would need to break up their formations.

RATING: 6
Same problems as memoir, only it costs more, takes longer to set up than it does to play, and the expansion possibilities that made it seem so cool have been a total abortion from days of wonder.  I owned this for less than a month before it was traded off, and I am a fan of the system.  

DOW should have made the armies customizable, the scenarios fluid, and put out different units for different races that got bonuses from each other.  Instead they crapped themselves.

It is very fun, overly expensive and feels completely random to me. But still offers a very good time: like it's WWII counterpart, it provides a framework to play with toy soldiers! Some extensions are really a steal for what you get: clearly, the first two should have been included right in the game to justify the base price. I would have liked that better than, say, not having to stick the adhesives on the banners myself.
I got a coupon on that game, otherwise I would not have supported that marketting strategy.

RATING: 8
This is a good game.  Played with the basic rules, which means no magic.  It's medieval combat, using the COMMANDS & COLORS: ANCIENT system, with a few minor changes.  DoW did an awesome job with the pieces, as they are made of sturdy yet flexible plastic which is perfect for paint.


The rest of the production is of top quality, from the full color perfect bound 80 page rulebook, the scenario book, the counters, the plastic playing pieces and the double sided board (one side is divided for "Overlord" type setup, so two boards would have 3 sections as opposed to 6, for those of us who like epic battles!).


As opposed to GMT's approach of using hardwood blocks, DoW went with generic units which all have a socket for a flag.  One differentiates the units with flags, one flag per 3-4 pieces, depending on type.  Of course there are light, medium and heavy Infantry and Cavalry, along with archers.  Long swords and short swords, bow and crossbows.


Definitely a must have for those who enjoyed C&C:A and like the Medieval period, as well as those looking for a more challenging game than M'44.  Highly recommended!

I love Battlelore (first edition).  I just never get to play it anymore because its only two player and it takes forever to set up.  Most of my 2-player game time is dedicated to lunch breaks or quick hits before game night with my gaming group. 

The actual gameplay of Battlelore is exceptional under the Command and Colors mechanic.  It really plays to the strengths of strategic thinkers while throwing in just enough randomness to give it an edge.  If there wasn't any dice and every movement resulted in exact results the game would lose a lot of it's depth.  I really, really enjoy the fact that at any given time an army's line can be "broken" and all heck can break loose between the two sides.

Throw in the promo pieces from the pre-launch sales and there is a lot of variety to be had here.  This will be a keeper and an heirloom since it is no longer being printed and the 2nd edition is being released.

Lots of fun. But I think the lore cards add to much chaos and  the minis doesn't look too great. The command card system is nice- it is all about which cards you keep for later use and which card you play now. What bothers me most is: why the woods offer no protection against arrows? Why you can run up the hill with no movement point cost? For the sake of easy rules they got rid of realism. Still, it was my favorite game until TOI came out.

Yearly comment update - I still don't see myself ever trying this game again.  I've never been fond of 1v1 games, especially direct conflict games, think the theme is very thin and uninteresting, and found nothing redeemable about the gameplay but the art.  Below old comments still apply.

I wasn't particularly excited to play a 1v1 game, Maybe a 2vM game but 1v1 has never appealed to me.  I gave it a try though, with my group telling me it's a fun, strategic game.  We set it up, got everything ready and started playing.  I realized I made a lot of bad unit card choices and really wasn't going to win until my next play.  

However, it came time and I played a cavalry card.  I did some fair damage and was happy with the turn.  Then my opponent played a counter-card, to mimic my action.  His cavalry (as he had more than I did) stomped all over my troops.  I tried to recover, and his next turn he played the same cavalry card that I initially played, stomping even further.  He had his 8 kills to my 1 and the game was done.  Any combination that powerful, with the luck involved and my lack of interest with the game, just totally turned me off on this one.  I was extremely annoyed and will never play this again.

This game is great! When i think of it i think of it i think of chess. The reason is you have a set of figures you move around the board to take a checkmate or a flag in this case.

RATING: 6
Jan 5, 2008 - first game with Scenario 1.  It took us 1,5 h to finish it while reading the rules as we go.  With each and every minute the game became more interesting, especially when we figured that units may retreat, battle back, pursue, advance to emptied space, support, cannot use ranged attack while engaged, etc.  We still have lots to learn: lore, terrain and other rules.  I plan to go slowly with this game and complete each and every of the introductory scenarios, although I am tempted to jump in to Lore battles right away.

Jan 7, 2008 - I started painting the minis.  I hate all that gray on the board.  It is totally uninspiring and all the details (faces, weaponry, texture) are lost.  Painted figures seem to have "personality".

Jan 10, 2008 - Today, we played with the simple lore rules for the first time. The gameplay becomes somewhat less strategic but is faster and allows for card combos.  Nice addition.  +0.5 in ranking. Now, we have two modes to play this game: medieval rules and lore.  It gives more flexibility and increases replayability.

Jan 23 - I like the game a lot.  I have decided to buy all the expansions. 

Feb. 18 - increased rating by 0.5 points due to expansions.  They bring a lot into the game.  Deployment rules with Call to Arms, new units with specialists expansions.   I can see bright future ahead of BattleLore - there is so much DoW can do to further refine and enrich the game.

Setup time kills this game - it takes forever.

Memoir 44 for Medieval with magic (Commands & Colours system). Probably a blast, albeit a pricey one, and a pig to set up. Not the wife's cup of tea, and looks a bit too random, luck-influenced and lightweight when you've already got Battleground Fantasy Warfare which shares similar territory theme-wise.

Expansions
- Call to Arms makes setting up the army part of the strategy - not stuck with scenarios
- Epic gives you a bigger board and bigger battles
- Specialist packs for when you run out of stuff to buy...

Great production value.  Days of Wonder is amazing.  The sheer quantity and quality of the plastic minis is impressive.  However, the gameplay is more of the same (Memoir, Battle Cry, C*C).  Even with lore, it seems redundant.  Also, the plastic minis are tough to repack and tend to get bent a lot.

Battle Savvy troops are veteran fighters that
understand the strike and counter strike of combat.
Battle Savvy units have the following rules:
• A Battle Savvy unit attacked in melee combat
that is not eliminated or forced to retreat from its
hex may battle back.
• A retreating Battle Savvy unit may not battle
back even if the retreat places the unit in a hex
that is adjacent to the attacking unit.
• When a Battle Savvy unit in melee is unable
to fulfill a required retreat movement, the unit
may battle back (after it takes losses and if it is
still in its original hex).
• Battle Savvy units with ranged weapons do
not collect Lore tokens in ranged combat.
• Battle Savvy units with ranged weapons
collect Lore tokens in melee combat.
• Battle Savvy ranged weapon troops and other
units that do not normally score a hit when a is
rolled in melee still force a casualty check against
a Champion when one or more symbols are
rolled.

[b]AMAZINGLY FUN, AMAZINGLY FAST LIGHT WARGAME SET IN THE HIGH MIDDLE AGES, WITH THE OCCASIONAL OUTBURST OF MAYHEM AND MAGIC, EVERY NOW AND THEN...[/b]

As a newbie to the whole wargaming area of board games and all-round geekness (BattleLore was my first wargame after just a year or so of starting my affair with board games), BattleLore is a beautiful surprise for anyone interested in starting a wargame section in a board game collection. The best of both worlds, BattleLore sure is a game to be reckoned with.

Other than the fact that the guys at Days of Wonder (I own a DoW copy, not a Fantasy Flight Games copy) really worked hard on the design of the game board, and the bits and pieces, the whole game set is a treat for the eyes, including the game box and the plastic trays. The miniatures, though bendy and somewhat fragile, are beautifully carved and conceived, but painting them must take at least two to three months of normal hobbying time. Nonetheless the game board implicitly invites players to create and build their own 3D scenery to go along with the miniatures (It doesn’t seem to be a too far-fetched dream!). The war council sheets are amazingly painted and the mini board painted on the table of the commander gives a bit of a comical or cartoonish side to the game. And let’s not forget about the scenario booklet, filled with details and with a small background text of each battle. It’s a gorgeous master piece.

The game play is a fast-paced, tension-bringing crucible between the players, both focused on getting as much out of their forces as fast as possible, with the least amount of damage received in each turn. The special actions of each unit, the different kind of weapons and the landscape features really add depth to an already awesome game, with almost no effort at all. Richard Borg really outdid himself with this one. I can’t imagine other game in the Commands & Colours series being better than BattleLore. 
Finally, the rulebook, besides being one of the most clear rulebooks I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading is another artistic achievement, since it combines perfectly the importance of graphic examples and the amount of space for each subject in the game.

BattleLore is a game I don’t think I’ll ever refuse to play. Ever.

[b][i]II. Sliders[/i][/b]

Abstract [b]______[COLOR=#FF0000][7][/COLOR]___[/b] Themed: Considering that BattleLore is a re-boot of the Commands & Colours system created by Richard Borg, it seems hard to think it would be too much of a difference if instead of medieval wars, the theme of the game would be space invasions fought between moons and comets, using the same hexed game board. However, it is impossible to conceive a better setting for the game’s expansions than that of the fantasy Middle Ages portrayed in BattleLore, especially since the expansions introduce units with typical European weapons used during those centuries. Fantastic History is way easier to use than Futuristic Science Fiction.

Simple [b]__[COLOR=#FF0000][3][/COLOR]_______[/b] Complex: As mentioned before, the presence of multiple kinds of units, weapons and landscapes instantly gives BattleLore an endless supply of possible movements, actions and military options to go along with those possibilities. Also, the simplicity and “straight forwardness” of the rules makes those options a lot more easy to grasp than expected, since the same restrictions applied to one’s own units, apply to those of the enemy.

Strategic [b]_______[COLOR=#FF0000][8][/COLOR]__[/b] Tactical: The size of the game board has a reason to be, which is to enforce the idea of BattleLore being a light wargame and not a full-fledged classical wargame. This results in the idea that almost every action taken by a single unit will end up most likely affecting the controlling player more sooner than later, positively or negatively. It is hard to think of strategic possibilities in BattleLore without compromising a full flank, or letting some specific enemy unit go unharmed when the opportunity presents itself. However, defensive strategies may be built around protection of slower or weaker units.

Luck [b]___[COLOR=#FF0000][4][/COLOR]______[/b] Skill: For a veteran grognard, BattleLore may hold secrets not available for beginners, so there’s always a particular amount of skill involved in the game, like in the way the units are chosen to attack or in choosing the places the attacks happen and how the enemy reacts to those situations. But the presence of dice and the card driven mechanism of the game turn are too important and significant to be overlooked, since the player cannot act on the board without a card allowing them to do so, and the attacks, no matter how brilliant and carefully planned they are, may end up in nothing if the dice don’t roll on the right sides.

Fiddly [b]________[COLOR=#FF0000][9][/COLOR]_[/b] Elegant: Like I said before, the BattleLore rulebook is one of the best rulebooks I’ve ever read, so there is not much uncertainty on how the rules are applied and how the game progresses. Also, the reference cards given to each player are a crucial element in the game turn and how the tactics and strategies are developed, since those cards show just what the players need for each turn, and the need of using the rulebook is almost non-existing once the players have gone through a few turns each.

Indirect interaction [b]_________[COLOR=#FF0000][10][/COLOR][/b] Direct interaction: Just because this is a wargame, light or not, it should be instantly understood that all interaction between players is direct.

Cutthroat [b][COLOR=#FF0000][1][/COLOR]_________[/b] Friendly: Just because this is a wargame, it should be instantly understood that all interaction between players is cutthroat, since at best, both players are required to eliminate their enemy’s soldiers, wether the scenario imports the need of killing them all or killing enough of them to achieve a certain goal.

Heavy use of language [b]__[COLOR=#FF0000][3][/COLOR]_______[/b] No language needed: Obviously, a card driven wargame needs a lot of language use, in this case, English. But it must be clarified that the cards, or at least most of them, don’t require much reading after a few games of BattleLore. Players end up understanding the very few symbols on them and how they work from the little pictures. The same cannot be said for the reference cards, which feature a lot of language (Too much to be ignored) and some of them also deal with in-game specific terms, like “morale” and “pursuit actions”, to name the easiest ones. Not a game for people that can’t read in English.

First edition, several expansions, only played a few times,  in new shape except for adding color to army shields and base rims for ease of play.   Very good game, love it, but my club doesn't like two player games, and my husband isn't a gamer.  It's in very good shape, organized in sturdy plano boxes.  

Don't really want to let it go, but I figure to let someone who can enjoy this great game, and find new prizes for myself and my game club.

Quick and Fun Battles with lots of Minis on a Hexboard. Easy Rules and not too heavy on the Brain.

I'm quite fond of this game.  I play plenty of 'real' wargames, but still cannot be dismissive of this game.  Yes, there's luck.  Yes, the L-C-R thing can be restricting, but learning to work with it (maneuvering troops to the left when you have a great deal of powerful 'Left' cards, for instance) and adapting your strategy is much of the fun.  

With all troops on magnetic bases (as per someone's post here), and stored in snap-and-stack containers - plus terrain tiles stored in coin-holder pages - setup time (likewise tear-down) is no longer an issue.  Fun game with plenty of variety.

Days of Wonder set out with the goals of "Short playing sessions, strong online community, easy to learn yet deeply engaging game play, superlative artwork and components, and finely tuned game mechanics." Much as some may nitpick and backbite it, DoW has achieved this for my play group. 

The movement and combat rules take a few games to understand, but they're worth struggling with since it's their very quirkyness that adds the "charging knights and slashing swords" feel to the game that makes you want to come back again. In particular the rules "Gaining Ground", "Battle Back", "Pursuit Action", and that calvary get to basicly attack twice and move three times as long as they keep up a string of successful attacks takes a while to do properly.

The basic scenarios even before Lore and Councils are introduced are fun --after you wrap your brain around how movement and combat works. It's also an adjustment that archery is woefully inaccurate and weak --as the scenario "Agincourt" shows! (Although drawing "Darken the Skies" is usually a game winner for the English) After playing two games of the first scenario and one of the second, we skipped to scenario 5 without problem, which is the first Lore scenario.

The Lore scenarios play much faster, more fluidly, and with more comebacks from behind. Scenario 5 is where we found the game system starts to glimmer and shine.

The investment for this title is rather high --$50 from an on-line vendor like http://www.timewellspent.org --but keep in mind you're not buying a single game --you're buying 10 games in one box. That makes the purchase price more reasonable.

Well, BattleLore didn't disappoint, but it didn't quite play as I had imagined.  I guess I was really expecting it to be significantly different from Memoir, for some reason, which it really isn't.  While the morale mechanic encourages formations and more skillful play, the double shot of luck in cards and dice is just as there as it ever was.  The Lore council is neat, too, and I like the depth in unit types and battle-backs, etc., but I just don't know if I *love* the system enough to play the endless expansion collecting game.  BattleLore is a great game, but maybe I'm just not the target gamer for it after all.  If the victory conditions were more dynamic and less sumplistic, I'd be willing to give it another try.

RATING: 8
Really fun strategy warfare game for 2 players.  I have issues with the setup at times, and must really plan to play this game, however once you begin playing it really does become an epic and thrilling battle.  The expansions are fun, I personally would suggest looking into what comes with the particular set, if you own Warhammer or other miniatures you can often substitute them for expansions and save some money and storage space.  The game play does revolve around dice rolls so luck does have a factor, but placement and choice of attack can also play a major factor, add in Lore cards and the game is deeper than any other of its kind.  The combat is built on the same premise as Memoir '44 so if you enjoyed that, this game adds another layer with the Lore.  I would classify this game as advanced due to the amount of pieces, rules, and variations.

Still learning this one, but it looks to be a deep, mature version of the Commands and Colors system. Some folks around here seem to think it's a bit too random and some features overpowered--but then what game don't they say that about? If you're not looking for too much simulation, and a game that focuses on the unpredictable ebb and flow of battle, make your battles BattleLore (..shoulda been the game jingle). 

  I do hope Fantasy Flight does more with it than cannibalize the name and backburner any future support--they've done a great job as gaming curators (reviving a number of otherwise dead titles), and I don't see any reason that can't do the same for BattleLore.

Description: Medieval war meets sorcery in this two-player fantasy wargame. While similar to Memoir '44, BattleLore adds some theme-appropriate tactics.

Pro: Mechanics match theme. Nice plastic miniatures. Magic and skills add strategic depth. Flanking bonuses reward formations. Simple combat system.

Con: Cards and dice can make battles somewhat random. Plastic figures are fiddly to get out and put away. Plastic figures bend easily. Difficult to tell each side's units apart at-a-glance.

Initial impression after one play. Fun to play and nice to look at, but the gameplay has some major issues. Every turn most of the units are spectators watching a few activated units move and fight. (At the end of the game, some units in the rear still hadn't done a dang thing.) Drawing the right card at the right time can make you or break you, regardless of how strategically sound your plans are. Too much of a game, not enough of a simulation.

Another game in the C&C:A system.  This one adds Magic and various "Court" roles you can add to customize your side.  Even though this one comes with a ton of plastic figures, unit strengths and weaknesses, and unit movements; this one has left me a little dull.  If I will play a game in this system, I would rather play the simplier Memoir 44 version.

I have played Memoir and Battlecry.  I own Command and Colors, but wonder aloud if it will ever be played.  I do think the magic in this game adds kind of a strategic element that makes it more interesting than its other plastic brethern.  I also like the gentle encouragement to pursue linear warfare.  Also the morale rules are a nice touch.  Much of this may be in C&C, but no plastic, so here I am.  If C&C had plastic, I doubt I would have ever picked up Battlelore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Better than base Memoir, not quite as good as C & C Ancients, as good as Memoir with the Eastern Front Expansion.  

The leaders and evade abilities from Ancients are sorely missed.  I like the potential when playing with a "build your own council" and all the creatures/lairs options, BUT the Lore deck pushes this way too far into the realm of too random.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The soft plastic is a knock, but a great system.  I think Memoir is still the best of the 4 games but this is great.  It really requires figuring out your own storage system to cut down set-up/tear-down time.

Not looking forward to the luck in this but then this is a one hour game unlke something like Wallenstein where 3 hours of randomness must be endured.

Update: Have now played this a couple times and rate this a 7 for the basic game. Surprisingly I liked this more than the wife, it actually felt too light to her where I guess I was expected that after reading about it. 

I still have hope to save it with her once the monsters and magic are added in as I have read the rules a couple of times and it will add. Will update later, most likely the game will be an 8 for us.

Pretty good game. I have all the other Command & Color games but I like the morale and the lore very much. It feels like the mechanics fit as well with the theme as it did with Ancients but the lore adds a bit more to the game. Where the game fails IMO is that all troops on both sides are the same except for the banners. It's not visually pleasing at all, in fact it's confusing at times. Couldn't they have opted for different colors of plastics like Memoir and Battle Cry?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Another valuable addition to the Commands and Colors genre.  This game scratches the 'fantasy battle' itch for me that Wizard Kings failed at... I prefer Ancients simply because of the subject matter, but you can't beat the DoW production value, and the system itself is tried and true.  You have to accept it for what it is (we're not talking 'simulation' here)... but it's HEAVILY playtested and generally fun.  I'll play this any time.

The card driven wargame is a nice idea.  While I would have played this a lot as a teenager, I rarely have time to play a full battle, and it would be harder to teach the game.  The lore adds a lot of interest for me, but it does make the game minimally more random.

As good as any of the Commands and Colors systems, but your favorite will depend on the theme (Civil War: Battle Cry, WW2: Memoir '44, Ancients: Command and Colors Ancients, Fantasy: Battlelore). I own them all and enjoy them all. 


It's a very fun system that works for many levels of gamers. 

Battlelore has potential be my favorite of the series, but I'm playing it more and it's new. I like the lore addition, the creature additions (they are special units), and am looking forward to how Days of Wonder expands it because I feel the expansions are needed to open the base game up; right now, I feel there could be some more to the Lore as it feels a bit limited, but that's clearly on the way in the expansions.

This game is not collectible in a blind buying sense (meaning: you don't know what you get when you buy a booster), it is expandable and what you buy in a booster is open knowledge and complete. While I'm not excited about a potential money pit, I'm looking forward to the boosters to put more flesh on this system.

Each version of this system has brought more to the table. Days of Wonder has done a wonderful presentation here and has great bits. The game play is solid, the games are fairly easy to teach, the games play in a modern day friendly time period. The fantasy element in Battlelore is well done, the lore possibilities have me intrigued. It's a very fun system.

Do not expect realism, or complexity, the system abstracts things. But if you're after a fun war game, these games are great.

UPDATE: This game is a lot of fun, the production is fantastic, but I still feel the base box--despite the addition of lore--is a bit, incomplete compared to the other base games. It feels like it's waiting for the expansions; as such, I've docked it a point. 

The Command and Colors game system has been a very solid 8 across the board for me and I'd expect Battleore to end up there as well.

I understand why people rip on this game for not living up to the hype and expectation, but this was my first foray into the C&C system and I really enjoy it. I like Memoir, too, but I like the difference that the lore council and spells/abilities add to the game.

One of the best mini games I have played.  I get the feel of a real mini game on a board, and without all the extra crap that goes into a real mini game (tape mesure, etc...).  This game is easy to learn and play, but is very in depth regarding the different armies you can play with (historical medieval battles, or fantasy "lore" battles).  Like the fact that this game doesn't take as long as your typical mini game also, which is why the mini game craze never really caught on for me even though I tried a few of them.  Will definately look forward to playing this again, this game is so vast you can pick one of the battles in the book provided or just make up your own.  Just can't say enough good things about this game.

RATING: 9
Bought this on spec after owning Memoir '44 for a year.  I refer to it as the 100 years' war with orcs, but that's not really fair---they call them goblins, and it's clear this game is aiming for the "Warhammer Fantasy Battle, only less annoying" niche.  I've enjoyed miniatures in the past, but never really had the patience for all that painting and was pissed off by the continuous figure power inflation that required endless buying and re-buying.  Plus I just don't have the time and space anymore.By contrast BattleLore is much quicker to set up, to play, and to re-play.  And the mechanics allow subtle tactical play and reward careful planning.  The one downside is the amount of time required to set up.  When playing solitaire I tend to ditch the miniatures (which are really glorified hit point markers) in favor of dice, keeping the single marker miniature to track unit type.  Indeed, the ancients rules use wooden blocks to accomplish exactly the same goal.There are quite a few expansions for this now.  I'd love to try them out, but I'd like to see  bigger player pool first!  I'm particularly keen to try the Epic version, which permits a good deal more maneuver before engagement (while compensating by allowing multiple card plays).  And a good campaign game could be quite interesting.

13/06/12. Down to 6 from 7. The game's not got any worse. It's just that I'd be less willing to play it because meatier strategy games are spending more time on my table.

03/12/08. Down to 7 from 8.
Richard Borg's C&C engine is a gaming masterpiece of our modern age. At the time of writing C&C:A shows the system at its best. Logically therefore [i]Battlelore[/i] should be more successful than [i]Memoir'44[/i], which certainly shows up most widely the gap between the C&C engine and historical reality. Sadly, whether this is true or not, WW2 tacsims more demanding than M44 have long since distracted me from Borg's games.

I do find myself wondering what FFG'll be able to do with their new Borg franchise. :goo:

I'm a big fan of Memoir 44, and a big fan of fantasy games, so Battlelore is right up my alley. I enjoy playing it, but I don't find it quite as appealing as Memoir. The historical background and simplicity of Memoir are what gives it the advantage over Battlelore for me. Overall, a great game and I do certainly enjoy playing it, but it can sometimes feel overly complicated for no real benefit.

Medieval-themed C&C system game with a basic magic subsystem that I really enjoyed. Typically fine Days of Wonder production, too. I've noticed a lot of bleating about how this game was overhyped and underdelivered, at least far as expansions go. At some point though, some folks need to free themselves from the clutches of their collector gene and just learn to enjoy what they have. I think the base game is just fine, and I'd probably rank it *just* higher than Memoir 44 in the series. The fantasy medieval setting just fits better. M44 feels like the scale is all wrong and it's obviously a pastiche of actual WWII combat. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Note: I have only played Epic BL, which was the reason I got BL in the first place, namely to have a different Commands and Colors experience. The same way MM44 Breakthrough scenarios break the pace of the basic system, this is makes you play differently tacticly than the basic C&C board. Plays like a middle ground between Ancients and MM44, in a good way. No leaders, but still some cards require clusters and formations, and supporting you troops in order for them to be able to battle back is a big part of the game. The different colors of units play a big part in how they feel, just like in Ancients. The whole lore aspect is completely different from any other C&C system I have played though. Can't wait for second edition and cant way to get Westeros to the table for new and refreshing C&C experiences. Oh how I love this system

Fun, fast paced, uncomplicated game. Adds magic to the C&C system. Being fantasy-themed, the variety of units and buildings should be broader than it is, and should be the feature that sets this apart from other Borg titles. Hopefully FFG will do a better job than Days of Wonder did.

Pros: Best card art of the franchise. The lore deck is fantastic. The interchangeable units via flags allows for scenario customization which is really cool.

Cons: The grey minis are hard to tell apart; you could paint them but that would take forever. The base scenarios are weak when compared with Ancients and M44. The probability of hitting a target is 16% for most units and as good as 33% for a select few, leading to the longest games of the CC series.

Fascinating game, but the setup time on this one (as all the expansions start to roll in) and having to look up all the different abilities/effects is really starting to grate on me. The game simply takes too long and is starting to be a bit of a hassle with all the expansions. Yet I *want* those specialized units. At the end of the day, I much prefer M'44.

RATING: 6.5
The rating is an average of the following:

5. Average game, slightly boring, take it or leave it.  (I do not like the fantasy element) and:
8. A very good game.  I like to play.  Probably I'll suggest it and will never turn down a game.  (If it was a purely medieval wargame)  I know there are 2 historical scenarios and one could just make up ones own and use the appropriate figs but I am not prepared to buy it to do that.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Tactical miniatures is not my thing, although I will play Memoir '44, which seems to play more smoothly (I also prefer the WW2 theme to the medieval/fantasy theme).  Beautifully produced and you get a LOT of stuff.  The lore adds lots of kool stuff, but many of the cards are very powerful and I guess it depends on how much you like "take that" games.  That said, I will happily play it - provided someone else sets it up! - but probably won't suggest it ahead of other games.  The morale rules are a nice addition and worth adding to your games of Memoir '44 as well.  Traded in March 2008

Apart from minor and fixable components concerns, this takes everything good about M'44 and adds to it (or maybe it's more accurate to say borrows a few things from C&C:A and then adds a few new things). Tactical depth is increased pretty significantly over M'44, but the options aren't daunting (though it will take a few plays, probably, to get the units straight). Only ten scenarios included, but there's the online scenario editor and the new official and fan-made scenarios to consider as well. I like the fact that the game can be both an "ordinary" medieval game and one with magical/fantasy elements in it. Customizable to a fault, this game is going to give players a lot of options, but I think they'll remain that, just options. Putting two boards together for Epic play should be truly epic, and BL wisely goes with a square Epic setup (unlike M'44, which uses a "long" board for its Overlord scenarios). The main problem I see is set-up and take-down, which really do take a while, even with separate bags, etc. Kudos to DoW on this one.

At some level, I think I actually prefer M'44 for its speed of play, historicism, and, well, lack of complication, but BL is at least as good, and it's genuinely richer if that's what you're looking for.

Update: I'm saying goodbye to this one. It's just not getting played--it's too much of a 'tweener for me, and I like Battle Cry and M'44 better.

RATING: 8.5
Nice upgrade from Memoir 44 and Battle Cry. Throws in a lot of cool things like creatures and spells and a war council but at it's heart it's still the same game. If you like the aformentioned you'll like this. For me it's all in the mood. Do I want a fantasy theme, world war II theme or civil war. It's nice to have the choice for either.

Edit: the potential for this game will never be realized. I heard Borg had rules completed for undead and elf factions, unfortunately it has been discontinued and is now out of print.

Fortunately what you do have is fully fleshed out, there are a lot of options for either the humans, dwarves or goblins. Plus it has a decent amount of creatures including a very cool hydra with remove able heads and dragons, assuming you have or can get your hands on the expansions

My rating is subject to change and I suspect that if I stick at it, it will improve.  

My main problem is probably lack of experience with the game.  I'm always at a loss about what to do in any type of wargame, mainly because I can't deal with the number of choices, so I just arbitrarily choose to do something and hope it works out.  And when you play this way, the die rolls will determine everything.

In my first game I felt frustrated because of the lack of ranged attacks.  It felt like you just move your guys up, everyone gets bunched up and you roll a bunch of dice.  I would like to play this more and then revise my opinion.

Additional Information
Why is this averaged to be 7.70? This game is a [b]poorly balanced Memoir '44 with unnecessary fluff[/b]. Although I do enjoy the assembling commander element, the overall process is quite trivial since any card is usable with enough lore. The method of obtaining lore is pure luck as well. Not to mention that 1 side has way too many archers than the other. Draw 2-3 darken the skys and the game time is shorter than the setup with 0 enjoyment.

Dwarven armies have no drawbacks and creatures are too frail. Battle back is a broken mechanic too since it makes melee combat virtually impossible.

I so wanted to enjoy this game purely for the theme and massive army control, but the [b]reliance on excessive luck makes this an expensive paperweight[/b].

WOW!!! I got this fantastic game for christmas 2006. I have painted almost all the minis, made a new, larger board to accommodate the new 3d terrain pieces I have also made AND still had time to play a load of times, mostly with my girlfriend, but also with a bunch of pals. Gameplay is fast and furious, so you get all the fun of, say, a game of Warhammer, but in less time, and with no arguments over meassuring and movement!!! The customizing of Warcounsils, the composition of the lore deck, and the possible addition of creatures keep the scenarios fresh and replayable, and I am anticipating expansions for this game in a BIG way! Can´t wait to find out what/who the guest spot on the warcounsil is for! (STILL WAITING 2 years later!!!)
Arguably my girlfriend´s favourite game, and one of the most played during the last 3 years!

Yet another variation of the now famous C&C system. Components were great: nice map, pretty tiles, somewhat overdone rulebook. The minis were a bit of a letdown. They looked too similar, they were unpainted and bent, and the flag-system undermined the need for different units.

The Lore system was a nice way of countering some bad dice rolls. If you rolled a Lore symbol, you got to draw Lore tokens. It was a little hard remembering to use your cards at the right moment (particularly the Reaction cards), but it was a welcome layer to the very basic C&C game.

Overall, its just another skirmish wargame with pretty bits and streamlined rules. I found it an improvement over C&C:Ancients, but there was no wow factor for me here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game has much to recommend it:
Ease of play, pieces "pre-punched", nice-looking, etc.  The expansions make it even better.
But, the rulebook and cards could have used some copy-editing and playtesting before release, and DoW has not yet provided a comprehensive, printable FAQ.
Because of this, I have reduced my rating. EDIT: The rights to this game have been transferred to Fantasy Flight Games, who at least with the latest expansions, does not preassemble the figures and bases.  :(

UPDATE:  I own the 1st edition.  There is now a 2nd edition by FGG which is NOT compatible with this edition.

Here is another Battle Cry sequel that adds some new dimensions/complexity that should be welcome for most. If you prefer to play without magic you have an updated version of the series that pretty much plays the same way. Thus I would recommend this if you only want one this is probably the one to get. I have not been much taken by the series mainly because I don't enjoy the set-up and dice rolling. I suspect that I would enjoy a computer version even though I generally am not fond of war games.

Battlelore has significantly more chaos than C&C Ancients, as well as less interesting scenarios. In fact, after getting Ancients, Battlelore sits gathering dust, and I doubt this will change.

Wow.  I really think this does a great job at living up to its hype.  That is hard to do.
This is a great step forward in Borg's design, and I think the expansions will make this one last a loooong time on people's tables.  All around it is very fun, strategic in its deck building and planning and tactical in its movement.  The luck of the die rounds out a great, thought-out system with just enough randomness to mix things up and make for some great moments of whoopin' and hollerin'!

Reduced 1 point due to stalled DoW plans...

FFG taking this over has me a tad excited all over again...if nothing else to see what direction the stalled system goes in.  We shall see.

RATING: 7
Plusses: Very clean system. VERY clean. The randomness isn't overwhelming. Cavalry works like cavalry, and heavy infantry works like heavy infantry. Very high production values: pretty pieces, nice board. I can see this game working really well with expansions.  Minuses: For some reason I felt a little blah about it after the smoke had cleared. My goblinses stomped the dwarves without too much trouble, but I think maybe I just like a little more resource management or economics or SOMETHING to hold my interest. We did play this without the lore system. There's not much of a sense of context, but that's not why anyone would play this anyway. It's not a bad game, but I truly don't get why it's rated so high.

Take 2

I've played maybe twenty or thirty more wargames between my first game of this and my second; finally I get it. (Although the level of similarity with C&C:A takes some of the shine off.) It definitely needs the lore system, and I think playing without the fancypants special powers was what made it so dull last time, although the lore cards can sometimes seem impossible to plan for. Played this with four; the Reluctant Alliance system doesn't work because there's just not enough incentive to play your own units instead of your ally's, and the cascading inefficiency that results tends to stall the game. Sure, you might say, but then some enterprising player will just sally forth with her own pieces. Minus the full cooperation of their ally, though, that tends not to work very well. The four-player game works better as a straight-up two-on-two brawl. 

The game also needs some kind of house rule to make it so you can't use lore cards to zap people who're already up against your opponent's back wall. Killing units by backing them into the backfield over and over is legit, but when you're using a magic power to do it? One that can hit anyone on the board? CHEAP.

I'd suggest: to be able to use a Lore card on a unit, any one of the following have to be true:

1) The unit is more than three spaces from the backfield.
2) A friendly unit is within three hexes of the unit.
3) The unit has attacked a friendly unit within the last round.

feels much better than Memoir. But there are still lot of randomness and player can be really screwed by bad draw. I was playing only historical screnario - I quite dislike idea of spells, wizards and so on.

But overall it raised my interest in this system and I am considering purchase of CC:Ancients - it looks like it could hit sweet spot (better deck, historical troops and scenarios).

This game seems to have it all- fun, quick playing, different layers of difficulty - I love it all. All that and my wife really likes it too!

Update: The setup time on this one seems to be becoming an issue with us getting it to the table. We don't play as many rounds each time we set up, so the play/setup time ratio has fallen. The expansions have also been mildly disappointing because they mostly involve more setup time.

The Lore definitely adds something to this game.  I would not want to play again without it.  I am finding the plastic figures are actually a downside - on the one hand they make it look like a battlefield full of soldiers adding a sense of realism, but they also make the board very cluttered, and they're a mighty pain to set out and pack away.

I set the weight at Medium because the rulebook and components still seem a little daunting, although in essence I think it's a very elegant light-medium system once you grok it.

This is my first board-based wargame and I enjoyed it a great deal.  I've played a number of real-time strategy computer games and also enjoyed them, although I think my brain is not wired to play them well.  I just don't make sensible decisions.  Still, I'd be up for more Battlelore, especially since I haven't yet tried the Lore system.

Not quite as pretty as Memoir, more fiddly to set up, but more variety in the units (halfway between Memoir & CC:A).  Pay your money, take your choice.  Expansions (both DoW & FFG) are borderline incoherent compared to Memoir.  But this is still damn fun.

This is a really good game. I was skeptical about it at first, after all it was a game with goblins and dwarfs clearly made for all the guys who have been dreaming about fighting real wars with such creatures since they read LotR when they were little. Not being a boy I thought I would not like it. But I did. I really did.

RATING: 10
Great introductory/light wargame!  The use of the colors, weapons types and morale rules give the troops a lot of different variety and avoid the feeling of generic units that was present in Battle Cry.  

Plays equally well as a fantasy system or a light historical wargame.  However, the Lore (fantasy) rules are so much fun the historical scenarios seem a little dry in comparison.

Update September 2009:  Raised to a "10".  This is the first wargame my son (now almost 9) will play by the rules.

I love the lore abilities, but I felt that the game is less thematic, engaging and, yes, attractive than C&C:Ancients.  Also, I didn't want to deal with painting the minis and they don't look so great unpainted.  I may end up loving the dragons and/or creatures enough to pick this game up anyway.

I was always let down by the lack of actual fantasy feel in this version.  If I wanted a more historic flavor I could play Ancients or Memoir. In another way I chose this one because it seemed in the middle from a rules weight perspective.  So in the end I've come to realize memoir is just a far easier game to get played and it also has minis and historic WW2 flavor.  FFG first tried to redo this one as Battles for Westeros and then as Battlelore 2 and now as ??? All the while Memoir and Ancients just continue on as-is.  FFG's next iteration is going to have to be absolutely out of this world for me to buy in yet again.

Excellent game. The time it takes to set up and play has been gradually increasing as I've worked through the scenarios, but it's still engaging throughout.

UPDATE (Oct. 2010): I'm sad to drop this down to an 8, but I just can't seem to get it to the table anymore, and I'm sure  could if I really pushed for it. That doesn't mean it's not an awesome game, though.

I'm a big fan of twiddling with existing game designs, and I believe that the Borg system lends well to this.  I opened this game and showed it to my 10 year-old nephew and his eyes lit up when he saw all of toy soldiers.  The game is very approachable - sort of a beer-and-pretzels game but with violence.  But I'm a bit disappointed with the Lore aspect of the game; it seems a bit "fiddly" and random.  I do like the potential for new units, uchronical battles, and expansion seats for new council member types.

I was not very impressed in any way by this one at all.  The base system has been used for three other themes ( civil war, ancient wars, and WWII) so having played one you have basically played them all.  If the system did not suffer from the same tactic the other versions of the game did, pick a unit beat on it till its dead.  Get the VP. wash rinse repeat.  The only changes have been a fantasy setting and casters(nothing big there).  I am guessing since M44 did well with a few expansions they decided to got expansion nuts with this one so they could make more money off players.

I really love the way this game plays but the 3-6 player epic expansion I think was very poor.  And I would never play with more than 2 again after trying it last time.

Good fantasy wargame with a similar game mechanism as Command & Colors Ancients (which I consider the best in the family). Only played medieval and basic Lore scenario's. Tactical play is rewarded (try to keep your units bold), but still a lot of luck in the dice and command cards. See also the other siblings BattleCry and Memoir44.

Fantasy theming has soured on me in my adulthood, doubly so for this kind of soft-pedal real-world analogue stuff that seems poorly thought through. Can't fault the system, since it's pretty good (I enjoy it in Memoir '44 and Battle Cry) but after three (or four, if you count Command and Colors: Ancients) takes on the subject, looking a little repetitious.

I like Battlelore (and the C&C system). It´s almost better / more fun than any tabletop-game I´ve played.


And:
My wife loves it. Read about Battlelore at BGG and you get the impression that´s nothing to special. And how many wargames can you name which are usually popular with that special species?

Yes - I like it alot, so it´s a clear 10 even though I´ve some concerns:

You have to build your own game-board with bigger hexes and make bases for the units (best are magnetic bases) - otherwise the game components are hampering the game; especially the set-up of an unmodified game is a pain.

And:
FFG (owner) is trying to kill Battlelore; they bought the system to take-out competition for Battles of Westeros. They published some expansions but the newer the less value you get for your money. And the expansions are overly expensive!

Okay, if you recreate the same game over and over does it count as 'polishing' or just 'can't think of anything new'? Either way this is yet another great game with the same exact concept of it's fore-fathers. The fantasy theme allows for a greater use of scenarios since the creators aren't stuck to historical events but the variation in creatures also leads to a little confusion at times. One game I played had close to 20 stat cards for the rule variations of that specific scenario. I've never been a fan of scenario driven games but this one is fairly decent. I'd recommend giving it a go at least once.

I will admit this isnt my usual kind of game but I did get it and give it a shot and it was pretty cool. Plays very quickly.

After some time though, it was sold off during my great gaming purge. Wish I still had it though.

One of those rare cases where the joy of playing the game overcomes its flaws as a simulation.  Short games; little down-time between turns; simple but agonizing decisions; decent depth for a game so abstract; and it looks great with all those miniatures.  I could just play it again and again.  The design is also amazingly elegant and clean.  The design would get this game an 8 or 9 were it not for production shortcomings:  the blue and green dice colors that look the same; the 1/2 of my miniatures that were warped and bent and required dunking and reforming in scalding water; the symbols wearing off my dice after two games.  That is strictly amateur hour and is unacceptable coming from a major game company.  Also randomness in the card draw plays a greater role in deciding the winner than I feel it should.  A powerful spell or tactical card can simply hand you the game, negating an entire game of careful maneuvering and strategizing.

RATING: 7.5
[2006.Dec.14] By combining the tried-and-true "Commands & Colors" (C&C) game system with a medieval/fantasy theme, Richard Borg has delivered a game that hits all the right chords. The addition of morale, support, lore (and its magical effects), war councils, as well as fantastic creatures only enriches this--the 4th--C&C title even more. Like its predecessors (i.e., Memoir '44, et al.), BattleLore's adventures (as the individual game scenarios are called) are relatively quick to play. Based on their modus operandi, only Days of Wonder could have published such a gorgeously overproduced game as this. With so many well-sculpted miniatures included in the base game, the BattleLore box is actually surprisingly quite hefty. I look forward to many, many years of enjoyable gaming from this title as well as its inevitable expansions.

[2014.Jun.14] Fun game. No doubt about it. The biggest drawback: set-up and clean-up. Still want to play though.

Borg is always a solid option when it comes to 2 player games.  To me, this is a richer & more complicated version of Memoire'44.

I pretty much avoided this one like the plauge because I was afraid I was going to love it too much to say "no" to all of the expansions, and end up spending hundreds of dollars collecting a set. Well, after finally playing a friend's copy of the game I find that the game simply has too many problems for me to enjoy. The battle dice are not nearly what they should be, and there are WAY too many retreats rolled. I have never seen a battle have so many troops just running away from the action. A few retreats I can understand, but not this. The units also seem very generic, and not very specific. As many units as there are in this game I wanted to see more variances in how they operate on the board. Sadly only a few things actually make them feel different from one another.

All in all the game has a lot of good things going for it (map building, multitude of units, good card driven tactics, etc., but there are just too many things that make this game not something all too enjoyable for me.

This may well be the best game of the Command and Colors system.  The resource management aspect added by the war council and the Lore system is a welcome addition.  I also appreciate the inclusion of battle back and moral boost rules from C&C Ancients.  I happen to enjoy the (admittedly light) sense of historical recreation from the non-fantasy Command and Colors games and I also enjoy the rules for leaders and the additional units of C&C Ancients but on mechanics alone this game might really deserve the edge.

Scenarios Played: Crisis in Avignon, First Encounter (CtA), Burgos: Castille, Deeper in Castile, Free Companies on a War Footing

2-player.  Includes Hill Giant, Earth Elemental, and Call to Arms expansion.  I enjoy this game, but for me, it's not living up to the hype.  The scenarios incorporating lore are certainly more enjoyable than the ones without.  I'm enjoying progressing through the scenarios, but don't know that this game is ultimately a keeper for me.

Riding on the Command and Colors!  Richard Borg, go!  This is the no. 1 wargame?  Fantasy wargame.  Looks like it is going to stay at the top for a while.  I don't like Memoir'44 so I am not sure how much I like this one.  Plus signs are the proven system that Richard used in Command and Colors: Ancient, medieval battle background, colorful rulebook, mapboard and tiles, easy to play, flag system on movement and combat endurance, magic in use with the lore cards, pre-punched figures come in a lid box.   The lack of more variety of types of troops, symetric forces on meeting engagements, lack of well-developed stories on the scenarios etc. are the minues.

Still not convinced by Lore/Magic but monsters are a fine addition.  With Red, blue and green poker chips for bases one can use one's own 1/72 scale minis to fight any ancient, mediaeval or even early modern battle one wishes one wishes. This has become our standard game. Thoroughly recommended.

RATING: 7
Now that's what I call a massive two player game! Battelore is heavy both in its actual weight and in its complexity - which easily places it out of reach of casual gamers. It's great if you have a hardcore gamegeek friend to play it with (hello Florent!). My main caveat is that luck seems to take too much prominence, especially once Lore is introduced. It's also a bit tedious to setup and pack away.

If I want a melee-heavy fantasy wargame, I'll go with the simpler and much-more-fun-to-set-up Heroscape. This system is far more suitable for a proper wargame such as Memoir 44, but trying to fit it into the fantasy setting results in a detached playing experience. Meh. I am also rather annoyed about the whole collectible aspect that seems bound to be part of this game's marketing strategy; it was the reason I stopped buying Heroscape pretty quickly after it came out, at least in this case I was forewarned by the Hill Giant release.

BattleLore is an interesting game, as it really makes you think while your playing it, it has hundreds of pieces that you need to set up prior, which makes it a little daunting to play.

An improvement from memoir44. Takes the gameplay to another level with is focus on melee attack and magic. The result is a more tense game with more tactical options.

Not even the expansions seems to offer this diversity, perhaps more heroes and monsters will.

Played for the first time. This is my first try at any C&C games. And this was awesome. We played 2 times the Agincourt battle. The French won on both times. Their cavalery were murderous! The game is incredible:

- Components are some of the best in the industry and there is plenty of it. 14 differents sculpts, 3 creatures (I got it by preorder), a rulebook clear and full of examples and good illustrations.

- Gameplay is simple to learn, yet there are a lot of tough decisions.

- I like the way the scenario are made. Each scenario introduce some new concepts up to the Lore cards. There is tremendous replay value in the box.

All in all of of the best game I've played in years. Can't wait to play all the other scenarios.

UPDATE: 
Played first scenarios with Lore. This adds a lot to the game. In term of chaos and in term of pure fun. I still think that victory condition are strange. Game seem to be over before it has begun. It becomes an exercize in keeping weak unit alive. Still a very good game. Just need to get in my head: you do not win if you wipe opponent, you win if you snipe some key opponents unit.

Update: Battlelore is now a regular that I plahy once a week. We play with a custom Council and this make the game really good. Use of creature (especially Hill Giant) has change the game a lot. I still think the game is over before it has begun but it is still a very good game. My fear is that since being bold is VERY important players will tend to play really defenseive so the game would drag.

A great incarnation of the Command and Colors system, fighting medieval battles using plausible tactics is fun in this game. The fantasy elements add some (optional) variety, and a few expansions allow the players to shape the game to be either more historically-based (hundred years war), or fantasy-based, with goblins, dwarves, and monsters. The spells are neat, but there are a couple "gotcha" cards that can upset any good strategy. My favorite Command and Colors game.

Fun. Simple Command & Colors system that when you think about it, borrows successfully from many previous game systems.  Nice figures, but I have to admit, the banner/color system I found weak at first as a piece of information design... confusing and counter-intuitive in the beginning.  Will gladly play again.

UPDATE: I lowered my rating by close to a half a point after playing Command & Colors: Ancients, which uses the same basic system.  The information design in the C&C:A production is much better, and the whole game seems cleaner and to the point.

RATING: 6
Fun to play once in a while when in the mood.  Length of setup and the need to play each scenario twice due to lack of play-balanced victory conditions are flaws keeping this from being an ideal battle system.  I prefer CCA:Ancients, though even it is a bit bloated for what should remain a simple rulesset.  My biggest complaint about Battlelore is the failure to leverage the fantasy theme with lots of creatures, magic and heroes and such, even after seemingly endless expansions.

All in all, Battlelore is a near miss.  If I am looking for a game that has a somewhat lengthy setup time and isn't necessarily all that balanced (without playing it twice and switching sides), but has great bits and you get to roll a lot of dice, I'm more likely to turn to Heroscape.  Battlelore needs more cowbell.

Luck of the draw on cards and those dice rolls really drives this game. Lore cards help somewhat by giving you more decisions.

This is a nice game, but I do have to say it may be ever so slightly overrated. It is fun, but a little simplistic for my tastes. I prefer TI3 over this I think, but it is still a good game! I tend to prefer Duel of Ages.

RATING: 6
Played a few times.

Ken:
My first boardgame purchase as an adult.  Fun variation on the C&C system.  Without C&C's other games' leaders, found the flank/center card system very limiting and frustrating.  Fiddly figures.  Lore system of questionable value.  Good medieval scenarios with potential for high replayability.  Sold off before I really got into boardgaming (long before it became an OOP gem).

Unlikely to play again.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

Kathleen:
I hated being limited by the arrows on the cards.  Lengthy setup time.  We didn't have a suitable table, which certainly did not help.  Really liked the alternate history/fantasy theme.

Pre-ordered FunGamesCafe Oct 2006 Arrived Dec 2006
Traded for a second copy Jul 2007

Looks like I might be able to re-live my Warhammer Fantasy Battle days after all!

Finally got a chance to play it, but only scenario one. And still, I like it quite a bit. Yes, it is random, yes, you don't have much control, yes it is a bit of a dice fest, but the overall barriers to entry are very low for this game so a lot of fun can be had in a short amount of time. I feel this is an excellent game for this former Warhammer Fantasy Battle player to retire to.

As of 2016 I still have my first edition Battlelore and expansions but have not played more than the one trial game. Probably will never leave my collection no that there is a second edition. But now that I have Cthulhu Wars, I have no reason to play this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Fast play. Not sure if it will appeal to all my students.
A ridiculously complete game system. BUT not without a handful of cons. At its heart, it's a wargame.

Bottom Line: Boardgames with Scott review just doesn't seem to do it for my students. While the mechanic is excellent, this seems a little too fiddly. Maybe Memoir 44 would have a better appeal. (Although Memoir's theme is not that appealing to them.)

At the end of the day, I think Small World will scratch the itch for a similar game.

CON: Set up and takedown is a killer. 
PRO: Lore and spell stuff can be omitted.

I love the fact that you cannot control absolutely everything in this game - makes it a bit more realistic.

The variety of scenarios and ways to customize both your army and how to set-up makes this a great game for our group.

While the fantasy theme is more appealing to me (except for the odd mixing with real history) and despite a few additions to make things more varied (Lore and Council), the core is the same of Memoir'44: whatever your decisions are, cards say what you can do and dice if you do it well. Minimal strategy ot tactic required.
Great bits.
The quasi-collectible nature of the game is a detriment as well.

A much better theme for the C&C system than WWII.  Having said that, I think I'd still rather play M'44 as the theme is less appealing to me and the magical nonsense tends to make play even more random.

Alright, I give up - it's a 10. Without magic, BattleLore is unexpectedly a good deal more predictable than C&C, mostly due to the absence of leaders and tamer melee counterstrike opportunities.

This is the BEST C&C game. The system has evolved to a point of near perfection with this game. I'm excited to see how they expand and develop the system. I really enjoy the morale and support tactics. The various level of troops from Ancients is awesome. The aspect I was unsure of was the magic, or Lore. It's actually great fun and doesn't overpower or slow down the gameplay. This is an instant classic, in my book!

Only played 2 times and with the basic rules so this rating should change. The game looks great, production is about the best I have seen from any company. I want to play again with the lore system, with out it the game is far far too simple. rate a 5 or so. I am also looking forward to extra stuff in the expansions keeping the game fresh. 3rd play, used a bit of lore. It was interesting, added a lot of semi random destruction but the game is still a bit too simple for me. I will continue to play this, but I am not sure it will ever be more than just ok to me.Another game with simple lore. I am even less convinced this was worth the $70 I paid for it. Everything seems so random and I have yet to see where good play will overcome strong card combination and straight up luck. I plan to do a game with a full war council and see if this helps. If not then I think I am done.

Best "multipurpose game" ever. It can be played as a family dicefest, light or epic wargame, or use its components for a miniature tactical game. Love everything about it: the minis are great, the cards are really nice, the dice are beautiful...
A true classical.
I own it for six or seven years now, and I still remember how I felt the first time I opened the box.
Thank you, Days of the Wonder, because there's a lot of love put in this game.

Made obsolete by Battles of Westeros.  Similar combat system, what this game lacks is a theme.  I don't like the generic nature of the units and the various commanders you can have.  Long setup time for a short game, that doesn't help.

Adds a whole lot of stuff to Memoir '44, nothing of which is really good. Even though I like the theme of this better, Memoir is by far the better game. This is just way too melee-focused for my liking.

RATING: 7.5
Second-best of the Commands & Colors games, after Ancients.  Rating after 2nd, 3rd, and 4th scenarios only, so I haven't gotten to the lore yet.  Thus, consider 7.5 a tentative rating.  I expect this to go to 8 upon trying all the rules.  The diverse units are fun, but the apparent prevalence of section (center, right, left) cards reminds me of Battle Cry and Memoir '44, where I've gotten used to the more balanced deck in Ancients.  That make Battlelore seem more luck-dependant than Ancients, and it didn't have the dynamic feel I'm used to in Ancients.  Still, it's a fun game, and I'm looking forward to see what lore and critters will add to the game.  Even more, I'm looking forward to some Tolkein-inspired fantasy battles.

RATING: 7
Clearly better than Memoir 44, which is an excellent game.  Two minor issues...  some of the figures are squished and now what do I do with Memoir due to it being replaced.  The manual is excellent and so is the overall gameplay and look and all that intangible stuff.  Fun, pure and simple.

After more plays, considering dropping the score.  The pure chaos of the dice at times gets frustrating.  With lousy cards and subpar rolling it feels more like the game is playing you.

Few plays, have yet to even get into a deep feeling on what the system has to offer (mostly the depth of lore options). Can't wait to see it all. I dig the forced strategy that is created by the card draws, but it isn't tooo random, a nice balance.

I do wish it didn't take so damn long to set up and I'm REALLY disappointed in the expansions on offer. Where is the real fantasy? I don't give a rats ass about more pikemen or generic dwarves, I was some fucking zombies and dragons and everything else awesome from a Monster Manual. Hopefully FF will get on the ball now that they took over the property.

Played 7 times 5 times with lore and monsters.  Set up is a pain but once its out on the table its easy to go to another scenario.  Luck is an important element (lost my giant to the first attack in my last game "damned archers") but does not decide every game.  Also it is possible to just draw the wrong command cards and get run over that way. Still a fun game that rewards good play. Using the lore rules adds a lot to the game.

This game is one of my wife's favorites.  The game uses the C&C system to good effect.  While I prefer Memoir '44, this game does emphasize formation in battle.  The components are wonderful, if bendy.  Lore, however, seems to add less predictability and more randomness to the battles (it also adds to the setup time).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Simple to learn, quick to play, yet offers a lot of variety, and fun.  With a good selection of scenarios that come with the game, and even more available online to download, the average gamer should be satisfied for a long time.

The tutorials in the rule book are easy to follow, and provide a good way to learn the game basics.  The scenarios become more complex, and introduce more rules with each scenario.

The game components are also worth mentioning, as they are very well made.  Even though it might be hard at times to tell them apart, the plastic pieces look great.  The artwork is also exceptional, as well as are the cards, which are the main driving force behind the game.

Unlike most war games, Battlelore uses a rule system called the "Command and Colors system" (same as Memoir '44).  Everything a player does in the game revolves around drawing of random cards, including moving the units themselves.  While Battlelore does contain a lot of random elements, such as drawing of cards, and rolling of dice, it still involves some strategy, and tactics.

Originally, I was put off by this system, as I like to have total control over my units, but after actually playing a few games, I grew to like it.  It is simple, and fast.  Also, with usually at least 5 cards on hand to chose from, there are some tactical decisions to be made.  Unlike many other wargames, you can fight an entire battle usually in under an hour.

There are also many "cool" features the game has to offer, such as magic, customizable "Lore Masters" (which bring quite a bit of strategy to the table), and monsters.  Unfortunately, there is only one monster in the base game, and the other two are hard to get, as they were limited time only offers.  

However, since Fantasy Flight Games took over the Battlelore license, thing are looking up.  There are already two expansions on the horizon, and possibly more in the future that might offer more new monsters!  

Of course, there is already a handful of expansions out there, that make the game more interesting; especially the Call To Arms expansion, and A Hundred Years' War.  

All in all, this is a fun little game that is easy to learn, and will offer hours, and hours of fun.

The game is easy to learn but still retains a great deal of strategy. I really like how you are able to customize your own War Councils. By itself, Battlelore is worthy on a 9 ....with the expansions, this game gets a perfect 10. There is no reason to not own this game.

RATING: 6
02/23/13 Played the first scenario, Agincourt, once, using the basic rules. 
Keeping in mind I only saw a small fraction of the whole Battlelore game system, I found it OK. I'd never buy it as, its mainly for the fantasy admiring crowd, which I am not a member. Yet the scenarios/rules without the fantasy elements were alright. Though from looking at the rule book that's the exception. As to the components, the cards were well done, the dice were good, the board and terrain tiles were of nice quality, the summary cards were of great value. The troops however were another matter. They were adequate, but since they were all gray, it made telling the two sides apart once units were mixed together in the middle of the board difficult. Sure, they had different shaped banners, but the colors of the banners were the same for both sides. In brief, *very* annoying. I would be willing to play any other scenarios as long as the fantasy bits (giant spiders, hobgoblins, swarves, lore) were kept out. With that restriction I rate the game a "6". *If* I were forced to play with the fantasy elements I'd rate it a "2".

Good game, but there is too much luck through the cards. The player with the better cards often overruns the other one, because he can move more units or units in two areas.

Played a senario without any objectives beyond killing the other guy's troops (I really need strategic objectives in a game of this type). I like the Lore system. I enjoy fantasy more than WW2, so I like the theme better here than in Memoir. However, I missed having numerous ranged units, as in Memoir. In fact, I missed them so much I think I like the ill-favored themed Memoir better, but more playings will tell.

I really wanted to like this game but after giving it many chances, it just didn't live up the expectations. Its not a bad game - but I'd rather play so many other games especially since there is too much of an element of luck here and it takes while to set up. Also, I don't like being limited in my command abilities by the cards in my hand.

A very good game. It's fun. Luck could very easily throw the game in some cases, but there are many ways to mitigate this (war councils, morale boosts). The luck in this game, imo, is perfect.

If it didn't take so long to start and sort after clean up, it would get a 9.

Update: After a few games now, I put it down to 7.5. It's still pretty good, but sometimes (more often than not) the ending is a little anticlimactic. The epic battlefield is a must to mitigate some of this. It really gives you a chance to strategically place your troops.

Playing with Epic is the way to go. It really adds to the game by allowing for more strategy. Now you have more time to line up your troops into more useful formations (and possibly take more strategically important ground).

Update: the more I play this game the more I like it. Now if I could just find somebody just as enthusiastic and that has played before.

Had a lot of fun with this game. Epic is very entertaining.

The addition of the "Lore" mechanic to the system creates a much higher interest level for both players than previous games using this concept. Introducing the players to the game with "historical" scenarios with the promise of magic and monsters in the later games helped me get a non-wargamer to try the game and we are both hooked.  My only complaint is that I had to spend over an hour heating and bending the figures so they were somewhat straight.  I had to do more than 60% of the figures.  They seem to be slowly bending back to the angled positions while in storage.

Thanks to Scharri7 for this game, which I scored in the BGG.CON 2009 math trade. I even acquired a second copy, but since getting it I've only gotten it back to the table once. Which makes me sad.

I like the game quite a bit, as it hits a good spot along the length/depth/complexity axes. I think the cards--and the attendant possibility of getting shut out where you want to move--work well in a light game like this. Not so well, I expect, in a heavier game.

Lore is a nice addition, as it adds not only magic but fun swings of fortune. The lore cards are interesting and fun and seem to add just the right amount of unpredictability. And of course the monsters are cool.

I do wish the set-up/tear-down time was less. This one is best if you have a dedicated opponent and want to play several games in a row.

I like that this is a little more complex and a little bit meatier than Memoir '44. I'd go with Memoir for a quicker game, I'd go with this for something with a similar feel but more complex. Both are handy to have, as they fill satisfying niches. If I could somehow carry around 20 games at all times, just in case a game opportunity came up, both of these would be among them.

One of the best 2-player games I've played.  Though the setup is a tiny bit cumbersome, you'll be rewarded for it by the gameplay.  There are so many interesting nuances that offer a great breadth of strategy.  It contains just enough luck to make things fun.  Though the pricetag looks steep, you get so much game for the buck.  The game bits are fantastic.  the board is beautiful and the replay value onscenarios is very high.  The changes from the Memoir style of rules are all little improvements and refinements.  Days of Wonder really hit a home run with this one.

Mmm... in-between M44 and C&C as far as I can tell. I totally dig the theme (damn!! why did I just by M44 and 2 expansions *2* weeks ago!!), and the gameplay is probably a bit better than M44 -- I like how they added in light/medium/heavy infantry but without the nasty C&C player aid to detail every single unit's ability.  really really worried that they'll pull a 'heroscape' on me and "force" me to buy 20,000 expansions... I'll stay away for a year or two and see

Solid tactical war game with great chrome (aka thousands of miniatures).  I like the battle-back formation mechanics and the stream-lined card-laying activation system.  I enjoyed it better than Memoir '44 especially since it has a much better theme.

Fun battle game that is easy to set up and has some decent add-ons. Combat system and line of sight is simple without being for four year olds. Only real gripe is player count is really limited to 2, there is a system for 4 players but kinda feel that its a bit tacked on and a bit clunky. Lovely theme and components though

A little less tactic and seriousness than in Commands & Colours, but that is not necessarely bad. The lore element is funny, it brings in a lot of surprises and unexpected changes on the battlefield. Also the war council is a nice thing. The equipment of the game is unbelievable, you get a really heavy box with nice and uncountable figures.All in all I prefer C&C:A, but it´s really close race between this two and depends on my mood.

RATING: 7.75
This two-player game uses the same basic mechanics as Memoir '44: miniature units on hexes are moved by "command cards" that state which sub-class of units can move and/or attack.  This game adds more complexity (and opportunities for strategy) when compared with Memoir '44: units have morale effects, unit attack values are dependent on both the type of unit and the color of flag (so unit strength varies widely), and there are now a separate set of Lore cards.  The lore cards are an excellent addition, as they add more tactical and strategic possibilities to the game, and require careful planning regarding when and how to use them.  The addition of morale is another great change, as it makes unit placement much more strategic (e.g., units with high morale can counterattack when attacked). While there is much opportunity for tactical and strategic thinking, at its core this game is still heavily luck based (all attacks are based on die rolls, and what units you can command depends entirely on the cards in front of you).  If you're looking for a straight up wargame, this isn't for you. 

Update (March 2007): I just played an Epic scenario with four players, and it was great; being able to play two command cards and work with another player was great.

Update (June 2007): I just played Call to Arms, and that expansion makes the game even better. It's great to be able to choose (to some extent) where the troops go.

Update (January 2009): The wisdom of time, and having now played another unit-based combat game (Conflict of Heroes: AtB), has led me to realize that Battlelore isn't all that I thought it was.  The use of cards to drive unit movement is highly limiting tactically, the setup time is far too long, and the unbalanced scenarios are just frustrating.  Due to these problems it turns out that I haven't played this game in more than a year and a half (not consciously ... we just stopped suggesting it).  Thus I'm lowering my rating from the original 8.5 to 7.75.

Great fun, simple core system, and so much potential for expansion (without ridiculous amounts of extra special rules every time). DOW look set to fulfill this potential with an ambitious plan of future releases. Ignore any tedious crys of "too random".

A solid version of the Commands & Colors. We didn't use the Lore, which sounds interesting. Otherwise it's quite good; kind of confusing to recognise troops from the waviness of their banners, but that's life in the medieval battlefields for you, I suppose.

Indifferent.

RATING: 6
I have to say that this Command & Colors system lends itself far better to this type of game than to the WWII stuff in Memoir '44.

I think this would be rated higher, but setup and tear down takes too long. I think we spend almost as much time doing those tasks as actually playing...

Update: wow it's been almost a year since this has seen the table. It's just not in demand - my son, who was my primary opponent, has declared he has no desire to play it. Off it goes in trade, I suppose.

Using the Commands and Colors system like Memoir '44 and Battlecry, this is an excellent game for two player (However, it can be played by up to six with the Epic Expansion which I have.).

The expansions add a huge amount of variety in troops, creatures, and scenarios.

It's very clear the publisher went the extra mile to make the bits high-quality; the rule book is written for the entry-level gamer, thwarting frustration by easing newbies into the increasingly-complex and elaborate rules system.  BattleLore is a contemporary wargame with a modular ruleset and dynamic play through the lore/war council scenarios. This makes the game better than its companion title, Battle Cry.   Some shortfalls from the aspect of this old-school wargamer:  the board seemed a bit cramped, possibly by design to hasten  gameplay by expediting conflict.  Also, for the experienced gamer - forget the basic game.  Without the lore system, this is a medicore wargame with pretty bits. Another thing that could detract from the fun are the random elements: (dice), and the command cards vary sufficiently in power to create an imbalanced game between similarly skilled players from time to time.  Overall, though - the game is sufficienly polished to minimize this.

I have the game and have played the basic scenario with my son (5 at the time of this writing) without a lot of the more complex rules (think the Young Generals ruleset without the cards).  While I found that session enjoyable, I do want to get the chance to play the regular rulesets before rating the game.

Update (09/2007):  I have played the game several times since then with the regular rules (still no Lore stuff), and while it's good, I miss the lack of leaders.  Although there are things that are good here (battling back and pursuit, among others), I think I like Battle Cry better than Battlelore because of the impact the leaders have.

Out of all of Berg's CC game series, this is my favorite. Days of Wonder went out of their way to make some of the best components ever included in a boardgame. Whether you are a casual minitaure painter like I am, or a detailed artisan, the figures are fun to paint. The game play adds magic to the CC mix, and the continuing expansions and scenarios available on the DoW website make this a really great game.

Revision:
I find myself enjoying C&C Ancients more now. I play it more than the others in the series.

The usual fine Borg system, but even with the addition of Lore and the War Council it felt a bit pallid after the VERY specific C&C:A.  For those who appreciate streamlined rules, magic, and monsters, BL will be an easy sell.  But for those who don't mind a few fiddly rules to make their C&C experience evocative, C&C:A still reigns supreme.

Rating might rise as I play more.  And I will play more!

RATING: 7
Some nice mechanics and plenty of opportunity for expansion but I think that the game is marred by a poor mish mash of themes. I would rather it decided one way or the other if it is to be a fantasy game or an historical game. Some of the fantasy themes are rather tired and cliched (Scottish Dwarfs) or too wacky (Ostrich riders?) for my taste. Some of the models are poorly cast. Could do with looking less confusing on the table too. Is potentially expandable into a great game though.

Very impressive.  Takes the mechanisms of M'44, adds a couple of layers of complexity and extra features all in a fantasy setting.  Superb.  I love the way that agressive play (and in some cases good defensive play) is rewarded with lore - this makes for a fast moving game, if it's played well.  What's more it has heaps and heap of replay value.  The expansions and the magic (lore) have all been thought out an dimplemented very well and  add very much to the game whithout detracting from the overall feel and flow.  I can see me playing this for many years to come.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Uses the Command & Colours Card System as the driving mechanic but with a fantasy theme. Aims to offer a mixture of historical and fantasy scenarios and miniatures. Whilst it looks pretty the base box is a little light on scenarios. This game will be big on expansions however and the game should shine in time. A must for lovers of the C&C system and fantasy. Owners of Ancients and\or Memoir may want to wait for a few expansions to gauge the direction it takes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Richard Borg created a niche for himself with the Commands and Colors series. Since Memoir, I've spent a lot of time in that niche - especially with BattleLore.

Add in Call to Arms, Epic, War councils, creatures, and now new specialist units. Don't bother buying this game unless you want to buy into the system. 

Days of Wonder planned ahead on this game, and it shows. The expansions plug in like missing pieces to a big puzzle. You can play BattleLore without Call to Arms or Epic, but when you add them in you start realizing that the base game is incomplete. Some may not go for this, thinking it too much of a collectible game. I 'm all for it. Sometimes I want to play a miniatures game without all the hassle, and it's just easier to play BattleLore.

Playing pre-generated scenarios is fun, but you only get so much out of them. With the expansions that have been released thus far, the whole system moves into the realm of army customization without adding too much time to the game's setup. Pick a deployment deck. Pick a few specialist cards. Assign your war council. Assign your deployment cards and place your reserve units, and start playing. It's efficient, yet gives you endless combinations of war council and specialist cards.

Setting up the units remains the worst part of the Commands and Colors games. BattleLore is no different, and adds in banner bearers, so it takes longer than Memoir or C&C: Ancients.

The most impressive part is the rulebook - not the full color perfect bound-ness of it, but the clarity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.75
Simply stuning in every respect.  The evolution of the C&C system now introduces Lore - and takes gaming to a whole new level.  The War counsel is ingenious and is what really makes BL shine.  Great production values from start to finish cap off an amazing gaming experience.

Battlelore sits in an unconfortable position: for a quick light dicefest-gaming fix Memoir is better suited, and for your light wargaming needs C&C Ancients is almost perfect.

I still want to get some of the expansion to see if they can make this really special...

Another great adaption of the Commands & Colors system.  It's a great fusion of board, miniature, and card games.  The only issues I have with BattleLore is the lack of scenarios and the piecemeal approach to their expansions. Also, I wish DoW would consolidate their player's aids onto a single sheet of paper (like GMT's C&C: Ancients) instead of using cards.  The C&C system is much better suited for ancient/medieval warfare.

This game seems to lack enough meaningful decisions to justify the time commitment.  Heavy randomness in both card drawing AND die rolling is not really a great combination.  I suppose all C&C games suffer from this to a degree, but this game particularly just feels very random.  Perhaps it is dependent on a player getting immersed in the theme in order to enjoy it, which I failed to do.

Could have blown away other Commands & Colors titles if not for a case of the publisher biting off more than it could chew.

Absolutely great game. Played the first three scenario's straight through last night with a friend, neither of us having played it before. Games were set up in good time, played out quickly and were generally a blast. The only reason I give it less than a perfect 10 is the occasional quirky rule.

Can I call Battlelore a light wargame? The rules are easy to understand, the gameplay is really fun and the expansions add a lot of possibilities to this game (although the base game brings everything you need to have a good time for many months to come). 

With Call to Arms and Epic Battlelore.

RATING: 6
I purchase Battlelore based upon the good press, and while some of this I now believe to be more hype than substance, Battlelore is enjoyable.  I don't like it as much as others, but I do like the blend of historical and fantasy, and I like the customizable aspect of the War Council.  There is a lot of room for both strategy and tactics, and I like the additions that new units and rules will provide.  The game is also produced wonderfully; playing card sized references for specific units/weapons/terrain is a really nice addition.

My concern is that much of the strategy can be undone by very powerful lore cards.  Because the lore accumulates endlessly, casting a huge spell is almost only a matter of drawing it and waiting.  I think what ultimately saves Battlelore is the short playtime.  You can play several games in one session, and this alleviates somewhat the possibility of big swings due to lore.  I enjoy the game and the possibilities it presents, but ultimately its a little too light and chaotic for me to devote lots of time to it.

It's a good game, I just like C&C:Ancients better. The 'all my troops wander the battlefield in triangle formation' result of the battle back rules is silly and the lore adds even more luck to the game...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Burn 'em all: My rating is based on one game. This is my first C&C System experience, but I didn't like the fact that when you are planning a move on the board, you actually need a card to do that. It doesn't simulates the war strategy as good as I'd like.

2006-12-23: After more games, I started to really like this game. The Lore rules add a lot to gameplay.

2007-05-15: There's no way I enjoy this game with so much luck involved.  It's the same Risk's feeling: frustration. No matter how well planned your moves are, you'll end seeing your units taking hits until you are completely lost. Down to 4. I rather play risk than this game...

This game is so boring and dumb that it deserves the lowest rating.

I'm sure Tom Vassel was paid to turn on the hype for this game (just like he was paid to do the same thing for Ticket to Ride).

RATING: 6
I've played this game a few times at a friend's house during visits to Chattanooga, TN. It IS a great game.  But is it worth $70??  To me, not right now as it doesn't really add anything that Memoir '44 and Command&Colors already give me. Yes, the production value is very high, and the card mechanism is cool. The latter provides such a nice tension that is only amplified by the momentary chaos that lore cards introduce. The system really is a tactical miniatures game. Miniature gamers normally plunk 300 - 500 dollars into their armies / game (if not more). And by comparison, BattleLore is cheap and pretty elegant! But C&C I find to be even more elegant AND I've found that it plays pretty well by itself (while being vaguely historical), and Memoir I have fewer hang ups about showing to people here in Poughkeepsie.  Besides I've already plunked money into a miniature set (Warmachine) that I now regret.

With Battlelore 2nd edition being released everyone was selling their Battlelore first editions so I picked up a second hand copy.

Not a huge fan of C&C games, but with the use of magic (Lore) adds another level to the game so I like it much better than Memoir '44.  

I can understand how BattleLore 2nd edition is a much better game (although slightly different).  However I feel like I own a part of history.  I love the huge amount of figures, how good they look painted, and how good it looks set up.  Game play leaves a bit to be desired though.  Set up is a pain, although not as bad as some people would make it out to be.

Very glad I own a copy (and expansions)

I did a few solo plays to try to learn the game, then played against my brother after he spent an evening with the "Thick and Ancient Tome of Rules." He proceeded to destroy me, 6-1. Ouch...

Battlelore is another improvement over the Battle Card driven systems in Battle Cry and Memoir '44 (I haven't played C&C: Ancients, so I can't speak to that).  Although frustrating  at times, the card driven system is generally fun, and the addition of the lore system, including getting to set up your own lore council, is pretty damn neat.  The possibility of expansions excites me too, with slots for more creatures, "guest" appearances, other lore cards, etc, etc, etc.

EDIT:  This really dropped in my estimation after a few more plays.  Keeping track of which grey troops were yours and which were your opponents was a pain and it just wasn't nearly as good as Memoir or C&C Ancients.

RATING: 4
BattleLore takes the superb fun of Command and Colors system from Memoir '44 and adds a whole slew of extra fantasy themed rules to the pot. Unfortunately, the sheer bulk of the resulting rules slows the game to a crawl, and it runs best in the few scenarios that don't feature any of the special rules. When players require enough "quick" reference cards that each stack could comprise an entire additional rulebook, something has gotten out of hand. 

Rejected.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As good as advertised.  I look forward to the expansion possibilities.  The magic system works very very well and adds a fair amount of delicious tension.  When you see your opponent start to store up lore you suddenly feel quite a bit of pressure to hit him hard before he can make use of whatever cards he's holding.

Un gran juego de estrategia "fácil" para dos jugadores. Excelente sustituto de juegos de miniaturas coleccionables, con él se ahorra espacio y tiempo al jugar. A veces los dados te juegan malas pasadas pero por lo general es un juego bastante equilibrado. Jugar con Lore integra nuevas variantes y diversión -aunque también algunas "injusticias"-. Divertido y con muchas expansiones y, por lo tanto, variantes.

I gave this game a 9 when I first got it...I now lowered it to a 5
as we aren't playing it.The problem is DoW has still not produced
a "World Setting"for the game & has not introduced any new races.
We have all the expansions but won't buy into another until the
above concerns are met.

Without the promised Alternative Age Setting the game is just a
series of one off battles & without some additional races you
can't do much justice to creating your own Setting.

Good game, kind of like fantasy/medieval Memoir '44.  The spells feel a little overpowered or unbalanced to me.  For me, Warmaster is more fun in the same genre (of course, hard to compare a minis game to a boardgame).  There is something about this game that keeps it on the shelf for me, despite being thematically right up my ally!

Regard this as the starter set it is...a base game that lacks alot of options and requires you to purchase alot more to achieve such. I like that you do recieve a ton of pieces for your buck but with just this set its a pretty straight forward miniatures combat game in my mind.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
First play was underwhelming.  Not so good as Memoir 44.Much thicker rulebook made game less accessible; morale rules made for games that are even more one-sided.Armor means next to nothing. It is as easy to hurt an armored knight as it is a chump archer. Also, the archers are almost as mean in hand-to-hand as the soldiers. Aren't archers supposed to flee when you crash into them?  Maybe all of the magic and such will spice it up a bit, but if this wasn't my buddy's new game I probably wouldn't bother playing it again.
***
Bottom line?  I'm shocked that this game has made it to #5.  It's disheartening that the gaming world has grown so weak and flaccid by the flood of Euro games that they hold up a kiddy luck-fest like this as great gaming.
***
I've been spared the horror of playing this one again, but it's slightly gratifying to see that it has dropped to 8.  Any dink who ranks this one above Dune should be taken out and beaten with a heavy, blunt object mercilessly for hours on end.

I love Battle Cry and Memoir'44, but this takes the C&C system to new heights. Furthermore, it has got Scottish Dwarfs - my own Wee Free Company who, in the spirit of the Auld Alliance, will skelp the Sassenachs at the least provocation. You even get four races to start with: Goblinoids, Dwarfs, Humans and English. And there's nuthin' worn under oor kilts, it's aw in perfect workin' order! All Dwarfs are trained in the ancient Scottish martial art of Fukyujimi.

Awesome 2 player action.  The mechanics in this game are spot-on.  I have had the luxury of finding a friend that shares the same enthusiasm as I do for this game and we have been having a blast.  

Poker-faces REALLY help with this game, strategic placement of all your troops to make sure all of their morale is high, playing the right cards at the right time, not chasing your enemy at an inoppurtune time, and lore-chasing. 

Last night I played two very fulfilling games of this and cannot wait to play again soon, way passed 20 times played and am still eager to continue playing.

Good game that I wish would live up to it's potentual. So far it's been taken two directions, but neither spot on. With my love for Fantasy warfare, and Medival warfare, it should be great. Mostly though I find it's out-shown by C&C:Ancients & Napoleonics, and even Memoir '44's more solidly consistant.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very fun two player war type game. Play is similar to C&C:Ancients, but has changes. Can use spells or other special powers to modify your attacks, movements, or other qualities. Set up time can be a bit long, but after setting up once or twice, it goes much faster. Reasonable play length as well. Always feels tight, seems like replaying the scenarios can lead to more strategic thinking and not just a slugfest. Even a basic paint job on the minis will make setup and play so much easier.

While I enjoy the system, unless you play a lot, the rules tend to be a bit hard to keep in mind. There are plenty of minor rules you have to pay attention to, which tend to be forgotten with infrequent play.

First tried this at Essen 2006. It wasn't something I was interested in before the fair, but after seeing it set up I felt had to try it. Lots of luck, but I really enjoyed it. Since then I've played the official release and I've remained impressed. 
 
Although Battlelore works well as a self-contained game, the scope for expansions should make this a really excellent game, however I have yet to see Days of Wonder support the system with anything that could turn this from a good game into a great game. (8)

RATING: 7
Battlelore 1st edition is fun and offers a lot of game components and options.  A ton really.  The game can be surprisingly simple or really complex.  Both ways to play are fun.  A lot of fun depending on who you are.

There are a lot of complaints about luck being involved.  I'll say from the BASIC PLAY stand point, there is a good amount of luck, not a bad amount.  The following is a review of basic play mechanics.

There are two main components of luck.  COMMAND CARDS and the BATTLE DICE.  COMMAND CARDS decide what sort of actions you can take on your turn, you start off with a fixed amount depending on the scenario and you draw one at the end of your turn.  COMMAND CARDS say things such as: Move up to 3 units on the left side of the map.  Or Move up to as many Green banner units as to how many command cards you have including this one.  They are flexible and you'll always have a few to choose from.  There is a fun bit of meta gaming involved as you have to decide which command to play and think a turn or two ahead so you can combo up movements strategically.  Consider COMMAND CARDS thematically, they represent what you're in position to command.  As an overlord in charge of an army, you're rarely in a situation/position where you can aptly tell everyone what to do.

BATTLE DICE are just fun luck factors.  There is a 1/3 to 1/2 chance to affect the battle field depending on your attacking unit and position.  There is a chance to cause damage and/or cause a break in the enemy's morale and force them to retreat.  The retreat/pursuit mechanics are a ton of fun and can really intensify the state of battle.

The order of things makes a lot of sense and if you do the historical campaigns they can really make you feel like you're commanding the souls of your troops.  You can become inspired to develop your own campaign and house rules.

Battlelore is a fun wargame-lite.  I personally don't own any wargames as of writing this, so maybe I'm ignorant to what the genre has to offer, but I sincerely want to play this every night at least once.  It's quick and easy and is as immersive as you and your opponent let it be.  [I go for maximum immersion].

The addition of Lore and War Councils combined with a fantasy setting have pushed the C&C system to a new high for me.  BattleLore takes some of the best bits from C&C Ancients like the importance of formation and support as well as the ability to battle back for certain units.  Each game plays in under an hour and with the free online scenario editor I'll be able to design my own scenarios.  BattleLore combines my love of fantasy RPGs and miniature wargames into a fun, playable boardgame.   2 copies.

Like the command system. Good "zoom" on the game scale. Was looking for something inbetween risk and warhammer fantasy battle and came upon this. The jury is still out on the whole lore-part of the game. The whole fantasy theme is abit pasted on, the game tries to get both historical (which i like) and fantasy (which im personally abit tired of right now) to work in equal measures side by side, and probably fails to please both camps. I prefer to play the historical missions. should probably have a closer look at Memoir ´44 too. =)

One of my favorite board games. The box contents just seems like a labor of love went into its making. It has so many nice touches and aspects that just make it that much more appealing for me. 216 miniatures in a good variety of molds, a colorful, fantastic rule book with great art and explanations of game play, plenty of terrain tiles for making interesting board layouts, lots of colorful and interesting command and lore cards etc. Even the small things like including stands for the cards, plastic cauldrons for the lore tokens, little banners for every unit, real wooden dice, etc just show that they could have cut corners on this game to save money yet they chose not to and wanted to make this something really special. I appreciate the work that went into this game.

Battlelore takes the Command & Colours game engine and turns it into its most flexible and expandable form yet.  This game has the rules and promise that make me think that in a year's time, my opinion of 'What is Battlelore?' might be totally different, since upcoming expandions might offer a completely different game experience.  For now, it's a fantastic combat game with lots of variety and lots of options.  The lore deck really adds some flavour to the game, and ensures that identical scenarios will almost never play out the same way.

June 2008: Knocked a point off the rating because I don't like the way DoW has gone about expanding the game.  Where did the cheap blister packs and cool monsters go?  Starting to feel too much like 40k with set armies and less like Magic with infinite interchangeability.

February 2009: Knocked another point off. The franchise has lost its way and I will play on occasion but this hasn't lived up to my hopes.

Has some minor balance problems and adding magic really slows the game down, but I'm willing to overlook all that just to play it.

Do wish there were other races besides dwarves and goblins. The setting feels like a very specific, very constrained place.

We wrap a whole bunch of complexity into the makeup on how many dice to roll and what combos are required to win by adding geography, pieces, chits and cards. The support rule encourages you to keep troops together which provides a different feel to Memoir '44, and the Lore cards generate a bunch of induced chaos to keep things surprising and lively, allowing people to pull rabbits our of their hat (that old trick? that never works!). I enjoyed it. I'll stick with M44 because the war theme is a better fit for me, but I can see that Battlelore is a more complex and more rewarding piece, especially for those who prefer the fantasy theme.

Base game is great in concept--in practice it needs more unit types and diversity, and better designed scenarios that have a stronger story (whether or historical or fantasy) to them.The Lore Deck feels increasingly cumbersome and like it doesn't add much to the game, the more you play.  I'm hopeful that future variants will allow a move away from the Lore Deck...or at least, re-invent how it is used.  Right not it is just a lot of fluff.

The game replicates wargaming in a very simple straightforward way. The rules are very good and the cards and dice bring in just the right amount of luck so that someone who is not normally good at these games (like me for instance) can still have an enjoyable time. The game is shorter than a lot of wargames, which in my opinion is also a plus point.

Cool game. Simple. Elegant. Fun. Expandable. Just a well rounded system with an excellent theme. Wish I could play it more.I'm getting more and more excited about this game the more a play and read about its upcoming expansions. Raised rating.The greatest thing about this game is its simplicity and the fact that it is never dull. Even if you are losing, you are focused on the game nearly the whole time. You watch what your opponent does during his turn and then you are right into your own. There is always excitement and anticipation of what is happening. There is a good deal of luck, but I have yet to have a game where I thought that the dice or the cards were just plain out to get me. Love this game. I just hope the expansions do it justice. Lowered my ranking. I don't think the expansions are doing it justice.

Best game I've ever played. (Do note that I'm a fan of miniature wargames, and I consider this one is by far the best.) I can't speak much for eurogames since they are not my cup of tea.

RATING: N/A
I like the graphics alot! This is a beautiful game. But the ease of play is seriously hampered by the miniatures themselves - I find blocks  of C&C: Ancients infinitely easier to move around. And I think it took longer to set up than to play. This one will take a back seat to C&C:A until I can get time to make up my own blocks for this. Otherwise, well done.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Disappointing. C&C: Ancients is a personal favorite and I also like Memoir 44 but I wasn't impressed with this one.

The lore system is just a way of introducing gratuitous chaos into the game and the absence of leaders removes a lot of the depth that C&C: Ancients has in spades. But what I dislike the most is the feeling that some of the units are useless and their only purpose is to serve as cannon fodder, while other units are extremely powerful and will win you the game. 

The look of the game, with the gray armies on both sides, is not that impressive either.

I usually don't like the card-driven gaming system. This game was an exception. Fantasy theme works well. The scenario-based games almost always have great replayability, so does this. Magic is only extra bonus to add some flavour to this game. Good fun for two players.

Edit: finally bought this. Also own the other two newer C&C games. They are so similar yet so different with their unique touch. R.Borg invented a good system, which really works just in any time period from fantasy worlds to WW2.

Ok, many disagree, but I don't care.

Edit2: I want to reshape my opinion: awesome fun for two players!

Superb game!
And surprisingly tactical/strategic. 
Considering that you have both card draw and dice combat, I really thought this would be highly luck driven but the strategy really was heavy in this one.
Several times the movement of the cavalry especially was critical. 
That you perhaps were unlucky with the dice and didn't do any damage, was not always the important thing. 
The placement of the troops was more important, i.e. what did you allow the opponent to do.
I only rate it 9 still until I have played it more times and have seen what more there is to do with it.
Might be I raise it to 10 soon... Just did!
We do not play this often enough. And there are now better games around.
Down to 9 now.

This is my first ever miniatures/war game, and I wasn't sure I'd like the genre, but I love it!  Although set-up takes a little effort, the games are so much fun.

Takes the best features of C&C: Ancients (while ditching the worst) and adds magic, monsters, etc.  It's a good combination with tremendous expandability, but it's not as fast-moving as Battle Cry / Memoir '44, and the fantasy elements aren't very inventive--nor does the fantasy/magic feel essential to the game.  The lack of a coherent setting is very noticeable because of the contrast with the historical games in the series.

Thanks to Ray at Geeks and Gamers and DOW, I was able to get in a pre-release game. 

The game has all the wonderful dressings of DOW at its best. If you are a fantasy gamer then here is your golden key into the C&C world.

I myself have to take my limited resources (money) and stick to one genre of this game. I love Memoir 44 and will stick to collecting those expansions.

While there are some historical battles that can be created (like Agincourt) this game comes alive with the fantasy element. If you are a fantasy type then go for it. If you love history then go with MM44 or C&C.

Prediction: This will be the game that puts DOW on the shelves of the big-box stores.

With some minimal thematic and mechanical difference with Memoir 44, this game is ranked high partially because Ana Maria loves the theme. Also, the miniatures are really nice and cool, with a lot more flavor than any other Command and Colors game I've seen. The way to power up your Lore is interesting (die rolls with the Lore symbol allow you to do that) and make for a good balancing scheme. Got to play more. I don't think this game would be any good in the historical setting only.

I was enticed by the vast armies. Not a bad game either. It's especially nice with the power cards which really set it apart from Memoir 44 and make it more unpredictable thus fun for me. Sure there's luck of the dice but again adjustable with the cards. My girlfriend also enjoys it. Too bad the setup time is kind of long. But I love seeing the massive armies waiting for battle. Be sure not to just jump in head first into the heat of battle. Some planning is advised. Otherwise you will lose!

I love the C&C game system.  The scenarios are short enough that you can play 3 or 4 in a single sitting.  Teaching the game to new players is relatively easy due to the incremental adding of rules, and if there's a part of the rules that's too complex for them, you can just play a scenario that doesn't include those rules.  Your strategy matters (I have opponents who don't have a good grasp of the strategy, and they lose probably 8 out of 10 games), but the randomness of the cards and dice gives anyone a chance to win on any given game (which is important for getting people to play again).  It's a very pretty game, and it's just plain fun to play with.

RATING: 6.75
So I broke down and bought BattleLore, after I told myself that I didn't need it.  Turns out, 'past self' was right - to a point.

As a preamble, I own Memoir 44, BattleLore and Command and Colours: Ancients.  They are all created by Richard Borg and all use a similar system.  Each have their own merits and I'll say this:  If you have either of the other games, reach for BattleLore only if you want to try the same dice and card system but with a fantasy theme.

If Command and Colours: Ancients were to be considered the 'advanced' of the Borg system of combat, then BattleLore would be considered 'intermediate' - M'44, basic.  

BattleLore takes the presentation of M'44, the raw concept of C&C:A, and jams it into a pseudo-fantasy box - clearly with the intent on making an independent game 'system' that no longer requires specific scenarios.  It does away with the intricacies of C&C:A, yet empowers the player more than with M'44.  The Lore system is truly why people come to play, and I look forward to seeing how I can further enjoy and exploit that system.

Where BattleLore truly succeeds is in pure presentation.  An expensive game, yes, but the lavish production of all of the components (packaging included) is the best I've ever seen.  The rulebook is beautiful, thorough, well designed.  The miniatures are a mini-painter's dreamland. Everything is very good.  Without reservation, this game is a solid 8, but if you have been reared on the complexity and control of C&C:A, only reach for this game if you'd like to take that basic system and add Goblins.  And Dwarves.  And giant spiders.

From top to bottom, this is a beautiful, well-executed work that delivers everything I had hoped it would.

The packaging is gorgeous, no surprise since it was originally produced by Days of Wonder. I know folks have problems with the bendy miniatures...I have many myself...but in the scheme of things, to have a couple of hundred individual characters such as these, well, I think it's worth a few imperfections. Everything was already separated upon opening the box, which I love as well. The board is nice...quite like Memoir '44, obviously...it could even be bigger, I think, but it functions just fine and is set up to add additional boards for Epic Battlelore. Nice.

The manual is an example of how game manuals should be produced. Clear prose with many illustrations make it a pleasure to learn. The scenarios are set up so that each one builds upon the last and generally adds another level of play, making the learning curve fun and simple to grasp. The C&C system works wonderfully here, and we absolutely love the addition of Lore and the war council. 

Setup takes a while, but I think this is a function of finding a better way to store the pieces compartmentally. I truly hope that FFG makes available the extra creatures because it's a shame to think we won't be able to acquire them for a reasonable price, which might make them prohibitive.  

I could play this game all day.

RATING: 9
Splendid game here.  This is a little more complex than Memoir '44, while preserving the beauty of the visuals that is missing from C&C Ancients.  I like the lore system a lot, and the use of terrain for simple effects without bogging the player down in a gazillion modifiers is a nice touch.  The bravery system works well to keep players putting their units near each other, which then serves to create concerns about area of effect lore powers and mobility concerns.  I like it a lot.

Where the various incarnations of Risk apply a mutation of the base system to a variety of themes resulting in unique experiences; Battlelore applies the core C&C system and then adds an over-the-top amount of chrome without an equivalent return in depth. 

The basic rule book is something in excess of 50 pages and does nothing to make this feel any different from Battle Cry or Mem 44. 

Wizard King from Columbia has 8 pages of rules and delivers the punch Battlelore never does.

Awesome game! Lots of fun.

Update: Admittedly it takes way too long to set up. (a half an hour or more, whereas Manoeuvre only take five minutes) The plastic pieces are nice, but a lot harder to store and sort than chits. I don't get to play this very often, and the hype has worn off, but it's still a pretty good two player game. In short Manoeuvre scratches a similar itch, is more portable, and is easier to get out regularly.

I love this game.  I waited to rate it a 10 until I had played through a few more scenarios, but the enjoyment hasn't paled at all.  Everyone I've introduced it to has really gotten into the game.  I can't wait until I get to play through all the rest of the scenarios.

Update: I still like this game, but it is not a 10 for me.  The production quality is excellent, I am glad that I bought this game while it was in print.  The scenarios feel quite similar and there is quite a lot of luck involved.  Good game, I just haven't been in the mood to play it much recently.

Hey, not bad at all.  The boy and I played four scenarios so far, and enjoyed ourselves.  We haven't gotten around to playing lore rules yet, but I suspect they will make the game that much more fun.  Will update when we've played a "full" game.  Oh, one gripe so far: set up is longish.  
Update: Upping score to 8.  Lore really enhances the game and speeds it along.  Full War Council will be next, and likely last update.  Set up is going much faster now that we know how to do it.
Update: Back down to 7.  Too big of a hassle to drag out for the pay off.  Still glad I own it, but...

I feel like I want my cake and to eat it too with this game.  One of the things that really attracted me to it was the quick play-time.  However, setup takes so long, that it sometimes takes longer than the game itself, which is just frustrating.  It feels like there isn't enough meat to the game, and yet at the same time that was exactly what I wanted.  I don't know how to fix it to make it better though.

A good game, similar to its counterpart Memoir '44. I prefer Battlelore  because of the fantasy theme (also if it seems to me a little more lucky driven than Memoir, at least if Lore is used).
Fantastic components and one of the best rulebook ever seen. A real pity it's only for two players... for me it's an enourmous limit.

 It is good? yes. However I still like the feeling of "CC: Ancients" better. Anyway, the options and the giant units give this game a lot of appeal.

 I can't help but to think that the command deck was at it's top on Ancients, and it felt like a comeback to Battlecry this time.

I really enjoy the light moral system incorporated into this game. The idea that you have to keep your units together and in formation gives me the feel of a must more involved wargame, without so much difficulty. The setup time for it is somewhat long, but if you can play 2 or so games its works out.

My first REAL game. I played it a lot,
 but recently it has been just sitting on my shelf.
I don't like long setup time, 
it sure takes a lot for a game that
 can be played in 60 minutes.
 All in all it is a good game.

RATING: 4
It's a decent game, fun, nice minis, but it is NOT as good as most people depict it. There's a fanatical cult behind it (quite aggressive and radical), and they seem to think it's the best game in the galaxy (and they will eat your heart out with a wooden spoon it you dare to disagree with them). Truthfully, it's overrated. No matter what people say, it IS very luck dependant, and doesn't allow for strategic playing, and allows for very limited tactical playing. Now, with all the expansion packs, it is clearly becoming a money machine, so I'm beginning to dislike it.

Edit: After a while, it begins to suck. Later, it reeks. Totally dependant on luck. Devoid of strategy. A money making machine, spawns expansions every couple of months. Avoid at all costs!!!

I'm not disappointed with this trade. The game is simple and flashy enough to attract players and I like to paint mini's. I managed to paint the heavy cav and some of the mid infantry. I burned out after that.

Maybe soon I will begin painting again.

I love this game, and I love the mechanics, a little bit random but with carefull play it's ok. Every battle I had was dramatic, and sometimes suprising. 

Artwork is beautifull. Ton of components, in a base game is 200+ miniatures, high production value.

RATING: 3
Annoying game. Played 2 games at my old classmate's house the other day. Couldn't draw a card to move any units on the left side and watched all my men get hammered. Then my opponent drew these ridiculously overpowered cards and wiped out the units in the middle. We might as well flip coins or play roulette.

RATING: 9
Played the second scenario. Enjoyed it.

Enjoyed it so much I got myself a copy as a b-day gift. I have run through the first four on my own to get a better feel for the game, and I'm liking it more all the time.

Got to play the 5th scenario to learn about how Lore works. It seems that limiting both sides to only 2 cards in hand from the same deck means that there's a heavy luck factor in getting the right cards at the right time.

Disclaimer: I only played the 'battle' part, with no 'lore' rules used, so I am likely to revise my rating if/when I play with the full rules and all creatures. Still, I expect it will keep the flaw of limiting your actions to the few cards you draw, an annoying game mechanic shared by many otherwise ine games. Sorry, I can't use the word "fine" because I didn't draw an "f". Even with that problem, it's a pretty good game, and I'd like to play it again.

Very boring. Not enough variety, not enough history and not enough fantasy. The game couldn't decide what it wanted to be, so it just settled with mediocre. The nice pieces are the only saving grace it has.

I love this game, but find it difficult to find people willing to learn it and play it since my brother (who used to be my main gaming partner for heavier fare) stopped playing board games.

RATING: 7
Such a tough one to rate. On the one hand, love the basic mechanics of all the C&C series - I'm always up for a game. But it could be so much better. It should have been the ultimate fantasy boardgame really. I want more heroes and  creatures and I'd have much preferred my wizards and warriors out on the battleground rather than throwing fireballs from off the board. Lacks personality and is schizophrenic. Is it a fantasy game or a medieval 100 YW game? But I still love playing it. In the end, severe lack of play and C&C:A killed it for me, so I traded it away.

RATING: 7.5
A very good game. The War Council is unnecessary… removed from the 2nd Edition of the game. I would have preferred if the game had been written for arbitrary figures. There is a lot of dependency on the fiddly bits. The 2nd edition of the game is better for rules, but I like the figures for this version better.

RATING: 10
I've played this over 10 times.  There are some clear differences from Memoir.  The core game isn't any more complicated for medieval adventures (without lore and war council).  With lore and the war council the game really shines, with more choices and endless replayability for scenarios.  The rulebook is excellent, with great examples.  Bring on the expansions!

Compared to the other C&C games, I'm not sure if the Lore rules adds as much fun to the game as to compensate for the extra layer of complexity/chaos it adds to the system. Also, I miss the historical scenarios & historical introductions. Nevertheless, it's fun battling it out with monstruous creatures, armies special powers, and all that in a fantasy setting. Also, I rate it a little lower because the boxed game only comes with 10 scenarios.

 Unfortunately, I've only gotten in a couple of plays of this game. It's a bunch of fun. 
 The only real issue that I have with it is the lengthy setup/takedown times. Finding the right minis, etc can be a bit cumbersome at first. It's not enough of a deterrent for me to want to play the game though.

RATING: 9
Played with all expansions except Hundred Years and Call to Arms. Each brings something new and interesting to the mix.

We typically play 2 games per session, once as each side, although sometimes one of us will request "one more chance" and sneak in a 3rd game. Even the same scenarios never play out the same way twice, which keeps it interesting.

RATING: 9
A lot of fun, but I don't like the Command Card aspect much.  I thought maybe it prevented the opponent from being able to automatically strike back right away on his next turn after being attacked, however I don't like the right, left, center thing.  The Lore Aspect is fun, make no mistake about it.  I really want to get BattleLore:Battles of Westeros.  I heard it's undoubtedly better, probably not by much, but who knows.

I love this game: it fulfils my desire for miniatures gaming and wargaming in one go, and with excellent components and a short playing time. What more can I ask for?  It works well as a medieval battle game, and the fantasy aspects just add to that.  Sure, there is some luck involved, but the spread of cards seem much better than in Memoir 44 (which I didn't like).  I rate this game so highly that I will be selling all of my (still mostly unpainted) miniatures. Why would I want to spend months painting figures and building battlefields in order to play a miniatures game that lasts all afternoon when I can just set up Battlelore and play 3 games in 3 hours?  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
(1/15/08) - Just got this today. I look forward to a nice evolution in the C&C System.

(1/21/08) - I decided to paint all of the miniatures in the game. A significant undertaking, but it will make the game look 10x better!

(7/19/08) - [7.5] - With 3 plays of the basic game under my belt I am ready to give BattleLore a rating. At this point BattleLore is my least favorite of the Command & Colors series, but that's like saying its my least favorite thing that I love to play. At times it feels like a watered-down version of C&C: Ancients, with the occasional battleback and what not. Further plays (especially with the Lore system) could result in a higher rating.

SOLD (04/29/2017) - Battlelore has been sold. It just never got to the table very much. Unfortunately my custom paint job for the miniatures made them quite sticky to handle, which did not provide much incentive to play.

Enhanced Memoir 44 game. I think it does most of the same concepts but a bit better. The lore is a big component of the game, but can sometimes sway the game too much.

It is still a solid Borg game which I enjoy when we play.

This rating may decline with time, but I really like it right now, much more than I liked Memoir '44.  I love the importance of configurations, the battleback, bold, etc.  And we haven't even introduced lore yet.  I'm in no hurry given how much fun we're having.

Edit 7/07: We've just started using lore.  In some ways I like the game better without lore.  I'm very interested in picking up C&C:A - I think it will be my favorite of this series when I do.

Even a decade after its release I still have a lot of admiration for this game. The bold attempt to make a 1-box board game that covers all medieval battles plus fantasy elements and do it without a complex rule set. Hundreds of scenarios are available online which offers great replay options. This still the most family-friendly war game I've ever encountered and deserves respect for that alone. Offers a history lesson with some fun fantasy thrown in. We used the Battles of Westeros figures to add Elvish and Viking factions which add some welcome variety to the armies as well.

It's Commands & Colors so it is fun. It's better than the earliest implementations of the system, and has a great theme. This version is extremely fiddly, though, and has too much meta-game bloat to keep track of. The magic powers seem like random hand-of-god type of effects, where the off board players are shooting into the fray without being at risk. I much prefer the C&C: Ancients' leaders where they are directly involved and can be eliminated from the game.

Things I liked about BattleLore - The ranged combat seen in Mem '44 has been curtailed resulting in more melee (adjacent) combat.  In addition, a taste of the the complexity of units from C&C:Ancients has been carried into this system.  System can be used to simulate historical battles or (via the addition of lore) fantasy battles with creatures and special squads (dwarves / goblins).  Works well to force strategic use of line combat and keeping units together for good effect. 

But in the end still a fantasy game with fantastic units.  Would much rather play C&C:A which isn't all that much more difficult to play and doesn't have the magic which can be a bit too powerful.  Prefer the historic battles, but the product line seems more focused on the fantasy/magic.  Traded my copy away to focus instead of C&C:A and its expansions instead.

BattleLore was enjoyable, which does not sound like a raving praise for the game, But for me who does not get into war games this is a fairly high praise. In Battleore you play as dueling armies that have differing abilities in battle. It has a fairly unique battle system.  The Game does not have a lot of depth but the components and artwork in the game is beautiful, which makes the game that much more enjoyable.

Pros: Fun Battle mechanisms,  Beautiful game production, excellent miniatures. Fairly fast game play for the 

Cons: Direct confrontation... not usually a fan. Rules can be a little clunky

This is a very good game.  Any war/battle game that my wife likes has to be good.  The game has lots of depth with both the battle system (CC) and the lore system.  It also manages to combine the minis aspect in the game without losing any of the battle aspects.  I also enjoy the fantasy environment and creatures.  Always played with the expansions.  We usually play two games, each playing as both sides with the winner being the player who got the most total flags.  If tied, the winner is the player who killed the most total figures.

--Jun2007-- Definitely more appealing on a first play that I might have expected.  We played the simplest lore setting, presuming a level 1 wizard.  I found myself wondering if I could dub one of my red-flag units the Bridgeburners, and float Moon's Spawn into view.  Yet for all that, I still don't want to own it.
--Jan2009-- Still happy to play; still unlikely to pick up a copy.

I always wanted to pick up a game from the command and colors realm, but never did with Memoir or C&C: Ancients...  Im glad I waited for BattleLore.  I am a fan of Games Workshop's Fantasy Battles, and while this title is much lighter in fare, it suits me perfectly now.  I think I'm most impressed with the flexibility and possible future of this game...  can't wait to get the expansions.

A very good game. I like the WWII theme (Memoir 44) better but this has interesting additions to the rules (variable unit characteristics within unit type, battle back, etc). BL is also more about melee combat than ranged. I've played Warhammer Fantasy Battle in the past so some things feel as simplified versions of the WH system. Still this needs to be treated as entirely different game and not just a lesser version of WH.

I may have to re-calibrate this; I inadvertently played this before Memoir '44 (which I own, but have yet to break out...I know--shame!).  We played several rounds of this at Origins 2007 and liked it quite a bit.  Very enjoyable...though I _hate_ D6 to resolve combat!!

Gran juego de miniaturas, representando batallas mediavales. Con un sistema muy fácil de aprender y jugar, y unos componentes más que sobresalientes, añade un punto de fantasía que mejora el juego si cabe.

After I bought Battles of Westeros and this game became (even) harder to find, I bit the bullet and bought the copy that had been staring at me from my FLGS's shelves.
I haven't played this nearly enough, but I'm glad I own it.
Components are beautiful! With a different miniature for each unit type and cups to store your lore tokens, this game might even be called 'overproduced'. 
The tutorial-like buildup of the scenario's included in this box make it necessary to buy at least the 'Call to Arms'expansion, so you can play with randomly deployed forces and the full ruleset that the scenario build-up took so much effort to teach you.

Currently going through the 'tutorial-scenario's' with Moonhawk (using his copy), 9 down - 1 to go. After that, we plan on playing his copy of the Scottish Wars expansion. We've dipped our toe in a Call to Arms game as well.

[b][u]Painted the miniatures?:[/u][/b] No and I probably won't, as it would be a very monumental task, including the expansions... [b]EDIT:[/b] I got a cheap second copy, just to paint up. I'm making progress on painting.

Much more lighter version of Tide of Iron set in fantasy world. Hmm... Even to simple for me. I don't have so many choices, but after a play I read some rules and saw that we played without moralles, and that changes everything, because you can't Battle Back. Still nice game, fast to play, light... and wargame ;)

First I give it a "3", because I thought, it was nothing but a fantasy "Memoir Battle Cry", but now, 3 years later, I still play it from time to time and think, it deserves a higher note. So I give it now a "7".

Based on one play, no lore cards.  Since this is basically C&CA fantasy and I rate that game an 8, this gets an 8 as well.  Will have to play with Lore to see if it changes my opinion of the game.

I still haven't played this game with all the rules, but I have enjoyed what I've seen quite a bit. It is definitely luck-heavy, which may turn off some people. However, I believe this is balanced by a short playing time. Feel you got robbed by the dice? Quit your whining, reset the board, and roll better next time.

I only played once, but my impression was a game that was too full of stuff for the simple Command and Colors system. If someone wanted that kind of complexity, Ancients is probably the better choice. If you want something to play with your kids, just go with Memoir '44 and be done with it.

RATING: 4.5
A game I've not yet been able to master (and now because I got rid of it, I never will). 

I understand the basics of the strategy (I think) but seem to always be bested in spite of anything I try. 

Possibly becuase of this the game always leaves me cold -it lacks the draw of lots of other light-warlike games.

The mechanics are interesting - but I'd claim that, like most 'minis' games by board games the minis are completely irrelevant and the same game could be made with just counters and cards (Command and Colours...?). More so here, perhaps, as the game doesn't feel like a minis game and lacks much of the tactical positioning/line of sight/terrain features I'd assocate with Mini Games. 

I get what the game is trying to give you, but too often it seems like it's pure chance whether me or my opponent gets the opportunity to execute their plan...

The minis are of reasonable quality, but often bent and even hot/cold-water treatment has a hard time fixing them.  

Addendum: I tried, and really enjoyed command and colours, so I really don't know what the problem here was...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An ok game. Only played the initial scenario so it's difficult to get a full impression of the game. What I really object to is this seems to be an attempt by DOW to create a GW like cash cow. So I suspect you won't get the designed experience until you've shelled out for the expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I really like this system. It's easy to understand and the unit design is well thought out. Sure, the card based aspect can be frustrating if you draw poorly, but the dice are just as random, and it plays short for a wargame.

This is a great euro-style war game.  Players face off across a map with 3 sections: Left, Center, Right.  Each player gets a number of Command Cards (determined by the scenario).  On their turn they play a Command Card and then activate the troops noted on the card.  This means that you are constantly revising your tactics as you may not have the cards to command the section of the board you want (i.e. you are set for a killing blow on the Right section but none of your Command Cards activate the Right section).  There is great depth of strategy and plenty of replay value.

I though that I didn't like wargames, but this probably proves me wrong, even when I have only played Medieval battles.  Perhaps, as most of wargamers say, this isn't a real wargame, due of its simplicity and lack of reality.  I understand that players may feel frustrated about the card system:  Somebody could have managed to get a war machine ready to crush over his/her rival, and the card he/she needs doesn't show up.  Is that realistic?  Well, I believe yes.  Or is it more realistic in a battle field that only two or three units fight meanwhile everybody else watches to each other.  The card mechanic allows to put in play all of the sectors in the map.  This is a great game with an intuitive flow of play that, despite the 80 pages of manual, goes on its way very smooth.  Besides, the great replayability, thanks to lots of scenarios, and the excelent editorial work (odor of the inside of the box apart) makes this game one of the best around.  A nice addition to the series, which has titles as [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/551]Battle Cry[/url][/i], [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10630]Memoir '44[/url][/i], [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/14105]Command and Colors:  Ancients[/url][/i] and [i]Command and Colors:  Napoleonics[/i].

After getting sweep up in the circus that was Battlelore marketing I have to say the game is as good as all the hype suggested.  The game shows great promise and plays really fast.  Except for having to fix many bent figures the components are fantastic.  The main negative I have is the long setup and takedown time.  We don't tend to play it much just because of how long it takes to setup.

Wonderful components, but the C&C system has lost some interest for me.  The lore junk is just extra chrome and not fun.

I like the variable unit types compared to Memoir '44. It's too bad that the end game often devolves into picking off the last one or two weak units instead of trying to capture an objective like many Memoir '44 scenarios.

i liked battle cry a lot. M44 a bit less. i always thought the mechanism fits much better to ancient combat than modern. unfortunately with the lore cards the game got a bit too uncontrolable for my taste. C&C:Ancients the best in the series by far, followed by battle cry

RATING: 7
This is just about as complicated as I want a wargame to be. It takes a bit too long to set up, so it doesn't get played as often as I would like.

I was down on the whole idea of BattleLore when I first heard about it.  Two things changed my mind: 1) They changed the sell-mode to standard expansion lines; 2) I played C&C:A and saw the effect of support rules, etc. on how the game would play.  Now I've actually played it, both with and without lore, and though I'm not convinced that lore doesn't end up overwhelming the rest of the game, I /am/ convinced that BattleLore is as different from the other C&C games as any of them are.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to everyone, but if you can handle having multiple C&C titles on your shelf, this one is as worthy as any.  I admit to being particularly excited about some of the expansion possibilities, especially the "design your own scenario" options in Call to Arms.  I could easily see my rating going up from that alone.

Have played only maybe half dozen scenarios but this was great fun.  The only reason it's not on my wishlist is because I still haven't gone through all my Memoir scenarios and I don't seem to get the opportunity to bring MM44 out much anymore either, so this would regrettingly also probably gather far too much dust than what it deserves.

Obviously they're similar, but I'd go with BL if I had the choice - the theme really works well,  greatly appeals to me and a couple of rules tweaks add a whole lot to the game.

Hell, I may just go and buy it anyway in the hope that maybe one day I'll play it with my firstborn :)

RATING: 7
2-player war game that's as simple or complex as how you want it. There is some luck, but good tactics can overcome it most of the time.

Very fun to play, as I really love the theme and some of the quasi-historical scenarios. Fantasy + Medieval = awesome. Lore cards are fun and add some welcome chaos to a game that could become repetitive after a few turns. Like the strategic element the formations bring, and the quality of bits is just awesome.

Biggest weakness of the game (and also Memoir '44) is that the ending can feel very anti-climactic sometimes, especially if it's unexpected due to lucky dice rolls.

3+4

Other than the time it takes to set up, Battlelore is the perfect diversion for an ex-WH player like myself who can't spend ALL his money on figs and time on painting (especially since I hate painting).

While I'm not particularly fond of the Lore system as it stands, I enjoy the game overall.  I've played it with my 7-year old son, my friend's 12-year old son, my nephew when he was 12-years old as well as seasoned gamers / wargamers. The simple and intuitive yet excellent C&C system makes it a joy to teach to younger players while still being strategic and tactical enough for vets.

I stopped buying expansions a while back, but may have to start up again as my son is very interested in the game as a whole and his 4-year old brother will be soon!

As advertised, this is another iteration of the command and colors system, this time applied to medieval/fantasy warfare.  The fantasy and collectible aspects of the game don't really do anything for me.  However, as a medieval version of this versatile system, I find it a more than pleasant addition to the series.  In fact, were it a little less expensive, I would probably pick it up solely for the medieval theming.  Still, the system works well, and I've enjoyed playing it.  I would certainly be willing to play it again.  [10/18/2007]

This game is way out of my price range right now but have been playing  PBEM over VASSAL. Lots of fun.

Own all the C&C game (Battle Cry, M'44 and Ancients) so this one is a no brainer buy. Pre-ordered.

Update: another able variation of the C&C system. This one is inbetween M'44 and Ancients in terms of complexity. The minis are nice eye candy and the lore cards adds an extra level of tension. Everything about it isn't new (there's support, battle back if supported and more). There are some nice touches (units are now ordered by colour and by either foot or mounted). 

I would prefer a reference sheet instead of cards but other than that, the game is a-ok!

RATING: 6.5
Initially picked up as a painting project, and because its 15mm figures look nice as giants/monsters next to my fledgling mass of 6mm and 10mm armies. 

It's a fine game in its own right; See my thoughts on C&C:A. Battlelore's goofy-fun aesthetics are a nice match with the lite C&C mechanic. Plus, i'm a huge sucker for miniatures, particularly games w/ masses of them. The caricature-ish sculpts and creature expansions go great with the theme. 

I am, unfortunately, unconvinced of the actual "lore" part of the game. While it adds a bit of flavor and goofy fun, its implementation feels a bit too abstract, too random, a bit too tacked-on; It detracts from the core C&C mechanic. It's like two diametrically opposed gaming goals: Managing the randomness of the C&C hand draw (which is awesome, yay) combined with the luck of a game-changing lore card (not so awesome if, like me, you enjoy C&C for its hand-management.)

Some notes: 

I'll admit, the lore part is fun if you're in goofy-fun mode -- which brings up the 2nd Edition, which I am passing on for now. The 2E's art direction, while awesome in its own right, does nothing for me C&C-wise. It seems 2E, with its darker aesthetic and 28mm figs, is shooting directly at the Warhammer player base. And I think it's a mistake to use the C&C mechanic for it. 

Seriously, though, if FFG were really going for "Warhammer-lite" they already have a great starting place at Battles of Westeros.     

Speaking of BoW, I was curious to see if the liteness of Battlelore would make for a more-enjoyable playing experience than the engrossing, though more fiddly, BoW. It does not. The more miniatures and "miniatures-like" boardgames I come across, the more I'm convinced BoW, though far from perfect, is the best miniatures-like boardgame out there.

Accessible medieval and/or fantasy wargame. Lots of great miniatures, plays relatively quickly, cool system for emulating Command/Control/Communication (C3) issues.  Lore introduces powerful, diverse abilities in a simple, balanced system.

RATING: 6
A good game, surely, only I should have chosen a different title from the C&C series... commanding dwarves and goblins is not exactly my favorite theme. I failed to find the 100 years war expansion to bring it closer to my taste so I sold it. The lore adds an interesting dimension to the gameplay that is missing from the other C&C games as far as I know, the production quality is superb and the game looks really beautiful. Most probably I will get another C&C title, anything else would do as thematically they all fit my taste just fine.

RATING: 9
Firstly I think Battlelore is somewhere in the middle between a boardgame and a light tabletop wargame. Therefore I can live with the admittetly long time it takes to setup. BL is very good despite the slightly annoying hype it got in the beginning. Nothing really original or revolutionary but a very polished product that is fun and exiting to play. I have no problem about buying expansions as it is usual with tabletop miniature wargames (which I feel Battlelore is).

I like that the game plays quickly and the setup is still way shorter compared to WHFB for example. I slightly dislike that luck is really a major factor. The underpowered archers and lack of protection from armour is a bit dumb.

I'm normally a big fan of tactical wargames.  This one was mediocre.  I find the inability to command more than a few units at a time to be irritating, and the randomness of which units those may be completely infuriating.  Just wholesale lackluster in my opinion, not to mention wildly unrealistic for a battle simulation.

UPD: It's definitely great game, but setup and cleanup time with all the minis and terrains is comparable to play time. Usually, it's just not worth the effort. 9->7

RATING: 7
I like the gameplay, but I'm a big fan of C&C:A, so that's no surprise.

The unit strengths are somewhat different between the two games - enough so that one's tactical decisions especially must be altered from what they would be in C&C:A. The production value of the game is excellent, and I really like the art work and the development of scenarios - gradually introducing new wrinkles as you go.

I do *not* like the little plastic men. They're unpainted and hence unattractive to look at - I guess I prefer the wooden block aesthetic. And no, I do not have the time to paint them. I'd rather spend that time actually playing games! Well, I probably will spray paint them, both for looks and because of a color problem. I cannot understand why game publishers continue to make life miserable for those of us who have color vision impairments. I cannot tell the difference between the red banners and the green banners in this game, and am forced to tell which is which by memory in scenarios where the ambiguity arises. I figure spray painting the figures in different shades of red/green will allow me to tell the difference at a glance.

I also find the separate information cards irritating, and would prefer a single sheet which summarizes the different kinds of units and terrain. Throughout, Days of Wonder opted for flash instead of practicality when it came to the materials in this game. Take the dice: why couldn't they have used different symbols for light, medium, and heavy units? Would that have been so difficult? As it is, I have to have my opponent tell me whether the symbols I rolled are red or green. Grrrr! Also, on the summary card, mounted units are called "Long Sword" units. Elsewhere, they are called "Mounted". A little consistency would have been nice. All these little details, despite the lavish production, are really irritating as they create confusions which hamper actually *playing* the game. If someone were to express interest in the Commands and Colors system, I would not hesitate to recommend that they pick up Ancients instead of BattleLore if only for the reason that the production of Ancients is streamlined in a way that makes it easy to learn and play the game. Usefulness trumps glitz.

Other than that, it's a good game. Familiarity with Ancients allowed me to get over the irritations here, but in the end I prefer Ancients. BattleLore emphasizes chance over skill as compared to Ancients, and I don't care for this. Confronted with both games, I will always choose to play Ancients.

RATING: 8
A fun battle game.  Despite the luck element, there is a lot of decisions to make which can determine the difference between a skilled and unskilled player.  The scanrios are a bit bland for me - I'm not big into historical stuff, but the system definitely allows for people to create their own fun scenarios, and even within certain scenarios, setting up the war council can make things interesting.

It seems that the fourth time is the charm when it comes to the Comand and Colors series.  This version took everything that worked from the other three games and scrapped the rest.  Everything is simplified without stripping out the game.  

I love battle games heavy on dynamism that give a reason to attack.  This game has that in spades.  Over the years I've played lots of little wargames at this scale and since playing this every one of them has made me wonder why I'm just not playing BattleLore. 

Everything works as it should.

Memoir '44 has been my favorite game since I bought it and I like this game just as much if not more because of the Lore system and Call to Arms adds a lot of replay value to the already impressive number of scenarios available to this game. It's very easy to teach to new players and I know some people have a hard time with all the luck involved but I still feel like your decisions play a much larger roll in the outcome of a match than just the luck of the cards and dice.  It's a quick, beautiful, satisfying wargame for people who don't want to spend 4 hours reading a rulebook before playing a game and then 8 hours actually playing it.

A great 2 player card driven wargame.  I'd been wanting to try Commands and Colors, and just got my hands on this first.  I love the system, like the theme, and enjoy the play.  Can't go wrong with a ton of minis.  Oh...but goblins suck!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
What's there to say that hasn't already been said? A fantastic 2-player game using the Command and Colors system. Note that I had already played Memoir '44 before tackling Battlelore, so the rules were ultra-easy to pick up. My biggest complaint is the same as the WWII game... you can have a fantastic setup and great tactics, but if you draw crap cards and roll like crap, it doesn't matter. Unit and scenario balance is great. I like the dual use of this game too: I can play in a fantasy or a medieval motif. Very clever.

I have reservations about the somewhat gamey, arbitrary victory conditions, but otherwise this is a solid, satisfying system. Set-up can take some time, but really - if you're pulling out a game like BattleLore, you've probably committed the afternoon to it already anyway.

Edit: That immense setup time is preventing this from getting to the table at all lately. Demoted.

Okay - first thing I want to say is that this game is really a luck fest. You may think that all the luck can be ameliorated because of the amount of dice rolls there is in a game, and with tactics and strategy, ...but come on! Luck to the rolls, luck to the draw of the cards, etc. Im just sayin...

But! Having said that, and now saying I generally don't like high luck factor in games, I will say this:

I love it!!! 

Really, it is so much fun!! Just pure fun! Love the magic system, and the bits, and the beautiful colors, and the terrain, and the creatures, blah blah. I mean, if you go in knowing that there is a high degree of luck, and then just let go and start your maneuvering and planning and attacking and defending, and being bold and archering, etc, you will find there are tons of decisions and tactical concerns and delicious moments of high tension each game. Highly recommended.

I enjoy this game quite a bit and I'm sorry it doesn't get out to the table more often.  This is a light 2 player combat/war-like game with minitures.  The game is dice and card driven with a great theme that makes it enjoyable to play.  Components are fantastic, there are expansions and creatures and the cards and dice even look good.  My only negative would be that it takes some time to set up.  This is a fun game that you can add magical attacks or go with strick calvery and foot soldiers.  I like it! Go get it!

Simple but elegant mechanics that make play move quickly.  Definitely enjoyable to play.  My only complaint, and this isn't necessarily a bad thing for everyone, is the diciness-- combat is very swingy with only a few dice being rolled at a time, and battlebacks possibly causing your swarming attack to be devastated.  Your choices are also constricted by what command cards you draw (arrrgh, all my cards activate my empty left flank!) and what lore cards you have.  Obviously, working around these limitations and hedging your bets is a huge part of the strategy, but it may turn off gamers who are looking for more skill-oriented games.

I've played the first five scenarios from both sides. We've just been introduced to Lore in the last scenario we played and it's great. It changes the dynamics quite a bit. I can't wait to form my own war council and diversify in Lore powers!
The next scenario introduces the giant spider and the special races combined with Lore. I can't wait to play again.
Battles of Westeros is the better medieval tactical wargame, but I still want to play some more fantasy scenario's though, especially the Dragons, Creatures and Heroes expansions!

This fairly technical game that is an exact build off its predecessor Memior '44, is hard to learn but fun to play. Try to plan on playing it a couple times once you have it out it takes a while to set up and plays rather quickly. Much like Heroscape this game is a good mix between strategy and luck. One major aesthetic drawback is the pieces come in cold hard gray plastic. I traditionally thought painting game pieces was nerdy but with the beautiful pieces that come in Heroscape competing, I got some cheap acrylics and with a little amatuer work made some rather pleasing play pieces. A fun, many exansion-able game.

Grognards may not think of this of a wargame, but for your average Eurogamer, such as me, it certainly is one. Despite its supposed shortcomings, I quite like BattleLore, as it gives me a relatively simple wargame with enough replayability to keep things interesting. It's pretty short with enough to do: selecting your war council, tactical card play, playing lore cards and of course rolling dice. Good stuff, which should keep me occupied for several dozen more games.

I'm totally into the Battle, not so much into the Lore.  My wife and I have played "Battle Cry" for years, but I've only played the base game of "Memoir '44" a couple of times and I've never tried "Commands and Colors: Ancients".  Instead, we leaped right up in the line to "BattleLore".  So my obvious comparison is going to be "Battle Cry".  At first, I was unsure what to think of "BattleLore", since it is ultimately a very similar game to "Battle Cry" (and not just in title!).  My initial impression was that all the newly added elements in the game simply created unnecessary complication and fiddliness, since they ultimately didn't do much to change the luck factor or the same, dull winning conditions of grabbing flags.  And I also felt that all the fantasy elements really ruined what could have been a great, historical game.  But then I realized that the game is entirely customizable, and all I had to do was pick up the "Call to Arms" and the "Hundred Years War" expansions, utilize the "medieval lore" rules, leave out the war council, goblins, dwarves, etc., and I could have a perfectly playable historical game.  I also realized that they have improved a number of other things from the "Battle Cry" days, from the way in which weapons are utilized to the command cards themselves.  And the production value is stunning (as has come to be expected with Days of Wonder)!  Sure, the amount of packaging is sickening (especially with the expansions), the cartoonish artwork is nothing short of grotesque (they could have done SO much better with a little bit of realism or, at the very least, with a more "Mr. Jack" or "Jamaica"-style of cartoon pleasantry), the set-up time is excruciating (even preventing the game from getting to the table at times), and the level of strategy can feel both very limiting and ahistorical at times.  But the attention to detail with everything in the game right down to the rulebook and all those reference cards makes the game exceptionally easy to pick up and play.  (The makers of "War of the Ring" need to talk to whomever it was that created the "BattleLore" rulebook and reference cards).  This is a fantastic game!  I have even traded away my beloved "Battle Cry" now that I own this one.  If only it wasn't such a huge pain to set up!  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8.5/10

RATING: 7
A fun game.  A little simpler than C&C:Ancients, but the lore cards add another layer to the game.  All the bits take a little too long to set/clean up for the length of the game.  I'm always happy to play this one, but given the choice I'd usually pick C&C:A.

Luck plays a part, but waaay smaller than some people think. The key is learning to manage your hand.
Also, if you happen to be a miniature painter, the game looks GORGEOUS.
This one, like all C&C games, is a good introductory wargame.

Expansions: all up to Bearded Brave.

Update 3-2-2014: I will always have a soft spot for BL, but it turns out its successor is the better game, to be honest. I am still undecided on whether let it go, or keep it for old times' sake :)

I like C&C:Ancients very much, so I thought this might get me too. After first plays I say: chaotic with lore, shallow without and not much fun either way. And that's not counting quality issues. I'll stay with the Ancients for now. Maybe with medieval expansions BL will get me again.

Easy to learn and play game.  The combat system is simple and keeps the game moving.  However, combat is 'dicey' and also depends on the card draw.  Game length is short and the game allows for only two players.  The components are of excellent quality.  Would like to have more plays.

Great variation on the C&C system. Complexity : slightly above Memoir'44, but lower than C&C:Ancients. Lore cards add a lot of fun! Played two games on Days of Wonder booth at Essen Spiel (oct. 2006). IMO, the most interesting part is the Expert mode: each player customizes his War Council at the start, according to feelings about the scenario. This mode enables a very good replay value of the same scenario. The Epic Mode rules were not ready at Essen (two boards for a big set-up battle). We discussed with Richard Borg, and it seems they are far away in the development of the game possibilities... Fascinating! We have to wait to discover these possibilities (two major expansions planned in 2007).

Got a chance to play this at a buddy's house the other night. I am a fan of the C&C series, but not enough so that I feel the need to own more than one version of it. I updated from Battle Cry to Memoir '44 moreso because I preferred the setting rather than any update/improvement of the rules. For the same reason, I will *not* update to BattleLore. I don't care as much for the fantasy setting as I do the WWII setting. The Lore system, while an interesting and fun element to the game, is not enough to inspire me to invest the time and money into the game. Hell, I haven't even used my Memoir '44 expansions and I've owned them for a year. The movement/attack rules for the units were not as clean as in M44; I was constantly referring to the cards. Also, I was also not thrilled that the units for both players were the same color. At least twice during the game I attempted to attack my own units. If time and money were no object, I'd have BattleLore on my shelf. Alas...

Just played another scenario last night, this time with Lore, and I just love this game. It is the very best of the C&C system by far. Lore adds so much to simple battles without breaking the game to the point of unplayability. Fabulous system, can't wait for Call to Arms. I must find a way to get this to table more often. I;m going to start reading storage threads on this one, there must be a storage solution that speeds up setup. Bought 4 "craft" boxes for 2 bucks each at Walmart, they work perfect hold all the units at one unit per slot. Makes setup a breeze. Now I just need to figure out a way to afford a second copy of he base game. My copy of Call to Arms should arrive any day now! Can't wait to try the deployment system.

Card-driven fantasy war game. Very simple mechanic to understand, which also manages to provide a great deal of strategy and depth. The dice rolled for battle outcomes ensure that there is plenty of randomness (as well as the command cards) but that only serves to enhance the gameplay and does not detract from it. Very high production values and one of the best rulebooks ever made (well illustrated and with plenty of examples without over-complicating things). One of the best games of its type.

The game system is controversial, but having said that - I recommend this game as the best of those using Richard Borg's card driven game engine.  If you liked Memoir '44 and don't mind medieval/fantasy mileu's then you will LOVE this game. 

Update - Another game that hasn't aged well.  FFG is letting the game die on the vine, and I don't see it surviving much longer.  

Commands and Colors has picked up the Richard Borg system and run with it and has probably done the best job of playing to its strengths.  I am particularly enjoying Commands and Colors: Napoleonics and would recommend it or Ancients before buying Battlelore

RATING: 5
Main disadventage for me is that miniatures are not painted. It takes much charm from the game. Maybe one day i will find someone to paint the miniatures for me and I will expirience more fun from the game. Another disadventage is that the game is a bit too serious. 2 player games should be more about fun and relax then war and conflict. I do not mind heavy logic, mathematics or economics in the games but killing foes on the battlefield is not my type of the game.

Lots of stuff in base game and expansions give you a lot to keep you busy.  The mission progression introduces you to more elements as you play so you can also use it as an entry level combat game or for advanced players.  Somewhat limited strategically as your choices are based on the cards you pick, but overall a good buy.

I'm not so much a tactical thinker so the playing field isn't very even. I lowered the rating because the last few times I played it, not only did I draw terrible cards but my dice rolls kept missing. I got a little sour on the game. Still a great game though for men to bring their wives a bit more into the direct "war-ish" games. I don't like war themes, so the fantasy appealed to me a lot more than if we were to play M44. I think its best playing with lore :)

RATING: 9
Great tactical game, very nice components, drips in theme.

If you like small scale skirmishers but prefer to keep set-up time to a minimum, like fantasy and like to customize your army by design rules, not by buying (more) expensive miniatures, this is a brilliant game.

Will do a full review on this after I have several games under my belt. This one deserves it.

I don't understand why this game is consistently considered the "best" of Richard Borg's "Command and Colors" line of games. I like this game, but I don't think the added complexity (specifically the Lore cards) add any tactical depth. When it comes down to it, these games are largely luck-driven -- one can try to "strategerize" for about three turns, given the cards in one's hand. Adding more cards just gives you more to consider, but in my opinion, doesn't really change the gameplay in any meaningful way. In fact, in my opinion, it detracts from the game. 

I certainly appreciate the excellent production value, but gameplay is more important to me.

Strangely I find myself a bit underwhelmed. I really like M44 but the extra complexity of BL spoils it for me a bit. Production values are great but it lacks the simplicity of M44 that makes the system a hit with me. (8/8/10)

Adds some great mechanics to the already superb commands & colors system. I love the mixture of different races, the focus on close combat, the need for formtions and the variety of magic available.

I just can't get used to this card system, maybe if someone would give a scenario where the general really needed to move the troops on his right flank but just couldn't. Is it a game mechanic that simulates communication disabilities or is it just fun!?

Except for that, I really like how they give out so much stuff for this game. The bits are really nice  :)

Thus far, I've only played scenarios 2 & 3 which don't have any magic and only just had the appearance of 'Goblinoids'. Without the magic and fantasy bolt-ons, this is a very good Memoir adaptation, adding tactical depth and a more interesting theme (the 100 years war) at the expense of cost (no doubt) and not much else. The tactics in the 2 scenarios both seemed to reward aggressive play which bodes pretty well over something like C&C(r):Napoleonics which seemed to favour holding defensive positions, making this play much faster and freer.

Rating could well plummet with the additional scenarios.

I've been procastinating about commenting on this game for months now, mainly because I've been telling myself that I've not had enough plays of it. But recently, I'd realised that the reason why I'm not getting the plays is because I feel that there are so much better C&C games out there apart from BattleLore. Yes, the fantasy theme is right up my alley and the cards and bits are great, but frankly, it feels as if they re-organised all the card effects of Memoir 44 and spread them out into "new" mechanics like Lore cards. 

This was definately a hype-buy for me. I'm just keeping it solely because it's from DoW and I have immense respect for their games.

This... is... AWESOME!  First and for most I want to say how impressed I am with this title, DOW really is in my opinion one of the best game companies of all time.  Everything about Battlelore is over produced, gorgeous and delightful.  I find myself longing for the expansion releases and can’t wait until they release more armies (undead in particular if they ever do).  The game itself holds great variety without the addon components of the future and can only leave you excited by the new possibilities.  In my opinion the entirety of battlelore and its potential makes it a FAR superior game to say Warhammer Fantasy.  The 70 dollar price tag for 2 armies, a board, beautiful components and minis, its unbelievable compared to anyone who has tried to play a Games workshop game.  I’m impressed by DOW that much is clear.  

While it does take a little time to set up (More then Memoir’ 44) it’s completely worth it.  That being said I have played only the first three scenarios so far.  The idea that these scenarios range from historical medieval to fantasy is wonderful and just shows that the game is meant to be completely versatile.   The first two were heavy dice related without to much strategy (basically pure Memoir’ 44 style games) the third however was far more interesting.  The third scenario brings Moral rules to the table and introduces the goblinoids (with an interesting skirmish dynamic all their own).  Needless to say after this battle I was SOLD on Battlelore.  I cannot WAIT to play Scenario 5 which introduces lore to the game and sounds incredibly unique.  

The Lore rules create an interesting dynamic pertaining to your physical combat misses translates into powerful spells.  I adore the concept and it seems to elevate the entire systems random elements.  Lore definitely seems to give more decisions to the game and creates a brilliant dynamic I cannot WAIT to try (you can tell by the rules alone.)  The monstrous creatures excite me as well, I really cannot wait to see what else they come out with.  That being said the 80 page rulebook is solidly written and is detailed, laid out in a completely perfect way.  The scenarios build and build making you want more, watching the games rules unfold as you play.  The reference card system is welcome as it was in Memoir’ 44 but I find myself wishing they just had one larger card vs a bunch of small ones, however we are lucky they provide these convenient summaries in the first place.  While the production is fantastic I find the packing method to be somewhat unfortunate.  The plastic bubble boxes crush the armies resulting in bent figures (I rather like the soft plastic though, rather bent figures than broken ones).  DOWs website support also suggests great things to come.  They have provided the game with more scenarios and even a creator.  I cannot wait to see how this evolves, I suspect that further plays will result in a 9 from me.

Addendum: Done the book, even better.

Miniatures are superfluous, difficult to identify and fussy to manipulate; would play the same, but setup would be faster and the game cheaper with blocks, by which I mean blocks with 1 step per side, rather than C&C:Ancients wasteful block system.

Randomness is too high in C&C to begin with; Lore takes any strategy in the game and chucks it out the window. Scenarios are unbalanced. "Play it twice, once on each side." is not a balancing mechanism; it's lazy game development.

The fantasy element is superfluous. Dwarves = elite units, goblins = skirmish units. Strict historical would have been preferred, but I suppose it would have appealed less to those who don't grok history.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I enjoy this one a lot, but I've dropped the rating because its just not as good as C&C:Ancients and its far and away harder to setup and play (fiddly). Despite the cool fantasy aspect and the lore, it just misses the mark for me.

**UPDATE: Easily bested by Battles of Westeros. BattleLore 1st ed is maybe 3rd best in the series - maybe 4th...

RATING: 6
For my general opinion on this 'series' of games by Richard Borg, see my comments on "Battle Cry".

This game, together with Memoir '44, strikes me as the best of the bunch.  With inclusion of different characters and the lore subsystem, and its many expansions, this strikes me as potentially the deepest of this 'series'.  It also therefore likely has the greatest replay value, but is also certainly the most time-consuming (never a point in a game's favour, and to my mind, doubly a drawback here, since even with the additional complications, there's just not that much depth).

Update: On reflection, I was probably too hard on these games with my initial ratings, so I've upped them a bit.  Even my initial rating and comments weren't meant to indicate that I didn't like them or wouldn't play them - I do enjoy them, and will happily play them from time to time - but none of them really grab me.

Fun wargame that is easy to learn.  It is a pretty light game and is not a simulation, but solid tactics should still win in the end.  It is also highly replayable.
This and Memoir '44 are the only wargames my wife will play, and of the two, this is the one she prefers.

Good fun. I would have played this incessantly when I was c.14 years old! And even now is very enjoyable. I like the way it scales gradually introducing new elements by scenario. It really takes it's time with this, whereas in other games using a similar concept they can't wait for you to get to the finish, the scenarios in Battlelore really savour each element bit by bit as you try each subsequent scenerio. I like the combat - quick and dirty, and the spell system. All such rapid mechanics mean that the game flows so quickly. Great!

I really want to love BattleLore more, but the long setup time, the lack of any great fantasy elements, and the non-imaginative expansions makes Command & Colors: Ancients and Memoir '44 stronger games in my book. Still, it IS a fine game on its own (the components are gorgeous) and might be worth a spot in your collection if you don't want a straight-up historical card-driven tactics game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun and quite light game. Very random with all the card draws and dice rolls, but in a really fun way. There are some meaningful decisions to make in order to maximize your chances for success. You want to roll many dice to let the mana flow, avoid battle backs, keep your units in support, move your troops to the areas for which you have good cards, use the terrain to your advantage and make good use of your mana. Before the game, you need to balance your ability to use different types of spells versus the power of spells of a certain type and the draws for commands and spells.

Have ... to ... obey! It's the lore. Seriously, this game is what I always wanted in a game, especially the war council is ever so sweet. (We started off with some lore-scenarios right away) Big thumbs up go to an 80-pages rule-book which is structured perfectly, building up on the last lesson, with several examples pictured. But I am angry now: the game is so good it makes me want to have the expansions. What I miss in this game is a feature for more than 2 players and some kind of catch-up-mechanic in case you have really, really, really bad luck throwing the dice.  

One of the issues is being taken care of. Epic Battlelore will be a must-buy for me. 
Edit: Creatures are too weak despite the "critical-hit-rule". They should have 2 life points.

I think that my rating is not as high as others for this game because I have played a handful of games of Memoir '44, and BL is not different enough to be that much better.  I enjoy the Lore system, but it seems to me that many of the Lore cards are redone versions of several cards in Memoir '44 (though they are more powerful).  In the end, I enjoy the more historic and cleaner version of the two, Memoir '44.

BattleLore's fantastic rules, fast gameplay, and subtle tactical decisions make this game a winner. However, I am no fan of the decision to combine the Historial and Fantasy battles together into the same setting. Overall, it's great fun and is one of the few games that I will play multiple times in a row. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A game I truly like, but due to the fickleness of the dice and the random nature of the system this game doesn't hit my table often. 

The game's biggest strength, is also it's biggest flaw: you receive cards, and these determine which orders you can give your armies. This simplifies the game and speeds it up nicely, but it can also cripple your chances of winning. You'll just have to make the best of your cards, and if that means your top infantry stays useless on the left flank because you only have cards to activate your wimpy archers on the right flank, that's too bad. But, your opponent has the same problem. This does prevent analysis paralysis, since you basically have to pick the best choice you have availabloe out of 5 or so options.

Also, a nice catch is the way that some misses in combat give you more 'mana' to play magic spells. This is a smart way to boost players that have rotten luck with the dice.

All in all, a good (and simple) game that can be played relatively quick, but be aware that the randomness of the cards and dice means you better not expect a grand strategy to win, but a healthy dose of luck and sound tactics.

Finally rated this after 3 plays. I haven't gotten in any Lore Scenarios yet, so I'm not familiar with the whole system. However, even without them this is a solid 8. With more plays, it could definitely go up. Unfortunately, it's not really my wife's thing. She'll play it with me (for which I'm eternally grateful!), but she's not exactly a direct conflict kind of gal.

Anyway, the system is very elegant. The command cards you receive are random and the colors (and other stuff) you roll are random, but it's still extremely strategic and tactical. I'm impressed with how Borg is able to incorporate numerous special units, terrains, and effects with only subtle changes to the basic rules.

Lastly, despite the large rulebook (80+ pages IIRC), it is fairly simple system. In fact, they include rule cards (playing card size) which can be dealt out to each player. Basically ALL of the rules are on these cards. And they're not super text-heavy either. For the first scenario, Agincourt, all the necessary rules are on 9 cards. That's a cleaner ruleset that most Euros.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game that has parts that "I love and others that I hate." It has elements that are enjoyable, it has some good themes and is a relatively quick game, but it has many clumsy implementations: such as lore/ war councils/ disorganised unit & weapon cards/etc. 

The game has developed (as evidenced by the expansion sets and new miniatures) over time and has allowed for different playing mechanisms. However these were lumbered by clumsy and sloppy rules. (This is evidenced by the expansion Call to Arms - which was really poorly implemented despite high expectations.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I had high hopes for this game, but it just fell kinda flat for me after a couple of plays.  The tactics of its brother Memoir 44 have been eschewed to make way for brute force.  The scenarios are seriously bland and are overly symmetrical.  I do like the spell system (without it this game would be a total drag) but power level and usefulness of the spells vary too much and overall is too random for my tastes.

No real desire to play this again. Memoir is faster, cleaner, and much easier to set up and take down. And this one has too much real history and not enough fantasy for me.

Exactly the right complexity for a 'move-and-attack' hex-based strategy game.  However, the secret-simultaneous selection of the War Council and the ensuing use of Lore cards is what makes the game really shine.  I greatly enjoy this every time I play.  The fiddly set-up to play-time ratio knocks it down a peg though.

RATING: 3.5
First Impression: 
Fair abstract Tactical combat game with improved mechanics but weaker theme in comparison to Memoir '44. But this isn't a gateway wargame, the theme and poor missions kill what good memoir has.

Second Impression: The mechanics are not intuitive. It seems overlysimplified and too luck dependent.

The Good:  Multiple scenarios, soon to have customization, different lore options(a must).The Bad:  The C&C games need to have less and not more.  The rules/setup needed I'd rather play a different more involved wargame without the C&C controls.  My opnion however, it could be wrong.  Could go up.  I would like to play again, there are just many more 2 player games I'd like the throw down between then and now.

RATING: 5
BattleLore arrives finally and finally I've had a chance to play it.  Seems to be a very nice refinement of the rules and system to date.  There's a lot more going on in this than in say Memoir or Battlecry. That takes away from this being as much of a 'gateway' game and more of a gamers game. I found myself having to make more decsions and they were harder to choose from.  Some of the cards in the command deck from the previous games have migrated over to the 'Lore' deck now so to use them you have spend lore.  Lore system works fine if you ask me and it's really nice to have lore side of the dice earn you lore instead of doing nothing at all like in previous games.  I do think that if you are going to have a system like this however it should have been a little more in depth.  It's good, but not great.

Now to the crux of it for me.  I love this game and will be playing a lot of it.  I'm gonna go ahead and say that I like M'44 better still.  It's faster and easier and I can teach that game to non-gamers and convert them instantly.  Theme wise I enjoy WWII better than fantasy as well, but that's not going to stop me from playing BattleLore, just a statement. The C&C system is brilliant and another excellent product is added here.

UPDATE. My initial thoughts do seem to be on par and for the most part accurate. I have played a LOT of BattleLore as predicted but that also means I've kind of burned myself out on it. I don't think I'll be playing this nearly as much anymore and interestingly enough M'44 still hits the table just about as much as it ever did.

RATING: 5
The third game in the C&C series that I tried (having previously played Memoir '44 and Commands & Colors: Ancients), and the third disappointment.  It's not a bad game, but I fail to see what's so great about this series of games.  I have a few complaints with this series: 1) the setup time is ridiculous, it takes forever to get all the terrain and units in place; 2) the amount of luck is unbelievable and the dice just never go my way... ever; 3) the games are not especially complex but the rules are very fiddly, they're not at all streamlined because there are tons of little things to remember like all the modifiers for the dice; 4) I don't usually care much about theme, but I don't see why you'd bother making games about WWII, ancient warfare, and elves/dwarves if they're not going to change much, so it never actually feels different regardless of what theme is pasted on.  This is not to say that these are the worst games ever, but they're just not especially great.  They're alright and I'd be willing to play again, but won't be actively looking for another game.

An excellent game that combines some of the better aspects of Wargaming with cards.  Beautifully presented with quality miniatures, board, counters, and one of the better Rule Books I've seen.  

They did a wonderful job with the learning curve on this one.  Each scenario adds new units and concepts, until you're up to playing with Lore, monsters, defensive positions, etc.

Setup time is a bit of a bear... you'll probably want to buy some kind of small box to keep the minis straight if you get a copy.

DoW also has an excellent website dedicated to this game, complete with a scenario editor and user created scenarios.

I come from a table top background and my wife isnt into all the rules of table top games.  So we gave this game a try and both love it.  It uses colored dice instead of your standard D6 and movement is done using a deck of cards that you draw and use.  Different colored banners show the different types of troops.  For instance, there are green, blue, and red colored banners in which green is "easy" blue is "medium" and red is "hard/elite" what I mean by that is red color normally gets 4 attacks (4 dice) and green 1-2 attacks (1-2 dice).  How the game is set up is you pick out a scenario in the adventure book that comes with the game.  So your troop types and numbers are already worked out for you.  You do not make a troop list (although you can create your own adventures as well!)  

There is another "advanced" mechanic that allows you to use different cards that give "buff/spells" called lore.  These are used to create more of a fantasy feel to the game.

Why I rate this game a 10:
1.It has a historic play. i.e. recreating famous battles that really happened.
2.It can also have a fantasy play to it as well.  Goblins and Dwarfs come with the game as well as normally men. And the lore mechanic adds to this feel as well.
3.Its a table top game on a game board.  easy to play, easy to TEACH, fast games, like scrabble in that fact that you only have the movement cards in front of you to use.  Like the letters for scrabble.
4.able to paint the models if you WANT to. Which we are.  Also the models are about 15mm. FYI Games Workshop (warhammer fantasy and warhammer 40,000) are about 35mm heroic scale.

a game I just want to love and be obsessed with. but the set up and the mechanics just are not matched by the actual gameplay.

I don't mind the randomness of the dice...that seems standard and are mitigated with interesting card play or good tactics.

I do mind the cards themselves, because here all your decision making is reduced to a few random cards with way too much variability. It is frustrating to not be able to do what you need to do because you lack the proper flank. Also, some cards are so overpowered, and some lore strategies are so overpowered that the luck is even worse.

I still plan on playing it whenever I can manage it, but I won't be drooling over it, or over the expansions and such.

I want to dig in to this, but with Heroscape available it hardly seems necessary.  I understand the play is quite different, but it's just another minis game.  Why do I need to adopt another large rules set?  I've collected every bit of it so far, and maybe one day I'll play enough to raise the rating. (Because it's C&C it really needs to be learned and played as so many other games use the same essential mechanic.) Also see Commands & Colors and Battles of Westeros and Battle Cry - I don't own or play Memoir 44.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I find this to be the most chaotic of the Commands and Colours series.  The lore, though very cool, makes the game very unpredictable.  The miniatures, though nicely sculpted, are all the same colour - meaning the only way one can tell ones troops from ones enemies, is by the banner.  This reduces situational awareness, increasing cognitive load, and making the game less fun.  I'll still play it, but it is my least favourite in the series.  Much as I love the genre.

Loking forward to playing this. Great components! ***UPDATE: Played the game twice, lost both times. Felt that I lost because I couldn't control the flow of events. Started with a lot of cards to set up my troops on the right flank. Then when it was set up I only drew cards for my left flank. I guess I'll learn with time... ***UPDATE: I have played all of the scenarios in the booklet as both sides now. This is a good game, a lot of choices has to be made. Sometimes luck/bad luck is too big a factor. For example during the last scenario in the booklet the Giant spider alone ate through half my army before I inflicted my first casualty at the enemy.***UPDATE: Played epic Battlelore. It rocks! Normal Battlelore gets a 7 but epic gets an strong 8.

I've got a bit bored with Memoir'44 and went for Battlelore. After the very first game BL seems quite promising. We didn't use the Lore rules, but the game felt good.

I don't fancy that much the "lore" part, but otherwise it is a great game from the Command and Colors series with magnificent components which insire you to go deeper into the home rules obsession.

The choices that you make are either obvious or there is hardly any way to esimatete the outcomes. The setup is tedious and moving the little pieces is not so much fun as you'd expect.

Although I did not expect it, I definitely had a lot of fun with this game during my first play. For what is in essence a non-collectible miniature game on a board (I did not play any C&C games before), the rules are quick to explain thanks to some great reference cards, downtime is perfectly acceptable and setup time is bearable. The game has great components. What I especially like is its value for money: The game can be easily adapted to your mood, as you can play anything from a skirmish between generic troops to a full-blown war with creatures, different terrain, characters and magic. Great stuff.
UPDATE: I like the game better and better with more plays and more options. As soon as you have added Lore and the War Council to your games, you will never go back. Not sure about the giant creatures though - they add quite a bit of fiddly rules. Always wanted to play your miniature tabletop games with nongamers? With Battlelore you can! :-). Played 8 times sofar.

A very good game. I can see how this game is hyped. I enjoy the tension of this game of not being able to mobilize all my troops whenever I want. The command cards certainly makes a lot of sense in this system. I definitely enjoy the detailed figures and the layout of this game. Absolutely beautiful and impressive and it certainly heightened the joy of playing this game. I do see that this game can become boring if played repeatedly. New scenarios and characters are needed. I can imagine having heroes on the battlefield. That would be amazingly fun! Thumbs up thus far for this game.

What marvellous components! Everything is top notch: a gorgeous, bound rulebook; beautiful, thick cards; small but nicely detailed miniatures; great artwork throughout. 
Everything is really well designed too. The rulebook is clear with lots of illustrated examples and the scenario book starts with a very basic, simple set up and adds in more complicated rules as you progress through further scenarios.  

I LOVE the idea of the player aid cards, only pulling out those involved in the particular scenario you’re playing. 
I also love the fact that you can tailor the gameplay to suit:  races utilised; use of magic; number and makeup of war council members...... and it's easy to solo especially if you use the medievil lore rules. What an absolutely genius system!

Yes it does take quite a while to set up but I rather enjoy that part and it's mitigated by the fact that that it looks so good, plus the toy factor of course (which is actually a bit of a negative for me, I'd prefer nice thick cardboard chits, perhaps then I wouldn't feel such a plank playing it).

Fun cards and dice tactical combat game. I haven't played any of the other C&C games, so I can't compare to those, but I did keep thinking that each of my units should have unique names. And also that they should gain experience and level up individually with new skills. And instead of only moving just the few that you're allowed, you should be allowed to move as many guys as you want until you screw something up. Also, instead of playing for flags, you should have some sort of object that you're carrying from one end of the field to the other to score points. Yeah, that game would be great.

An excellent medieval edition of the commands & colors system.

A fun, quick paced game, if you don't take it too seriously, since bad die rolls and cards can hose your plans. Setting up can take time, but it's worth it if you play two or more games. Despite the randomness, it's a fun combat game.

The components are gorgeous, the rules are fairly well written, and you get a lot of stuff in the box.

A light, quick, and very fun wargame. I am still working my way through the base adventures and my opinion rises with each added wrinkle. The first two expansions should only improve things.

Epic Battlelore should mitigate the luck element -- a larger board and more armies should give the law of averages more time to work it's magic.

Call to Arms will hopefully improve the aspect of the game the I consider a chore, the setup, by making it more dynamic.

Overall a great system, but two things I don't like about this game: First, I don't like that units that have been reduced down to their last figure still attack at full strength and second, the way the counterattacks work discourages aggressive play.

Fell in love with this when Days of Wonder initially released it.  The marrying of Richard Borg's C&C system with an expandable fantasy setting seemed very promising.  And while the game didn't disappoint, I quickly became bored.  The expansions following the initial release seemed uninspired and boring.

The world of BattleLore meshes history and fantasy together - putting players in command of an array of miniature troops on the battlefields of a Medieval Europe Uchronia at the outset of the Hundred Years War.

Drawing on the strengths of Memoir '44, Days of Wonder's newest game takes the time-tested Command and Colors system to a new level and offers gamers of many backgrounds a chance to fight medieval battles with a dose of epic fantasy.

In this fantastical re-imagining of the Hundred Years War, French and English armies are supplemented with Goblins and Dwarves mercenaries and even some creatures like Giant Spider and Earth Elemental! Just as important as the armies you have, though, are the Lore Masters you choose to aid you: Wizards, Clerics, Warriors and Rogues can all aid you with unique powers and spells in ways role-playing gamers will find familiar.

Only played a couple of times, but it's similar to C&C and Memoir 44, so I feel that I've played this type of game enough to comment on it.

Days of wonder has become one my favorite publishers out there.  I think they did an amzing job with this title.  First thumbs up for the beauty of the game, the illustrations on the box, the cards, the board. they suck you immediatly into the theme although i'm not such a big fantasy-fan. Second: i was a little scared getting overwhelmed by an army of rules but they offer you to start with some very easy scenarios, then you can move on to the heavy stuff. They also made these little rulecards, comes in pretty handy.
Third: cardholders: really, THANK YOU Days Of Wonder.
This is a very well produced, fun, wargame and i strongly recommend it.

After all the acclaim for Battlelore and its relatives, I got this game for Christmas 2008.  I managed to play a couple of games with my brother, but then I had to leave the game behind in Mexico (you can only carry a few games in an airplane!).  I will soon have it at home, though, so I look forward to play it (and to buy its expansions ;-)).

Después de oir por todos lados lo bueno que es Battlelore y sus parientes, finalmente adquirí el juego para la navidad de 2008.  Pude jugar un par de veces con mi hermano, pero luego tuve que dejar el juego en México (¡ya que no se pueden llevar tantos juego en el avión!).  Pronto tendré el juego en casa, asi es que espero disfrutarlo (y comprar las expansiones :-)).

I like the theme, presentation, board and everything.  I really wanted to love this game.  But I got put off by the bits - they're all the same colour - this makes it really difficult to picture the battle lines.  A simple change to coloured flags, with symbols indicating unit type, rather than vice versa, would have been great.  Rating could improve on subsequent plays.

Seems like a mix of several games I like. Have played a few games; very easy to pick up and recognise (better than ancients). Not finding many people who have the time to play. The set-up time stops this game from being rated higher. Being restricted to two players is also problematic as I rarely have exactly two players who like games like this. It's nice how the game state can be estimated at a glance.

Resource management and miniatures with a fantasy war game theme.

This game has a simple war game theme much like Commands and Colors: Ancients, Memoir '44 and Battle Cry, but with the added twist that you collect lore and pay lore to cast spells from lore cards that are obtained along the way.  You'd think this would swing the game wildly, but both players have the same opportunities to cast devastating (but not game-breaking) spells along the way.

The game is totally overproduced with more bits than you really need to play the game, but the bits make the game more fun with a great deal of visual appeal.  Plus, all the complex rules are on handy tip cards, so I don't have to decode a table (like in C&C:A) to figure out what I can do, and what the response is.

Like most of the Command and Colors games, the mechanics of BattleLore are a mixed bag. The historical rules have the right feel, as battles tend to break down into small clusters of engaged units, the way I imagine that encounters of that era tended to play out. The command card system does a good job of simulating communication difficulties on the Medieval battlefield (sometimes you need to order a unit and just can't get the message through) and the combat dice make skirmish resolution short and sweet.

The lore rules on the other hand, which add fantasy creatures and spell casters are not nearly as well designed (especially the spell cards) and in fact seem to be hugely overpowered. Almost every spell seems under costed by half, resulting in very swingy game play. Some cards can effectively kill three or four units with one order. Considering most scenarios end at six or seven kills, playing these cards can often lead the game to a very unsatisfying conclusion. It's an inherent  weakness of the system in that victory is usually determined solely by killing enemy units, so you will often see unrealistic and tactically poor maneuvers by players trying to "game" the victory conditions. C&C games as a rule frequently reward players for ordering units to rush into the open field to pick off weakened units and score cheap kills. Again, this can make for a game in which early tactical maneuvering becomes irrelevant in a mad dash for victory banners. There are also no options for playing racially pure armies, so fantasy races are mostly relegated to mercenary work. Hopefully this improves with the game's expansions, but for now mixed armies are the rule.

Set-up time is also an issue. Considering how quickly this game plays out, it usually takes longer to prepare for battle than to fight one. While this may be the most realistic aspect of BattleLore, my group is a bit put off by a game that takes thirty minutes to prepare and only fifteen to play. Nevertheless, it is a fun game and well worth having and playing. Usually I'm up for it, just not on organized game days...

Just got the game, but damn it looks FINE! I can tell just by inspecting the contents DOW really plans big things here... They did a great job of putting together a game that even heavy duty wargameers and Heroscapers combined will love.  Let's all sit back and watch what direction the game expansions will go...  Added Note: After playing the game I must jump my rating UP! It is a fantastic game. Take THAT, Puerto Rico!

A wargame may not be everyone's cup of tea. With Battlelore though, a wargame can evolve to everyone's liking. While not being a super heavyweight (I'd say it's the kindergarden of wargames), it's splendid artwork, excellent fantasy setting and easy to comprehend rules can make it loveable by almost anyone. Very well done!!

I think the system works better here than it does in Mem '44. (Although C&C:A is still is the best in this series, IMO.) Tons of goodies in the box, but the minis aren't the best in quality with way too many bent pieces that require a good boiling to fix.  

The fantasy theme is also shockingly generic and the 100 Years War theme isn't fleshed out at all. Still, if you like the C&C design idea but with more focus on hand to hand fighting with spells tossed in for good measure, BLore works -- and I'll be playing this for some time to come. I'm leery of the expansions though...

Wonderful child of memoire and command and colours, beautiful pieces, good solid componants, great fun game play including magic and DWARFS IN KILTS! Games are quick and generally very bloody affairs with the inclusion of a potnetial fight back (this game is the 1st that has allowed this in my experience) attacking is not such a blaise affair as it once was in battlecry and memoire. A good gateway game also has great potential and I for one am impatient to see what new races and things will appear for it.

Best of the series.  The lore functions add a whole new level to the game.  I also like the fact that it will be expandable much like CC:Ancients with new units and abilities.  For epic fantasy battles, this may be a perfect system wherein your strategy must be adjusted to the fate of the card draw.  Hats off to DoW for producing this with plastic figures.  You get the look of a miniatures game that plays out like a strategy board game.

Wow, lots of luck in this one.  I've played C&C, Mem '44, but might like this game the best, mostly because it is not supposed to be historical for the most part.  The monsters are fun too!  The system is great with the cards and minis, and the addition of lore makes the game even more fun.  The only thing I dont like about the system is the fact you earn victory points by relentlessly hunting weak units, even if it makes your position very chaotic.  It just feels gamey and some of the flavor is lost.  My last game came down to a single die roll, so luck is definately involved here, but it is light enough to just play again if you get hosed by cards or dice.

I made an easy and effective variant, which I applied on my last two games. My conclusion is I will apply it every time from now on.

I Automatically affect to each player:

Since I changed this rule, I want to play to battlelore an d why not to pain them.

Tactical fantasy hex-grid wargame that uses a unique mechanic for ordering troops, typical dice combat, and a fun hero-based spell deck for casting powers of awesomeness. Though there are times you feel at the mercy of bad dice rolls and swear that if you only had the right command card you would pull off the next Hannibal-crossing maneuver, the gameplay has a surprising amount of control. The system has just enough randomness to make you not a perfect commander with a perfect army (realism is a term sometimes thrown about for such an effect) and yet you never feel a complete slave to the Fates.

RATING: 7.5
A wonderful game.  Takes what is good about Memoir 44 and then goes a couple of steps further to make it fantastic.  The only thing that keeps this game from coming in at a 10 is the weakness that runs through the series - the fact that the game can get out of control if one side draws significantly better cards than the other.  Fortunately, in this case, the game ends quickly with plenty of time for another.  The other thing negative I have is that there are more scenarios needed.  The included Adventure book is really a tutorial, with only two full fledged scenarios.  I'm sure these will show up on the web soon, but it's a slight ding for me.

Also, looking back at the game, I've downgraded it because it is such a hassle to set up and take down.  The game is phenomenal, but the work necessary to play it means that it hasn't gotten played very much.

I bought this when it was back in print and sold it due to not playing it much. I then bought it again because of scarcity and the idea that I could find or convert someone I knew to play this. Yet, the more and more I thought about it, the more I realized this was poor logic and I decided to sell it with the notion that I won't be buying it a third time. If you're about to buy a game twice, think very hard about what kind of decisions you're making and why.

A fun game, but I think the quality of the minis is sub-par, both the sculpting and the shape they were in when I took them out of the box. Many were badly bent. 
The price was high for this title, so I had high expectations and the minis just let me down. I don't really care for the fact that the game tries to be a fantasy themed game and a historical themed game at the same time either. Give me one or the other!

RATING: 10
I've tried to rate only 1 or 2 games a 10, but I finally realized that this deserves a 10 spot as well.  I love everything about this game, and I don't see that ever changing.  I like the variety of ways that this can be played, especially the aspect of being able to play with or without Lore.

I love games that have a lot of variety because it greatly adds to the replay value.

No matter what area I'm judging the game on (game mechanics, components, look & feel, fun, etc.), I give it a 10.

This wargame simple plays both historical and a re-imagining of the Hundred Years War, with armies supplemented with Goblins, Dwarves and even some creatures like a Giant Spider. Just as important as the armies you have, though, are the Lore Masters you choose to aid you: Wizards, Clerics, Warriors and Rogues can all aid you with unique powers and spells.

This is a great game and even more for it is more a miniatures game than a board game. The arwork is AMAZING, the best rulebook design that EXISTS. Great cards, SUPER COOL SMALL MINIATURES. Plus I have my Earth Elemental miniature too :D I play this one with my girlfriend that loves it even more than arkham. She defeated me on both games but that is better. I hate the easy ones :P Forgot to mention that these guys even designed the plastic holder for the cards and everything comes already cutted and placed in a plastic container within the box. Seriously you won't find a better game if you like tactical medieval games.

Great little fantasy wargame.  Hex based and the game mechanic is based off Memoir 44 and Command and Colors.  Activation is decided by cards and combat is simple.  The game suffers in the limited number of missions and not as tactical as say a Tide of Iron.  Still a great game though.

Not halfway as coherent as CC:Ancients, but the introduction of lore considerably magnifies the replay value of the scenarios (of which there are lots). I long didn't bother with the expansions for pricing issues, as there are plenty of cheap 1:72 scale fantasy miniatures out there, and making up your own units was great fun.

I don't believe there are any perfect games, but this thing is as close to a 10 as anything I've played.  Simply put: I love this game.  

It can be anywhere from a light wargame to an upper-medium game, which is one of the great things about it.  The amount of luck is there with the dice rolls and card draws, but I don't mind it at all and it can be mitigated with planning and good unit organization.

This game, I should note, is also on top of Liz's favorite games, a feat I NEVER expected.  That, coupled with the fact that I'm pretty much always willing to play, makes it a staple in our gaming lineup.

RATING: 5
All of the games using the Commands and Colors system have the same critical flaws.  The win conditions are terrible (focusing on kills - which always boils down to preying on weak units - rather than objectives), and your card draws had better be good for you to have any chance of winning.

I barely feel that I have any tactics in these games, let alone any strategy.

Command and Colors system with spells and fantasy creatures. Good game.

RATING: 7
Played once (first scenario). Of course, my single play does not really allow me to judge the whole game - so far I have only a basic feel of the game, which is probably much more interesting when using all the rules. I have the same concerns than about Memoir '44 about randomness (both in the dice rolls and the command cards), but of course I have not played enough to be a really fair judge.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Cool looking and fun to play light war game. I was tempted to dismiss it as luck driven but was beaten 3 times in a row by a more experienced player so I guess that there is more strategy/tactics then luck involved here.

Price seems to be a big drawback.

Sometime in 2012:
I tried the first scenario for beginers... Now I can say I don't really like the game since it plays on three front ... Memoir 44 alike game, just put as a medieval kinda game. Not my kind of game but I doubt if notthing else show up I 'll turn down the game.

Good game with easy mechanics and great themes and pieces. I just prefer the mechanics of memoir 44.

RATING: 6
A nice implementation of the Command and Colors system.  I like it a little better than Memoir '44 and a little less than C&C: Ancients.  BL is a little too overdone, by which I mean the Lore cards and and Lore masters, while fun, add a little too much complication to what is essentially a simple system.  That said, I like this quite a bit and am happy to play it.

Update (3/25/10):  The Lore stuff just adds too much overhead to the base system.  The simplicity of M44 and C&C:A make them better games than this one.  It's still fun, but not as good as I initially thought.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Initially, I steered away from this game for 2 reasons.  
1.  Lore.  I have played Commands & Colors a lot and I really like the fact that you can basically play the cards and the strategy that you want without your opponent somehow negating it.  I was worried that Lore would add too much of a "nuh uh" factor in the game.  But it really doesn't..
2.  The MANY expansions.  I was really concerned that I would go crazy and have to own all expansions.  So far that hasn't happened.  So far....

After giving in and playing it on Vassal, I find that it's equally strategic to Commands and Colors and has a very strong fantasy theme and feel.  I really dig it.

This is a very good game, but when I bought it my expectations from Memoir44 were very high and I found myself disappointed.  I cant put my finger on why, though.  The magic system seems well designed but... basically not as much fun as Memoir44.

RATING: 10
Might go down with more plays but I think this is a pretty cool game. As others commented the magic system is really cool.

In the game I played my opponent attacked me, I played a backstab, he played a counter spell. I mean how cool is that. Just the back and forth.

I think this would make some great sessions for DnD. Having a DM involved describing things and going through plot would be really neat.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good strategy game for 2 players. I like the mixture of dice-rolling and command cards. There's room for different strategies. There's maybe some problems with the balancing, as the dwarves are to strong, compared to the goblins. But that problem is solved with the expansions.

A very good game, but I prefer the blocks of CC:A, they're easier to handle, easier to tell apart and easier to tell one unit from another! And way easier to pack away, although throwing out the plastic packing would help here... Other than that, I liked this a lot!

RATING: 7
I really love this game despite my initial misgivings about the C&C system (Battle Cry being my only other exposure to this system). The lore really does add a great deal to the system and the 'bold' and 'battle back' abilities add to the tactical options.  Still a bit unhappy with a system that allows a battle to be entirely decided by the taking of banners (losing a battle due to the loss of one last banner just when your army is about to annihilate the other side can be very frustrating).  I also do not entirely understand why there is no differentiation in the DEFENSIVE values of various troop types.  I am slowly coming to terms with these niggles though and they in no way reduce my love of this game. 

UPDATE: Still a solid game but, as with Heroscape, setup time has been an obstacle.  I hope FFG can revive this game for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Overhyped, pretty components but very lacking gameplay. Total randomness of the command cards too often means that the main force cannot be moved and dies to a weaker opponent while the players holds in their hand a plethora of cards linked to an empty sector of the board. Very disappointed.

RATING: 8
Some LOVE it.. some HATE it... I love it. There are games however were it is a romp - and luck drives the game - and the win or loss is not driven by skill/decisions. An example is  a game I played the other night. My apponent managed to cast a chain lightning early in the battle and I had a string of units in the center in good formation. He was 3rd level and rolled like a fiend, Wiping out entire units and butchered the remaining ones - one or two men at least... it was shear devastation and there was no way for me to recover. I made a valiant effort but it was a no win situation.  When this happens we just set back up and go again. At some point this may change my opinion but for now I can handle a few games like that because they are far outweighed but the epic battles and the stories that they generate. When it goes right it is a total blast - tense - a real struggle to destroy your adversary with skillful use of your order cards,lore and creatures. No matter what people say it does require skill and good choices to manage your hand and handle your lore. Don't let the detractors sway you. This is a blast and well worth the money to get.

[b]MARVELLOUS BOARD-SET WARGAME. PERFECT EVEN.[/b]

A big box game replete with top-quality components, cards, rules, and board. Also comes with a funky set of coloured battle dice, similiar to the ones used in M'44.

The game plays quickly and easily, with surely the prettiest rulebook ever to grace this land, helping out with any sticky points in the ruleset.
BattleLore is a great deal of fun to play, with enough room for tactical maneuvring to quench the thirst of a wargamer, and light enough to appeal to any other gamer with a hankering for this type of thing.

I will not be buying C&C:Ancients now - there simply is no need: Battlelore fills the gap between miniature wargaming and boardgaming nicely.
The morale rules are a neat idea, and battleback is very nasty indeed, reflecting the formations of olden-times warfare, gifting your troops with a "free" stab back at whoever annoys them. Master the morale of your army and you will win the day, which is just as it should be. The lore "magic" system is also well implemented, allowing a player to mitigate his poor combat rolls by powering up his "lore" for some god-almighty megaspell to devastate the opposition on the battlefield.

The game is powered by cardplay, and the tactical playing of these cards will make or break your strategy during a battle. The winner is always the player who manages their pool of cards the best - make the most of what you're dealt, to coin a phrase - rather than the player who rolls lucky on their battle dice.

Big monsters spice up the stew wonderfully, and these MUST be handled with care by the opposing force, because a loose cannon like the giant spider, can reap terrible damage upon the flanks of a goblin army, twitching its mandibles menacingly before wading through the lowly rank-and-file, gutting the odd grunt who strays too close. You have been warned!

I must say that the game's design is quite brilliant, IMHO. Count me in as a fan of THE SYSTEM! Also plays well solo, if you cannot find a suitably geeky friend. Though, I very rarely play this solo, admittedly.

Some gamers ramble on about the luck factor in the game. Ignore those people. Large-scale combat is a messy business, and unpredictable too - not that I've fought in any wars, but you know what I mean (though I have handled a sword and shield in battle against hordes numerous: the delights of LARP). What I'm trying to say is this game is a blast, and the luck involved is all part of the fun. To the naysayers I declare: have some cheese to go with your whine!

[b]THE BENEVOLENT KING:[/b]

1. Brilliant rules. Brilliant.
2. Superb dice.
3. Great board.
4. Hordes of miniatures.
5. Beautiful rulebook.
6. Excellent tactic & magic cards.
7. Bolt-on expansion systems.
8. Giant monsters!
9. Cool morale system.
10. Effective battle-back rules. Nasty.
11. Perfect, board wargame.
12. Gives an epic mass battle feel to a board-set game, and for a fraction of the price.
13. Implements terrain advantages/disadvantages simply but very effectively. Advance on a hill, defended by bold troops at your peril.

[b]THE BLACK PRINCE:[/b]

1. Dicefest.
2. Bad streak of cards can be very bad.
3. Swing factor with a few Lore cards.
4. Slightly comical fantasy setting.
5. Bendy miniatures.
6. Certainly not as "pure" a game fighting system as Memoir, but still monstrously good.

I shall certainly buy some of the expansions for this scampy little puppy, though I haven't figured out yet what type of extra units I'd like to see. A guess a dragon or a gaggle of trolls could go down a storm. Though you certainly don't need any more expansions to get endless enjoyment from BL, out of the original box.

My personal preference, as of this snapshot of time, is to play BL as a medieval battle-game; keeping the goblin/dwarf/fireball malarky to a minimum. I do like all of that, and more, but have a thirst for longbowman and spears at present. You know of what I speak - I can get dwarves any day of the week in D&D. Oh, yes.

My copy also came with the FREE earth elemental and hill giant. Cashback!

I have the DRAGONS, HORRIFIC HORDES, TROLL & COUNTRY, CALL TO ARMS, CREATURES, and 100 YEARS expansions.

This is a great, light wargame.  However, there are two reasons why this is not as good as Battles of Westeros:
1) It is unrealistic to have the same chance to damage heavy and light units
2) Ordering units by 1/3 sections of the map can cause annoying games if your units get too concentrated in one section.  
On the other hand, this game is more solo friendly.

We'll see if the more advanced layers of stuff help raise this rating.  So far, however, it's ye old [family=50]C&C[/family] engine, with its card screw and nothing-but-die-rolls combat resolution that can provide anything from perfect progress to perfect failure.  Both ends of that spectrum are pretty darn un-fun.

What the heck, I'll make this my first '10'.  The luck/skill has hit a sweet spot with me.  What this means is even though I definately became interested in BattleLore initially due to the hype (it shot to my most wanted about the time it hit number 5 in the rankings), and my interest waned a bit, it has surpassed my expectations.

I really haven't got to play this as much as I would have hoped. Sigh...

Edit:  The rating has dropped due to the fact that it is so hard to get to the table.  I bough the Call to Arms expansion since it is touted as a 'must buy', but haven't used it yet.  I am tempted by the upcoming FFG Heros expansion, but it is tough to justify.

Nevertheless, Jessie liked it and wants to play it again some day.  So there it sits, gathering dust and taking up half of my valuable bookcase real estate with its hugeness.

The set up to play time ratio is unacceptably high in this game.  If I'm going to take a long time to set up, I'd rather play a game that goes a little longer (like tide of iron) or has quick setup for multiple replays (like heroscape).  The system is ok, but doesn't engage me as much as I thought it would.

This game looks to have the same problem as Battle Cry from Avalonhill.

An absolutely mountain of components here.  Makes set up slightly annoying when trying to find a specific army piece, but this isn't a huge deal.
I've never really been a fan of miniature games like Warhammer Fantasy Battle, etc., this is about as close as I like to get.  What it does, it does well, though the potential to get totally screwed with the order cards always looms like a shadow, and prevents an otherwise solid strategy game from realising it's potential.

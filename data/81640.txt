Puede parecer a Caylus, pero se diferencian bastante.

Muchísimo sabor histórico en este juego; todos y cada uno de los personajes del juego fueron pintores,escultores,arquitectos del renacimiento italiano y nos ayudaran al contratarlos para construir los diferentes edificios de Florencia.

Ha de haber mucha planificación para no quedarse sin dinero o recursos cuando nos toque construir o pagar al personal contratado.

Muy recomendable

A játék maga gyönyörű (akár csak az "ára"!), a szabálya sem túl összetett, elegendő mértékű interakció van a játékosok között, a témája nagyon közel áll hozzám, de mechanizmusában semmi újdonságot nem tartalmaz. (több játék "koppintása", semmi eredeti ötlet, a dobókocka használata pedig felesleges szerencsefaktort hoz a játékba)

Ebben a stílusban a Caylus mind máig az etalon - ...és maradt is.
Ennek ellenére alkalomadtán szívesen leülök mellé...

Florenza is a quite heavy gamers' game, with lots of things going on. The main mechanism is worker placement and resource management: nothing new, but everything makes sense.
The artwork is great thematically and from an artistic point of view, but is quite far from being functional: the game needs lots of space, and ideally every player should be able to recognize bits from the other side of the table, but this is not the case.
I see some other problems, too: the game is long and very fiddly, and lacks any change of pace (you do the same actions for 8 turns, with the same potential outcome if being carried on turn 1 or turn 8). Furtermore, there's an element of luck introduced with the dice rolled for artists performance, and this can be quite annoying for such a long and involved game.
In the end, the game is not BAD, but seems more an ancestor of Caylus (that's absolutely more streamlined) than a descendant...

Certainly a good game, but it takes just a bit too long for this kind of mechanism. So 1 point less than how the game felt.

RATING: 7
Very good and very thematic worker placement Euro.  Expect to spend a while with it, especially that first learning game.  Even after learning, this will likely take at least 3 hours with most groups.  The artwork is beautiful and the fun factor is higher for me than something like Caylus - this feels less like work to me.

My criticisms are the same as many other peoples - the workshops/player boards should be easier to read, I'm a bit dubious of the role of the die in a game of this length and with scores this close.

My tastes have changed to the point that I rarely play games of this length, would still like to play occasionally, but sold my copy

Decir que estamos ante un juego de primera división dentro de la avalancha de juegos de colocación de los trabajadores que nos ofrece el mercado. De tema agradable, arte gráfico elegante, notable cantidad y calidad de materiales, debemos disponer de gran espacio en la mesa y de 3 horas de juego como mínimo. 

Florenza tiene mi punto dulce de complejidad e interacción entre jugadores. Los dados ruedan con los maestros artistas para dilucidar cuando se crea la obra maestra, algo que no molesta en absoluto y de chispa divertida.

Estamos ante un mueve cubos clásico, pero uno de los mejores que he tenido el privilegio de probar en este campo. Me gustan muchas cosas. Podemos hacer un montón de acciones e incluso reservarnos algunas para el siguiente turno. Construir edificios de producción o gestión en nuestro barrio, embellecer nuestro palacio o capilla familiar, realizar obras de arte, contratar a predicadores para conseguir trabajadores extras, etc. 

Además el Capitán de la guardia puede "detener" a un trabajador adversario o artista. El obispo puede "convertir" a un trabajador del oponente en propio. Vamos que tenemos de todo. Uno Top Ten de colocación de trabajadores.

Whoa.  Lots going on in this one.  Definately a worker placement euro that has some player interaction.  Turn order is decided by who has the most points at the time.  Once you become first player, you lock in your points and drop down to zero.  Long game, at least for five.  AP prone, for certain but part of that is it is hard to see icons on the small tiles (the icons are clear, tho).  I enjoy this and want to play again.

2014 (2nd ed), 2-5p, 200 min.  Worker placement, economic and planning game.  It's a punishing game, and if you don't plan well there are fairly harsh penalties, per snoozefest and cbazler (whose comments I have saved in my private comments for future reference).  Probably too long (by at least 30 min) for the amount of fun to be had... and I'm AP prone so it'd be even worse (esp. with more than 3p).

Se le puede describir como un caylus para mayores. Es como si en el caylus hubiera varios castillos en los que contribuir. Hay que ir mejorando el tablero propio y además ir contribuyendo con determinados edificios de florenza,  para lo que hay que contratar artistas y tal. 

Es  complicado de explicar y muy cerebral de jugar. No apto para no jugones. Tampoco es muy recomendable jugar con tendentes al Ap. Se puede hacer eterno.

After first play "Florenza" left me kind of angry at wasted opportunity - there are some nice ideas here, but everything seems to be "overdeveloped", with unfun complexities added just to make game feel a little heavier, inelegant balancing factors here a there, and some mechanisms which push players into scripted path.

"Florenza" feel like a game, where designers reached specific balance during development and in fear of breaking it, added "weights" to player actions to discourage them from exploring radically different strategies.

Main things that soured my experience :
- Take-that-ish powers of Captain and Bishop (this does not improve player interaction)
- Significant swings from dice rolling for artist's rewards (end game bonuses like 1 point for Captain or Bishop title pale in comparison with 5 point difference from lucky roll)
- Length of game (especially jarring, as it took twice longer than quite heavy "Feast for Odin")

Solid worker placement game, but takes a bit too long with more players. Perhaps better with 2 or 3. Resources seem to be a bit unbalanced, especially marble is very scarce.

Ouch. This is a heavy, punishing game. In theory, the mechanics are actually pretty straightforward: collect cubes from workshops, reserve spaces for buildings/artworks, and then build, first trading at the market if necessary. 

In practice, this is an accounting nightmare. One turn might play out as follows: to build your reserved buildings, you'll need 200 + 200 florins, three marble, two stone, a gold, and a cloth, but then you need 200 more florins to pay for the artists you commissioned. Since you need to make money, you'll have to use a workshop to convert your stone to 200 florins, sell a spice at the market for 100, and then trade a cloth and a gold for another stone. But wait! You also need that cloth! So maybe you'll spend 150 florins at the pulpit to gain 3 new workers, sending one of them to use your opponent's clothmaking building. But now you need more money! Aargh! 

If you underestimate your expenses by a single resource, you could find yourself screwed. Plus, if you fall behind in points, your opponent will become Captain of the Guard and then arrest one of your workers in the next turn (in a 2-p. game, if you lose both Captain and Bishop to your opponent, you'll have two workers to your opponent's five, and you might as well just call the game then).

While I'm normally a fan of worker placement games and various games where you collect resources to cash in points, this one just didn't come together.  The game is mechanically fine, but there's just nothing here that's exciting.

The game is mostly about collecting a lot of cubes in order to cash in in sets for points.  However, you never really feel like you're building toward anything.  It's just get cubes, cash in, get cubes, cash in, with most of the options being roughly equivalent.  I like having a goal in mind in games, but here, I felt like most goals weren't any better than any others, and if someone took something I wanted, it was easy to just do something equally as good.

There were also some game mechanisms that seemed superfluous, such as a mechanism which brought artists into play, where they gradually live their life and die and get replaced by new artists.  While it seemed novel, the whole thing also seemed like more effort than it was worth, as it didn't add much to the game.  I would have been fine with just a limited selection of artists dealt out each round or something simpler to manage.

To top it off, the game is really long for a game where you just plod along doing much of the same things over and over.  If I felt like I was working toward something, the time might have gone faster.  But the game is far too long for what you're doing here.

Overall, a mechanically sound game that is probably pretty well designed, but just not very fun to play.

This game hits my sweet spot for complexity and player interaction.  Don't underestimate the 1 VP point swing when you go into someone's building.  The dice rolling for the artists does not bother me at all - and has seemed to balance out in out games.

Florenza is really not a particularly difficult game to explain or play, but it is definitely fiddly and it undoubtedly requires a large table.

The core of the game is nothing that will be unfamiliar to most Euro game players: place workers, collect cubes, use those cubes to create "art" which scores VPs. In Florenza there is a bit of added texture to the VP creation, as it is thematically tied to art either on the player's own board or in central Florence. Each piece of art can be completed once, and requires a certain type of artist. At the top of the board, a display of historical artists exists that can be used to this end, each has a cost, as well as a spread of VPs that they can add to the art, this being governed by a die roll (1d6) that is specific to the character. Cheaper guys will offer 3-4 VPs in bonus, great artists like Leonardo can add 7 if you roll a 6. If you're cheap, there are also drunken bums who claim to know what they're doing who will complete your art for free, usually with no effect on the VP value. Occasionally, however, they have a flash of brilliance ala the proverbial monkey at the typewriter and add 1; but they can also occasionally urinate on your rug and set the palazzo on fire, costing you 1 VP instead.

The artists can each only be hired by one person each round, and the actual name ones also have a special high VP value that they grant for higher die rolls. Once someone rolls that once, the card is flipped over to a lower value VP side, thematically representing the idea that their last work was their masterpiece and that it's all downhill from that point on. After each round, the artist conga line moves to the left one space. Artists who fall off the end are dead and are replaced with random new ones from the bag.

There are a couple of other entertaining things going on (start player can detain artists in prison to use later for their own benefit, players can accrue clergy points to become the bishop and convert other player's markers) but that's the gist of the game. Like most other worker placement games, you can use buildings constructed by other players if you give them a VP for the use. Buildings are very limited, and even moreso because the primary way to get more workers (always important, obviously) is by using up some of your 8 available building spaces with casas and other purple structures that generate no resources but which do give you a bit more income and another worker to use.

The worker placement category is and has been glutted for years, but Florenza pulls off enough things effectively to fall into what I'd call solid second tier. The artist mechanic is clever, and the sense of competition and tension is well done, as the resource buildings are often in very short supply. The die rolls I do wonder a bit about though, there aren't very many of them, and the spread between winning and losing can be pretty tight, so just one bad streak of rolling can sink you in the title. I understand it thematically, and it doesn't bother me much in practice, but I do wonder about it after having won a game where my closest opponent was rolling nothing but snake eyes all game. Still, this is a solid title that it worth playing. Interesting.

First impression: Wow, what a big game it is! You'll need an equally big table to play upon. The quality of components is great, the grafics superb, but due to the bigness you can't see everything at first glance, which is sometimes annoying. Gameplay suggests it would be smoother with lower count, but this may also be a matter of experience. I'm very eager to play again, alas, the steep price is a little hinderance ...

Gestión de recursos, quizá al que más se parezca es al Caylus, construyes edificios que los puede usar cualquier jugador, los edificios proporcionan materiales, con los que construir más edificios o empezar a construir obras de arte. Para las obras de arte se contratan artistas que dan un plus de puntos de victoria al terminar cada obra. El juego es fluido, y quizá su principal debe es que es bastante solitario, aunque hay una "carrera" por construir las mejores obras del tablero central !! Un juego sólido, quizá el que más me ha gustado de 2010.

I enjoyed this.  It is very, very similar to Caylus but more complicated and clunkier though not particularly difficult.  It is very bits fiddly and has usability issues with the boards, player mats and especially the artists.  Despite that it was fun.  The thing is, I don't know that it is better than Caylus.  I'd happily play the game if I had the time (it is much longer than Caylus) but I don't know that I'd need to own both it and Caylus.  There were rules questions about the special powers as well - early on in the game the ability to take an action from someone is incredibly brutal, and I'm not sure I like that aspect.

RATING: 9.5
A beautiful game with an interesting combination of mechanics (some old, some new).

So much going on, so many options. Add new production buildings to your private board, complete various works of art, hire a preacher to rope in more workers, try to create "masterpieces" which yield nice bonuses, become the guard captain and "detain" an opponent, become the bishop and "convert" an opponent.

After a few plays with the no-dice variant, we've gone back to using the die. Having artwork outcome be (slightly) random adds a bit of excitement and uncertainty to things, and the no-dice variant leads to even tighter cash in the game and some tedious min/max calculations. Use the die!

A positive surprise. A was a bit sceptical at first as the game looked so fiddly and the theme felt like a joke, I mean, how many games about medieval Florence do we need?

Nice components and the rules were easy to understand. Lots of choices and ways to score victory points, and since you can occupy other players productive buildings you always have stuff to do even if you play badly which is a good thing in my book.

All in all a good solid euro that I'll gladly play once a year at least.

Translated the rules to Portuguese. This is a heavy game in which several known mechanics are added together to form a very good game.

Good, solid game about more or less the renaissance period in Florence. It is a pretty difficult, long game and it is very mean. We played in two and, for us, it worked well, even if it could be a lot better in 3 or 4. The mechanics is not so original, but the graphic and the art are very nice.

Florenza is somewhat of a hidden gem for those who enjoy deep strategy games that are filled with numerous options, tough decisions and a variety of strategic paths.  There is SO much to think about, so much to plan, so much to accomplish in just eight turns.  This makes for a tense, exciting and often gut-wrenching game.
 
The game’s biggest drawback is its length.  All of our games have lasted 3 – 3 ½ hours.  I certainly don’t mind the occasional longer game, but many gamers shy-away from games of this duration.  That certainly is a matter of personal taste, though, so the game’s length should not be construed as a flaw.  My other concern is the randomness of the bonus prestige points awarded by the artists.  There is no denying we have derived considerable enjoyment from the dice rolls, chanting in vain efforts to influence the outcome.  Still, the swing in points can be significant over the course of the game, quite possible determining the eventual victor.  In a game of deep strategy, such randomness is problematic.
 
In spite of this one concern, Florenza is an outstanding game, certainly deserving wider recognition than it has apparently received.  I can only assume that since it was released by a small publisher, it has not received wide distribution.  That is a shame, as the game is certainly on par or even better than many games of this nature that have received wide acclaim.  I’m hoping that others will discover the game and it will begin receiving the recognition it deserves.

RATING: N/A
Florenza is a worker placement game- on steroids.

Once the Captain (Mayor) and the Bishop are finished with special actions to remove one option from others, players place workers one at a time to acquire resources, hire artists, build workshops, trade at the market, or hire out for income.

It is very easy to misplace a worker, or overlook an option, or to miss out on your target to someone else while nailing down resources needed for all this.

I found that no one thing is particularly hard, but that everything at once becomes complicated to manage various options.

In addition, artists only stay in time for varying amounts of time, as they go on though Florence, which means that the time window may expire before you reserve the artist you want.

Furthermore, artists do not always perform equally well, and if players use no-names to save funds, it is possible that they cost the player Prestige instead of increasing it.

This means that spoiler actions from other players are VERY possible, if not highly likely.

Players all to play to various places on the board in the city of Florence, racing to build prestigious pieces of public art with contracted artists.

In addition, players have boards with several spaces for family artworks, palazzo and chapel, and if there are empty spaces here these will count against the players at the final tally.

All this adds up to a complicated game, rivaling or equaling Agricola in terms of things to be accomplished in a short period, with the added complexity of local player boards with Le Havre-like building access.

I cannot hazard a rating on a single play, but I like the mix of mechanics going on, and want to get this back out and played soon if possible.

An attempt to create a better Caylus by throwing more into the mix. It kind of works, but with more buildings on the table the competition for any particular one inevitably softens. Don't let the game fool you into thinking that with only eight turns it will be quick, if you think about your options (and there are plenty of them) this will stretch to 3 hours. The worker placement game isn't my favourite genre and has been done with more flair in the better known titles, but there's nothing wrong with what's on offer here.

Ciò che un german game non dovrebbe essere: macchinoso, cervellotico, bruttino graficamente e poco originale. Si vede l'impegno messo nel realizzarlo, ma resta quel genere di gioco che ti tiene a pensare per due ore e alla fine perdi per un punto. Per puro caso.

Sort of an ugly worker placement points grab resource game.  Quite expensive and harder to find.  Rahdo talks a good talk about this, but his enthusiasm has mislead me before, and I think that's the case with this game.  Should play it before trading or buying.

RATING: 5
Non-innovative worker placement, cubes gathering and spending them to erect buildings [yaaawn...].
The race to build from the common pool of tiles reminds me Royal Palace and Fresco (I'm not fan of this mechanism).

Besides - the game is long and random elements are included without a reason (dice).  Still, close final scores suggest: 'whatever you do it's fine and you win thx to a few subtle nuances'.  Not good for a game lasting over 4h...

I'm completely uninterested in future plays as I can have similar (more) challenge/fun/experience with several shorter, excellent economic titles.

The good: Highly thematic worker placement game with many paths to victory. Some very interesting mechanics: The availability of characters (artists and priests) and the different cost and turns they are in the game provide a lot of variety in the game. I really like the Captain mechanic. The player in the highest position on the vp chart gets “cashed out” with VP certificates and gets to go firs the following round. However, his marker is not reset to 0. This has several great aspects. It rewards aggressive play from the beginning. Going first in turn order could have several benefits. In addition, the Capitan also gets to “lock-up” another players worker or an available artist for the round. Players who stockpile resources will be at a potential disadvantage since they will fall further behind in turn order and may be at the mercy of the Captain. The Bishop is also a powerful feature. Church points should not be overlooked and can be the key to success if a player is able to capitalize on them often.

The not so good: A player who becomes both Captain and Bishop is hard to stop so players need to learn this quickly and prevent (or minimize) it. Although the dice rolls should balance out results by the end of the game, for a euro game with as much depth as this one, it can turn quite a few gamers off – especially if they suffer from several poor rolls that could end up costing them the game. The game does have a lot of components and a large board so a big table is needed to play.

The bad: This is one of the few games I can remember where the design/layout of boards has been problematic. The buildings are a crucial part of the game, but keeping track of all of them on other player’s boards can be difficult at best. Having them in a more central location may have been better. Also, the buildings should have displayed the resource icons larger. The player aids list the buildings alphabetically, which is probably the least useful way they could have done it. All of this leads to the playtime of the game lasting 20% or more than it would otherwise. Once the game goes over 2.5 hours, it begins to wear out its welcome.

Overall, I consider it a very good game with some very interesting mechanic. With a few additional design tweaks, it could have been a great game that would have seem a lot more table time. Maybe they will come out with a version 2.0 that will fix some of these unfortunate distractions.

LIKE:

* The artist display is really creatively developed in this game.  They start in a certain era and grow older each round until they, um, retire.  As well, there is the potential that they will create their masterpiece and their card gets flipped and they won't help players score as many VPs as they're on their decline from there!  In addition, some artists have skills in more than one area of art whether it be painting, sculpture, or some other area I'm currently forgetting.
* The papal track adds a bit of intrigue and bonus actions for whomever influences the pope the most.  As well, the councilor always goes first and has the opportunity to either jail a worker or an artist from the display and force him to work on his paintings for the round!
* Each player can build 8 structures which can provide key resources, a place to sell resources, or acquire VPs, workers, or papal points.  The game proceeds along each track with every first spot action taking place in first, then second space and so forth.  This means you need to plan the resources you plan to use well since there can be significant penalty if you are unable to build what you planned.

DISLIKE:

* Player boards must be seen and can be used by everyone.  It can be very difficult to see what other people's buildings are on their palace board.
* Die roll to determine bonus VPs by the artists attached to each project you complete may too greatly effect the outcome of a game which would appear to see someone win by just a couple points.

Initial rating after one play with 5-players. 

This is a very clunky, overly complicated game. The complexity and amount of decisions to be made does not add any enjoyment to the game, but just makes it an overwhelming, unwieldy mess. The theme is not well integrated into the mechanisms (the artists are the best part), and while there are tons of different building types to focus on, they all work exactly the same.  Boring, long, not interesting, and just not fun. I'm perplexed at the BGG rating and can only assume it's from skewed Kickstarter hype and marketing campaign.

I tried very hard to love this game because of its rich theme and extremely nice components, but I just can't stop comapring this game to Agricola (which is a game I didn't love but don't mind playing). Both games have similar complexity and playing time. The problems with Florenza are 1) there's no 'combo' inside as your opponents can use your buildings by paying a small cost (and that's why I hate Le Harve); 2) You don't have any true strategy each turn as you're trying to do the best with what's available to you, as you can't control what you get every turn. Would probably write a minireview when I have time. 
Edited on 8/1/2011: my second play. Way way better as I changed the method of teaching this game: only teach them the essential points and add and add as we play through the game. This way the other players could all grap the core mechanisms much easier and make teaching easier. And you should designate 1 player to the scoreboard, 1 player to the artist board and another player to manage the resources and money. With these you could enjoy this game much better despite the still long playtime. Rating up to 8.5.
Added on 9/4/2011: Likely my last edit. Few points:
1. The 1 prestige point spent on using other's resources does make a large difference: as pointed by others it means 1 point less for you and 1 point more for other players, total 2 PP difference for just a single resource.
2. 4 players is likely the sweet spot, with enough variation of buildings, not too significant downtime and barely possible running out of single resource. (marble)
3. The dice rolling element is actually not as significant as many others mentioned. Most artists have a rather narrow range of bonus points (e.g. 1,1,2,2,3,3 or 3,3,4,4,5,5) and in each game you're going to roll for your artwork for ~ 8 times. Unless you have ultra-bad luck rolling 1 or 2 in every single time, most of the time your total bonus points is unlikely to deviate much from the middle. The exception is da Vinci: His painting skills ranged from 2 to 7 (which corresponds to his actual history, as he had so many interest that he rarely finish any single work). So beware of him.
4. I think it's actually more efficient to earn points with small artwork but employ famous artists every time. Need to prove whether it's correct or not.
5. Turn order is very important. If you're the last player, the first objective should always be how to become the captain/ bishop.

I have only had one play of this game, it was five player game with four of the players playing it for the first time. It was a l-o-n-g game with a lot of downtime. Not all of this is due to the game, but it did feel like it dragged even when actions were being taken.

Like many euros it is all about getting your ‘engine’ going to maximise your ability to produce victory points.

The game itself was a bit fiddly and not overly intuitive; all but one players made mistakes with the turn sequence to scupper some of their intended actions later in the round. This was initially put down to teething difficulties as we learnt the system, but eventually became a real source of frustration. Curiously, the only player not to muck this up finished second last.

Another ongoing area of difficulty was sourcing workers who didn’t die once they’d completed their task. There were seven building of one sort or another that generated ‘free’ workers each turn - too bad for you if you’re in the last three in a five player game; two players could build two of these buildings while the last three had access to only one. This edge in extra workers helped those who were fortunate enough to go first or second. Turn order is also crucial in the first few turns as the more advantageous buildings are snapped up pretty early. I started at player five, so I got a good idea of what life was like at the toilet end of the turn order.

I was pretty underwhelmed by the whole experience. I am not sure if this is down to me or if it’s due to the game trying to be ‘all things to all men’ but the overall experience was, as I say, underwhelming.
Of the five players two said they’d be unlikely to try it again while of the other three the owner remained enthusiastic while the remaining pair were polite but noncommittal, except for stating ‘never again with five’.

Not for future purchase and would only play again under duress.

This has the core of a fine game. However I feel that some of the information that is needed in order for a player to progress their strategy optimally is too hard to get to.

This gets the prize as the most color blind-unfriendly game in existance. Two of the cube colors are indistinguishable. The little pictures of the cubes on nearly every piece of this piece-heavy game are a nightmare. The colors on the player aides don't match up very well with the actual colors of the physical pieces. My head spins at the thought of even looking at the game, much less having to play it. I played with Michelle as a team, but really didn't get that involved, I saw what looked like a decent game, but nothing too innovative. If they reprint and fix the color issues I would gladly give it another try, but as it stands, too much work would be required to make a playable copy.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---
Another euro about moving cubes around and transforming them into points. Good looking art, history inspired, and overall, a good game, but has nothing else revolutionary or special that makes it a different/special/attractive game when you already have some of these euro.
-> Terribly long for what it is. There are plenty of euros there that offer something similar in less time.
-> A few random elements (one cube per round and number of extra points when building). There are custom rules by the author to remove the luck factor.
-> Placing in other players buildings is very lightly punished, and the other player doesn't get a great reward, I see this becoming very common.
-> There's plenty of options, provided you have cubes (because it's not easy to get cubes), but it's difficult to make plans, because most probably you won't get access to the resource buildings you want. Maybe you won't do what you want, you'll just do what you can.

Un capolavoro. Per strategia, ambientazioni, meccaniche. Forse troppi materiali che invadono il tavolo di gioco ma il gioco è molto bello e strategico. Durante la mia prima partita era un continuo commento: 'che figata di gioco', 'bello, bello, bello'...  tanté che i tavoli vicini, con giocatori che provavano altri giochi, si fermavano e buttavano lo sguardo verso questa novità che riempie il tavolo con palazzi e quartieri di Firenze. Le partite iniziano con una forte interazione tra i giocatori per terminare spesso molto concentrati alle proprie plance di gioco. Vista la lunghezza (in 5 giocatori si sforano le 3 ore) capita che al momento del recupero delle risorse ci sia un po' di self-service, da evitare se le risorse sonolimitate perché è importnate l'ordine di approvigionamento. Trovo la risoluzione migliore in quattro giocatori. Materiali ottimi e i disegni molto belli. Pessimi invece i punti vittoria di carta che sembrano banconote. Gioco promosso a piendi voti e si contende con Vasco da Gama lo scettro di mio gioco italiano preferito. Per chi non ama la fortuna, lievemente incidente nel gioco specie per l'assegnazione della meraviglia, è stata pensata una variante che sostituisce il lancio dei dadi; personalmente ho apprezzato entrambe le risoluzioni.

RATING: 7.5
Beautiful worker placement game, Florenza is what I wanted Princes of Florence to be. The best part of the game is how artists arrive in Florence and the hiring mechanic. While I thought the game was very thematic and engaging for two players, I'm worried what this game feels like for any number more than two. The AP for this game is off the charts!! There's endless calculation, reconfiguring your turn, and stalling the game. In a given turn, you have anywhere from six to a maximum of eight tokens/workers to place! While I think this is a beautiful game and a fantastic entry for the worker placement genre, I'd warn anybody who plays this to settle in for the long haul. Beautiful but when can I this again?

RATING: 7
When it's all said and done, it's really just a longer Caylus with some tweaks. You build buildings on your tableau which generate resources, VPs or workers, or convert resources into money. The worker placement round allows you to place on your own buildings for free or pay a VP to place on someone else's, and here you also book the spots where (after you've received everything) you're planning to convert all your stuff into big VPs. Thematically these are pieces of art. You can spend extra money (which you'll usually do) to reserve an artist which will give you bonus points based on a die roll. The more money you spend, the more bonus points, and the die roll will provide a spread over about 3 points to give you something to complain about when you lose the game by a point or two. It works just fine, but we've seen it all before. And at 150 minutes, this is way too long for what turns out to be a simple worker placement game. The length is a result of the large number of things you can build - 40 buildings, maybe 30 art things. But they're all variations of the same thing, just different ways to convert cubes and money into VPs. I enjoyed exploring it, and would play it if requested, but I've got a feeling each game will feel much the same. I wish they'd trimmed it down to 5 or 6 rounds say instead of 8 to reduce that lather, rinse, repeat feel that the final rounds have.

4 Plays - This should be rated much higher in my opinion. Some people have called it 'nasty' because of the bishop/ captain abiities that can arrest other players workers etc. I would dismiss this and say that loosing a worker is easily overcome and you can prepare for it fine. In addition competing for captain/ bishop makes for an interesting extra layer to the game, where players need to score points at the "right time" in order to maximise the number of times they might get these roles throughout the game.

This could be a great game, but it seems very short-sighted that there are no rules for managing the resources for different player counts. In a 5-player game, money and resources run out fast, and then it becomes a game that relies way too heavily on being first player, which is only something you can accomplish by being highest on the prestige track, which forces you to cash in your points and reset back to zero.

Other than that one glaring flaw, I really enjoy constructing the buildings and racing to complete the artworks. I've always been a fan of the old Caylus mechanic of being rewarded when other players use your buildings. Hiring artists is a novel mechanic which really enforces the first come first served nature of the game.

Overall, I like Florenza. It has a very pleasant style and it's a joy to watch the transformation of the board from beginning to end. Unfortunately, 8 rounds can go by pretty slow with an unbearable artificial limit on resources. Never play with 5!

EDIT: Apparently the resource limit was only a rule in the first edition. I will update my rating once I play with the 2nd edition rules.

Finally learned this after it's sat in our collection for over 3 years! I enjoyed the first 7 rounds where the worker placement and actions could be more tactical, but was very frustrated in the last round when trying to plan out the final actions and got messed up with the market happening before acquiring resources, and again by mis-remembering which cubes I'd have when it was time to paint! Even then, our game was fairly close so I could be talked into playing again, but aren't really excited by it.

A low competition worker placement game that has lovely artwork, but runs a little long. Rules are very easy to follow and should only require a couple of references during first play. Everything clicks together well and gameplay flows smoothly. It only gets a bit fiddly when checking to see whether resources have run out. Otherwise cube management isn't a hassle if you set aside what you'll have to pay each turn and make a mental note about what you're missing. Scores seem to be close and although dice rolling will therefore play a factor in deciding a winner there's plenty of dice rolls. There's also plenty of single victory points to be had here and there throughout the game that'll also be important.

What the game does best is give players choices - a lot more choices that Caylus (whom many compare it to). You can choose workshops and artists and artworks and where you want to compete and where you don't. You can choose to go for artworks early or build up your workshops and use other players' workshops to supplement your income. All quite good except that at two and a half hours it takes about half an hour too long. Any game over two hours needs to be a bit special and I'm not sure if this will see the table often enough due to length. A pity because if I compare it to a similar mechanic and themed game like Fresco, it's much better in every respect except for paying time.

Players who don't like the luck of the dice rolls (in what is usually a close points game), can choose to play the official no dice variant.

Here's a tip for the newbie - build workshops that produce white marble cubes. Acquire all the white marble cubes you can. You'll need them.

Solid game not without a few issues.  I like the game play, using workers to get cubes or exchanges.  Sequence of moves is important.and requires timing.  Workshops are important and should not be ignored.  Using other peoples workshops is useful but at a cost.

The player colors/bits could have been done better.  It's hard to differenciate between some.  Game takes longer than most people would like and there can be a tendency to analasis paralysis. Overall a very good game.

Hardcore worker placement game with a lot of things going on. This is not for the feint-hearted. Only played this once and the first play is definitely a learning only play, so much going on you won't make very good decisions. 

Would not recommend trying to teach this to non-board game veterans, as it's not easy to learn but once you do learn it and get into the roll of things it's not too hard and still quite interesting. I do like the theme, just lots of fiddly pieces and things to move around. In terms of design, it felt like there was too much downtime from just moving things around just to abide the rules.

A rock solid heavy worker placement euro. The bishop's ability to "convert" a worker resulting in one player having 5 and on player having only 3 workers is a disadvantage. Probably imbalanced, can't say really tell yet. Definitely a downside on the player's motivation though.

1 play, 2er.

Interesting worker-placement, resource management game with a LOT of interweaving things going on! Very clever mechanism for artists and preachers coming in and out of the game. Economy is very tight, and you really need to plan your cube/money acquisition so that you have everything you need when you need it (big penalty if you're off).

I'm not so sure I like the die-rolling, and since you can use other player's buildings, it might have been better if the buildings were on a central display (like Caylus) instead of in front of each player. At the very least, bigger icons would make it easier to see what other players' workshops can do! Still, definitely need to play this one again!

--- Summary ---
No Die Variant:
- Preachers: always roll 3
- Artists: roll = base + incentive
base = 1/2/3 for district/civic/cathedral artworks
incentive = +1 per 50 fiorini spent (max +3)

2-Player Variant: if one player is both Captain and Bishop, Captain may not detain a worker

Players are families in Florence, each with their own district board having a Palace and Church, each with spaces for 4 artworks), and space for 8 workshops. The board shows:
- the Cathedral in the center, and several civic buildings in an outer ring -- all with spaces for artworks of varying costs and providing differing rewards (immediate prestige of church influence, as well as some income bonuses each turn).
- spaces for the 6 types of resources (cubes) and money
- marketplace
There's also a separate board with tracks for Prestige and Church influence (start 0 on both), as well as a turn order track (random at start of game).

Setup
- Sort all the workshops and place them nearby
- Place the Life in Florenza cards, numbered 1-7, in a row. Place the 8 unnamed people (6 artists, 2 preachers) on their cards; the rest of the tiles go in the bag. Draw 5+n tiles from the bag, and place the matching cards under the appropriate Life card.
- Determine turn order randomly. Players then choose 2 workshops from a subset of the 29 available ones -- switchback style. Place these in your district, BUILT side up.
- Start with 300 florin, 4 worker discs, and 1 cube of each type.

8 Rounds, each of which are as follows:
1. Worker placement. In order of the Turn Order track, either pass for the rest of the round, or place a single worker in a location (max 1 worker/location, except Marketplace). These may be to 
- build a workshop
- use a workshop; if using another player's, give 1 Prestige (lose 1 on PP track, and they gain 1)
- complete an artwork; choose the artist immediately, which must have the appropriate type of skill (architect, painter, or sculptor) as shown on the space; place artist's token with your worker
- go to market
- give to charity: place worker and an available preacher on a free Pulpit space (1 in your district, or 1 in Cathedral after its artwork has been completed); immediately take extra workers as indicated on preacher card (for Cathedral Pulpit, roll 2d6 and choose which to use)
2. Resolve Marketplace. In turn order, players sell a cube for 100, buy one for 200, and/or trade 2:1 -- but each player may only make each transaction once
3. District activities.
- In turn order, resolve all #1 workshops; then #2, etc. If trying to build but cannot pay, lose 1PP
- If built, flip tile and take reward shown (if any)
- If using, take reward as shown
4. Artwork. In turn order, complete your artworks: district art first, then civic buildings, then Cathedral. Must pay for both artwork and artist. If cannot pay for art, lose 1, 2, or 3 PP; -1 PP for named artist. Earn PP for artwork, and bonus for named artist and according to d6 roll.
5. Turn Order. 
- Player with most PP on track (no ties) becomes Captain of the People; move marker on Turn Track to that position (first) and convert PP on track to PP certificates; reset your PP track to 0.
- Player with most church influence (no ties), and at least 3 influence, becomes Bishop; place marker on Turn Order track on Bishop space (if you're also Captain, use the extra marker). Church track does NOT reset. If this was 2nd consecutive time for you, also become Cardinal: earn 5PP on track, and reset Church Influence to 0. All players with 10+ influence, also become Cardinals. 
6. Cleanup. If this was Turn 8, game ends. If not ...
- advance turn marker
- return all detained/expelled artists/preachers/workers to play
- return all workers to supply
- shift character cards 1 space down. Those under "1" are removed from game; draw as many tiles from the bag.
7. End of Turn
- Player Income: 200, 1 white cube, 1 brown cube, 4 workers, and any bonuses from purple workshops and completed artworks on the board. Also, roll d6 and get matching cube (chart on board) if available for everyone; if not, extra 100 fiorini.
- Captain: either detain another player's worker, or an artist; place disc or tile on Captain card; no other player may hire that artist this turn
- Bishop: either expel a preacher (like detaining worker), or convert another player's worker: they return one to supply, and you take one from supply.

End of Game
+PP for PP certificates
+PP for position on PP Track
+1 if Captain
+1 if Bishop
+1 per 3 cubes
+1 per 300 fiorini
-1 per empty workshop or artwork space in district
-4 if your district Palazzo has no art
-4 if your district Chiesa has no art
Most points wins. Tie breaker = most cubes; then, most money.

Florenza is a worker placement game, medium to heavy with a great deal going on. Stuff is always happening, artists to be hired, buildings to be build, donations to be given, in a flavoured kind of resource gathering game. Some of the mechanics are fresh (not the mechanics theirselves but some of the tweaks associated to them) but the feeling of playing the game is not new at all mainly because the confusion generated by all the things available to do and the terrible, anoying upkeep of everything turn the game a bit too much fidly and dull. Another unintersting thing in this game has to do with the fact that players tend to accumulate resources and at some given point everything can be used or built meaning that I don't mind (in terms) which  resources am I getting because if I have the money needed something is workable. 
Another downside is the time of play.

For a game set in Renaissance Italy (theme I am a little tire of) this looks quite interesting.

Caylus/AOEIII like placement then activation of buildings. use of artists and there time line of availability looks interesting

Not sure about the dice rolling for resources bit though.

Passion for theme shines through rules which helps a purchase decision - unlike De Vulgara.

Played once, 4p.  The game seems to be cluttered with mechanisms that felt unnecessary, and the table was utterly cluttered with things like cards and tiles.  It's difficult to see across the table to see what workshops your opponents have constructed, and to know which ones are left to construct.  This felt like cube pushing at its worst.

Peu de nouveauté (même si j'aime bien comment le rôle de Capitaine et l'ordre de tour sont attribués). Ce jeu repose beaucoup plus sur sa richesse: pas évident de savoir quel est le meilleur coup vu le nombre de possibilité. Les scores ont été très serrés tout au long de la partie. Excellent!

Rating is after only half a game, but there are some issues with the game that won't be fixed by playing itall the way through. 
First of all the game time isn't anywhere close to the stated 120-150 minutes on the box. We were at 3 hours including rules explanation when we had turn 4 wrapped up. And to finish it would have needed at least another 1 1/2 hours. 
But what's really bugged in this game is the mess of a player turn order they came up with. It's quite likely that the last player to take his turn will stay in that position for quite some time, as his start buildings aren't that much of an advantage to compensate for the disadvantage of going last. Also, paying 1 fame point to use a building with the fame point going to the player the building belongs to (which makes a net total of two points between these players) seems ridiculously underpriced when compared to the amount of fame points you'll possibly be able to achieve with the resources gained, because at the same time you're also taking away options from the other player. Really, altering start position only according to the bishop and the captain of the guard is a game breaker when you have the constellation stay the same otherwise. Even more so with the different amount of fame points gained depending on your dice rolls. Why not have the captain of the guard and the bishop have their powers and make a turn order the usual way with the starting-player-goes-to-the-left-and-everyone-else-goes-clockwise. They've just put too many mechanics in one game, too much unnecessary stuff. Bad! It would take a whole lot of persuasion to convince me to play this again. And you'd need to persuade fast, as this will go directly onto the For trade-list

This game is thematically a 10 for me! I studied art history and it is so PERFECT I can't even begin to thank the designer for the trouble of assuring historical accuracy and maintaining the original Italian names in the English version. I love it. I just put it an 8 because I kind of wanted some gameplay differences between the noble houses, even if I am not sure how not to redirect the building part too much by doing so. I am impatient to play again and I recommend it strongly for any art lover and any euro fan!

A lot of research and love permeate this game, and it is what we in the business call a "BEAST." No doubt, this worker placement game, in the same vein as Caylus, may cause brain cramps at first. I, however, enjoy the type of pain that Florenza dishes. I particularly appreciate that, unlike Caylus, there is a modicum of luck involved. The main drawback of this title is of course the time commitment needed to truly enjoy the experience. However, if you can get a group to take the plunge (and it does work well with 2), it is very rewarding.

Fun Essen release of last year. Build buildings, collect money and resources, commission artwork with those resources for points. Players may place workers on other player's buildings, so it's quite a common complaint that they can be hard to see. It's important to play this at a smaller table so that you can see each player's buildings, until you know the game by heart.

The first edition has employed too subdued a palette for depicting the cubes, and there's a lot of information to scan and consider each turn, especially considering the frequency with which someone can beat you to the punch.  That stated, there is a lot to like here, plenty to keep your gears turning.  It's in the same vein as Caylus, but they are quite distinct games — to the extent that I probably could contentedly play one after the other, without wavering from my predisposition toward variety.

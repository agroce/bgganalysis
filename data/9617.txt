I like any opportunity to use phoney accents and this is a good one. It is a lot of fun shipping tanks and vodka around! Also the breakup issue is well handled and adds an interesting twist. However like any other *Rails game, it is painfully overlong.

The rail theme is not one I'm interested in, so that's a problem.
I'm utter rubbish at route building games, so that's a problem.
The theming of this game is just absurd: competing for the most money in your private rail company under communism? Ridiculous. 
The art for this game (both cards and board) is pathetic. It looks like a cheap SPI wargame from the 1970's.
So, with these four strikes against it, I'm very surprised that I liked it as much as I did. "Liked", I said; certainly not "loved"!

RATING: 6
This is the first title in the crayon rails I had the chance to play, and I hear it's pretty standard in the series.
I was quite underwhelmed by the experience: it's a long (1 hour per player seems a possible standard), it's very solitaireish, it's less elegant than the trains systems based on hexagon and cubes... Though I don't mind playing longer games, and I am not particularly against multiplayer-solitaires, I don't see the point in playing a crayon rail above Age of Steam (or Railways of the World, if I want a lighter experience).
Another aspect I didn't like is the very huge cards deck, with random contracts and much more random events. With a "customized" smaller deck, everything could be much more meaningful and subject to planning.
For now, I feel very little compulsion towards another play with the system, but one never knows...

Mayfair Crayon games are great; this is no exception. While not the best, this is probably the easiest because  all the wide open Steppes (plains) spaces make it easier to build and get established. Has an interesting "Fall of Communism" mechanic that changes play slightly. Nice.

RATING: 6.5
A typical crayon rail, but the board is big so the game can run longer than other crayon rails.  Must play with public locking for a competitive game.  If you play with the event cards, the tension runs high because the fall of Communism card triggers toll charges for crossing borders.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not as balanced as I originally thought.  The play seems to be heavily in the south, however, one can start most anywhere and be fine.  The baltics, very south, and the east.  The news cards are a good addition.  I would recommend this behind Eurorails and Empire Builder.

Comment from Iron Dragon:

I don't understand the appeal of any of the crayon rail games, on turn 2 someone was eliminated because a bridge was washed out in front of him and you are not allowed to turn around and he had no money to rebuild (it was only the second turn) and so that was it, he was out. The end game was sort fun, but the 4 hrs it took to get there was worse than getting teeth pulled, I will NEVER play one of these games again!

I hate crayon board games.

It doesn't really hold my interest. There are better games out there which are better than this one. Why would you spend time playing a bad game when you can play a game which is more worth your time and enjoyment?

Why this version than another in the same series? I don't see any major differences between the crayon board games. They are all a like to me. The more I play, the less I enjoy this kind of game. Major turn off. Come to the point, if the game is propose, I prefer not playing anything at all. Don't know why many gamers enjoy these types of board games.

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time.

I don't plan to play Russian Rails any time soon.

[5 plays] I adore the crayon rail games in general, but even among them I think Russian Rails is a favorite.  The listed playing time is nonsense, though; even the 2-player "honeymoon" version, which is what I usually play, does not play in 90 minutes--more like twice that.  So it's a longish game, but totally fun and I always hate for it to end.  Slowly but surely, we're also starting to pick up some Russian geography.

My first crayon rail game.  Way too long, too much downtime as others decided what to do with new drawn cards, and once you know what to, you're on auto-pilot for a few turns.  Could play again, if it took less time, others were having fun, but it wasn't my type of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game can be a bit unbalanced because of the huge effect of the downfall of the USSR, though I'll admit that it's historically justified.  But the threat of a 20% devaluation provides a constant dilemma until the downfall happens---do I spend my money on track or trains so I won't lose in the devaluation, or do I save my money so I'll have more options?  This is an interesting extra aspect to this game.  I wouldn't recommend it as your first crayon rails game, but for people who play a lot of them, it's a nice change.

It's Empire Builder, in Russia.  Actually I really like the changes to the base system.  The contract events everyone can go for are nice, and the Fall of the USSR event can helps make the game less static, as the runs change and it now costs money to re-enter Russia.

Like the idea of the game, make the best route, pick your goods and deliver them, including some lovely events. However, the thing that the map is confusing (unless you Russian geography) and that you have the feeling of doing the same one time and another.... drops down the feeling of the game. Final thought, too long for what you are doing
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A solid middle-tier entry into the Empire Builder series.  I generally prefer to play these games without the event cards in the deck, but you'll definitely want to use the event cards in Russian Rails.  Along with the usual disaster cards, there are many cards that offer additional delivery contracts that are available for any player to fulfill.  At some point Communism may fall, which eliminates the current public contracts, changes future contracts, and drains a portion of players' bankrolls.  I recommend stacking the card into a designated portion of the deck (for example, shuffle the card into the next chunk of the deck - I use #players x 5 cards - as soon as a player connects his fourth major city) so that players can prepare for the potentially crippling loss of cash.  The huge map and flat geography offers players interesting choices, but also causes the game to play a little longer than some of the others in the series.  Of all the Empire Builder games, Russian Rails gives me the most difficulty remembering where the cities are located, which can lead to frustration.

RATING: 6
Part of the crayon rail game series.  The main difference is the potential fall of Communism, which has a strong chance of NOT occurring during the game.  The game is decent, but really doesn't add much new to the system.

Now this is a real train game. The slow pace of the game makes the theme work, because building railway across the Siberia really seems like it takes forever. In the meantime you are trying to optimize the logistics for your existing railway system and find better opportunities for money making. And the simple existence of the Fall of communism card makes you think about each border crossing from the very start of the game.

And chugging along the icy Taiga with Steel and Vodka as your cargo is just manly...

This is one of my favorite of the crayon rails games.  The dual event cards are definitely challenging.  Even though we did not have Communism fall in the game we played, it would have been an interesting twist to the mechanics of the game if it had.

Update:  Finally played a game where Communism fell, and it definitely changed the game.  In my opinion, it raised my opinion of the game from one of the weaker crayon rails game to one of the better, but that's only when Communism falls.  If it does not fall during the game (common in a 2-player game), it is not as good of a game.  I feel that this is a better game with more players, as opposed to some of the crayon rails games.

Not a bad map, but the sparseness of cities on the center of the map makes the confrontations a bit forced and the routes perhaps a little too obvious.

Post-communism "tax to enter Russia" is more annoying than strategic in my opinion.

This newest game in the Empire Builder series is bad. The game drags, and drags, and drags. On of the players needed to pitch 7 turns out of 20. None of the 3 players even enjoyed playing Russian Rails.

So, I guess it's back to the really good versions (India Rails, Empire Builder, EuroRails and Lunar Rails)

RATING: 7
It doesn't have the pretty pieces of some train games, but I liked the faster pacing. Routes are drawn on the board. We used dry erase markers bought separately which seemed to work well. You have three cards and each has three delivery options of a city and the good it needs. The only pain was then looking up which cities sold which goods and then finding these on the map based on the grid coordinates. Some color coding of goods on the map would have made this easier. Some unpredictability came from special cards that took some of your cash. Still it was fun figuring out the best routes.

RATING: 7
Typical crayon rail game with challenging Russian geography. Very cool twist with the "fall of communism" event card. After the fall, you have to pay a tax every time you reenter Russia from one of the satellite states, and the event cards change in flavor to that of a more open economy. Overall a very cool edition.

RATING: 7.5
Most of the games in the Empire Builder line seem to add a feature or two not present in the original. This one features a The Fall of Communism, an event card that acts as a tax event, but also permanently changes the game (slightly). I do like that this offers a little more potential variety from game to game, but it isn't as exciting as it sounds like it could be. I don't see anything that really makes this stand out from the other Empire Builder games, so it falls into the YARG (Yet Another Rail Game) category.

I liked Euro rails more. When I bought it I thought, "hey, I was starting to learn about the placement of cities in Europe from borrowing Euro rails. Maybe if I buy Russian Rails, I'll learn about Russian geography". But apparently, I can't stand reading Russian city names. Furthermore, I find the names confusing. Although I find trying to pronounce the city "Volgograd" out loud entertaining, I found that certain cities were too close visually for making quick decisions, such as Sverdlovsk and Syktyvkar. I still like the game mechanics of this game and the theme. However, it can be a VERY long game.

The Rails games of fun, but there is little player interaction.  In fact some games involve non.  It is basically independent races to the finish.  Russian rails is my favorite amount them all for the fall of communism twist.

The interaction components can be helped by allowing trading of goods and sub contracting of missions.  Pay you opponent x additional rubbles for y barrels. And Giving you opponent x rubbles of the y payment to have him fulfill for you.

"Solid pickup-and-deliver game. Too long with 3+ players, and best solo. Typical crayon rails."

What I like:
- Crayon rails
- Lots of events that create public contracts

What I don't like:
- It can run longish, like most crayon rail games
- The length makes it uncomfortable with 3 and unplayable with 4 (45-60 min per experienced player)
- Remembering the border fee after the fall of communism is a nuisance
- Parts of the map seem unbalanced, as is typical with crayon rail games

Learning the new geography is challenging, but that's part of the fun of a new map. 

Having played with both the original (no discard) rule and the express (discard one per turn) rule, I think I like it better with no discards.

A game in the crayon rails that I enjoy.  Like a lot of the more exotic maps, unfamiliarity with the cities can be a bit daunting at first, but I find that the depth of play with all the various "bounty" cards, and dual events, there is a lot of good flavor to this game.

I enjoy the crayon rail games, but this map features an aspect of Empire Builder that I'm not a big fan of: huge stretches of nothing.  The contracts seemed to be appropriately distributed and costed, and the positive events were a nice change, but I really wish this had some more interesting geography.  The "fall of Communism" card can have a big impact of the game, and does provide another random factor, but it's something that can be planned for.

Nice big open board. The first two play throughs didn't have Demand cards that naturally led us to connecting the major cities. Communism fell very very early but the game played on just fine. The dual event cards are a nice touch but aren't that big of a deal overall. The nickel and dime runs won the game for my son, big payoffs (me) were a close third (out of 3).....

Think I prefer Eurorails and India Rails to Russian Rail. 
Board is very open so there appears to be not much competition for routes. Most events appear to be bonuses and the mid range payouts look to predominate.
The Fall of Communism is what makes the game - so much so I would stack the deck shuffling it into the middle third or 2nd quarter so it will occur around the middle of the deck

It's nice to have another big map game in the Empire Builder series.  However, my first playing of this game has come across as "ho-hum" -- a first for me.  Both of us essentially built an East-West track with some spread in the Baltic states and a few spurs elsewhere.  Easily >50% of the board was unused.  Perhaps the rating will change with more playings, but those playings are not likely.  The only real innovation in this game is the fall of communism, which only serves to lengthen a game whose system is notorious for being long already.  [6]
------------------------------------------------
I've played this a few more times since I made my original comment (even a rare--for us--four player game).  My opinion really hasn't changed all that much.  It is still my least favorite of the series.  I still like to play every now and again, but it is very unlikely to ever reach the number of plays as several other members of the series.  07/25/2007

Each time a new event that provides a delivery is drawn, all players get to reconsider their current runs.  Each time you make a delivery, you have to look at the existing event deliveries and add them into your calculations.

Long, but fun.  It's simpler than it looks, and very involving.  See my review for more details...

Just like its older brother, [gameid=168], except set in Russia.  Not a whole lot to differentiate it.  The one game I played of it didn't have Communism fall, and the Ferry never got built.  Thus, my opinion of this game is similar to the other game.  In a nutshell, the components and downtime hamper what is otherwise a cool system.  I really wish that there was some kind of streamlined goods demand system.  There's a lot of downtime when players draw a new card, so that they can figure out where to go, and unfortunately this happens in the middle of their turn.  It's cool, and if you like Russia, it's pretty neat running around the map delivering armor, vodka and potatoes, but it's not enough to save what is otherwise a lackluster game.

(Sept 2011 - after 1 3p game) - I enjoy the open freedom the crayon rail games provide - start anywhere, connect up, deliver goods, etc.   I struggle with the geography (also have played India Rails once) and small icons for goods, BUT if I am in the mood this is a decent game.   I always want to build on spec, rather than just run my train and deliver.

Another enjoyable entry in the Crayon Rails series. The geography is pretty relevant given Afghanistan's importance for the last 5+ years and the recent conflict between Russia and Georgia.

I don't like this as much as some of the other Empire Builder type games that I've played, but it's still a reasonably fun experience.

I have played all of the other variants and found this one the best. Luckily I played it with other experienced rail gamers so there was little down time. We found the added deliveries in the event cards a lot of fun and a real bonus for those that had difficult cards. The fall of Communism is best played when the game is at least 1/2 way through; I got hit the hardest money wise all three times, but still enjoyed the new dynamic to an old game. We played with 5 people and did not find the board overly cramped in comparison to other rail games like British Rails which plays best with 3 (4 max!). Having the map pointers in the rule book was a great idea and was used a lot by us.

good rails game.  the shift in play when the communist empire fails is pretty good.  other than that and a few other events, it is a typical crayon rails game, which is to say, if you like those, then you'll like this.

My first exposure to the crayon rail game series.  Having played both Age of Steam and the 18xx line already, there just seem to be something more primitive to the Russian Rails experience.  I don't necessarily mind the multiplayer solitairiness feel to the gameplay, but the inability to affect other people (besides inadvertently building into a city first and thus forcing your opponents to utilize your track instead) really means that it boils down who can draw the better and more efficient delivery cards.

A bit too long and repetitive for me towards the end.  So while I would probably consider trying the other maps, I doubt I'd wever wanting to play the same one twice.

RATING: 9
I am very impressed with this game. There are so many different mechanics intertwined, it is truly amazing. The system is simple though the rules are difficult to follow on your first couple of reads.

What I liked most about this game is the different strategies you can use to achieve you final goal. In a high player game, it will be very difficult to keep track of all the possible ways people can win. The game will keep you guessing which factions your opponents are trying to take over next. Will it be the one you control?

The more I play this game, the more I like it.

Very, very good game.  I have only played with three players and it was my first game but it was great.  FFG did a great job with the rules and everything about the game was first class.  So glad that I added this one to my collection.

A set collection/worker placement game set in ancient Rome.  There are a lot of routes to victory, and a reasonable amount of player interaction.  I really like this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another "worker placement" game with a couple of variations: 1) the sudden death victory conditions, and 2) the card-collecting mechanic/faction control.

You can tell this game has been designed by a real professional, as it plays very smoothly and easily, yet has real strategy and tactics.  It also uses an overused mechanic and adds enough twists and variations to still make it enjoyable and possibly worth-owning even if you have a multitude of these types of placement games.

Each round you place your people, and then at the end of the round the placements are resolved (usually there is not much conflict at a position, merely the spots you want run out).  You do however, compete for faction control, which grants special abilities and potential victory conditions.  Money is key in this game, as its a victory condition, and it is needed to purchase cards at many of the locations.  Cards of course are your other "currency"- you need to accumulate strength in numbers with your cards top take over factions, and taking over factions is key to victory as it provides many opportunities to accumulate different victory conditions in addition to the special ability/benefits its provides.

The game apprears to scale well (2-5) and you can change the length of gameplay by choosing more difficult/easier victory conditions.  You can also shift away from victory conditions and play a points game instead.

For whatever reason, I have the HARDEST time setting this game up when it is played. It's as if I need to read the entire ruleset AGAIN before playing. This has been played five times to date, and I still feel like each time I get it out it is an uncomfortable and awkward experience.

RATING: 6
The game flows with cards and allegiances, throwing in a variable end game condition - some are far easier to achieve (get 30 coins) than others (gain a tribute). To me, it doesn't fit together terribly well. In reality, it's pretty straightforward, but the rulebook disguises this fact well. The board is only used to corral cards and present a handful of mechanics to distribute them which makes the game daunting to look at. Player conflict comes through a simple worker placement and a pretty nifty highest set control idea is use to win and hold various powers. I liked this one alright, but it doesn't stand apart enough to earn a spot in my collection.

RATING: 4
It has been a while since I last ran into a game I wanted to end as quick as possible. In principle everything should be in order - you have your worker placement, good balance and a fair amount of interaction. But, something just did not click.

There were too many victory conditions to keep track of. Secondly, there was no climax in the game. You just tried to meet a predetermined number of victory conditions in no particular order. The latter goals felt no more significant than the previous ones. This resulted in no dramatic arc whatsoever.

Why not to give Tribune a one then? Well, mechanically the game works but it's just plain boring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quite fun.  Despite winning my first game of this - and feeling that I knew exactly what I was doing to do so, I wasn't knocked over by this.  It is quick, colourful, well made and quite fun.  There's a little bit of depth and I like the theme (though it is tacked on).  Even so, it's very expensive for what it is, and I have to say that there are better games to play in an hour.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
For me the best about this game is that the purpose of all players' actions is clear and thematically justified. You are not just collecting vp's to be "the best" - you have certain set of goals and you are able to choose which ones you're going to fulfill. Along with variety of interesting actions it makes all this worker placement part feel fresh. 
We traded Helvetia for Tribune and don't regret at all.

RATING: 6.5
Like Power Struggle but less obscure, I would rather play this as Power Struggle needs 5 players who know what they are doing, so more likely to find the right crowd for this. 

I also prefer the more visible link between actions and winning and so it's easy to pick up a good strategy at the start of your first game, or at least a good idea of what to aim for.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Tribun is a typical worker-placement game. You have to place workers in order to activate certain actions - often a combination is much needed.
I have to admit that I am normally not very good on worker-placements and the different options somehow overcharged me at first glance.
But this was only the impression after one play. The rules are very easy to teach and after you got to know all the options the game might or will defenitly develop some deep strategy.
Luck is also involved as you might get screwed a bit as the right cards might not show up and at this point it becomes a nice touch of "take what you got and make the best of it", which I usually find a nice mechanic.
There is always something to do and you have to adjust your tactics constantly.
The only negative point is the sudden ending. You can see which winning-condition is soon reached because everything is open information but I felt like "oh I didnt see that coming" when the game ended.

Okay, worst part: 45 minutes to teach.  Everything else is pretty darn good.  Worker placement, mini-games, set collection, multiple victory conditions...all in a race-to-the-finish card game.  I love that you can decide the length of the game before starting.  It could even take as little as 60 minutes to play!  Yeah, not too many games like this.  Bravo, Karl-Heinz!

RATING: 8
+ Somehow the theme (which is pretty thin) still drives the action in a meaningful way; The victory conditions are varied and often difficult to achieve.
- Some players are turned off by the confrontational nature of taking over the houses from one another and take it personally.

RATING: 6
Fantastic game. It is easy to learn and plays in a reasonable time and most importantly for me (A History and Philosophy Major), the theme comes out in droves with the cards and locations, especially if you roleplay the factions. There is also a lot of player interaction that can be directly negative and thus playing with people who get offended easily should be avoided too.

RATING: 9
A game of worker placement.. and other stuff.  You use money to get cards from the board.  You use cards to take over factions in order to earn benefits towards achieving the win conditions.  The game provides for a limited number of different win con arrangements.

The great thing about this one is that it plays quickly (probably 3-6 turns), even with 5 players (1.5-2 hours).  It's not too hard to understand or follow, though faction management can be tricky.  Make sure you read the rulebook carefully - it's easy to miss some significant rules.

I like the board design and layout.  It really complements the gameplay and enables fairly rapid flow for the game.  Though there is a management aspect for resolving actions, performing faction takeovers and earning faction benefits, it really does go quick.

One minor complaint is that the game didn't come with enough ones for money, at least for a 4 or 5 player game.  We always end up having to repeatedly make change and manage the bank pool.  I should probably add some pieces for more ones or replace the existing currency pool with a larger one.

I strongly recommend giving this game a shot.  It's fun, there's some depth to it without being overwhelming or long-winded and it has some real interesting interactions with the factions.  There's definitely some player interaction, but not so much that it's all out war (fairly civil).  I'm very glad I blindly purchased this one.  Totally worth it.

Fyi, I have yet to win amongst my first [-]4[/-] [-]5[/-] [-]6[/-] [i]7[/i] games, yet I love this game and will gladly play it.  That says something.  (Either I'm more of a masochist than I thought, or I'm really enjoying this one.)  (I finally won my 8th and 9th games.)

By the way, we have one house rule - if in your starting draw you have 2 leaders, you are allowed to keep one of them.  You must discard the other leader but you are not obligated to inform the other players that you did so.  This prevents someone from getting the perfect draw of leaders and running away with the game from before it even starts.

Incidentally, while the Vestal Virgins leader is probably objectively the most powerful (Permanent Favor of the Gods?  Why thank you!), my personal favorite is the Plebians' leader.  He allows you to execute a one-turn Tribune if you manage a single-turn takeover of the Plebians and the Patricians.  WHICH IS AWESOME!  I think I managed it once on Turn 1 and won the game.

RATING: 6
Relatively simple combination of set collection and worker placement game. I was a bit disappointed after my first game.  Probably not a bad game but not particularly engaging. I think that my main problem is that I disliked the winning conditions. I would not mind to play again but I am not in a hurry to take it out.

Played with three players. Enjoyable game where everyone has lots of choices each turn and multiple paths to victory. Players place six workers each turn, taking turns, next to a limited number of houses.  The houses have various effects with which you obtain more cards/money to build card sets with. You play your high card sets to control factions which give you additional powers and help you meet other victory conditions. This game could be cut-throat with an experienced group.  Yes this is a generic review.

RATING: 7
A real surprise and delight of a game.  The mechanisms at work in play are enjoyable and simple, managing to mesh very well despite an array of actions.  The power struggles are very enjoyable, and the sequence of a round doesn't generate much AP even as a worker placement game.  The blind bidding works well and is always a plus for me.
There are some reasonable concerns about how the victory condition cards are fairly samey, and I could definitely consider getting the expansion later if this lingers as a negative.  The game also ends just a *little* early most times.  
Overall, will still be happy to play it.

A worker placement game reminiscent of Pillars of the Earth, but this one has more variation of mechanics. You don't simply take the action where you place the worker.

Great game! Constant fear that everyone's going to take your stuff. I love that!

I also like the idea of having to complete x of y victory conditions. It forces you to be efficient with your actions. You don't want to spend time working towards a victory condition that you're not going to meet. And you don't want to waste resources gathering more of something than a victory condition requires.

RATING: 8
Worker placement craziness from the designed of Die Macher. In Tribune, you put out workers to collect cards of several different factions (Senators, Gladiators, etc.). After collecting cards, you can lay out a set of cards of a faction to take control of it. Taking control gives you a special benefit. You can beat another player's set of the same faction by laying down more cards or by having a higher total than them. Faction benefits are the key to winning the game as they give you game ending things such as the Tribune or the Favor of the Gods. Another neat thing about this game is that there are different scenarios which let you shoot for different ways to win or a longer or shorter game. I love this game and never see myself getting rid of it. The expansion if definitely NOT a necessity, in case you were wondering. Also contains one of my top 10 favorite boards of all time, the detail is amazing!

There is a lot going on in this relatively short game. Too much for such a short game in my opinion. Game would improve very much by increasing the gamelength as I believe this would also reduce the luck factor. I also believe the points variant is the best way to play the game. I do not like the mandatory goals at all as they seem to increase the randomness.

Gameplay has some nice twists on some well known mechanics. But nothing realy interesting there. Components look good and add some atmosphere to the game. 5 players seems not the best number for this game. I'm very curious how this will hold up after repeated plays.

I've only done a solo run-through of this (playing 2 different people) and it seems like it would be fun.  It's definitely a slap-a-theme-on-it game, but the collective choices that need to be made and the player interaction for control of the various factions make this a good game.

This is by far is one of my favorite games.  The theme is excellend, player interaction is back and forth, and the experience and fun factor lingers on for weeks afterwards.  When I first played the game I couldn't decide if I liked it because there was so much going on and the game ended before I knew it.  It made it hard for me to appreciate it.  I played few more times and then the strategies, player interaction and fun factor started to emerge in spades.  This is a great game and should be in everyones collection.  The cool thing about this resource allocation games is the mechanics are smooth and you are using cards.  This differs from games like Caylus, Kingsburg, Age Of Stone, and Pillars of the Earth.  Because of this difference it makes this game unique and worth owning.  I highly recommend that you get this game in your collection.  Oh and it is interesting that this political game is created by the same designer of Di Macher.

Worker placement combined with set collection. The theme is accumulating influence and prestige in ancient Rome. The theme is very much present and there are various ways to win from the variable sets of Victory Conditions.

In this game you aquire cards to regain with these the control of factions. These factions give you advantages and are essential for victory conditions. There are different win conditions, which scales depended on number of players or alternatic you can play with a VP-system. This is a fine game which masters the combines workerplacement  with collective card set (in a way of Cleopatra). It has a smooth and manifold gameplay.

Average Euro snooze-fest.  Very thin theme (These legions are just victory points?  Yeah, everything is just victory points).  Too long for its' dull mechanics, made worse with the expansion.  Alternate victory point scoring lets players develop their own strategies, but at the cost of conflict and player interaction.  Very much a checklist game.  Got your Tribune? Check.  Favor of the Gods? Check.  Freed some slaves?  Check and so on.

Se trata de un juego en el que el tablero es una colección de mecanismos para hacerte con cartas para componer facciones familiares.

Date of first play: 21 June 2010

The first game or two is going to be learning the mechanics and paths to the various victory conditions.  The introductory scenario (Carpe Diem) can be over extremely quickly.

Keeping track of everyone else's boards is going to be challenging and learning the balance between gaining new cards and spending them on faction control is going to be the lynch pin in this game.  One of our initial play group was so enamored with getting cards that she failed to take over more than one faction.  The winner of the first game performed three unchallenged take overs on turn four which gave him a Tribune, favor of the gods, 5 factions controlled and enough money to take the game.

Next time it'll be a fast and furious race to be the first to take over each faction.

Rating based on one play.  Liked it very much despite many auction-like mechanisms (and some actual auctions), because there were enough options that a player can't be completely shut out.

Dropping rating from 8 to 7 after another play.  The relatively high luck factor caused much frustration (and not just for me).  It's still a game I'll play every once in a while, but not anything I need to own.

From a mechanics point of view, this is an odd game.  The mechanics are a hodge podge of things. It's got action marker placement, bids wherein the money only changes hands, various roles, card matching, and set collection.  However, the overall set collection game is worth playing.

Very good game, but I have to try it again, and rating may change. I'm suspecting that it is the kind of game where, whatever you do, you get something (i.e. you improve your position); and, at the end, who won can't explain why he won and who lost can't explain why as well. So still unsure if I have to put it on my to-buy list or not

A very interesting set collection game with lots to think about and keep track of. You always have to keep an eye not only on which cards your opponents are collecting, but also on what resources they are acquiring (lest they finish the end game conditions before you). 

The faction powers and leader benefits are also beneficial in complementary and sometimes subtle ways. The Praetorians, for example, seem totally useless because all they do is give you a legion token each turn–an easy enough thing to acquire—except for the fact that each legion token is worth three points at the end of the game. One player who controls that faction for most of the game is almost guaranteed to win.

Initial impression after one play: very good worker placement game.  The various choices seem well balanced and the pacing is very interesting.  You can jump out and grab control of several factions early but it will be easy for others to take them away from you later.  Or you can take control with a strong play later on and try to keep that control for several turns.  Very impressed with this one...can't wait to play it again.

A new Schmiel is always much anticipated in this neck of the woods - especially as, like Blue Nile albums, they come along only once in a very long while.  Glimpsing the prototype of Tribune at Essen 06 and hearing very good reports on how it played, but without getting the chance to try it, meant that anticipation really built up in the almost two year wait to experience it ourselves.  A lot to live up to then but first, second and third impressions are that it does.  While there is nothing earth shatteringly new here there is a lot to like and it all meshes very well together, with the multiple victory conditions a particular highlight.  A word of credit too to FFG for a superior production job - nice graphic design and excellent physical quality.  All in all a very nice package.  Buy it now before FFG realise Rome is history not fantasy and discontinue production!  Played more and remain impressed - marked up another notch.  

Further plays reminds me what a good game this is and how intuitive the rules are, even after a long hiatus between plays - very much looking forward to getting the expansion to the table.

Another game in the latest trend of worker placement games, and a good one at that!  The core of the game is placing workers to obtain cards which you meld into sets to gain the influence of different social classes; the classes give you bonuses that aid you in obtaining stuff that is required to win the game.  Due to the players struggling over control of the various classes, this one has a little more direct player interaction than most offerings in the genre, which may be good or bad depending on how you feel about that.  I also like the somewhat open ended victory conditions.  Each game has a list of victory conditions which you have to complete a subset of to win, so some players may choose to attempt a different subset of others which is interesting.  As with pretty much all worker placement games, the game is extremely easy to get into for as many different things that are going on.

First play with two players was a great game.  Second play with a large group of six went well and was an interesting game.  Third game with 4 players lasted three turns and one player whose starting hand got him virgins and senators on the first turn went on to dominate so totally that the rest of the table just didn't feel like there had been any chance at all.

RATING: 5.5
(23/10/2007] Caylus, Maestro Leonardo, Säulen der Erde, Tribun... All involve action selection by the means placing pawns. Tribun blends this popular mechanic together with set collection.

As so many games being published, it seems to be a clever design. I trust there are numerous equally viable paths to victory. Having a good and efficient plan to reach it looks like the domineering factor. I'm not sure how flexible you are if facing adversity. It might be that among experienced players the one who manages to pull through his original plan, will be the victor. Though perhaps veteran gamer's will be more astute about frustrating each other's respective aims, making the game more interactive, longer and more interesting.

With merely one game under my belt, I cannot judge the balance of victory conditions and the importance of destructive play - which I hope plays a particularly pronounced role among veteran gamers. Otherwise, the game would feel for my tastes overly solitairish.

So, does it work? Is it as clever as one would think after one's first game? Only repeated play can answer that one.

Is it fun? That's in the eye of the beholder. Quite frankly, I find the action selection mechanic rather stale. If I want to play Kuhhandel (English title: You're Bluffing!, I believe), I'll rather play that game than having that mechanism meshed into the workings of Tribun's auctionhouse.

I have to admit that I'm also less of a fan of those games which basically require you to formulate a gameplan you then set out to implement. I want more dramatic turns, more shifts in strategy. Okay, perhaps that is the case here, but my inkling is that you may get a little railroaded into following your formulated plan.

In the end, it also is a thematic disappointment. I don't see anything genuinely Roman in the mechanics. Indeed, the latrine actually works against historical reality. Romans often did their business together and exchanged gossip and talked politics while doing so. Not so in Tribun, where you head to that restroom on your own....

Tribune was yet a positive experience in May! Like Colosseum, I liked the different nature of the end game where you don’t just tally up your points and see who won. Here you need to fulfill X number of goals out of 6 and you instantly win if you’re the only one to do so. However, it’s often a tie as people reach those goals in the same round, and then you do count victory points for various things. Still, it’s different, and in general the victory condition goals are pretty cool and very different, so that’s always nice.

I do think there is a first player advantage (and second player advantage; at least there is definitely no advantage in going last!) which I don’t think is being equaled by the small amount of extra gold you start with… This is especially problematic if a game takes 5 or 6 rounds and you are 4 or 5 players, which is very realistic in this game.

On the other hand, besides the victory conditions, I liked how you can overtake each other’s cards in two different ways by either trumping the total value or the total amount of cards. This means that you will not hold power of a certain faction for too long! Finally, there is luck involved in this game (it’s a card game after all), which is nicely illustrated in my one play of this in which another player had won if there had been a purple card in the catacombs… It’s okay though, because the game doesn’t feel that random and the short playing time makes up for this. Tribune was a pleasant experience which I would love to play again a few more times to see if it has staying power or is just a game you want to play 2-3 times and then move on as you've seen what the game has to offer.

RATING: 8.5
This is more interactive than some of the other games in the place-your-guys-on-the-action-space genre.  It feels like there are lots of subgames buried within.  Essentially, it's a set collection game where you jockey around to get the cards to take over factions from opponents and with them the faction's special abilities.  To win, players must meet a variety of conditions (x number of laurels, x number of legions, x amount of money, etc.).  The pieces are attractive, and the game is fairly easy to learn and get into.  English player aids would help, but it's definitely possible to play without knowing German.

Man, I love worker placement games. I've not yet found a favorite between this, Carson City, or Age of Empires III. Each one has its strengths.

In Tribune, I love the "take that" aspect of faction takeovers. It's tense as you try to find your niche and avoid butting heads against other players. It's got a lot of various oddities and quirks regarding how you buy/choose cards, but within a single game, we quickly got into the swing of things. Took a while to explain, but the game flowed smoothly once we got the hang of it.

This game starts as a "9", and I can't wait to play this some more. The first game did come to a crashing halt, but for now I like playing for the various win conditions and not for straight-up point grabbing.

Update: five plays now, and my opinion has lessened a bit on the game. It's perfectly fine, but I've accumulated more games over time, and this one ends up as nice to play but not essential. There's a lot of upfront explanation required to get this one to the table, and the collective reaction from my gaming group was "Eh. It's OK."

Two things to get out of the way: I tend to like Karl-Heinz Schmiel games and I was not in any particular hurry to play this after all of the comparisons it has been drawing to the worker placement games du jour. However, it did its way to my table, and I ended up enjoying it, as it's a pleasant enough little game with some interesting things going on.

There is one thing that is beyond question though, Tribune is a game that feeds on Euro game player familiarity with mechanisms. There are just a ton of them present in this. Worker placement to buy cards, but then there are also in the fist auctions that force you to give cash to the other player involved when you win, in the fist auctions where one player wins, tactical placement of workers where you pay more money for choice picks, and odd timing situations involved in taking over factions by playing melds of cards where both the sum of the ranks and the sheer number of cards played matters. Tribune also reuses the mechanic of "Here are numerous potential victory conditions, fill X of them, and win." There can also be obligatory things which everyone has to do to win. So yes, this is a KHS that happens to have a lot of moving parts, which is not as usual as one might assume if one's only exposure to him is Macher.

So, game flow: your turn comes up, you place a dude somewhere on the board, the end goal being to hoard cards or cash. Those two major currencies can then be used to buy or procure victory conditions like laurels, the favour of the gods, and other such excitement. The main board all involves getting cash or cards in a variety of ways. Players can also place pieces in the faction area of the board, and try to gain control of the various different groups in Rome, each of which confers a special power, and these can vary from an extra worker to the ability to assassinate a card out of someone elses' meld (makes it easier to take over that faction later).

Many of the mechanisms feed into each other in ingenious ways. In one area, for instance, players can pay 4/3/2 for their choice of 5 face down cards. The money spent is left behind though, and as one of their powers, the controller of the gladiator faction could take the money that had been spent in that way. A nice interlocking focus, and I like the way those things fit together, and little touches like this are what push this game up a full rating point for me, taking it from slightly above average to solid.

The overall play, in a lot of ways feels like a generic worker placement game, but there are enough twists to give this one some life. Some of the areas simply feature "place piece, pay price, get stuff," which is not at all exciting, but others feature conflict with the other players via auction or card play, and can be quite interesting. I can see where people who are really into medium weight Euros would love this, because for a 1 hour game it has a number of things going on. It does have some significant randomness in that if you need cards from a given suit and absolutely none show up then you are screwed, which will irk some people though, but there's not much that can be done about that within this design space. I also like one of the closed fist auctions and dislike the other (the one where you pay the bid to the other player = good and sensible, the one where everyone is involved and only one player wins and pays to the bank to lock a faction = not good, the power is often much too important to be determined by a wildly unpredictable closed fist auction).

I think at the end of the day, this is a solid middle of the road worker placement game with a mish-mash of things going on. If people in my group were interested in playing it, I would be unlikely to object, because it has enough to keep my interest, but it's not breaking into any particularly new territory either, which is surprising given its designer, who normally pushes the envelope in some (often unusual) direction. The interlocking mechanisms that KHS sometimes uses are on full display here though, and the game is about as solid as a 1 hour worker placement game can get for me.

An unoffensive worker placement game about getting cards in various ways, and using them to control various aspects of Roman life, in turn yielding victory requirements. Pluskudos for the variable ending conditions, although I'm not fond of the Quod Erat Demonstradum-requirement that everyone has to have a Tribun, as this is a brutal bottleneck which has no place in this game. For the rest Tribun is a game which excells in its averageness, and is in that on par with Stone Age. I think Tribun is the better of the two games, though, because there is less influence of raw randomness which sees players gain unfair VP advantages. 

It's not a game I need to play with any regularity let alone own, but I can see why it attracts others the way it does.

RATING: 7.5
Initial rating after one play. There is a lot going on here. From the first play, I imagine that I will prefer the fixed point scoring variant vs. the varible victoy conditions. Unfortunately, the game is a little bit language dependent, but an English overview sheet will help. Will have to play more to solidify my opinion.

Played it a second time. This time, we used the fixed scoring mechanism with 5 players (game ends after one player owns 5 faction markers). Surprisingly, the game was still over after 3 rounds. I think I am starting to like this better, but more play will be needed to evaluate.

Okay, the third time we played a 5-player game with the most difficult variable victory conditions. Finally a game that was not over after the first 2 turns. I like it more and more and will up it to 7.5.

After some more plays, I'm a touch disenchanted - the logjam to get hold of Tribune tends to take over the game, and for shorter games can easily knock half the players out of the running. Apropos for the name, perhaps, but not as fun as the game first seemed. If playing such that Tribune is not a required-prerequisite for victory, I'm still quite fond of it - and the [gameid=38777] both fixes the above problem and makes it neat in other ways.

RATING: 3
While it technically works, Tribune is a perfectly mediocre game filled with a mishmash of borrowed mechanics that offer few interesting decisions.  It also gives the odd feeling of being both too short and too long. In terms of turns, Tribune ends so quickly that there is little time to deal with disparities in the strengths of starting hands, to overcome the advantage of someone getting too many overpowered leader cards or a lucky tribune, or to recover adequately from an unfortunate takeover. But at the same time, because the setup and card refresh are so fiddly and because most decisions are either obvious or random, the game feels like it drags on. In addition, the different permutations of victory conditions actually do little to alter the basic framework of the game enough to make up for the staleness of the card-drafting.

RATING: 7
Components: Nice artwork, though the board is a bit dark and gloomy. Effective layout of information, including on the player boards.

Experience: There's a lot going on here. More desirable choices than I've seen in another game, and the ability to select many of those choices each turn, which is very satisfying. There is great opportunity here for tactical play, gathering up the necessary cards to take control of a faction. Tough to play effectively on the first go.

A set collection game about the same weight as Ticket to Ride, but with a little higher learning curve, as each area has something special attached.  Once the players figure out what does what, though, it plays very simply, yet with lots of choices, and some great interaction as players vie with each other for control.

Yes, many familiar elements, but that's not a bad thing when worker placement is matched with a cardgame as well as this is. Very thematic, opportunities for clever play. Play Carpe Diem to learn the game but then choose the other longer scenarios for more depth. (Carpe Diem is over too quick and does not reward tougher, interesting decisions to build and delay gratification.)

Some cards are much better than others and huge luck of draw (and position) as to who gets them, ending that can be manipulated means a lot of kingmaking based on who could trigger the victory condition this turn and who can stop them.  Game seems to me way underdeveloped.

Came during the rush of worker placement and I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. The issue was that it seemed to end abruptly. Gave me the same feeling as Mare Nostrum. I think though this isn't bad on repetition as one gets used to the razor's edge (like End of Trium) - better on repeat plays.

The blessing of this game is that the board sports more than the usual number of worthwhile places for your workers, so your options overflow, and the problem of going late in the turn order is alleviated. The game's curse is the same: there's far too much going on for a game that can end in four or five turns.

The play is wonderful, but the thing I found cool is that, with all the things going on in the game, it's very difficult to follow just how well, or bad, anyone else is actually doing.  Thus, when someone does win, it almost a complete surprise.  I like that.

Another worker placement game, another game set in the time of Roman Empire.  What's going on with all this obsession with Romans?  But in essence this is just a fiddly card game, with tens of ways of scoring points, none of which makes any sense thematically.  In a nutshell: an abstract with cards and too many rules.  You'll miss absolutely nothing if you avoid it.

Wow, very nice game, actually better than I thought it would be. 

I'm not a big fan of Die Macher, but this game takes the best part of Die Macher and plays in half the time or less too. We finished a 4 player intermediate length newbie game in 2 hours which is totally ok. I guess we could easily get the playing time down to 90 minutes on further plays. 

Ok, it's a classical hand management and worker placement game. There are ways to interact with other plays or at least fight them for some "resources" which is a plus for me. I like that you have different victory conditions to choose from. This way you can play the game in several different ways and you can't optimize the game easily. Sooner or later you will of course play with the same victory conditions again but it's still not the same every game. That you only have to fulfil some of the conditions to win also improves the game for me as it leads to multiple ways to victory. All in all a fantastic game.

I am glad I finally got an opportunity to try out Tribune. The comparisons between it and Power Struggle were fairly prevalent and now that I have played them both I can definitely say that I prefer Power Struggle to Tribune. This is not to say that Tribune is bad. There are definitely aspects of Tribune that I prefer to Power Struggle, particularly in the flexibility that Tribune provides in achieving the 4 required out of 6 potential goals. Additionally, while I have some balance concerns regarding Power Struggle’s victory conditions, I am fairly certain that Tribune is balanced, particularly since each player is pursuing the same set of victory conditions. Beyond that, however, I find Power Struggle to have deeper and more engaging gameplay. Because of this, and because of the parallels between these games, it is difficult for me to rate Tribune higher than Power Struggle, causing me to give it a 6.

RATING: 9
Players represent power brokers in ancient Rome, trying to gain control of factions to earn their rewards.  Once again, the action placement (first seen in Keydom, and too often since then!) is here, as players position their pieces to draft cards, money and attempt faction takeovers.  Factions are controlled by a clever card melding system, earning "takeover" and "ongoing" rewards, which build your portfolio of stuff.  Get enough stuff and you win.  A very solid game, and the card collection and meld strategies make it much more interesting than the swathe of "cube collector" games we've seen recently.  Another nice touch is the inclusion of scenario cards, allowing for different game lengths. Great to see Karl-Heinz Schmiel back - excellent game.  Great, broody-dark, presentation too - this isn't a Days of Wonder vision of Rome ... you can smell the corruption.

I'm not a huge fan of the "worker placement" games, but this one gets the job done.  The board has a variety of areas to obtain cards in some interesting (and some straightforward) ways, and then the cards are used to meld for control of different factions.  Each faction has abilities that trigger when you take over that faction as well as on-going abilities.   The addition of "scenario" cards allows the game objectives to scale according to how simple you want it to be.  Pretty solid game.

Acuired via BGG trade (along with Tigris & Euphrates for Arkham Horror and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage.

Avoid any set of victory conditions that requires the winner to be a tribune; they make for really slow games.

I love roman theme board games and this game is no different.

The mechanic of Tribune is very interesting and different from other roman theme games that I have played. You have to makes various choices during your turn. Lots of possibilities in Trimus.

Each player plays the role of a roman family. You put influences on different factions. Each faction gives a bonus or ability to the player who controls the faction during the game. Factions changes hands often. With the help of the bonus or ability, you have different objectives to do during the game. The player who completes his objectives faster is the winner.

There is some interactions with the other players. You do set collecting. Trying to get as much of the same kind of cards as possible to have a better hold of the faction you are trying to get.

This is a decent worker placement game.  The choices aren't quite as agonizing as in games like Agricola, Le Havre, Caylus, etc.  The good is that there's more interaction than just blocking off other people, the game isn't overly long, and you can play the game with various objective requirements for winning(changing the length of the game) or simply a victory point method.  The bad is that I feel like I'm just collecting cards the whole time.  In addition to that I don't find there to be many meaningful decisions to be made.  That's probably also why the decisions aren't as agonizing as in other games.

The artwork I felt was flat, and the lack of pictograms to explain certain actions bugged me. I didn't care for the boring font used on the playmats.

The majority of the worker actions in the game is choosing what way you want to buy faction cards. ie. (buy one outright, auction with another player, gamble on a blind choice, etc.)

A very clever Euro game. Has a similar feel to Aladdin's Dragons thing going for it (AD is a great game). 

Could do with the AD feature of bidding for first player though, since a fixed rotation of first player creates a rigidity to the dynamics of meeple placement.

Theme-wise, not so good. Still has a mechanic feel to it of merely card drafting and set collecting.  So it's not going to replace Republic of Rome.

As Carcassonne, this is a great follower-placing game. But unlike the before mentioned, this game has even more options to gain victory. 

You'll collect cards (or money, or honors) by placing your followers next to a card on the table. There are numerous areas to which a follower can go, and all have different rules to which area the follower can be placed, and at what cost.

The collected cards are then used to control the most of the seven factions, which is the ultimate goal of the game. Or, if this is not convinient, one can use the cards or money to achieve one or more minor goals set, such as gain X number of Legions or Laurels.

For short: hard game to describe briefly but easy to learn, and a great game to enjoy!

Tribune has a lot going for it, and I liked it for a few plays, but the more I play it, the more I notice the effect of circumstances at your back/in your face in such a short game. The first appeal is the set collection; there are various ways to go about collecting the cards you need, some are straight purchases, and others involve pushing your luck. Then there's the positioning for faction takeovers and benefits to your advantage. This is the most opaque aspect of the game but it offers the strategic hook and will keep players coming back as they desire to master the interplay between them.

The problem, however, is that the game is such a short sprint, the slightest misstep will more than likely mean you're out of it. This misstep could be from the way the cards come out relative to your turn order, losing a faction takeover battle, or going for the permanent favor of the gods only to have no available card to trade in for it. I liken it to a sprint down a tightly jammed hallway; once somebody gets tripped, they're out. 

Now that I "get" the factions and how to use them and know the best relative ways to go about getting the cards I need, I'm left with "will somebody step in front of me" and the luck of the cards. While I realize that stepping in front of players is an element of most games, here it seems to be fatal if someone takes the card you needed or causes you to waste a turn going for a particular faction. It's just too short a race for any impediments.

The end of the game feels unsatisfyingly short even playing the long game, and we frequently end up with at least two players winning anyway. The tie-breaker points seem arbitrary and odd; four points is four points. Finally, the game is a bear to teach, and new people need a learning play to get their head around how it all comes together. 

I much prefer Power Struggle for this kind of game as the cards for set collection are replaced by actions that you choose to take for area control. I find that element of control more appealing, plus the bribing and the theme always have us laughing and cursing each other whereas Tribune has us cursing our luck with the cards.

The game is a worker (follower) placement game with a card collection and auction element to it. It has several objectives and in our five-player game, you had to achieve four out of eight to trigger the end of the game. While there are several  ways to achieve the objectives, they mostly involve getting control of one of the factions. 

Each round you take it in turn to place your followers on the board, mainly to collect faction cards or attempt to take over factions but also to get coins (or denarii) and in some situations complete  other objectives.  

Followers actions are resolved in a strict order dependant on where the follower is placed. Control of the factions is achieved by placing a follower next to that faction and playing two or more cards of that faction of a higher value of those in play by the current controller.

While I think it would be less good with fewer players, the five=player game we had was great.

The current rating (8.25) is for a two player game. It would be an 8, but I suspect that with three or four players it would climb to an 8.5 or 8.75. This is an interesting combination of worker placement and set collecting, with a couple of pretty fun auction elements mixed in. After one play, I saw its potential. I also thought that, in the easier version we played, it was a bit too stilted. There didn't seem to be any way to keep your opponent from reaching victory conditions, and it was almost a race to get them. I lost the race pretty badly, but still. I definitely hope to get a multiplay game in, I think it would shine with the maximum number of players.

Quando se atinge um determinado número de condições de final de jogo contam-se os pontos e sabe-se o vencedor. O jogo tem a opção de tipos de condições de final de jogo diferentes mudando complexidade e o tempo de jogo. Basicamente locação de trabalhadores. Gostoso. Somente as condições de final de jogo que são um pouco difíceis de entender mas nada que uma segunda partida não resolva.

I'm very happy of having discovered this true gem! 

Tribune is for gamers that love to have a lot of different mechanics working well toghether, this game has:
-Worker placement
-Hand managment
-Set collection
-Auctions
-Different win conditions
-Many ways to score VP
-Etc.

Tribune is, IMO, underrated here at BGG, 'cause even thouth its mixture of mechanics, it isn't a complicated game and it's fast paced.
IMO it also has beauty and well designed components (e.g. the nicest followers -wood person pieces- that I`ve seen and a dark, large, roman themed board).

I remember playing this before and not understanding what on earth was going on.  There are lots of ways to plan your victory path.  Watching what other people are doing forms a very important part of the game

Tribune is another worker placement game but it's rather different from what I expect when I hear that term. There aren't really all that many actions to choose from, and most of them have to do with acquiring new cards that are useful for gaining influence on the different Roman factions present in the game.

While none of the mechanics are breaking new ground the author still manages to create a unique game. There are multiple victory conditions, and each player can select their own subset to go for. None of them are particularly difficult to attain so a game is usually over pretty quickly.

All during that race for the finish line it is also important to keep an eye on your opponents' boards in order to deny them the opportunities to end the game themselves. All of this results in a fast and furious game.

TRIBUN stammt aus einer Zeit, in der Spiele zum Verstauen der Komponenten noch schwarze Plastikinlays hatten. Muffig, möchte man meinen und liegt falsch. TRIBUN ist ein aufgeräumtes, flächig großzügiges, munteres Kartensammelspiel im feinen, römischen Gewand, welches derjenige gewinnt, der zuerst aus einer Reihe verschiedener Siegbedingungen eine gewisse Anzahl erreicht hat. Dafür versucht man wechselweise die Kontrolle über diverse römische Fraktionen zu erhalten, indem man die gesammelten Karten einer Fraktion vor sich ausspielt und auslegt und ggfs einen Mitspieler übertrumpft und ihm die Kontrolle über die Fraktion entreisst. Übernahme wird belohnt: jede Fraktion hat einen Vorteil. Die Kartenauslagestruktur aus dem Plan zeigt verschieden Orte und Möglichkeiten, über einfachstes Worker Placement Karten zu erwerben. TRIBUN, welches 2011 die Tabellenspitze der Fairplay erklomm, ist inzwischen fast schon herrlich retrospektives wie altersloses Spieldesign wie es heute noch solide durchgeht. TRIBUN zeigt im Kontext der heutigen Vielspielerapparate, wie schön sich Entschlackung anfühlen kann, als es diese noch gar nicht notwendig hatte. TRIBUN ist ein geschätzter Alt-Bundeskanzler. Und Thema Rom war damals noch alles. Das Imperium. Der Mittelpunkt der Welt. Es gab kein anderes Thema als Rom.

A worker placement game with card set collection. It was lighter than other strict worker placement games I've played, but very enjoyable. The worker placement aspect wasn't too cut-throat, but competition for spots occurred often enough. I liked the 6 choose N scoring mechanism a lot. The theme worked pretty well.  I could see myself owning this.

RATING: 2
An over-produced card game, with a worker placement mechanism thrown in. Tribune seems extremely fiddly in its execution, making it an undesirable addition to the worker placement genre.  It also seems effectively driven by the luck of the draw, and early seating position - either of these can destroy your game from the off set (be it your sets are low and others occupy the spaces).  Interaction is only an off shoot of possessing similar cards and with random disbursement of said cards this can make beating early sets in the factions difficult.  The money victory condition is a wash (or was at least in our game), it is too easily achieved compared to other conditions.  The inability to actually steal factions, in essence the tokens, from other players makes controlling such groups after acquiring a single turn's control almost pointless, except for a few that have some synergy.  In a five player game, with designated turn order I never had an opportunity to go first as the game ended in round three - which to me is absolutely ridiculous.  All aspects of Tribune seem gamey and there is no real adhesion, even thinly, to the thematic tie-in.  It appears that Tribune should be a game of taking power in the Roman senate, but without the ability to effectively rob people of such faction tiles (stealing "real" control) and what not, the game is basically who gets good cards and gets them first.  Stone Age may be a game that involves luck, but in it you can at least work the probabilities.  Tribune is really a random game, that suffers tremendously if your are far back in turn order.   I believe the favour for this game is based on people who are dedicated to their love of Die Macher's creator Schmiel, and not on the merits of the title itself.

I realize that this is the first action selection game of this type that I've really warmed up to.  I think all of the previous games missed some key element.

Caylus is far too long and resource collection is fairly flabby (can't go to the castle this turn, go next turn).  Agricola is another long game driven in large part by the initial hand, and the theme doesn't match the mechanisms used.  Pillars is static and processional and Stone Age's pointless resource differentiation bugs me to no end. 

Tribune solves all of these problems while wrapping up in half the time of Caylus.  The victory conditions are unique and require distinct effort to achieve, as opposed to a generic vp generation scheme.

This is meant for heavy gamers who play many modern-style Eurotrash boardgames [note: I play and love many European designed games myself, but they are not ALL great, and feel that if "Ameritrash" can be bandied about like its an entrenched common phrase, than using the term Eurotrash can be considered fair game in kind :-)]

It is not meant for casual gamers, so I don't think it would be a good game to get for your family or non-gamers to try.

It is at its core a worker placement style game a la Caylus, but much cleaner, shorter, and more enjoyable than Caylus.  I wouldn't turn down an offer to play as I mildly enjoyed my play.

That being said, I wouldn't go out of my way to play another game. It is another heavy mishmash of game mechanisms that doesn't especially grab me theme-wise nor game-play wise.  You're on a quest for victory points in a variety of manners with arbitrarily set VP goals.

Tribune is a very weird worker placement game. The board is like a little casino with each table offering a different way to get cards or money. The cards are used to wrestle for control of various factions, and each faction gives a one-time benefit when you gain control of it as well as an ongoing benefit if you keep control of it. The game has different scenarios you can play, and each of these allows each player to choose their own victory conditions from among several goals. For example, in the scenario "Pecunia non Olet" (with four players), everyone must get 30 bucks in order to contend for a win. You must also do three other things, chosen from a menu of: become tribune, gain the favor of the gods, raise 3 legions, get 10 laurels, or control 5 different factions during the game.

It's a relatively light and random game, yet there are a surprising number of moving parts and mini-games within the game. It makes for an odd mix. But this designer, Karl-Heinz Schmiel, always makes odd games.

Be warned that the two scenarios requiring the tribune achievement can be unfairly balanced and frustrating - especially for new players. They're okay for veteran players, although I still prefer the more flexible scenarios. Four players seems best for Tribune, and five is also good. Choose something else if you have fewer than four.

[UPDATE] After several enjoyable plays, I felt satisfied and traded my copy of Tribune. Then I played someone else's copy with the expansion included. The expansion rekindled my interest in the game, and now it's back in my collection.

Fairplay Scout Winner Essen 2007, but I have mixed feelings about this.
The game mechanics are able to create some tension (do I get what I am looking for), but in the end it's just another euro style game with completely pasted on theme! You collect cards and on majorities you get bonuses. Therefore it's just an slightly complex set collection game. that goes a little too long for what it is, because I feel it's rather on the dry side. Not bad but also not a sinlge new idea in this offering.

I do have a concern that the open information means if taken too seriously the game could be more decided by diplomacy than board play. Sept 08

Cool game with several different ways to get ahead.  It's reasonably deep, but yet the game finishes in about an hour with three players, which is just four or five turns.

RATING: 7
A solid combination of worker placement and set collection. The board is a little daunting, as each section is resolved differently, but after an explanation and a first round everyone usually has it picked up. The transient ownership of the various factions is the most appealing aspect of the game, making it very much focussed around timing - playing enough cards to keep that faction for just as many turns as your need them and then being happy to lose them. The options of different sets of victory conditions for long/medium/short games is good. The game is over surprisingly quick, playing a short or medium game the starting player rarely seems to make it all the way round the table. A light over abundance of chits and tokens, but then FFG can't help themselves sometimes.

I like that there are many variations on end-game conditions and that you generally must meet a subset of specified conditions, both of which will increase the replayability for an otherwise so-so game. You draft cards through various mechanisms, then play melds to take over roles with rewards and powers that (in the right combination) help you earn victory. Given the many possible paths to victory, it's actually somewhat difficult to track who is close to ending the game and whether there is anything you can do about it.

The game is over surprisingly quickly. Each person only got one turn to be the leader. This made it feel like luck about what cards up plays a large role in how you do. Dunno if that is true or not but it *felt* that way.

The set-collection didn't seem particularly inspired.

The multiple goals, however, were very welcomed. Especially the different goal cards for different numbers of players. I like games that include that kind of scaling built-in.

The game seemed kind of mediocre but I'd like to give it another go before giving up on it entirely.

What a beautiful game...as my friend put it, it's a strange mix between the set collecting of Ticket to Ride and the variable card powers found in games like El Grande.

After one play, this goes squarely in to my Top 10.

3 things for me to remember:

The victory conditions must (still) be fulfilled at the end of the round for the game to end.  There could be some issues with who gets the 2VP bonus for ending the game but hopefully it doesn't come to that.

Also, on takeovers you only have to beat the previous set (not necessarily the original owner).

And don't forget that the winner of the card bid pays the money to the loser!

Reminds me quite a lot about Stone Age.  This game features hostile takeovers of opponent-controlled resources, which I normally don't care much for.  But, your ability to do so is a bit limited so it isn't just gang up on the leader.

A simple worker placement and set collection game reasonably themed around ancient Rome. The victory conditions are very uneven, some are wildly easier to achieve than others (try obtaining a tribune, and see how far you get) which means that knowledgeable players will go the easy routes and probably 'win' the game all on the same turn. The cardboard chariot for a locking marker must be the worst example of component overkill I've ever seen.

Interesting! Undeniably, this is a worker-placement game, but it feels entirely different from other worker placement games that I have played.  Players use their workers to claim cards they can then use to influence various Roman factions and complete a certain number of victory conditions.  When described like that, it sounds generic and flat... but in fact, it is tense and fun with lots of surprises, largely because you have a choice in what victory conditions you will fulfill.  There is lots of competition for various valuable things and lots of trying to figure out exactly what your opponents want, so that is definitely part of it.  I also like the game's versatility-- the victory conditions can be adjusted for difficulty or to make the game longer or shorter. Would love to play again and figure out exactly what is going on here. Turns out it is possible to win without paying undue attention to the factions! I do not however recommend this approach.

Based on two plays. It's actually very short while having many different components and things going on. I would not play it with family/non-gamer gamers because it's too much. Also I would choose different games (e.g. Age of Empires III) over this one with gamers.

The main problem is the invisibility of players's scores. You always have to check the boards of the other players to assess how far they have progressed. The actual mechanics of the game are well designed, but the overall game somewhat disappointed me. The decisions did not feel interesting / tough enough.

Wasn't blown away by this one, but I could appreciate that there are obviously some deep strategies that would fall out after several plays.  I think that experienced players would have a good time playing this one against eachother, but it's not really for me.

There are far too many choices for worker placement, and as such the game lacks focus.  It is also a bit too tricky to keep track of everybody's progress towards the completion of 3 victory conditions (at least it is with 5 players).  My third main criticism would be that the large scope and scale of the game is not reflected in the rather basic cards that you are collecting, the game is effectively a board containing a million and one ways to pick up a coloured card.

RATING: 8
This game's already a winner for me for the theme alone: controlling Roman factions. Hmmm. I like the artwork as well, even though it might not be of such great quality as the work delivered by Menzel or Mike Doyle. Gameplay is more than good, and it has enough player interaction (the murderer; stealing factions; ...) to keep it interesting.
The one thing that I think is underdeveloped in this game is the winning condition. Playing for points is the best option for me (vs. the fixed mission cards), but it still feels a bit... incomplete.

RATING: 5
This one was rather a large disappointment for me.  In my book, Schmiel is a certified game designing genius.  But there is little sign of that genius in this game.  He falls for the worker placement mechanic that is already feeling a little stale.  He adds very little to the genre, and stretches the theme beyond plausibility.  In a bizzare rules sidenote, the designers apologize for the historical accuracy in the game.  Suffice it to say, Tribune is to Roman history what Puerto Rico is to Peurto Rican history.  The two have little bearing on one and other.  

Compounding all of this is really poor graphical realization of the rules.  No iconography is used on the spacious board or large cards to serve as a reminder of what they do.  Its just wasted space.  

There is a game here, but I just can't see the hubub.  Worker placement was done better before this game ever saw the light of day.

After 1 play.

Very nice concept and design.  I appreciate it, but still, the game misses something for me.  Sure, there is some randomness and a lack of balance (e.g. cards with leaders of each faction, which sometimes give huge benefits just out of the blue), but besides that there must be something else which bothers me enough not to buy it.  Maybe it's nothing specific, just the general feel of the game.
Objectively I feel the game deserves a better note than I give, but I think my rating quite accurately represents my will to play this game in the future.

RATING: 7.5
Set collection:worker placement:variable powers:blind auctions

Initial rating 1 play 3 players

Very nice middle weight that runs about 1 hour, nice planning aspect, multiple paths and lots to consider but moves along very fast. 

I know another worker placement game like we really needed one but you know what, it doesn't feel stale and it is better than the latest ones to come out with I think less luck as well, you know which ones I mean. The game play is fast even though there are lots of things to watch for and the luck level is acceptable for this weight and length, especially if I compare those recent placement games. Luck here shows up in the auctions and some with a few cards being face down, without these elements I think the game would be quite dry and I'm the last person to condone luck however if games are going to be close every game like I suspect then it could potentially decide a winner between close players (although that could be said about an awful lot of games, more plays to decide about the luck...).   

Don't be too put off by the blind auctions, there are only two and I don't think too critical, overall they're implemented well. One has you bid against one other player, winner gets 3 cards and loser keeps his money and gets the winners money, win-win. The other is all players and it is for a useful item for one-time use for one round, not that important AND losers GET THEIR MONEY BACK unlike something dumb like the one in CUBA which I thought was terrible. Really I think the auctions here are fine, I would be the first person to suggest changing them if I thought they needed it (check my nickname *-) ) but it could be easily played once around or incremental if you feel the need with hidden money.  

Lots to watch for with the multiple win conditions and abilites available, planning important and rewarded, timing key, decent interaction, variant included, so far so good. I think 4 then 3 will be best but some might like the very competitive 5 player game, it will be crowded for sure and it looks like turn order becomes too important with 5 players and needs to reverse after turn 1 ie. last player goes first turn two (easy fix no?). It might feel a little ‘samey’ after several plays once some set paths are determined but hopefully the different ways to change some aspects will alleviate this.  Wouldn’t say this often but adding just a tad of length like 15 minutes might even benefit the game which I think is an option included, it especially looks true for the 5 player game. Not sure yet if some dominant paths will surface, I see at least 2 but I'm hoping for 4.  Rating could rise slightly if some concerns subside or fall if they persist.

Rating after one play, 5 players using a red victory condition card.  3 1st timers, 2 having played before, 1 having played at least 1/2 a dozen... he creamed us quickly in only 4 rounds... if all games end this quickly rating could go down... however hoping to play with a balance of equally experienced players and a game that goes long enough so that at least each player gets a chance to be start player, in which case rating is likely to go up.  Just can't seeing playing a game that takes so long to set up if it's going to end so quickly :)

RATING: 8
Great game of influence in ancient Rome. Players place workers at various locations (ie. actions), gaining cards for a number of factions. Playing sets of a faction's cards might give control of that faction, with all the advantages that entails.

Victory goes to the first player who fulfills a set number of separate victory conditions.

After a couple of games, I am very impressed. Great game, and together with Agricola the best of the worker placement games so far.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (November 2010)

To be perfectly honest, I played the game a long time ago so I don’t remember much about it. I remember I liked the game in general, but I felt it was very unfair and unbalanced with two leaders that are too powerful (the one that gives you a scroll and the one that gives you the eternal favor of the gods), due to this I dislike the game.

The game components are pretty decent. The theme is ok.

When I play the game again, I will do a proper comment, for now I’m rating it according to my desire of playing the game again.

Current Rating: 5.0

RATING: 7
Thought I would hate this game after the first turn.  For a set collection game, though, this isn't bad, especially with 4 players.  Rating might go up after this game is released and I have the chance to play a few more times.

Second play nearly two years after the first.  I have more respect for this game after another play.  The factions are reminiscent of the baronies in In the Shadow of the Emperor, in that they look and act like area control but have much less incentive to hold than to take.

Need 2-3 more plays to decide whether this will belong among my lighter games of choice, or just an interesting occasional diversion.

I enjoyed my one playing so far, but it was marred by my inability to --twice-- not be able to distinguish between the two blue-colored cards.  

Have played a few more times.  It's a fine game, but I think not for me.  With only 4-5 turns in a game, I tend not to fare too well.  Normally I don't need to be good at a game to like it (I'd hate most everything if that were the case) but there's a certain frustration level with this game that exceeds my capacity, turning fun into a wish for the game to end.  It's a shame, as I like most of the moving parts; it's the whole that I don't like.

A solid game by the designer of Die Macher that plays relatively quickly.  (Something that can't be said of too many other meaty games.)  Probably the best of the Essen 2007 class, but unfortunately it's taken Fantasy Flight alot of time to get this into US distribution.  Only possible concern is a bit of a luck factor if playing with the mandatory Tribune victory condition, but it's less of a concern with other victory conditions and once the players understand the relative value of the factions, the game may be self-balancing.  Tentative rating of an 8 after about 20-25 plays.

I'm a sucker for Ancient Rome, so I'm delighted by the fact that Tribune delivers both as a game and on its theme.

The worker placement mechanic offers tons of options, while the set collecting portion of the game is a great mix for both strategists and tacticians alike.  Only a few plays so far, but I think it is clearly my favorite worker placement game, and so far, my favorite Ancient Roman themed game as well.

RATING: 9
Tribune: Primus Inter Pares looks thin on the surface, but if ever there was a "more than the sum of its parts" game, this is it. Each player vies for control of several factions in Ancient Rome (Praetorians, Gladiators, Vestal Virgins, Senators, etc). A handful of varied mechanisms provide access to faction cards. Once you're confident of your strength in a faction's 'suit,' it's time to lay down a challenge.

Each faction's leader card (Ace) provides a special power, current control confers a special action at the end of a turn, and long-term presence within a few factions is one of the game's victory conditions. And that's where the game really takes off for me: you make your way through the system looking to achieve a few conditions in order to declare a victory. You choose which conditions to aim for out of a larger array of choices. You can try to amass three roman legions... or not. Earn a favor of the gods, or not. It's refreshing to see a game in this genre break away from point-collecting, although it includes a point variant if you're so inclined. Overall the game was a hit for me, and as a bonus I'm betting I could get just about anyone to play it.

Update: 6 plays, and I'm upgrading to a 9. This game just feels alive to me. There's just so much that is in motion and maneuvering within it is fluid, satisfying, and requires a lot of skill. This is a superb game and the number of victory cards you can choose from cinches it as a classic.

RATING: 7
A slightly unusual worker placement game given its victory condition of achieving a certain number of objectives vs. the usual VP point collection. As another positive characteristic, it refrains from integrating any resource conversions or engine building. In essence, players can select various paths to achieve victory and don't have to necessarily compete with each other. To achieve the objectives, players have to purchase cards to collect sets of higher value than those present to gain influence with various factions each granting unique benefits. The key is to stay focussed on the objectives while ideally pursuing the less contested ones. In that regard it resembles Navegador a bit which mechanically is a completely different game.

If you have to play a worker-placement game--and apparently a lot of people do--Tribune isn't a bad sort. It looks kind of intimidating, but a few rounds of play clarifies most everything.  I think I'd rather play Stone Age, and I know I'd rather play Pillars of the Earth, but I'd actually consider playing Tribune without a gun put to my head, which means it's light-years ahead of Agricola for me.

Hard to believe this is an FFG game, really.

A solid and somewhat uninspiring game, mainly due to the tired theme.  From what I understand, it was rethemed from something else, which would make sense.  The game design is sound and playing the game is very enjoyable.  I guess what is problematic is simply a lack of originality, both in theme and mechanisms.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it makes it difficult for the game to stand out.  I like how the different goal cards allow for the game length to be different, and the play time is acceptable.  Hopefully with repeated play this will hold up and become a little more inviting, as I enjoy this, but don't find myself yearning to play it.

Interesting and quick game, which usually ends unexpectedly for those, who don't win. There are several ways to obtain each item in the game. There are also many different ways to obtain cards. It is nice that to take over faction you need either more cards or large total sum. This allows factions to change the owner more often and makes the game more dynamic. However, usually we do not use the chariot. We do not like it somehow.

Įdomus ir greitas žaidimas, dažniausiai pasibaigiantis netikėtai tiems, kas jo nelaimi. Gauti kiekvieną žaidime reikalingą daiktą visada yra bent kelios galimybės. Korteles rinkti galima taip pat labai įvairiai. Įdomu, kad norint perimti frakcijos kontrolę reikia arba daugiau kortelių, arba didesnės sumos. Tai leidžia frakcijoms lengviau eiti iš rankų į rankas, žaidimas tampa dinamiškesnis. Mes tik vežimo dažniausiai žaidime nenaudojame. Kažkaip nelabai jį mėgstame.

Downgraded to a 6 after a few plays.  This game seems to have a lot of promise and hooks you on your first play.  But after a few plays it seems to end in just a few (2-5) turns (even with the long victory conditions).  This is quite disappointing because whoever has the best deal will likely win the game.

Perhaps we'll try the high score variant.

2016-11-20 - 7 - Good worker placement with a lot of interaction for this genre. The game goes pretty fast and was dynamic, many times the control over factions were changed, sometimes unexpectedly. Good game.

2017-08-07 - 7->6.5 - I played again with 4 instead of 3 players and suprisingly it wasn't better with that number. I like this game, although I prefer other worker placements after all, but this one has its own unique assets such as playing until someone achieves certain winning goals and faction take over mechanism. I could gladly play it again, but I guess I will get rid of my own copy.

Update:  After 2 plays I think its unlikely I'd ever play this that much.  I've traded it away.  Sadly, just another game I'd play if asked, but not one I get excited about playing.


I have played just once.  I spent the game learning the system.  I like the multiple victory scenarios, seems like a nice way to tailor the game to your number of players and tastes.  The quest for victory conditions leads you to a quest for cards; and the quest for cards leads you to money; and both of these quests demand you make the use of your limited actions.  A very nice package with a good solid game engine.

Time will tell, but this seems like a design that ought to provide enough different paths to victory that several viable strategies may lay side by side.  I hope so, anyway.

There is nothing terribly original here, but the game seems solid, and I expect I'll enjoy playing it now and again.

Extremely solid game!  I love the imperial Roman theme, and the worker placement/set collection mechanics work very well.  Players get to usually choose which victory conditions they want to try for, and there are often multiple ways to obtain each of the victory conditions.  Add that to the fact that there are several different "scenarios", and you get a game with scads of replayability.  Lots of choices and multiple paths to victory equals a bunch of fun for me!

I see that there is a lot of potential in it, BUT it's all wasted. There are missing all the tools to see the overall victory point situation - how am I doing compared to opponents? Why? Again, there is missing "progress" board (how near player x is for getting Tribun-token etc.) AND one quite big issue is, that there aren't any hints what do you get when you takeover one leader etc.

Okay the later two issues might not be BIG issues, if you play the gamee a lot, but for example I'm a gamer who play the same game maybe ~twice in a year, I would like to have those helpers.

I'm quite sure, that I won't play this game again unless someone makes those progress-boards. Why? Because the game itself isn't that unique AND there are better designed games in the same genre.

The rules might be clever, it is possible that it's a well-balanced game (although there was quite a bit of role for luck in the game we played) but collecting cards simply is not as much fun as many rules you should remember. We even learned 'new' rules in the last round while it certainly was not a group of non-gamers.
Update after one year: Yes it works. I still think it's overcomplicated for itw own good (even those who have played it more than 5 times didn't remember all the rules) but it works, it's an okay worker placement game with some interesting decisions but an artwork that I still find too cold.

An ok game.  The fundamental mechanic is somewhat weak.  If I'm going for making sets of random cards, I prefer Thurn & Taxis or even Knizia's Vampire.  Tribune wraps this in what is (imho) an overly complicated metagame.  I like complex games, but only when that complexity means more control and more strategy.  Plays fine, not just a good mix for me.

RATING: 8
A multiple card-types (seven in all) set-collection game that is highly interactive (if you're paying attention).  You are placing your pawns to influence various different locations to acquire cards, gather money, build resources, and so on to fulfill a minimum required number of goals, that everyone else is also aiming for.  Attaining sufficient and proper types of cards is important but there a multiple paths of strategies in gaining any of the different goals towards victory.  With players of similar experience level, it will usually end up in the tiebreaker chart in tallying up victory points on the goals which you've accumulated throughout the game.  

When playing with large number of players (5 or 6 with expansion), there are quite a few times where a player gets screwed too often b/c others have better cards and did this earlier.  I think Tribune may be best with 4 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It is another worker placement game which relies on card play to take control of the different factions which allow you to gain victory conditions.  It is essential that you plan and pursue the victory conditions as efficiently as possible as you will have difficulty winning if you don't specialize well.  

While it is another worker placement game, this one is enjoyable due to its ease of play, speed of gameplay (some feel it is over too quickly), and the different ways one can acquire cards from straight up purchasing cards, potentially getting into a blind bid where the winner pays the loser for three cards, a card where you can take its worth in gold or buy the card, a place where you can trade cards for new cards, turn in pairs for VPs, and more.  I just enjoy the variation to what the workers can do while keeping it simple.

The first time it looks like a pile of rules to go through but actually it plays very fluently. I like the different choices you have at the start to set as victory conditions, as well as game length. Cards and material is very good quality. Has a chance to become our next favourite !
The leader of the senators is too good for my liking, especially at the start of the game as you can then take the vestal virgins faction marker and start going for the eternal favor, which is a bit game breaking.
But besides that I don't think there is anything to complain about !

Quite a game here. A whole lot going on during just about each phase. So much that in the shorter win condition scenarios, it's over in 4-5 turns. Rules seem complicated at first but after a round of play it all makes sense. Really enjoyed how you can have an overall long term strategy for which win conditions you want to try and fulfill but also had to play very tactical each round depending on what is available for buying and where everyone is going. Solid game for any collection.

RATING: 8
Effectively a set-collection card game in which players draft cards by taking turns placing "followers" on various board spaces (similar to Caylus, Pillars of the Earth, Stone Age, Age of Empires III, etc.).  This is a medium-weight game with simple rules that is fun, challeging and addicting.  Works well with 2 players.

I'm thinking the rating on this one will rise.

It's most certainly an overlooked gem from Essen '07.

While it's just worker placement, hand management, and majorities, the way each area implements the collection of these objects gives such wide variety, not to mention the multiple ways to collect points. There seems no way to be shut out.

There's just something about the swift flow of the game, faction benefits, and not to mention the short playtime that really make this one come together.

An interesting game where you are set collecting, but you acquire cards and sets in a myriad of ways.  You are trying to get victory points and be the first to meet the game victory conditions.

One of the very few games of this year's Essen crop that I was interested in but where I did not manage to read the rules beforehand. After listening to an explanation of the game and watching a table at Essen play a round, it got instantaneously upgraded to a must-buy, and our first journey into Rome made me very happy about that decision:

In Tribun you try to gain and, more importantly, use influence over the various political factions of Rome. You get the influence in several action spots where you place your agents in an initial round that plays out similar to Säulen der Erde. Things are turned up a notch here, however, since some of these actions are little gamelets all by themselves, and the decision what to do with your newly gained influence is a lot more involved.

This is mainly because all factions give different freebies both every round and at the moment you wrest control over them from another player. A lot of things happen, and in our initial two games (we immediately played twice in a row in spite of other new Essen stuff awaiting us, which says something about how much we liked Tribun) we found out that at least with unexperienced players, they can happen very fast - both games just took three rounds to finish, and in both cases, this could probably have been postponed by better opponents. So I'd guess that the game length (under an hour for us) will probably stay where it is, since the improved speed due to knowing your stuff will be offset by more rounds to win.

Played 5+ times.

I've only played this once so take it with a grain of salt, but here's what sticks in my mind with this one:  You are REQUIRED to have a Tribune to win.  It's hard to get. And your possibilities are mitigated by the luck of the card draw.  You may have a plan, but then zero cards of the type you need come up... for two straight rounds.  By then, your other tribune requirement has been whisked away.  There is no recovering from that.

07/22/08 Played a five-player game, once. It was OK. The components are nice except the huge chariot that is waaaay over produced. Probably something not much larger than the meeples in the game, and made out of solid wood would have served better. As it was, it sometimes blocked ones view of parts of the game board and/or just flat got in the way. 10/25/08 Played a four-player game. The convoluted and therefore confusing scoring procedure keeps this game from being one I want to play very often. I feel like I'm a juggler. Not only trying to keep 4-5 balls in the air all the time, but also having to watch what the other jugglers are doing, lest they win. 01/25/09 Played a three-player game.

Re-uses the same old action selection mechanism pioneered by caylus and further popularized by agricola. Some interesting decisions to be made in the set-collection process, but I really hate the fact that all 'bonuses' (ie control of tribes, scroll, and god favours) do not expire, even if you loose your set to a better one. Granted if it did, the game would simply not work, but as it is it's not super either.

Tribune doesn't really bring anything new to the table but it does bind large mix of mechanics together in a tight package.  At it's base it's a worker placement/set-collection game where players gather followers (through various arenas and powers) so that they can be used to gain control over the seven Roman factions.  

Once someone has met several of the potential goals layed out before the game begins, the round continues, and whoever has met the victory condition at the end of that round now sees who has the most points.  This encourages players to continually diversify as there's a race aspect to the game and it's very difficult to meet all of the victory conditions without gaining control of most of the factions, at one time or the other, before the game has ended.

Beautifully produced, easily "grokked" system of play, with a lightly thematic twist.  But I won my group's first game, which means there's *got* to be something wrong with it. There is, actually:  the victory conditions are a bit wonky.  You can't even score if you've fulfilled the mandated number, so no matter how huge your score may have been, you can't get through the door if you haven't diversified enough.  Neat game, but the endgame is a head-scratcher.

RATING: 6.5
In this worker placement game themed after the ancient Roman empire, one is collecting noble cards in various suits. These cards can then be used to take control of a faction, to give benefits, VPs, money and so forth. Some faction abilities are interlinked, so you need to have control of two specific factions to earn the benefit. There is a short game, where one tries to make four out of six objectives, or the long game.

The mechanics of this game are good, but it seems games barely last 4 or 5 turns. It seems that whoever has a favorable draw of cards that allows them to take control of the right factions (eg senators and vestal virgins) have a big advantage.  It's fun, and I'll gladly play, it's just the games have felt a bit unsatisfying. I think a few more plays will uncover more strategy.

Based on a single two-player game.  Solid, if unspectacular design.  There's lots to do - the crux of the game is finding an efficient way to explore the breadth of "scoring" options, however there is also motivation to keep on doing it past the minimum you need as it contributes to the "tiebreaker" at the end.

Interested in trying it with more players.  

---update---
Played with more.  Having fewer conditions necessary for victory allows some specialization, which is nice.  And it plays quicker as everyone has fewer conditions to meet.  But you also get less control/more chaos.

Ultimately, Tribune seems to be a game where there can be a lot going on, but without any of it necessarily being fun.  A fine system, but not something I'll suggest myself.

This game simply isn't "my game". It seems I'm always doing the wrong thing, have the wrong cards, go for the wrong faction. I can't do anything right in this game. 
It appears to me that it is more luck dependent than many others games, but perhaps it is just me, missing   the luck in this particular game where in other games I have the necessary luck on my side.
Also possible, I just don't grasp it.

Quick set collection worker placement card game with lots of options and several paths to victory. You control factions and get things when you do it, and abilities as long as you keep controlling them. But the target is to achieve some objectives that might or not be in line with all these things.

There are decent ammounts of luck (not too much) and depth, but the star feature is the interaction. You must control what your opponents are doing, react and adapt. You will want to do many things, but you'll have to choose and focus. The one hour duration is just perfect for the tension that will keep building since the beginning.

There is some theme to it, but when you get to play it, you just think of the cards and the abstract mechanisms. The producction is medium-high, the board is nice, the cards are just practical, but the have an odd size that will complicate sleeving them; there are a couple of cardboard charriots very nice, but quite useless.

Tight and mean gameplay, and nicely polished design. Probably among the top three games of 2007. Rating will probably rise.

Worker placement, hand management, multiple paths to victory, and refreshingly direct player interaction. Game length can be fine tuned to your group's tastes by choosing among the different victory condition cards.

A middleweight euro where players place pawns in order to take actions or pick up cards and in turn take control of various factions. This game has a beautiful board and plays at a nice pace but I'm disappointed that this doesn't have the politics or intrigue that the theme might suggest. Some of the cards seem unbalanced, notably the ones that provide a victory condition from just owning the card.

Wife and I, we played this at the local game club... and *I* thought it was fun,  The Mrs. she was a quarter of the way there... (she needs another play to figure it all the way out)

We learned this with 2 good teachers, and plp we reguarly play with BUT GEEZE Brain tried to "Tell" us the rules, and we're usually good with him and rules but this is SOOO friggin hard to take in... 

Take it from me... just play this first, lose badly, but that is the only way to learn this game....


AFTER you get over the learning hump... I find it REALLY enjoyable... I have to play it again to figure out how much i really like it... but if i had to guess, it will up there...

Good solid game, without being 'spectacular'. The similarity to Caylus/Pillars/et al when it comes to "worker placement" is obvious and is done well, but there appears little new here. These comments come after only one game though, so take them as you will.

Initial rating. Low interaction light/medium worker placement game with a nice theme. Good rule book. Looks nice as well.

It's a game for an occasional play when I'm not in the mood for a long dramatic thematic confrontational game, but for something totally different, may hit the table once or twice in a year.

3 players seems too few. I never felt much pressure and  didn't feel seriously challenged in terms of tactics/strategy. I suspect the game usually gets more tense in the last third. All that happens before seems rather irrelevant to me, thus presenting an unwelcomed feature.

Played three times thus far (as of Sept 2008) - once with the 'basic' scoring variant, twice with the victory conditions.

Very slick game with lots of mechanics that build on one another.  You play workers to get cards, you use cards to get control of factions, and you use factions (for the most part) to bring you closer to meeting the victory conditions.  This would all be rather boring except that Schmiel is far too clever to leave the game completely linear - you can use workers and/or money to short-circuit some of this and try to jump ahead by buying what you need directly or gaining laurels without having to control a faction.

The fact that the game length is controllable by altering the difficulty and quantity of the victory conditions makes this an even better game - it can be a quick 1 hour game or a longer, more tense affair, however you wish.

Highly recommended.

Really just a card drafting game, with a bunch of different objectives to complete.  Nothing outstanding here, but I appreciate pretty simple rules that provide interesting decisions.  For a race game, I felt a distinct lack of chaos with five players, which is a good thing.  Would like to play this again, would like to see how balanced it is with fewer players.

RATING: 8
There's a nice mesh of mechanics here - worker placement and blind bids to get cards, use the cards to compete for biggest sets. Each set has different advantages. As players can strive for different groups of goals for the win, sets will have different values for each player. All good stuff.

You place workers out Caylus style to claim cards or money - claim a specific card for $1, or others for $3, or take blind luck, or compete using an in-the-fist bid, etc. Players then compete to be the 'king' in each of the 7 colours, which construe advantages such as laurels, scrolls, legions, cards, money, etc. To win, you need to achieve a target in 4 of 7 categories - $25, 3 legions, 8 laurels, etc. Winning conditions vary depending on the number of players and the difficulty factor chosen pre-game. 

The rules are too long and multi-layered for family, which means this is aimed at gamers who are looking for a light-weight 1 hour type game. Your strategy to begin with is driven by your starting hand, plus what the other players aren't going for - if the two match, you're off to a good start. 

It takes a game to internalise how to drive for each of the winning categories, and swinging it so they all come good on the same turn is the charm. Which means the game is a constant decision-making process on what spot to go for on any given worker placement; given the categories you're aiming for, what it seems the other players are aiming for, plus what's left out there. Which may well lead you to change strategy and aim for a different category at any given moment. And this is what I like about the game - it may just be a varied card picking and set building process, but it's imbued with a constant weighing up of options and changes. 

An 8 from me to begin with. This is not the greatest game in the world; this is a tribune to the greatest game in the world.

Il gioco, che ha componenti molto buoni (e in quantità superiore a quella richiesta per una partita!) è semplicissimo da imparare e scorre in maniera lineare. 
E' interessante, visto che i bei tempi delle nottate di gioco sono terminati per sempre, la possibilità di giocare con obiettivi diversi a seconda del tempo a disposizione e del numero di giocatori.
La fase di piazzamento, a parte la sensazione di già visto, è tutto sommato interessante per la diversità di opzioni messe a disposizione del giocatore. La fase di predominio è pensata per rendere disagevole il mantenimento del controllo di una fazione: è difficile avere contemporaneamente molte carte e un alto punteggio.
Il bilanciamento è garantito dai giocatori stessi: è facile capire chi sta tentando di scappare, ed è facile mettergli i bastoni tra le ruote. Questa facilità, unita a scenari che comprendono ad esempio la tessera Tribuno (difficile da ottenere) come obbligatoria, rischiano di far trascinare il gioco per le lunghe.
A qualcuno Tribunus puzzerà troppo di astratto, a qualcun altro sembrerà un gioco di carte travestito da boardgame. Inoltre, non è innovativo nelle meccaniche e lascia quella sensazione che "manchi qualcosa". Non ti viene da proporre come prima scelta per una serata, ma tutto sommato un gioco carino e longevo che supera la sufficienza.

I had read the comments about this finishing quickly and after playing it I know what people mean.  This is not a game to slowly build up resources to achieve victory, an all out rush to the finish is required.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  We all enjoyed the game although there was some talk afterwards questioning its replay value.

This worker placement game feels a lot different from other games in that genre, as it's all about trying to get a bunch of different number-value cards of a color that's useful to you.  There's like 5-6 different ways to get your hands on the various cards, and at different times everyone will be after different quantities of cards of different colors.  The game also has variable victory conditions, but I'm not sure how I feel about those yet.

Herr Schmiel does it again. Being an unabashed Die Macher fanboy I was really looking forward to Tribune. 

The Die Macher lineage is very clear: A lot of phases to a turn and several levels of influence manipulation being prominent similarities. The game seem confusing with all special spaces, actions and phases, but as the game progresses you will get into the flow of the game very quickly.

The mechanism with bonuses for both the actual take-over of a faction as well as controlling it, makes for a very dynamic game where shifts in the power structure is frequent.

It feels like a pretty tight (=unforgiving) game. We played a four player medium long game and three of us achieved the victory conditions on turn five and all three of us could pinpoint that one mismanaged turn in the game where we dropped the ball momentarily.

I'm very satisfied with Tribune. It scratches (but not fully soothes =) that Die Macher itch, but is more streamlined and with at more reasonable playing time. 

Good rules and parakeetis worthy bits are a plus too.

Solid game. Pleasantly light, yet there's plenty to do, and much to think about. Worker placement and set collection, but interactive and aggressive: collecting the stuff you need to win, means taking some away from your fellow players. I like how you can choose which set of victory conditions to use, and therefore how long a game you want to play.

There isn't much 'soul' or 'story' in the game, however. You collect stuff until someone has collected enough stuff to win. Choosing the which, the where, the how and the when IS rather interesting, but in the end it feels a bit lacking. So Tribune is maybe not a top game, but still recommended if you like a big, but not heavy, game.

RATING: 6
Sadly I'm not a Roman fanatic (yet), so much like the aerial shot of Rome, I'm disconnected from what is going on in the metropolis. 

I bought the game mainly due to the refreshing 'first to meet menu conditions' instead of the tiresome most vp calculating involved with most (Euro)games. Also I found the worker placement mechanism a tense affair.

Turns out the worker placement is mainly a means to draft cards in various ways to collect people with numerical values or to occupy a spot to reveal and takeover someones hold on one of the 7 factions populating Rome. It is the taking over and seizing control which bestow the 'ingredients' (i.e. laurels, legions, scroll etc) to satisfy 3 or more conditions on a VP card.

There are various rule hurdles regarding the drafting, which become clearer each round, but still a bugger to teach. I can relate to the drafting as I can see I'm sending out my 'people' out to attract the varying factions influence, be it in the forum or latrine. But all this is the lead up to the heart of Rome: the take overs and consequent benefits. And this is where for me the disconnect from theme begins. The term 'take over, is 20th century to me; gladiators are cards which collect money from the stadium or assassinate a displayed card (not fighting animals/men in an arena); the legions are abstracted to a token (not a mass of fighting men on a march). My lack of fandom means I don't get a kick from converting a scroll to a Tribune by controlling two adjacent factions (Vestal virgins and Senators being next to each). The cards are dark, the personality of the leaders in each faction are only different in text. At the end of each round a chariot is auctioned off to the highest bid to place on a faction prevent a takeover in the next round. Again my lack of Ancient history knowledge couldn't narrate this aspect into any sense.

With recent playing of Trajan, with its beautiful bright board and more importantly the vista of Rome, its surrounding ports and over the Alps to Britannia I got a better feel of the pulse of Rome and its life, so it made it easier to let go of Tribune. 

(I've been through this experience before with Knizias Confrontation and his magnus opus co-op Lord of the Rings. Despite reading the Trilogy and seeing the movies, you have to be a fanatic to enjoy the detail of the boardgame which excluded me and hence its rich narrative was lost on me, so I preferred the overview feel of Confrontation. But I have no need for fabricated mythology so even the little brother had to go).

Tribune didn't wow me but I like the options to play different length games and play for different win conditions. It's a good game in the worker placement genre that doesn't run too long and has some unique mechanics.

Edit: Dropped my rating drastically after playing a game where once player got to an early insurmountable lead and won on turn 3. The money victory condition is broken (no risk--just place on coin bowl several times) and there is far too much luck in the cards. There are too many factions to make competition meaningful. I could go on but...Tribune is not worth the effort.

It makes an interesting comparison to Power Struggle, one of my favourites of last year. Lots of similarities: achieving a certain number from a menu of victory conditions; taking over factions which confer special benefits; multi-phase turns with the core being several rounds of single actions. But instead of area control as the mechanism for takeovers, Tribune uses set collection which gives it quite a different feel. Like Power Struggle, the second play was much more rewarding than the first as it was possible to drive towards certain victory conditions from the start rather than floundering with the mechanics. And like Power Struggle again, it's all over much faster than you first expect, meaning every action is vital.

My main complaint is that the theme is much less helpful in learning the game than Power Struggle's. While things 'make sense' in PS because most of us are familiar with offices, in Tribune the theme might make sense for scholars of Rome, but I am not one! I also think the game is a bit overproduced. If you can only gain and never spend tokens like legions, they're probably better tracked on the board so you can easily see how others are doing, like the victory tracks in Power Struggle.

Chaos.  Kitchen sink mechanic design.......throw in mechanics of all sorts trying to make a game based on the designers reputation it seems.  The flow of the game could be much better explained on the board, or cards or something.  

We spent three hours playing one game.  Of the six of us, four of us got the fifth victory condition on the last turn.  Using the tie breaker, two ended up with 34 points, one with 32 points.  Really made me wonder why I wasted my time playing it.

Several subgames which make for a pleasing whole. 
Lots going on during a turn and you must evaluate what you have versus what you see other players are doing.
Action point - place you meeple mechanism which is divided between money, card collection and faction control;
A set collection to gain control of factions, which make number of cards equally important to the values of the cards.
Differing ways to collect cards, fixed price, trading, bidding....
A bidding mechanism to lock down a faction for your control or to deny one to an opponent.

Like how there are differing victory conditions for the number of players and in each set a player can choose which conditions he will pursue.

The board, cards and meeples are enticing (FFG edition).

Yet another worker placement/role selection game. At least it doesn't have a economic engine mechanic attached to it.

Instead of ubiquitous wooden cubes, you're trying to collect cards from a deck of seven suits. With those cards you get various things with which you satisfy objectives to win the game.

Cons:
* As with all worker placement games, there are usually lots and lots of rules, a different rule for each worker. And with almost all worker placement games, the Roman theme is totally pasted on this one, which makes it more difficult to absorb the rules. I actually fell asleep during the rules explanation (but I'm very good at falling asleep in a sitting position).

* I thought that the lack of some economic engine mechanic was a good thing. In this game, you're collecting groups of cards of the same suit. If you have a lot of cards of one group, you can control its associated faction. Each faction gives you a special power. What's also nice is that it's relatively easy to take control of someone else's faction -- which is also a problem; it is too easy to take it. Because of this, the game is very tactical.

Consequently, the game is about opportunism, not about attacking players who are in the lead. Like so many other worker placement games, you're rewarded by finding the path of least resistance, by pursuing a strategy no one else is. So you pursue those factions that no one else cares much about or are weakly controlled, or those factions that happen to be in your hand of cards. You don't bother making long-term, strategic plans because you really can't. The selection of available faction cards totally changes every game turn.

A slightly curious but enjoyable game. The rules-complexity is a bit too high to make it a family game, but it has some explicit randomness which may turn off the hard-core gamers.

The taking of actions mainly serves to warn you what other players are up to. Lots of wheels spinning, but some are mainly making smoke I think, still good fun for an hour.

Only marginally more interesting than Agricola. The mechanisms are interesting in themselves, but do not add much in the way of fun. This is just another (German) game that's all about mechanics. (Knizia comes to mind...)

An enjoyable set-collection card game lavishly dressed up with a board, lots of chits, meeples, and a cardboard chariot. Uses a worker placement mechanism, which offers a lot of hard decisions. Seems daunting but the play is actually pretty simple. The choose-your-own victory conditions offer players more choices and the race to meet them is tense and fun.

After first play I really liked it. I was taught by a couple of experienced players who warned me of the sudden victory situations so we all kept our eyes on each other. When the end came it was expected but hard to avoid, so attacking the leader was not as easy as one would think. This is a fine game and plays much different than your typical worker placement e.g. Pillars of the Earth or Stone Age. Plays faster and requires more planning than either of these.

Unplayed but I'm familiar enough with the rules and game play to know this one will work for me. Great components, a solid history theme (even if the designer played pretty loose w/historical accuracy, there's no doubt that the game is set in a particular time period and an attractive one, at that). An FFG Holiday Sale purchase that will NOT be regretted.

--Jul2008-- Needs more plays; but at first glance it's a fine system.  I'm still not quite sure how much randomness is caused by the initial card draw - but it seems naively that there's quite a strong ordering among the various Factions: some are far more valuable in the first turn than others.
--Aug2008-- 3p experience is very different than the 5p.  I now need to try with 4!
--Aug2008-- I think I prefer the larger player counts: 5p>4p>3p.

Im a fan of worker placement games as long as there is room to adjust for mistakes or direct player opposition.
Tribune is just such a game.   As with most worker placement games there is a lot to do each round, and I enjoy the fact that you need to watch your opponenents developing tactics in order to not waste your own efforts.

I like the theme and the slightly overproduced bits...  This is a game that (unlike Agricola) I don't have to be "in-the-mood-for" in order to agree to playing it.

上周第一次玩了Tribune。因为是我教的游戏，最深的体会就是元素太多，以至于在教学的时候我还要不断的翻说明书，当然这不仅是元素多的问题，游戏中细规则太多，而且在版图中又不能完全体现。这个是我对他最大的意见。
游戏性来说，还是不错的。结合了手牌控制，拍卖跟工人放置，不但可以互卡，而且可以直接攻击。但又不太会被群殴。这一点我相当满意。
任务卡感觉有点假，玩起来都差不多，意义不是很大。上次连开两局感觉还不错，不知道多玩几局会不会腻。
另外，盒子的尺寸比一般正方形偏大，可能会因为这一点把他出掉..

RATING: 6
One of the better implementations of this system to date. Quite simple and more enjoyable than Caylus, Pillars of the Earth, Stone Age, Mastro Leonardo... and so many of the others in the current craze of worker placement games. It comes in at a fully packed hour of playing - and usually not more than an hour. I especially like the victory objectives instead of the overused straight out victory points for the win. You can be creative and mix these up for slightly different games. In addition to calculating, taking risks, going with different strategies, it's also imbued with  fun and flavour. Nice!

My only caveat is that you'll want to invest in the longer game because it helps negate the luck of the starting player turn order with games involving more than three players. It's worth the extra time investment in my opinion, but only because I'm enjoying the game. Tribune always just feels too short really, with some games only lasting three turns.

It strikes me that just like I've found with Age of Empires III this game is a lot better with three players than with more.

Gone up a rating point for me if only because of my desire to bring it out and play again.

RATING: 6
Using the worker placement mechanism to obtain sets of cards wasn't a bad idea, but something didn't quite work at the end.  Perhaps it is a very huge machine for so little task, or just that the game feels repetitive after a while.  Maybe the first is the cause of the later, or both feed each other..

I had this on my shelf for about two years before I finally got around to playing it... Wow! Why didn't I play this earlier? Quite possibly my favorite worker-placement game!

Only downside: the rules aren't as simple as, say, [b]Pillars Of The Earth[/b] or [b]Stone Age[/b] as far as worker-placement games go and therefore more difficult to bring in new players, but I found the experience that [b]Tribune[/b] offers to be more enriching due to the myriad ways of achieving victory points, giving the player many different paths of strategy - no two games are alike.

Highly recommended!

Worker placement with conflict based on set-collection. Got super-confused while scanning the rules, because of the varied functions of all of the different spots. Still confusing while you're taught, but it's easier to grasp it after one round of play...after you realize you're screwed beyond salvage. I wish the game were more forgiving and less steep at the start (so newbies can get hooked), and there's a board to track how many victory conditions each player has, since my short-term memory is already overloaded with tracking what cards people take, and the game overwhelms you with the victory conditions. Other than that, I like this, since it's a Euro with plenty of interaction.

Other worker-placement games derive their strategic crux from the managing of resources and their conversion to VPs. Tribune is hard because the resources (cards) are simple, and you're managing your end-game conditions instead. Complete pain in the ass to keep track of other people's end-game conditions. Components could have done a better job here.

[1 play] I think there is a very good game here, although I did not play sharp in the learning game. It reminds me in theme and also somewhat in gameplay of Caesar and Cleopatra. It also has a set collection showdown element like Condottiere, and also some worker placement angst.

Relatively easy to grok after a round or two, I suspect the best way to teach might not be an in depth rules explanation, but a practice round or two, and then reset for the real thing. Still too complicated for family style gaming though, which Condottiere is not.

I will likely raise my rating after I get the chance to try it again.

Most recent play 6-5-09 with Corey, Donovan, and Michael.

Karl-Heinze Schmiele is back...and this one's not a bad one. Has a slew of mechanics - players use meeples to draft actions (usually cards). Cards are then used in clever melds to take over factions (which in turn bestow special abilities for the controller). There are various scenario cards that determines victory conditions.

Good presentation and components. One of the better and more flavourful games of this ilk though I wish there could be more playing hosing. Also, one can't help but feel that a strong initial hand gives an unfair advantage to a player.

Tribune effectively mixes a lot of game mechanics and does so in a successful and enjoyable way.  With worker placement a lot like Caylus, a card collection mechanism in the realm of Ticket to Ride, and multiple paths to victory similar to Agricola, it actually harnesses a lot of those games' fun.  Add in a Roman theme that I really enjoy, I find this game to be a winner.

Hm, my GB ratings indicate I should get this. GBs=7.37/7.31/8.50

Update: finally got to play my copy and enjoyed it quite a bit. Nice mix of worker placement and set collection to earn the components of victory, plus some auction action.

Initially difficult to learn/teach just from the rulebook. It's not complex, per se, but you sort of have to go through the entire thing to understand what you're trying to accomplish. For example, during setup, each player is dealt 6 cards and must discard 2, but you really don't know what to keep/discard until you've gone through a whole round of play.

Once you get over that hump, though, the game plays rather smoothly. I think everyone enjoyed it and I believe I'll be keeping this game. I also got the expansion in the same trade, and just glancing at that looks like it takes it to another level, as it were, so looking forward to that.

RATING: 7.5
There is absolutely nothing here that is new or original.  It lifts control of factions from Crazy Chicken, and runs on the whole worker's placement thing.  It is essentially: Pillars without the artificial engine system or turn order nonsense, or Stone Age without the rand-o die rolling.  What is particularly strange is that this slots right into the second wave of Worker Placement, but doesn't feel much like the first wave, which would be better described as action drafting: Way out West, Byzantium, or Age of Steam with Caylus as the bridge.

That said, much like Kramer's derivative Hazienda, that fact that it is not breaking any new ground doesn't prevent it from being a fine game. In fact, similarly, I believe that in many ways this game is better than the source material. It is a very clean system with no nonsense.  The game has luck in what cards are drawn, but there is just so much that you as a player can do, that while luck can be an issue, doesn't seem to be any deterrent toward accomplish some sort of goal.  If you are relying on certain card types to come out you may find yourself in trouble.

I found it quite engaging, and will gladly get this on the table again whenever merited.

Reminds me much of Caylus, although I think that Caylus is a better and deeper game.  I think the mechanics of how much you pay in Caylus are better; there's primarily fixed costs or the luck of the draw with some face-down cards in this one, rather than an escalating scale.  We played a version where one victory condition was obligatory, which caused some difficult contention.  I'd like to play where all the victory conditions are available.  It's a quality game, although I wouldn't say that it's amazing.  Perhaps more plays will reveal it to be a better game.

UPDATE: Finally got the back to the table again, and a 7 is just about right.  It's a good game, but nothing spectacular.  Having all the victory conditions available did make the game blissfully more open.

UPDATE #2: The various ways the cards are allocated makes for some interesting mechanics, but there still is a bit too much randomness and length here to really elevate this to the upper echelon.

Did not enjoy enough.

I feel this game is too much governed by luck: Not getting the right cards for you on the board, not being the start player for most of the game, not getting to the 'better' cards before other players.

Maybe the issue is that I still don't see the entire flow of action-reaction, or maybe that most of them will happen anyway - getting laurels and legions just happens as you progress through the houses.

RATING: 6.5
Another game of deploying meeples to collect resources -- this time, cards of different colors and strengths, or money -- which you use to acquire the stuff you need to win the game (control of factions, legions, laurels, various tiles). Difficulty scales by requiring increasing numbers of these conditions. The basic game, which requires only 4 of the 6 conditions, was interesting but played way too quickly -- it was over at the end of the third round! Apparently based on good card draws (and good play, of course), one player was able to win without any difficulty. 

Need to try it with more advanced rules.

Played once so far and had a great time, save for a few strategic blunders.  This is the type of game I can see playing over and over again without it growing stale.

RATING: 7
This is a set collection game with some worker placement elements.  Each round a number of cards come out across a bunch of different spaces showing cards of different factions with different number values.  Players then place their workers on these spaces to acquire these cards and each space allows the players to acquire the cards in different ways.  There are also spaces where players can use these cards to take over a faction.  A faction is taken over by playing more cards or higher valued cards than the faction's current owner had played and each faction bestows a different bonus at the end of each round.  The game ends when a player accomplishes a certain number of achievements.

I like this game quite a bit.  The way set collection and take-overs are handled is pretty unique and a lot of fun.  The worker placement also offers interesting decisions since some areas only have one space while others allow players to interact in interesting ways.

However, I think the game falls a bit flat with just 2 players.  There's not enough competition for spaces and players tend to progress at an even pace with just two and the game doesn't have a lot of tension.

It's one of the best games of 2007. The mechanics are not original and the game is a bit abstract. Also the chariots, although very cool, are exaggerated and not necessary at all!
But I think the game is very well balanced and "putted together"! Everything works very well with nice and simple rules. This one was play-tested a lot and it is very well designed and polished. 
A medium euro very well produced. Components are superb.

It's one of the best games released in 2007. The artwork is very beautiful.
Mr. Schmiel doesn't publish that many games but he really has some unique feeling titles. It's not that his games are completely original but they sure have a strong appealing to players. I own too many games and when this happens, when you're picking up a game to play, Mr. Schmiel's games are always a possibility just because they are really good games that when comparing with similar ones by other designers they really seem to show up more like they have more personality sort of speaking. 
Die Macher, A La Carte and Tribune are all part of this class. Games I own and that I would play for the rest of my life.

60/70 minutes

It's easy to play the German edition!

One play. Lived up to my expectations, but my first game was amazingly short. Granted, we played with victory conditions for a short game, but a game of three rounds seems pretty short even then.
All in all, Tribun left a good impression. There are many moving parts and lots of avenues you can take to win. I like that action rather than turtling is rewarded. I think I prefer the victory condition card over the VP variant. That can only lead to AP, as players start counting how they can optimise their scores every turn.

Michael Mindes of Tasty Minstrel Games [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/4013/the-great-and-wise-yogurt-says]posted last week[/url] about branding, and asked readers what their associations were with major publishers like Days of Wonder and Rio Grande Games. Well, Tribune represents perfectly what I have come to associate with Fantasy Flight Games: nice components, but about five hundred counters too many, and worse -- about five hundred game mechanics too many.

I expected to like Tribune a lot and was unpleasantly surprised. As I found with Chaos in the Old World, it feels like a bunch of unrelated ideas got thrown into a blender, then dressed up nicely with a lot of entirely unnecessary chrome.

Nothing about this game is elegant.

Rules and graphic design are excellent thus first impression is very good, game systems are well designed, but after first play there is feeling ends too quickly, and there is too much dependency on cards distribution. With good draw and some leaders in hand player may take lead and win before any other player will hurt him. Weird. After a one more play my opinion is a bit better, but still I'm not sure if this game is good enough.

I don't really know what I thought of this one. Some thoughts include:

I don't think it is a particularly attractive-looking game (especially after playing the aesthetically pleasing Agricola). 

I'm not really enamored of the worker placement sub-genre, and I think Agricola solves part of my problem that Tribune does not, which is the procession of grabbing stuff. In Agricola, you place your guy, and you immediately grab the stuff. Much quicker. I kind of hate waiting for us to go through all the actions after we already placed our guys (reads kinda nitpicky).

Your starting hand and whether people screw with you in the early rounds is huge for success. I can imagine that if we had played to 5 victory conditions instead of 3, the game would have been longer and somewhat more interesting, but I had a MASSIVE lead due to some serious luck, and I think it would have been tough catching me. I just had everything fall my way early, and it seems like those leaders gave me a huge push over the top. They do seem very overpowered.

Also, why is there no option to bid or place a worker for turn order? Going first is HUGE, and early success builds later success, so going first or second (like I did) in the first couple of rounds seems like a big bonus that an extra couple of monies can't overcome. That section that lets you discard for everything in there can be a leaders bonanza, and leaders get you tons of stuff, so going first is super-awesome. I would have to think about adding a variant with a blind-bidding round similar to the chariot round to bid for start player after the cards have been laid out.

Still, with all this harshness, there are some cool aspects to the game. The hand management is kind of fun, and I could see it leading to some big plays with huge swings on victory conditions (part of why the long game would be most fun). The different victory conditions seem interesting and on first glance seem somewhat balanced, so that is a plus. Even with the long game, I bet it is only 90 minutes.

So, kind of a mixed bag on the first play, but I'd play again to see if my rating improves

Some theme play.  Game is very easy to learn and play, although it may take a couple of plays to pick-up strategies.  Play is OK with some tense moments.  No new mechanics, but meshs many mechanics together well.  Components are good - mounted board, thick chits, fairly durable cards with fair artwork.  Rulebook in color and well written.  Game time is short at about 1 hour and feels quick.

Nice components for a card game on steroids. The hand of Karl-Heinz Schmiel is really visible throughout the game but this time he doesn't reach the perfect mechanism of Die Macher, as the game last very few turns and ends before you've started to enjoy in a full way. Must be played again.

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  Overall I felt this was an enjoyable game to learn and play.  It was not a strategy master piece that I felt I should run out and purchase.  I do prefer games that are just a bit deeper and more complex I would say personally.  But it was fun collecting the different sets of cards, and competing to gain control of the different factions.  I especailly like that there are different scenarios for how to win so each game can be a little different.  It plays at a decent pace and has a nice mix of luck and strategy.  I would welcome another chance to play and learn more about this game.

RATING: 7.5
The game has nice blend of mechanics: worker placement, auction bidding, set collection.  The trick seems to be the order in which you collect your sets because one set can make another so much better.  Its a solid game and I would say the theme of Roman power struggle is decently implemented.

Another game I expected to like more than I did. Now, I played it 3-player and have heard that this is not the optimal number of players, but even still I found the game to be a bit lackluster. It was a PRETTY game, with FFG's hilarious penchant for overproduction in strange places, but the actual gameplay felt both overwhelming and undersatisfying. I'm going to give this another try or two before I definitively say whether I think it's overrated or not, since I feel that part of my problem was just a general lack of direction and understanding of the win conditions, but I just didn't feel terribly satisfied with the game, even though I liked some of its aspects.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The multiple conditions needed for victory make the game look to be a build-up game: first you gather the resources to fulfill your first condition, then your second and so on.
But since other players are taking away control of your factions and there is nothing that you can do about it, that approach does not work.
Consequently, victory comes rather randomly to that player who is lucky enough to NOT get screwed by someone else in that particular moment.

played a 5 player and it was all over in 3 rounds, despite a obligatory Tribune. It seemed to be over before it got going. But worth another try.

Second try with 4 players using the Carpe Diem scenario, and it was won in 3 turns again but took a little longer to play, due to players in my group. I thought it was okay, but one other player said that it finished before it got started. This scenario is meant to be the quickest for 4 players and lived up to it.

Feels similar to "Colosseum" by Days of Wonder with worker placement mechanics, except good. There are many paths to victory, which is nice, plus there are secret / hidden parts and some randomness, which I enjoy. The only problems I have with the game is that there is a bit too much randomness, where one person can sweep the game if they get lucky. Another problem I've found is that some "places" for your worker are almost always too good to pass up, which makes the choices in the game too easy for the most part. There are some weird rules with Temporary Favor counting as a win condition, which feels too easy to get, but might not be so bad in the longer version of the game. In the end the game is enjoyable, but not something I'd pull out all the time.

Assign workers to recruit the cards that you use to bid for positions of power. There are several possible ways of gaining victory in any given game, and the special abilities of the various groups to control put a lot of variety into the game while still being easy to manage. Plays very quickly.

Tribune is without a doubt the leanest, meanest worker-placement game available.  But to me, it seems to lack just a bit of fun and that's what I'm looking for in my games these days.  A bit of luck or some crazy swings of fortune just aren't found in Tribune.

This is the "gamer's" worker-placement game.

We played this game once or twice and never again.
Personally, I dislike varying victory conditions already as such but Tribune has not only 2-3 of them but around 6. And different sets of conditions to boot.
For some, that may be actually be interesting, so please check it out.
For me, this mechanic is a huge turn-off.

All in all our games devolved in multiple solitaires big time and quickly and in a way that was no fun at all for us.

Great game with different paths to victory that change every time you play. It's got a nice combination of mechanics that offer players a good amount of choice and decisions. The game offers some player interaction, but for the most part I believe it is more solitary (though auctions, and blind bets do add interaction). I did feel feel that some of the rules may be a bit unbalanced, and could have been better, but overall it was an enjoyable experience, and I wouldn't mind another play.

With a perfect blend of tight manouvering, scarce access to resources, open and hidden information, Tribune offers strategic options and cutthroat gameplay.

With the different scenarios included, it also offers great variety and the option to restrain or prolong play time.

Not enough player interaction to keep my interest. The fact that you really can't defend factions you take over annoys the hell out of me, and makes it feel like I'm playing the game independent of the other players, which is not what I want in a game that is ostensibly about Roman politics. Even taken as an abstract game if just doesn't do much for me.

There is nothing really new in Tribunus, but it's a nice mix of worker placement and card game.
Good news: it's quick, you can actually decide the lenght of the game, scales really well from 2 to 5 players, nice board that drives the gameplay very easily.
Bad news (for someone): there is by far more luck involved in Tribunus that you would suspect after reading the rules. There are countless things you cannot control, and the leaders are strongly overpowered so winning (provinding that all players share a good knowledge of the rules and have similar skills) is a question of luck and diplomacy, more than ability. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
When I first played this I got very excited. I still think this differs enough from all of my other games and is definitely worth having. I recommend it in every collection for that reason.

The reason I don't rate it higher is that it is somewhat exhausting to play. You have to constantly check the victory conditions and try to keep an eye on your opponents as well, so end game doesn't surprise you. You can have everything set for winning and you think you'll win this round and then one of your darn friends takes over a faction from you and you don't fill all victory conditions anymore. 

I generally don't like card games, but I wouldn't call this a card game even though it probably is. But there is a board and there are meeples and there are coins and even a chariot in play, so that's enough to convince me this isn't just a card game. :) Also seeding the cards to the board doesn't seem so boring or fiddly for me as it feels in some other games. 

Cards are unusual size, I had to order special sleeves from Mayday Games. If you get two packs of sleeves (100 each) you have enough to sleeve the expansion too.

Tribune is the fussiest set collection game that I've played besides Colosseum.  The board is funeral and the rules are labrinthine.

The whole darn thing works in spite of itself!

I always love a game themed in ancient Rome (see Colosseum). There are many different paths to victory and many fights over who exactly is the prettiest vestal virgin. The chariot idea is a nice way to reign in the player or ensure you stay in front, sometimes at a great cost. The lavatory is a humorous placement and can sometimes even be worth it. There are plenty of ways to block your opponent which leads to juicy competition and confrontation- both winners in my experience, provided you are playing with the right group of people.

About [thing=30957][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=30957][/thing] is a work placement game mixed with hand management, in which players fight to be the "best among equals" by achieving objectives, like controlling legions, becoming a Tribune, gaining laurels, denarii or the favor of the Gods, or having taken control of roman factions. It has a race aspect: the first to reach a certain number of objectives will be the winner, if none other reach the same threshold by the end of the round.

[thing=30957][/thing] works amazingly well: is a smart design, that presents constant decision-making and offer a richness of options every time. It is also highly interactive, but not agressive - though there are dispute for control of factions and a couple of hidden bids, they are done in such a way that the loser isn't hurt so bad and often can enter in the same dispute again in one or two rounds, if she wants.

The game flow is smooth, with almost no downtime, even when playing with 5, as the options are clear and the execution of everything is quick once all the works were put on the board.

Overall, [thing=30957][/thing] takes the title of "hidden gem", as it is around for 9 years and I never gave two thoughts about it until actually playing it, in spite of being inside the Top 500. Several of the pieces for a great game is here: decision, options, paths to victory, interactivity, tension, dispute, in a whole that is quite easy to teach and to play. A true winner.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
To complete summarized: every player starts with a number of workers. Workers are put, one at a time, in spots on the board - most of them is to get cards, with some more being to take control of factions, one to gain money and one to gain laurels.

Once everyone has put all their workers, the places ion the board are resolved in order: usually is simply a matter to pay money and take cards.

To take control of factions players use sets of cards, be to first take control, or to take-over the control from someone else. To surpass the control of someone, the new set must either contain more cards or the sum of the numbers on the cards must be higher than the previous set. Control of a faction is kept until someone takes it, which means is possible to take the benefit of a given faction for several rounds, if no one else do something about it.

At the end of each round there is a blind auction for the chariot, which the winner can use to block a faction, meaning that in the next round won't be possible to try to take control of it. 

All of this is done with the aim of fulfilling objectives. The number of victory conditions and what is necessary to accomplish them changes accordingly to the number of players and the "mode" (quick, medium or long game) players want to apply. When a player reaches the required amount of objectives, she says "Veni, vidi, vici" and then the current round will be the final one, played until the end. If by the end of the round, no one else reached the required number of objectives, the player that did wins outright. If one or more players also did, everyone that did tally their points, and the person with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
- The main decision is: where to put a worker. While most of the spots give the same thing (cards), the way they work are different: some are cheaper; some can give more cards but demand the discard of a card from hand; other might issue a blind auction; in other you can pay more to pick a card first, or less, but chosing last; one is left to chance: you don't know what you will get, but it is free, and you can decide to not take and get the value of the card in denarii; and so on. also, there are several type of cards, used to take control of certain factions, and each card have a strength number, meaning some will be better than others, but all are useful, as even the most weak help in making a set of cards bigger. Finally, there are the places to gain money, laurel and to take control of factions. Of course, this decision also carries a priority and a timming issue: places are limited, and might not be available on your next turn, so there is a prime necessity in prioritizing.

- The secondary decisions are: wich use to take from a faction, as many of them offer two options; how much to bid for the cards and/or for the chariot; in which set to use the Assassination ability; and a few others.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Surprisingly easy to teach and to play, but with enough depth to keep everyone invested for multiple plays;
- Good production value, with the art of the board being the high point;
- Several decision points and many paths to follow to reach the goals;
- Fine amount of interaction, some destructive, but none that are too mean and crippling.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- The game takes a whole lot of table space;
- No catch up mechanism - just pity;
- The race aspect might put some players off;
- More mechanical than thematic.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
As living as a roman patrician in the high society -  I was enthralled the whole time, constantly thinking about options and tensely checking what the others were up to, otherwise you would get a dagger on the back, at least more metaphorically than literally, by losing the grasp on some factions and having your way to the top blocked by the actions of others.

[thing=30957][/thing] passed completely under the radar for me: I don't remember seeing in lists of "hidden gems" and such, and is in that gray area of the ranking: high enough to be certified as a good game (even if not for you), but easily passed without a second look when one skims by the ranking pages. So I was really surprised when I played and found such a great game so near, in the dust for several years, and one that wouldn't stand much of a chance against the new hotness that often appear at game nights. And, yet, is a head and a shoulder above most of them - almost making the tagline "primus inter pares" completely true.

Very recommended.

There's alot to like about this game, the card drafting system has clarity & nimbleness I find pleasurable and the obstacle course the players create ties an interesting knot. The selection process doesn't burden things with too much programming. Planning is pretty clear and collisions resolved with a blind bid that seemed to work well as one can choose to lynch your strategy on this or not. In other words, success doesn't funnel through a succesful blind bid.

In the end, so close but too clumsy for such a tight, sudden thing.  

The problem is the difficulty (for me) to track where everyone is so I can value my choices in relation to the knot we're creating. By this I mean there is too much information you need to be able to track to make a decision that is tucked away, constantly maintained & adjusted in memory without good mnemonics built into the game board(s). I'm not one who carries all these barely-thematic relationships in my head... I want to see what I need to see so I'm thinking and not remembering. And I don't want to slow the game trying to peer at everyone's card as things shift around. That it is a dynamic game is good, but it needs a central board for everyone's little bits of stuff their collecting to meet victory conditions.

A good idea that misses for me because of the amount of overhead left in the players' lap. and together with rather loose thematic binding, it disengages me.

In ancient Rome, tribunes were highly esteemed individuals elected by the people to represent them politically and militarily. In the board game Tribune: Primus Inter Pares, players take on the role of a powerful and ambitious patrician family. By applying influences and manipulating controls over the various factions, they attempt to pave their way to victory in order to attain the high office of the tribune.
From the mind of the highly acclaimed Die Macher, Karl-Heinz Schmiel, the gameplay in Tribune is a combination of worker placement and set collection. Each round the players take turns by positioning their followers on the board to garner cards, achieve objectives and/or attempt to take over factions. In order to gain control of a faction and to utilize its benefits, one must play a set of cards from that specific group. That person will remain in command of the faction until someone else stages a successful take-over by having another set that is either of higher quantity or higher sum of values.
Victory is achieved when a player has met the required number of objectives as specified on the victory condition card selected at the start of the game, which is dependent on the number of participants. Alternatively, you can choose to forego the use of a condition card and play with the point-value option. In this variant, the game ends when someone has collected a certain number of the faction markers and the winner is the one with the highest scores as determined by the points assigned to each achievement.

I really enjoy this game. I like the worker placement aspect to get more cards than others, but then you can be overtaken back and forth. Has different ways to get VP's and win, I like that. P.S. It is very hard to get a Tribune though...arghh!

This game has the same structure as Pillars of the Earth, but is a lot more confrontational between players.  The number of factions, and the wide difference between their abilities adds a lot of depth to the game.  You will not play ideally on your first play!

The main distinction that this game has over many other well-produced games today is the different winning condition options.  They seem rather similar at first glance, but the subtle differences will affect strategies enough to keep it fresh.

I like this game, but I hoped for something other than what it was. Since it's called Tribune, I hoped that there might be some negotiation in the Roman Senate.  No such luck.  With that said, I still enjoy it.  Components are gorgeous, and the gameplay is really compelling.  Really lots of ways to get to the victory conditions, which is really great.  Have to keep a real close eye on your opponents.  Even though this uses worker placement like seemingly every other game that has come out in a two-year span, I think the variable victory conditions make this different enough to make picking this one up worthwhile.  There's a lot of replayability, between the different victory conditions and the different cards creating different setups for worker placement.  My one gripe is that the Plebian leader that allows you to take a scroll is almost too powerful.  Combined with control of the Patricians, that means you can get a Tribune in a single turn, and that can often mean the difference.  As a consequence, we houserule him to mean that you get a scroll at the end of your turn.  Much more in keeping with the strength of the other leaders.

A fairly typical worker placement/set collection game. Place your workers on the board in various spots, each of which functions slightly differently in how you gain the cards present. Use the cards to take over factions, that and holding them from turn to turn provide benefits in various categories. There are differing "score cards" you randomly select for each game, so the categories vary, as well as the number of them you need to satisfy to win.

I enjoyed the game, but it struck me as a little bit short. In just a few rounds, folks were already getting close to winning. These rounds took a while, so it wasn't too short timewise, just gamewise. This meant that if you made a mistake or two, you were pretty much out of the game.

In ancient Rome, tribunes were highly esteemed individuals elected by the people to represent them politically and militarily. In the board game Tribune: Primus Inter Pares, players take on the role of a powerful and ambitious patrician family. By applying influences and manipulating controls over the various factions, they attempt to pave their way to victory in order to attain the high office of the tribune.
\13\\13\
The gameplay in Tribune is a combination of worker placement and set collection. Each round the players take turns by positioning their followers on the board to garner cards, achieve objectives and/or attempt to take over factions. In order to gain control of a faction and to utilize its benefits, one must play a set of cards from that specific group. That person will remain in command of the faction until someone else stages a successful take-over by having another set that is either of higher quantity or higher sum of values. Victory is achieved when a player has met the required number of objectives as specified on the victory condition card selected at the start of the game, which is dependent on the number of participants. Alternatively, you can choose to forego the use of a condition card and play with the point-value option. In this variant, the game ends when someone has collected a certain number of the faction markers and the winner is the one with the highest scores as determined by the points assigned to each achievement.
\13\\13\
Note: Tribune Expansion is stored in the base game box and is requires to play with 6 players. Also the 6th player plays with different rules than the rest of the players

In [i]Tribune[/i], you lead a family during Roman times and are trying to do something Roman-like in order to score points. While I’ve tried to build up enthusiasm for the theme, it's a tough challenge as the Roman setting washes away more easily than a henna tattoo.

That doesn't mean I don't like the game, mind you. [i]Tribune[/i] is a mildly tricky worker-placement, set-collection game that takes a few plays to figure out how to piece together a game plan. When playing against inexperienced opponents, you'll crush them; when playing against those who know the game, ah, that's when the real fun begins.

Definitely overproduced, and the box/board size is obnoxious.  Oddly wasteful of cards, as well (there are 36 "reference" cards, when only 8 are needed; or, put another way, there could be 28 more unique victory condition cards, or a whole new faction or two...).

The quickness of the game is interesting, as it ups the ante on every draft choice, which is good (less "well, I'll wait until later").  OTOH, it can raise the luck/chaos level.  Pick your poison, I guess.

Interesting worker placement to set collection to mission completion game.  Worker placement,  with lots of resolution phases.

Having played thrice now, it's fast becoming one of my favourites utilising the Caylus worker placement mechanic. Although in saying that, it's quite a different beast being more a set collection game from the 7 different card sets in the draw deck. If you're new to Tribune, I would make the one comment of being very aware how players are progressing in achieving their victory conditions, and also be prepared to voice that or work hard to stop players controlling certain factions to break their possible condition win. A game can happen very quickly (3-4 rounds) so you must be effecient in your play.
To sum up. So far I think this is a wonderfully honed game. With no excess fat. But enough meat and finished in 90 mins it's definitely going to stay in my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Downgraded from a 6 to a 4.5.

I don't often complain that a game is too short, but Tribune is over in such a brief amount of time (often lasting only 4 to 5 turns) that small amounts of good/bad fortune are magnified to the extent that luck has far more impact than strategic play.

Sources of luck include the following: a player's starting hand; the cards available on the board when it is a player's turn to place workers first; whether any single player is allowed to control a faction for multiple rounds; turn order for each round; and seat position (the game may end so quickly that players to the right of the starting player may never get the chance to place workers first).

In addition, each player has so few actions and so few rounds to use them that the tiniest loss of momentum is deadly.  I remain convinced, for instance, that a player who loses a challenger-vs-challenger battle for control of a faction is guaranteed not to win the game.

Played once (with 5 players). An interesting card-based game with several nice ideas. It is shorter than it looks at first, and you should ideally pay close attention to what the other players do (which should be easier with fewer players). A possible concern could be the leaders, which have powerful effects, yet require no special effort to get.

Like Die Macher here is many different yet simple sub-games (bread and circuses anyone?) strung in long sequences with multiple directions in strategy to be applied to how they roll up to the larger game. Also controlling the factions is fun in an almost Cosmic Encounter sort of way. Once again Karl-Heinz Schmiel shows himself to be a master at intertwining card and auction mechanics to create so much more than the sum of their parts. Wonderful. But do watch out for a sudden win by a player if you don't pay attention and target them appropriately.

oh and remember that like opinion polls in die Macher the only thing random about the cards is the order in which they come out (i.e. by the time deck has gone through an even mix of cards will have come out) Given that most are obtainable with worker placement to the observant eye this isn't chaotic at all (as unlike Ticket to Ride the deck is small enough for it to really balance)

and I disagree with the majority of BGGers as the two player version of the game is surprisingly good (again due to the predictability of the deck)

7 after 2 plays

Various ways of scoring feels pasted together and not very connected, nor thematical. Some game components seem over-produced, e.g. the chariot seems unnecessary and there are two of them. There is some player interaction, though mostly indirect. It is doubtful whether the game is scalable, particularly with fewer players.

There is a lot going on here, but like many I feel like the game is a bit too short.  I really need to try the long version of the goals eventually.

At its heart Tribune is a set collection game.  By gathering cards representing the different factions, you can eventually come to control them if you can beat the current owner's influence by having either higher quantity or value of their respective cards.  There are a total of 5 victory conditions, but you only have to achieve 4 to win, and apparently there are others depending on how long you want the game time to be.

I like the different ways you can place your meeples to obtain more cards, as well as the mechanics in which one can take control of the various factions.  However, Tribune isn't without flaws.  For one, I thought money was too easily obtained.  Don't have enough to pay for that card you wanted?  Do you need more to compete in that upcoming auction?  Go ahead and claim what you need first then place a meeple or two in the collection dish for 5 coins each.  Since acquiring money is resolved first, you can repeatedly go for stuff you can't afford and use your remaining action on getting the gold to pay for them.  Frankly, I think that cheapens the need for good resource management.  The other thing I didn't appreciate is the blind bidding.  I'm just not a fan of the mechanic and there are two fairly important auctions that utilize this.

Even so, Tribune was one of the better games I got to play at BGG.con, and I look forward to trying it again.

Update #1: Revisiting Tribune more than a year after my first play.  I dropped my initial rating by a point.  While the game goes much faster now with familiarity, the flow just seem more of the same.  I am in agreement with the comment that the initial draw is incredibly deterministic in how well you will do for the rest of the game, especially if you use the scenario where obtaining a Tribune is a requirement.  It's still decent but I'm pretty bored by it now.

An excellent worker placement game with a great unique game-end and scoring mechanism.  Every spot on the board works in a different way.

Initial impression: very good game, nothing really new but recycles a lot of very good elements to something refreshing new. The game offers a fast pace because of it's very good design and intuitive setup or layout. The different options to score the necessary victory point ensure a different game for each player and of course for each session. The core of the game is "only" a card game but believe me, you'll need some space and also the board. Components and graphics are top notch. This combined with the medium (to high) complexity with fast playing time makes it a great game. Highly recommended.

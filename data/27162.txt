As usual, the only "interaction" comes through placing workers on the board, making those spots unavailable for others. I really really don't like multiplayer singleplayer boardgames.
They are almost always strictly worse than what their PC version would be.
That said, for what it is the game plays alright. Lots of strategies and variations are possible.

A decent game that cleverly uses dierolls as worker placement.  Some people complain that they get screwed by what they roll, but for the most part the small value spots are just as good as the big ones provided you can get into them.  My only real quibble is that some building tracks are much more useful than others, so most of my games are virtually identical.  The queen is disproportionately powerful, and game-breaking.

Fun-ish, easy to learn game, with great art. The "advisors" are all generic though, and I had a bit of trouble determining what exactly was happening when I got some wood and stone from a dude with a weird outfit. Lots of choices to make, but very little downtime. You roll dice to determine what kind of stuff you can get on your turn, but you have a lot of choice in what kind of sets you make with your dice.

RATING: 7
A clever dice based game that benefits from repeated play. The first time or two might be a bit overwhelming (and long), as you have to learn a ton of characters and building powers. But once you know enough to go in with some strategies, I think the playtime would decrease significantly. I think there are a few paths to victory, and some interesting ways to mitigate against the luck of the dice. That being said, you can still get screwed, so don't play if you can't handle it when the dice roll poorly.

An early, and light dice-rolling worker-placement game in the same genre as To Court a King, Alea Iacta Est, Troyes, Alien Frontiers, Castles of Burgundy, Pirates of Nassau, and La Venise Du Nord. Kingsburg predates all except To Court a King, and is a pretty succinct, accessible design with great artwork. There's nothing particularly deep here - simple engine building really, with a heavy dose of luck and blocking involved - but it is fun, and a lot easier to explain and pick up than the brilliant, heavy, Troyes.

LIKE: Fun dice placement mechanism, where you can split up your dice and block other players.
DISLIKE: Low replayability. Play the game enough and the winning strategies become common and repetitive, but there is enough there for quite a few plays. Bad dice rolls can be frustrating.

OVERALL: Even with the expansion I feel the boards need to differentiate more to force new strategies. Fun game, wish it played just a tad quicker.

I really like the dice placement mechanic and lovely board and components, but the rest of the game isn't very challenging nor interesting. The buildings - there are some fairly obvious choices. The catch-up mechanics - aren't sufficient after a player gains the best buildings. The monsters - miss one nasty one and you're pretty much sunk which gives a runaway leader feeling. The sum of it was it had no place in my collection.

Curioso juego de gestión de dados + gestión de recursos que consigues con ellos y puedes construir edificios que dan mejoras especiales al juego. Influye en cierta medida la suerte como es lógico, pero sobretodo las decisiones de que casillas caer para conseguir según que recursos, para combinarlos y poder construir o pillar soldados para defenderse de los ataques bárbaros al final de cada año, que se divide en 4 turnos/estaciones. Es entretenido, y fácil de jugar y enseñar. Un 10 para los tipo juegos familiares. Ahora, el juego es caro para lo que tiene, que si me apuras se podría hacer el juego en P&P. Versión alemana con tableros tradumaquetados.

A fun, slightly more weightier than normal gateway game - certainly as regards the amount of rules.  I like the die rolling mechanic which limits rather than decides the game. I like the invading hordes at the end of each year, which seems like a Stephan Feld-type idea. I would have liked them to have slightly more teeth, though. It's also got elements that will remind you of Caylus and several other worker placement games.  Perhaps it's slighlty too long for a filler, which seems a shame as it may be even better if it was quicker - but perhaps one could limit time for each decision with a chess clock - maybe not on the first game as there's a lot to learn, but after that.  In this respect and a few others, it reminded me a little of Tribune.

The expansion looks very worthwhile.

*Rating based on one play.

This game makes pretty good use of dice as "workers" in a worker-placement style game.  It feels like a better game than Alien Frontiers, which uses a similar mechanic.  In Alien Frontiers, you literally cannot plan out your turn before play passes back to you because you have no idea what you will roll.  In this game, you can plan out your moves ahead of time (at least, as much as you can in any worker placement game).  I would also say this game reminds me of Castles of Burgundy, though it's been so long since I've played Burgundy that I can't say which I would prefer of the two.

+Straightforward gameplay that doesn't overstay its welcome.
+Solid component quality and artwork.
+Good level of strategic and tactical play.
+Multiple paths to victory.

-Rolling low is generally worse than rolling high. I prefer dice games where roll outcomes aren't necessarily better or worse, just different.
-Theme is fairly pasted on and not particularly engaging.

RATING: 8.35
A light and enjoyable resource-collection and building game, with a light fantasy theme.  

Personally, I think this is a better game with the expansion, which at least allows for the pursuit of strategies that have a better chance of defeating the embassy strategy (see my comments to the expansion below).

Very tight game in terms of victory points, which means over-investment in defensive buildings may not be a winning strategy.  The risk-reward trade-off of neglecting defense and going for building strategies which yield more victory points is a nice touch.  I've had a couple of unfortunate run-ins with barbarians in the late game which caused me to lose the game because I had neglected a bit on defense.  

New printing available with worse art, but which comes with all the expansion modules out of the box.

Very good game overall. Looks much more intimidating then it plays. Can run a little longer then one would like but there are ways you can adjust the overall game time with how many monsters you face. I haven't played with the expansion but I have been told by a few sources that it makes the game even more fun and it is highly recommended. I enjoy the options one has with how to spend the die rolls, you can spread them apart, spend a few together or spend them all on one action. that along with the special abilities (buildings) you can purchase really make this game sing.  if you don't like the fantasy theme check out Kingsport Festival. it is cthulu based for you horror nuts ;)

RATING: 6
Good dice game.  The mechanisms (dice placement, resource gathering, building construction) combine to make a good dice-based game.  Two criticisms.  One, low dice rolls will  have a significant effect on outcome/VPs.  Yes, this often arises with dice-based games.  However, I feel it is particularly true with Kingsburg as there is little-to-no catch up mechanism.  Two, the building construction does not make for many interesting choices.  I get the feeling that there is a certain building progression at work.  Plus, there's a good chance that of the 10-15 buildings everyone constructs, a good number of them will be common across the board.  There is little differentiation.

A fun game?  Certainly!  Interesting choices?  Occasionally.  The building angle?  Well done but no scarcity or direct player interaction via or involving buildings.  Player interaction is *only* via dice placement.

I would definitely play this one again, but I doubt I'll pick it up (unless it's on sale and marked way down, of course).

ADDENDUM (01 July 2013):  Friend of mine gave me this and the expansion.  Expansion fixes the biggest problems and provides a TON of replay value.  The expansion makes this a good game.  My rating of the base game reflects just the base game.

[With To Forge a Realm]

The base game's a little too simple, but overall this is the most interesting I've found "worker placement" (Dominant Species is a wargame that happens to use WP of a kind).

However, there is a problem: the pure base game makes military too luckish, and the chance of losing a battle is high even with prep, unless you give up too much effort to military (which means a lucky opponent can beat you just by taking a risk).  The expansion ramps up the power level of the player (via governor powers and the planning ability of the military tokens) to the point you are unlikely to lose, however.  Is there a sweet spot?  If not, the game ends up not being very enjoyable.

Also, even with the expansion the buildings are a little too much "same old same old."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game, my only wish was that it were shorter.  This is not at all a dicefest, its a drafting mechanic where those who roll less have less drafting power but get to go first, with the result that most rolls in the 8-13 are approximately even in value.  Only very very low rolls or very high rolls are weaker/stronger than average, and even then, not by a whole lot usually.  Tactics/die placement and building choice tends to matter more than the size of your die rolls.  There is some luck but not more than your average middleweight game, imo.

I like playing with the monster-die variant to make mosnters more difficult (because they seem extremely easy with the base rules).  Roll two diece, subtract the lower from the higher and thats how many soldiers you all get.  (Alternately, giving people chips with numbers 0,1,1,2,3,4 and they get to place one per round for how much they personally get, with the extra one being points at game end).

A good, but not great game. The main problem with this game is not the dice (which can be frustrating, but generally balances out), but the length. It was too much of doing the same thing over and over, as the buildings do not have a large impact on future turns.

There's also too much administrative overhead. It felt a lot like my turn, your turn, the game's turn,...

I am guaranteed to roll 3 ones at some point in this game.

It's a game where your rolls on 3 dice translate into control of one or more people in the king's court. These people then give you resources or special powers to both build victory point earning buildings and also defend your investments from enemy attack.

The expansion is enjoyable too, but not essential to enjoy this,.

I think that Kingsburg is a fantastic worker placement game that in my mind is better than Puerto Rico and Caylus. The reason it's so good is that you simply place your dice on what you want and then collect it to purchase a building on your own player mat. It's easy to become familiar with the different buildings as they are always in front of you, and it's a direct means of collecting abilities and victory points. For many worker placement games, there's a bunch of extra steps involved (building plantation, shipping goods, etc.) that can be fiddly and cumbersome. Kingsburg is also very suitable for new gamers as a gateway game as it introduces the worker placement genre in an easy going, accessible way. 

The only negative that I see is Kingburg might turn into San Juan, where the quickest path to victory is building certain buildings in relative order (such as the Inn row where you eventually get an extra dice) and then the Crane (build higher level buildings for one less gold). We shall see - we've only played one vanilla game so far. We did play again with the expansion pack, which I felt diminished the elegant simplicity of the game.

This game was recommanded to me by a friend, however, I didn't like it at first, but after a few games, I've come to appreciate the game. My main disapointement was that there was no end of game scorring, so you're really still working your score up. Someone suggested a variant where you keep the score hidden until the end, and I would think that it would help me appreciate even more the game, but even as it is, it's an excellent game. I've shown it to a couple of people by now and it has always been well received.

Works well as a lighter strategy game or a family game. The die roll/influence mechanic is fairly easy to grasp. The building phase offers some interesting choices while the fight the monster portion of the game at the end of each turn adds just a bit of necessary tension. Can play just a bit long with a full compliment of players but otherwise I really enjoy this one. Looking forward to the expansion.

A very fun Eurogame, but it has DICE!  Very strange for a Euro, but very fun and unique way to choose your action for the turn.  I think this game will have a decent amount of replayability.  The only complaint I have is that the combat at the end of each year is very VERY luck based.  You normally have between 2-6 defense on your own, and you all gain 1d6 for defending.  This means that half of your position in combat is complete luck, which makes the combat feel out of place in this otherwise elegant game.

2-5(4)

Okay, so it's reasonably fun. Not all that fiddly, and gets pretty intuitive. The first few plays the intuition is to grab the most valuable advisor. After several plays, I think, strategies emerge as far as splitting your dice up and, especially, blocking and such. Some building rows are much more useful that others, it seems, or, at least, much easier to use effectively. E.g., I can't imagine rolling nine or lower enough to make many points off of the University (as opposed to the Embassy or whatever). Maybe I haven't delved into it quite enough.

The press-your-luck battles can be crucial, as far as devastating your resources or buildings if you undercommit or being worth just paltry points, if you overcommit. It's one quibble I've got.

The expansion, though, is great for expanding the building options, adding some variability to the sessions (and the players' tableaus) etc. etc. I like it much more face-to-face than on the computer. I think there are more enjoyable dice Euros, but this one is quite good. Maybe a touch long.

RATING: 7
This is a thematically fun and mechanically solid game, with just the right amount of luck for my tastes, at it's core is a sort of worker-placement-with-dice mechanic.  However, there does seem to be a best strategy, both when placing influence (Can I somehow make my dice add to 14 this turn?) and when constructing buildings, which detracts from the replay value a bit. 

The combat mechanic leaves much to be desired.  In my mind, it either needs to go away completely, or raise the stakes and complexity a bit to make it a big climactic experience.

An OK game of role selection and development, with a not so very threatening horde of bad guys turning up every fourth round to put that development in peril.  I can see how the buildings offer different paths to victory and the system of allocating dice to select roles is quite nice.  However, by the third of five years I felt as though I'd got all there was to be had from the game and the rest was just repetition.

Production quality is good and the artwork is quite engaging.

The game is really boring once you discovery the winning path of buildings, and it's almost the same for all players, no matter what numbers you roll. The player who rolls the better numbers usually wins.

The expansion is a must have to make the game better (and it really does).

Dice manipulation worker placement from FFG... that's not something you see every day. The game is good, almost above expectations and due to dice rolling it has high replay value.

A major dice fest/worker placement/resource conversion/build buildings to give greater capabilities game.  Has a lot going for it, but it just didn't seem that compelling to me.  It felt a bit artificial and "dice decided" to me.  If I am going to play a dice fest, I prefer Castles of Burgundy and Macao to Kingsburg, Troyes and Alien Frontiers...which leave me cold.

RATING: 8
Played 4 times. Fun game, but it can be incredibly frustrating too - the dice rolls don't go your way, you get the roll you're looking for but the player before you in turn order takes the spot you needed to be able to build that crucial building, etc. I suppose that's the common tension amongst all worker placement games, but in this game it's especially tough, because you have to also be lucky enough to roll your worker to be able to place them in certain spots. One of the players I played with last night spent the last 6 production phases of the game rolling less than 8 each time (yes he should of built the chapel, but if memory serves, he didn't have the statue, and I'm assuming was thinking his luck would break). He was pretty dejected by the end of it. If I had a true gripe about this game, it's that the game is deceptively long. The first eight phases of the game go by pretty quickly, and you think, "I can do this for four more turns in no time", but each subsequent turn is slower as everyone calculates out what's the most optimum move for them in their production phase, etc. and suddenly you're playing a brain burner and AP starts rearing it's ugly head.

This was the first Euro-type game (we have no doubt hardcore Eurogamers will shout at us for even affiliating this game with Euro but whatever) we ever bought and it is still a favorite. Simple and smooth you can roll through this game without spending hours pondering what resources you ought to take to build what structures. The art is fantastic and you cannot go wrong with rolling dice for resources. At least that's our opinion.

Eurogame bastante entretenido. Me gusta la gestión de dados y el tener que considerar las opciones para que no te pisen la jugada mientras tú intentas fastidiar fastidiar la estrategia de colocación de dados del resto de jugadores.

Lo peor sin duda es la rejugabilidad. Al ser siempre los mismos 16 edificios a construir, las variaciones son muy limitadas. Se hace imprescindible la expansión para aportar rejugabilidad al juego.

Update 1 -> Probado con expansión el juego mejora y se hace menos repetitivo.

[ESP] A pesar de no ser una gran amiga de los dados siempre me divierto mucho jugando este juego.

Los jugadores representan a Lords enviados por el rey a administrar sus territorios fronterizos. El juego tiene lugar a los largo de 5 años con un total de 20 turnos. Cada año hay 3 epocas productivas para recolectar recursos, construir y entrenar tropas. La cuarta es el invierno, en la cual todos los jugadores deben pelear para derrotar a las fuerzas invasoras.
Para lograr esto deben usar con astucia sus dados al influenciar a los consejeros del rey y construir los edificios mas convenientes para la estrategia seleccionada.

Kingsburg is just a solid all-around game.  I don't think I've ever played with anyone who didn't enjoy it.  Drafting your resources based on dice-rolling is a cool mechanic, and Kingsburg does a pretty good job of it.

It seems like generally people can play a variety of strategies, mostly successfully, but it does feel a little silo-ed from time to time.  There's very little direct confrontation, so sometimes it seems like you're playing in a vacuum.

The artwork and the theme are great, but the components leave a little to be desired.  Cubes as resources are kind of lame, and they break the enchantment a little more than I'd like.

One little quibble (and it might be just me) is that the resources feel a little bit too scarce in this game... Or maybe it's just that the early level buildings don't seem to pay off that much.  Most of the time when I'm playing this game, I feel like I'm waiting for a couple of turns down the line when I have a few more resources.  It makes you change your plan quite a bit and it increases the tension, but at the same time it's hard to feel like you're ever doing anything really cool.

RATING: 6
One play, 4P.  Lots of downtime, which I chalk up to the individual playing pace, but the game still facilitates it.  And because it's placement-based, pre-planning your move during downtime may be an exercise in futility.  Suspect it would be best with 3 fast players.  Anyway, liked most of it except the king rolls, which I understand to be replaced (or replaceable) in the expansion.  I didn't realize it before, but I think I actually prefer snowball effects in games like this - simply collecting stuff with my 3-4 (or rarely 5) dice each turn seemed anti-climactic.  I'd give it another whirl.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The randomness of this game is significantly offset by the distribution of dice.  Even so, there is plenty of uncertainty in the game, and I think that's what makes it a lot of fun.  In a five player game, people may not get exactly what they want with the others taking it first, which leads to some AP problems.  Planning for the future is important.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable, but you do seem to be at the mercy of the die rolls.  Over time this will average out, but in my wife's first game she consistently rolled lower than I throughout the game.  One person who has been playing Roll through the Ages thought that Kingsburg was a little long for what it was.  I do enjoy Kingsburg.  To  me it seems about as meaty as Vinci, another Civ building game.  Both are enjoyable, but if I have the time I'd go with something meatier.

Blocking other people's dice is very important.  Currently my favorte track is Inn -> Market -> Farms. This reminds me of playing [gameid=37380], but I think that you get much more game for your money with Kingsburg.

Have only played 2-3 player so far.

Kingsburg has lots of options that are spelled out in little blocks of text that you have read really quickly and get straight in your head so that you can figure out what to do without holding everyone up so basically that's hopeless until my third or forth play, at least, so that's a bit frustrating.

I think a rating of 7 just about fits perfectly. It's a good game and I'm usually willing to play. I like it best with 3 (well, I haven't tried 2 yet).

Deceptively complex game with a nice mechanic, but the mechanic can turn on a player making it difficult to do what one needs to to win.  When the opportunity arises to make strong moves, the player must be able to see it and take advantage of it as the game can turn against them.  It does heavily rely on dice and in my opnion put a little too much luck on the individual players, unlike Yspahan's use of the dice and the community advantage or disadvantage being spread out.  Outside of that, I do enjoy playing and teaching the game.

A tábla és a kockák lehelyezése nagyon tetszik, a viszonylag nagy szerencsefaktorba pedig beletörődtem, de annyi kritika mindenképp illeti a játékot, hogy az 5 év során nem nagyon éreztem változást.

This game has less little stuff to worry about on the main board but slightly more things to worry about on your personal one, compared to Castles of Burgundy, a game definitely influenced if not based on this one. What it lacks in weird symbols, it makes up with text that can be easily memorized after a few plays (i guess). The buzz over this one is understandable, but i would probably still go for Burgundy, when having to compare.

This game reminds me of those restaurants where the Menu has 1,004 choices.  I'm an indecisive guy, and the analytical side of me really wants to make a good selection.  This game just feels like work, and the more control you get over the dice (with modifiers) the more options you have to consider.  For me this isn't fun; it's exhausting.  I realize if I played it more some of the better options would be more easily recognizable, so my friends could talk me into this, maybe...

I tried it as a definitive prototype. The game is good but it did not convince me for the lenght (far too long) and for the insufficient balancement of cards (monsters) and points. Moreover it is nice at the beginning but after 3 turn it becomes boring for two reasons: it doesn't evolute enough, and most of your decisions (above all in the last turns) depends on luck in the dice rolls. Artwork is really beautiful.

One play at the Isleworth BGG, but more on ios. It is a game design I like a lot.

Nice use of the dice to get the selection of characters.  It combines lucky-worker placement with a bit of screwage, together with resource management and building decision.  Only one play, made some mistakes which may change a bit the feeling.  First impression is that battles were too easy, but may be due to the mistakes.  And also a little bit repetitive.  Anyway, a nice game, original and funny.

Game with an interesting dice mechanic as its core. It's pretty tight as you always feel you have too few resources for building and for defending against incoming attacks. However at 2h the game overstays its welcome a bit (same as Manila) and the potential worry for me would be its replayability - won't this game fall into a beaten path once you will discover the optimal tech tree development (assuming there is one)?

Kingburg is a very good combination game. Although you throw with dice, there are a lot of tactical choices in it. The system is original, well equilibrated and challenging. The scores of the players stay in the neighbourhood, so it's only decided at the end who's the winner.

worker placement gateway weighed a little heavier than Lords of Waterdeep, but not by much...only because there is more to keep track of. More luck because of dice, but still a very fun experience. Sold, replaced by Castles of Burgundy

Met 3 dobbelstenen gooien en zo bepaal je welke actie jij wil doen: grondstoffen nemen, verdediging plaatsen, punten pakken, enz...
Kijk goed naar de waarde van de dobbels bij de andere spelers om hen te blokkeren.

Op het einde van elke era vecht je tegen een aanvaller, en moet je zien dat je voldoende defense gespaard hebt.

Elementen van Caylus en zeevaarders van Catan, maar stukken eenvoudiger dan Caylus.
En meer gelukselement (hoe hoger de dobbelstenen hoe meer je toch kan doen...) !

Niet zo moeilijk qua regels en toch gespeeld op 90 min.
Veelzijdig.

Ik ben fan!

A clever worker placement game using values of rolled dice.  The system makes you really have to pay attention not only what you want to or can do, but how best you can "hose" your opponents with your choices.  As mentioned by others, the last round is a bit of a let-down as players can pretty safely predict the winner, but I love all the options one can choose to try to win the game.  Sure, the "Embassy Rush" is a strong strategy, but not everyone plays it, especially new players, so other paths to victory can be experimented with.  Don't know yet if I'll add the expansion or not.  Will depend on how many plays the original gets.  [Market price]

RATING: 8.5
I give it such a high rating because I find this game to be absolutely AMAZING!! It really is fun, strategic, and awesome.  The one BIG problem is that there is only one path to true victory...thus the same strategy exists in every game.  Thus I anxiously anticipate trying the expansion.

RATING: 6.5
Original game concept slows down to repetitive gameplay. 5 turns long you're doing the exact same 3 actions that don't require enough strategy to keep it interesting all along. There's only a bit of interaction with other players, in selecting the goods you want to receive.

RATING: 7
Worker placement game that uses dice rolls to determine where your workers can go. I first saw this implemented in Alien Frontiers, and I very much enjoy how differently it is implemented here. The resource management makes the game very thinky, as does the skill tree of buildings available to each player. The potential to block opponents makes the game tense, and the constant threat of the monsters at the end of each round creates a race for military points. Intermittent rewards for most points/least buildings keep strategy diverse. Impressive game developed around rolling dice.

Based on one play of a friend's copy: Enjoyed the dice-as-determinants of resources aspect (which needs the +2 tokens and Market powers to mitigate bad rolls) and the use of resources to build progressively more powerful buildings. The generic fantasy theme could easily be replaced by a historical one (e.g. players as paladins of Charlemagne or Roman governors) and the enemies don't seem particularly threatening; I feel that I paid too much attention to that aspect during the game as so missed opportunities to increase my score.

Only played once, but I did enjoy it.  

My only gripe is with any good dice game, you make your own luck.  So, it gets down to knowing what buildings to build...  but as much as I try to trivialize it, it's NEVER that easy.

I'm basically waiting for the expansion to fix the king's roll dice problem.  That is... he who gambles the most on the king and wins, stands to come-up HUGE, or lose huge.

EDIT:  I gave it an 8 on the initial play, then lowered it down to 7 when I had the opportunity to buy it, and said to myself, "while this is good, there are other things that are better, or that I would be willing to try."  It's on my wishlist, but way way way way down there.

A well received and good replay game.  Everybody I have introduced it to likes it. 

Only drawback is the theme: once again the basis of the game is to kiss the ass of the King's advisors to get their help in impressing the King. Well, the King and his advisors can kiss my ass. Maybe I'll just stage a coup and murder the king in his bed! How about that advisors, what will you give me if I do that? How about I kill all of you advisors too? Then I'll be King with nobody left to kiss my ass. I want my ass kissed, maybe I'll leave a few advisors alive to do that. Maybe I'll make them compete to see who I do and don't kill by how well they kiss my ass. They may feel so degraded they start plotting to kill me and steal my throne. Those treacherous bastards have always resented me and rise to power. I need a secret police force to watch my back and ferret out those disloyal to me. Perhaps martial law should be imposed. I am assailed be enemies on all sides! Off to the gallows with them all!!!

Scales well from young to older players.

You know what? Some days I just really like rolling some bones, and Kingsburg is one of my favourite ways to do that. Kingsburg has you rolling a bunch of dice and having to work with the results to get the resources you need -- basically a "dice placement" game. It looks great, and there are several paths to victory when building your town, which is cool. The end of year attacks add an element of risk-management to your choices, and although the game can occasionally be a bit anticlimactic (in that it can be obvious by the last turn who is going to win) it's still a lot of fun. In fact, Kingsburg has really surprised me with how much I want to keep going back to it. I think it's a really good game.

RATING: 6
This should be a comment of abounding praise and adoration for an awesome strategic game based around dice-rolling.  I mean this game had everything going for it that I look for in a game (theme, fun mechanisms, multiple paths to victory, etc.)  Unfortunately, disaster struck!  I literally rolled 10 or less every single turn of the entire game.  This kind of worse-case scenario didn't really annoy me, but it opened my eyes to a major flaw in this game.  When a player has consistently bad rolls like mine, they can't win.

Now I'm not bashing on the game.  I had a fun time playing, and I would gladly play again.  However the few little mechanisms they threw in to help a player who rolls badly aren't enough to make that player a competitor for the win.  Sure you can try different combos of buildings, but you're going to struggle to get enough resources to build the really great stuff.  It's a fun experience, but when things don't go your way the experience lasts a little too long.

I've only played this once in the Dice Tower Con, but it left me with the impression that it is a light middle weight worker placement family game with some interesting decisions that doesn't overstay it's welcome. I'm glad that I got to experience this old classic.

There is a lot of dice rolling; although the dice could be manipulated, there is some player conflict in regards to taking actions and there is an engine building aspect that holds your attention. 

I left the Con purchasing the game for family nights; although I could see myself playing this with gamers after a heavy session.

For now the rating is a 7 for fun, but if you roll higher numbers than everyone you'll probably win.

RATING: 7
Dice placement, what an excellent mechanic.  I definitely love this game, and while the temptation in a dice game is to decry your luck,  players end up rolling 15 times over the course of a game, which mitigates the luck greatly.  Plus, one the best spots on the board is also the cheapest (Jester).  Just brilliant game design - adding dice to worker placement is ~exactly~ what that genre needed and the whole package is a ton of fun to play, while still being highly strategic.  Unlike most WP games, you have to "roll" with your dice, which forces you to mix up your strategy from game to game.

The only bad point - the end-of-year monster battles are way too random and really detract from the strategy of the game.  This means one of the game's pivotal moments and decisions comes down completely to the roll of a d6.  Thankfully, the expansion "Kingsburg: To Forge a Realm" fixes this completely.  My rating of "7" is thus for Kingsburg without the expansion.

One of my favorites.  You roll the dice and take turns claiming various spots.  Of course somebody always takes the spot you wanted as you gain resources to increase your building engine for more abilities and points.  Having to invest in defense that disappears at the end of the round always makes people mad for "wasting resources"  ironically it factored in who won or lost the last 2 times I played.  Has a real good 2-player variant too.  A must add to your collection (you can't have mine).

I've heard this game has been fired.  That's a little disappointing, as I quite enjoy this game.  I do tend to use the same strategy each time to win, so perhaps I need to change it up a bit. I wouldn't turn this down if we had the time to play it.

After reading a few reviews, it looks like I really need to pick up the expansion to make this one shine.  I'll have to see if I can find a copy at a good price out there.

One play with the expansion mats and the circular tiles used instead of rolling for defense at the end of the round.  It was fun and I'd really like to try it again.  I can see how the circular tiles are much better than rolling.

Second play was with all original components.  Once again, a lot of fun but the variability seemed to be lacking in each player's development.  I preferred using the discs for the king's support versus rolling a die.  If I play this game in the future, I think I'll want to use the expansion.

After several plays, I think this is a decent game and a bit short of Stone Age for overall quality.

I like dice-euros; the best of the genre is great at adding randomness without penalising you heavily for poor rolls. Unfortunately this is not the best of the genre and the game is too big and too long to make winning or losing on a lucky or crappy roll in the final round a satisfying outcome. Would probably be better retaining the buildings but with some less random mechanic for getting them.

The argument about Kingsburg being a good game or not won’t be settled before long, if ever: in my opinion though this game isn’t that bad for, as easy as it is, it doesn’t promise nothing more than it keeps, a simple, thoughtless diversion.

The game has a killer use of dice in a Euro.  I just don't get that much enjoyment out of it though.  Designed as is, Kingsburg isn't interesting enough to be fun.  The battles with monsters at the end of the year feel like an afterthought and their is one VERY strong strategy involving farms that is hard to beat.  The expansion is probably necessary...but I think the reworking into Kingsport Festival is a much better designed game.  This game is totally average in almost every way.

The dice placement is interesting to me. The buildings feel kinda "same-y" and this game just feels more abstract to me than other games of its ilk. Not sure why, though. This should be up my alley.

-Edit: looking forward to trying it out with the exp, which might help my issues with the generic feeling buildings and the random battle resolution.

-Edit: The exp fixes my 3 main beefs w/ base game: 
1. Same-y buildings: now more choices, and different choices for each person
2. Battle resolution too lucky: before the luck was coming (strength of enemy) and going (king's roll), now you have control over one of them. Excellent addition.
3. No variable setup: the events, choice of building strips and characters make each player's position, and each game, different. 
I really liked my one play with the exp. May go to 8?

The game was pretty decent. Not what I was expecting as I was hearing comparisons to To Court the King which is just one big borefest for me. Some tactics going on in your dice placement and appears to have different paths to go down. You can mitigate the luck of the dice nicely. Actually, I found that bad rolls can work in your favor, as well. It took us 2.5 hours to play it, which seemed long to me. If played again, I would hope to shave off an hour off this game which would feel about the right amount of time to play this one.

Up to a 7.  Played very well with two people.

Dobsz, eldöntöd mit szeretnél (tudsz) kihozni a dobásodból. Nagyon kell figyelni a többiek lehetőségeit és az alapján dönteni. Lehet bosszankodni is, de ezzel nincs gond. Kifejezetten jól felépített játék, közepes nehézséggel.

An excellent light(-ish) game.  Easy to pick up and play.  The mechanics of the dice are refreshing compared to the usual role/card style randomness.

Personally, I think this is a better gateway game than Ticket to Ride.

With the expansion this has been bumped to an 8.

I love dice placement and this game is a classic in this genre. I don't know much about it but would love to try it to see how it matches up with other die placement games like Bora Bora, Troyes, Madeira, etc.

Update: Well we tried it and have no desire to play it again. This game was so boring and felt dated. There are dozens of games that do dice placement in more interesting ways now. Just a slog through die rolls, gathering cubes, and building buildings. Very glad I tried before I bought because this was soooo boring!

Purchased this as our first to incorporate dice in a non-traditional way. It has not disappointed. The small ways you can adjust the dice and the setup of the advisors do a nice job offsetting, but not completely removing the randomness of the dice. The rules and the theme make it accessible.

RATING: 5.5
6 plays.  Too long for the amount of fun involved... and too many calculations that could be for 'naught when you get blocked out by opponents.  Details --> Roll dice & decide how to spend them to bribe characters.  Block your opponents from playing their dice to the board.  Poor rolls can really tank your game.  Seems like 3 dice is too few to keep all players competitive... because someone is bound to have really bad luck with the dice.  I hate to think that there might be a single, viable strategy, but perhaps everyone needs to rush to get the "farming" building (which gives you a 4th die for production).  The game seems to have a rich-get-richer problem.  -------------Others say:  middle/light weight game, reminiscent of "To Court the King" but more complicated with more interesting decisions, too long for this genre, no chance for 2 losers to catch up in 5-player game. ---------Update: it's slightly better with 3 players where there aren't as many calculations and permutations to run through.

UPDATE 2014 (at 10 plays): A worker placement puzzle that becomes exceedingly frustrating, painful and tedious... especially if you roll poorly for several consecutive turns or your opponents are playing willy-nilly and not keeping other players in check by blocking.  The dice randomness and limited ability to mitigate it really kills this game for me.  Also, the fixed sequence of buildings is boring.  Variable buildings or building chains would greatly enhance replayability.

The dice rolling mechanism that is central to this game adds some randomness to proceedings, but it is compensated for in some regards by other mechanisms. There's a couple of helping hands which assist poorly placed players with an extra dice once a year or allow someone to build an extra building (if they can afford it) or to consult an advisor who's already been used by someone else. A number of means to modify one or more dice per season to allow you to manage to influence advisors that your rolls would otherwise miss.

Alien Fromtiers is the better game tho

OK, the dice can break you in this game, but I totally accept that in my games. (well... except for the dice in Settlers.  I HATE THE DICE IN SETTLERS!) I really like the player interaction and the multiple tracks of slowly developed capabilities. This is a hard game to win.  The expansions are very fun and I will always accept them in a game but won't demand we play with them. (Although the large soldier tokens should be mandatory probably...)  I love the fact that the whole game PLUS expansions fits into the very small expansion box.  MUCH easier to cart to game days!

An excellent game for those who like dice rolling. The structure of the game tends to offset the luck of the rolls to some degree, but the players who roll better certainly have a better chance to win. Easy to learn. Not a fan of the end of year attack - the single die roll makes it too random.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a very pleasant dice based Euro occupying the same "head space" as Lords of Waterdeep. I prefer it over Stone Age as one actually develops a little engine over the course of the game. Additionally, play is a matter of managing the dice rolls rather than suffering from the luck of the dice. It doesn't seem to be quite Euro enough to satisfy some or thematic enough for others. Add that to the fact that it has a few years on it and I think it lacks the amount of attention now that it might have had it been released in 2013. I'd prefer a bit more interaction and immersion, but it's a game I can play and enjoy when I'm in the mood for something that doesn't require a full intellectual and emotional investment. 

With the very fine expansion I rate the game a seven. It just opens up the possibilities more.

RATING: 5
Dice outcome determines worker placement freedom of movement. A bit like an inverted version of Stone Age. Like Stone Age you collect resources but instead of houses you buy upgrades. The upgrade 'engine' not only makes your actions better, but also provides victory points. There's a little added fluff in the form of invasions you have to beat each couple of rounds. These are postive or negative effects that happen when you meet (or fail to meet) a certain value on the battle track.

Kingsburg is pretty light and feels like real fun on the first play. Continuing the Stone Age analogy, the dice outcome here is more prevalent and can seriously hamper progress. Since you're building an engine and must meet certain quota in time throwing low numbers feels frustrating sometimes and the game doesn't have much mechanics for planning for a worst case scenario.

The real weakness of the game probably lies in the replayability. The upgrade paths seem to add variety but there are some staple upgrades everyone goes for. In the end the one that throws the highest dice values has the best chance of winning. That's not a problem per se, but it is for a game that easily plays over 1,5 hour.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It's light, plays in about an hour but has strategy to some degree.  Since each productive phase is based on dice rolls, you have to be prepared to not be able to execute your plan the way would have wanted to.  It's a very dice-heavy game, and you'll roll plenty of them and curse them pretty often.  The player interaction is non-direct, and really comes down to dice placement.  If you can place dice to prevent opponents from taking full advantage of their roll without screwing yourself over you've discovered all of the player interaction I've found in the game.  It's pretty fun and light, something to play with light or non-gamers.

The more I play this game, the more I like it.  It`s fun, and despite being at the mercy of the dice, it offers a lot to the player and is usually interesting.  Bumping my score up.

I was really expecting to like this game, but it seemed a bit boring. I suspect the strategies would play the same. There's very little adaptation going on. You simply have to worry about making sure you have enough defense, which never seemed hard. I wouldn't hate to play again, but I'd certainly look for another game first. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The key mechanic in this game is the process of placing influence by rolling 3D6 and dividing the spots among a number of "advisors" who grant favors in terms of VPs or resources. Buildings are constructed at various stages to also yield VPs or other benefits. Turns are phased over a span of four years after which VP totals are determined for victory. At the end of each year a variable number of marauders must be dealt with the planning for which must be included in the player's decisions.

Reminiscent of such games as Settlers of Catan (the dice for resources), and Puerto Rico (construction) with the randomness quotient in between the two. Also similar to Louis XIV. The saving grace in this game that elevates it above Settlers is that the resource generation mechanic is not quite as chaotic and there are devices to give a "tail-end Charlie" a bit of a boost.

Decent light weight game I've managed to play a couple of times and found it held my interest. I'd play it again, but won't likely be buying it...

Thought I'd like this more than I did :(
Too much downtime, you have to think about where to put your dice, which dice to use and also factor in what all your opponents might do with the dice they have (plus any bonus '2' disks they have) ... meaning each turn takes an age, and you can't plan out of your turn as you have no idea what slots will be free. End of year battle is a massive anticlimax, and seemed too easy to defeat in the game I played. There's no 'push your luck' element here - if you get a bad roll, tough luck, if you roll well then you're half way to winning ... totally tactical, there's no way you can really plan strategically other than the track you build on, but that's totally dependant on the resources you get, which you have little control over. Finally it's way over produced, a $15 game with cards and dice would be fine, but you get a huge board and lots of eye candy none of which adds to the game. Overall better than to Court the King, but I hated that too, so it's not saying much.

The King has challenged us to compete to improve our provinces.  There can be only one!

This is an easily learned on its incredibly lovely and high chrome board.  It seems to interest the younger crowd and in spite of its incredibly flat learning curve offers good replayability.

The point of the game is to roll dice that will give you various levels of "pull" with Nobles working in the kingdom.  You simply place your dice on the matching noble and that claims that Nobel person power for that particular production phase.  

After the claims are made, there are checks made for various levels of balance or accomplishments.  Sometimes those in first place are rewarded, and sometimes mercy is shown to the slackies.

Toward the end of each year an invasion occurs that can be bad oir relatively harmless.  The point is through the game you gain defenses as part of building various compounds in your province.  

The game ends after the fifth year.  Points are acknowledged and the winner is clear on the VP track.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like the game, but after three plays I am having questions about replayability.  It seems as though there may be only a few variations on an optimal building strategy.  Perhaps the game needs a few more events other than an invasion one per year.  Will definitely try 2-3 more times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I liked it... but wanted to love it.  The dice (a central mechanic in the game) add SO much variation and luck to the strategy.  Also, among the different building tiers, a fully completed regilious tier is a [b]requirement[/b] for winning.  Big design no no in my book.

Still, I keep playing it wanting a deeper strategy.  Hopefully, I'll find it.

RATING: 6
The strategy in this game doesn't seem all that compelling or varied, and the randomness plays more of a role than I would like. Every turn ends up with you scanning repeatedly through every each combination of the dice and hoping that someone hasn't blocked all the spaces you want.

The dice rolling mechanic is fun and there's lots of possibilities on your turn.  The different groups of buildings offer a lot of choices for strategy.

Es un juego de gestión de recursos en el que las acciones se escogen haciendo combinaciones con una tirada de dados y ubicandolos (solos o en grupos) sobre los consejeros del rey. Aunque tiene dados, el azar está muy controlado. El juego se desarrolla durante 5 años y cada año consta de 8 fases. La última siempre es enfrentarse a un ejército enemigo. Las acciones están encaminadas a ir consiguiendo recursos para construir diversos edificios de tu ciudad e ir preparándote para el combate de final de año. Al final gana quien tiene más puntos de victoria.

Es un juego rápido y entrenido. Admite de 2 a 5 jugadores. Recomendable. Puede gustar tanto a jugones como a no-iniciados.

I like dice games. Specially when you are playing with friends that like a good laugh.
It has some screw your neighbour in it, which I like.
The game has several different tracks to win which increase the playability of the game.
The playing time is a bit long with more players, but It hasn't disturbed me yet.
There is a discussion on BGG that there are disdvantages with certain choices in the game, but I don't read "I want to analyze the game down to every bit".
A very nice game that was very well received by wife, kids and gamer group.

Not a bad game and I like the fantasy theme, but it plays a little long for what it is, and the invasion at the end of each round with a single dice roll 1-6 determining the additional soldiers too defend creates too much randomness.

This game always reminds me of Heroes of Might and Magic III grafted onto The Pillars of the Earth. I enjoy both of those games, so unsurprisingly, I enjoy this one too.
Basically, you are a nobleman who has to build the best kingdom possible to impress the king, and you do this by competing for the influence of the king's court, gathering resources, building things, and fighting monsters. Neglecting any of these aspects of the game tends to lead to abysmal failure, so you have to carefully manage your plan. Bidding on the advisors' influence can also be amusingly cutthroat.

Dans "Kingsburg" les joueurs sont des seigneurs envoyés par le roi pour créer de nouvelles frontieres. 
Le jeu dure cinq ans, soit un total de 20 tours. 
Chaque année, il y a 3 saisons de production pour rassembler des ressources, des fondations, et des troupes de formation. Durant la quatrieme saison, l'hiver, tous joueurs doivent combattre une armée envahissante. 
Chaque joueur doit faire face aux envahisseurs: il ne s'agit donc pas d'un jeu coopératif.

Very fun game. Normally dice are an automatic turn-off but they are implemented in such a way as to still leave a bit of luck in the game, but not to overwhelm things. We played 4 players: if you played 5 the luck may be a little more pronounced since people would be competing more for the single-dice resource squares.

The 'meat' of the game plays fairly streamlined which I like, and the array of buildings available seems like there are definite alternative strategies that can be pursued. Looking forward to trying this one more to figure out what those strategies are.

Worker placement game, in which dice work as workers. It felt like luck plays a considerable role (one bad roll may cause to skip one building phase and make you trail until game end). Invading armies were never a threat - perhaps their strength should be increased? I liked the artwork, but was unimpressed by game play.

Great game with simple mechanics. Quickly explained, quickly played.
I like the fact that you have to weigh whether you want to pick a important action safely while possibly loosing another to your opponents or you try to mindgame the others that you can choose freely.
It's just wonderful to see a player hoping trying to get his action while the other one just tries to block him.
I really like it.

After time passed on my taste did as well.
Alien Frontiers is a better game imo...
...and after that came Marco Polo, fighting for the crown. Maybe, someday, I will get the expansion and the story will be rewritten.

Enjoyable game, although it sets my AP in a tailspin.  I'm not one who's bothered by the die roll for the winter season, but by golly I can roll horribly for the productive season rolls -- even on 4 dice!  I don't find that to be a dealbreaker, though; the key is working with what you have, and the game does have perks for players who are running behind.  Still having fun with this one.

Update: repeated play still keeps this firmly in rotation.  To Forge a Realm adds greatly to replayability.

Wonderful game all about making do with what luck gives you. Make sure not to use the dice that come with it; they seem to be regularly imbalanced. Also, you don't need the expansion, but the 'King's bonus' or whatever is crap. You need to have the chips.

7/5/08 - 36 hour trading extravaganza math trade. Traded Ubongo - Das Duell to get this. The first few games of this, I really enjoyed. I introduced it to some non-gamer friends and every time we got together it was their game of choice - so we played it quite a bit. After many games of Kingsburg and a few now with the expansion - it appears to me that there is really only one way to play this game - focus on military or you are dead in the water with no chance of winning. I have tried to prove this wrong by focusing on different row combos but to no avail - not only do you lose consistently but sometimes it is embarassing. I will continue to try different row combos but so far those middle rows seem to be the only means of having a shot at winning. But because of this - the game has lost a lot of lustre in my eyes.

Kingsburg!  You mothafu*&#$!  This is one game that redefines love/hate relationship.  Ok, so I love worker placement, so I should love Kingsburg.  Ok, the components are beautiful, the play is smooth as can be, so I should love Kingsburg.  And the first week after I got it, I played it every day.  And it was good - kind of.  The reality is, I want to cut Kingsburg's heart out and feed it to the damn parrot fish from Reef Encounter!  Why?  Well, how about - I CANNOT win this thing!  (I cannot in good conscience count that one tie as a win).  I shouldn't care about such a petty thing, should I?  I mean, really, as long as I'm having fun...  But I'm not having fun.  Why?  Because I can't find ways to improve.  I can't get better.  When I look back over the game and try to analyze what I did wrong, I find that - for the most part, I did everything right.  At least as much as my opponent.  My strategy is good, I make no glaring mistakes, my military is never an issue, I am competitive.  The reason I lose continually is - bad dice mojo!  And this is the reason I despise Kingsburg, because at the end of the day, all other things being equal (and they can be, very often), whoever rolls better will win.  I don't think Kingsburg is unbalanced per se - sometimes I think it's too balanced.  If you're having a bad game luck-wise, there is no way to compensate in another area, as it is almost always impossible to pick up more than 3 goods a season (and have them be useful).  So you can't make a big score and build two buildings in a season (except quite early on) without skipping the previous season to save up.  Really, I could go on and on about this.  I can't take the Kingsburg much these days... but it calls to me with that damn siren song.

RATING: 4.5
Is it just me or is this game too simple? Roll dice, get resources, buy buildings, and acquire soldiers. Repeat ad nauseum. Losing to the enemies is not punishing enough, defeating them gives you hardly any victory points, and since you don't get to keep your soldiers the game gives you no incentive to fight them. Hopefully the expansion will add some complexity and difficulty to an otherwise nice-looking game.

Not bad at all, I'd like to play again.  Feels like the bigger brother of To Court the King.

I like worker placement games.  The down-side to this one is the dice rolling.  Rolling low once in a while is no big deal, but if most of your rolls are low you will likely get shut out a lot (and lose the game).  I don't like the huge random factor of the king's aid roll.

Ever read the rules to a game, and just know you were going to love it?  Then, you play it, and you actually do love it?  For me, this is that game.  

A little bit of dice, a lot of special powers, slow build-up, eking out one resource at a time, a tiny bit of screwing your neighbor.  5-player game was terrific.  Theme was a fun story to capture the growth and the dice rolling aspects.  Catch-up mechanisms present, but not over powering.  Love this game, and it worked as a Gateway game, too.

For its simplicity, it takes way too long and is way too repetitive. Maybe four seasons would be better? Still, I thought it was ok. My fiancee, though, didn't like it at all. She said, "It's too shallow. Not as fun as Agricola." Too bad for the game, but great for me! 

UPDATE: Downgraded 5 --> 3. This game took over an hour on BSW, which is ridiculous. And it just seems really tedious: five identical rounds, with each player basically building the exact same buildings, and enormous AP setting in as people try to calculate where to put their dice and then where to build. I am really not a fan.

Played this again for the first time in a long time. It's still pretty bad, although I may have been slightly over-harsh in my rating. While it lacks more or less any interest and does reward just rolling well more than really knowing what you're doing, it at least functions. Still, I won't play it again.

UPDATE: Kingsburg is essentially just Airships done wrong. Given that Airships now exists in English, there is essentially no reason to play Kingsburg, unless you're a fan of downtime, analysis paralysis, arbitrary luck, and overwrought, underdeveloped games.

There is a good game in here somewhere, but the one in this particular box is one developer short of being interesting. There is just way too much thought involved in performing simple tasks. There are so many permutations of options, and so many ways to get hosed, that accomplishing even small things - like collecting a single resource - requires way too much work. Then the proliferation of similar buildings provides many more options, a lot of which aren't viable or interesting. Things just get way too bogged down in analysis paralysis, and the game takes far, far too long for what it is if anyone is trying at all.

Then there are two systemic problems. The first is the battle at the end of the year, which should be exciting, is really boring and hugely random. Second, the game simply rewards getting high rolls too much, even after you've done all that work. Most dice games are about pushing your luck, playing the odds, that sort of thing. This one isn't, it's a purely tactical game where getting good rolls is just a lot better than getting bad ones.

It also doesn't help that this whole worker-placement type game is becoming grossly over-used. It's not a terribly interesting or fun game mechanic to begin with (compared to, say, an auction), and too many games are using it without compensating in any way for its shortcomings (mainly, too much downtime and too little interesting player interaction). I remember Aladdin's Dragons with fondness, and would play that over virtually any of its modern successors any day.

No denying Kingsburg is a reasonably clever game, and the ideas in here could be made into something interesting, possibly. Kingsburg is not that game, though, and I would not play it again. To Crown a King this is not, not by a long shot, despite being twice the price and what, maybe 3 times the length?

I love dicey games and this one takes dice and uses them in a pretty neat way.  While your rolls largely determine what actions are available to you, there are other elements in the game that allow you to bend the rules enough to where there's usually something useful you can do with your rolls.  There's also a sense of progression as you move through the game, building better buildings and fighting nastier bad guys.  However, it appears after many plays that there's pretty much one clear cut strategy that you can use to win almost every time.  It would be great if there were different building combos that were competitive, but there just aren't.  This takes Kingsburg from a great game to a very mediocre one after you play it a few times.

Played it twice, but I really don't see the appeal.  I'm not a huge fan of dice, generally, but I thought they might work on this occasion.  They did not.  I didn't feel that the decisions were particularly interesting.  

Rarely were the spaces I wanted/needed blocked.  The number of advisors is overwhelming relative to the number of resources, so there was typically a workaround to get what I needed even if the first choice was occupied.  The proliferation of +2 tokens, a building that allows +1/-1, and the King's white die all provided excessive flexibility, which only served to reduce tension. 

The building powers seemed unbalanced (although I can't say so definitively without many more plays that I'm unlikely to pursue), the building costs seemed close to arbitrary (perhaps because the resources themselves are all so easy to acquire that a 3 gold, 1 wood building feels roughly the same as a 1 gold, 2 stone, 1 wood building, or 1 gold, 3 wood building, and so on).  The fact that the same building sheet gets reused every game would appear to detract from replayability and result in set strategies (I would have preferred a Puerto Rico style building market, so that players could at least compete for buildings, producing variation due to scarcity).  

Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the game was combat.  The attacking monsters are severely underpowered, and the knights sent by the king (determined by a die roll) were usually enough to dispatch them for the first few rounds without any player investment at all.  This really reduces the players' desire to use actions relating to combat, making several spaces on the board little more than overpriced defaults.  Moreover, the cost for losing is typically taken out in resources, but in our games, players simply spent all of their resources on the turn before the Winter, meaning that the penalty for losing (in the case of a bad roll of the King's die) was simply not getting the one resource cube prize and/or the one victory point for the largest army.

The art was pretty, if cartoonish, but the whole thing felt like a protoype of a game that would eventually be awesome with many more refinements/additions and much more playtesting.  It's short enough and innocuous enough that I'd play it to appease someone, but otherwise I don't see much there to excite me.

Bought just before Christmas 2009, got it's first play 1/24/10.

I had been building this game up since Tommy said he'd played it and loved it.  Reading it made it seem like a good fit for Heather and I.  I tried not to build it up too much for her, but let her know we definitely needed to give it a try.  I got it out, set it up and started reviewing the rules for the 3rd time.  Heather came over to try it out, and huffed and puffed throughout the explanation and she was annoyed I didn;t know every rule verbatim already.  We messed up a couple of things and Hetaher kept asking if the game was over yet.  At the end she looked at me and said "well that's a great game.  i wanted to hate but it's really good".  I think it's fantastic and am rating it a 9.  Once we play some more I can see it becoming one of my very few 10's, especially once we add To Forge a Realm.  LOVE IT  (1/25/10)

With To Forge a Realm Expansion

A bit too static- get's boring fast once you've figured out the strategy. But great for new players.

Fun for what it is, which is a game with a static setup and little interaction (beyond figuring out where others will play in order to know in which order to place your dice), meaning that it's all about figuring out which path is strongest, and just going through the motions every time you play.

Based on 1 play with 2 players: Why is gold so much easier to get than stone in this game? Anyway, this is a decent game. Pacing is pretty good, but basically no long-term planning at all. As a fan of turn-to-turn tactics this doesn't bother me toooo much, but I can see how it would turn some people off. Reminds me of Yspahan in terms of mechanics... but it's much easier to get screwed over by a bad roll in this. Still, it was engaging enough and I'd definitely be curious to try with more players. It just doesn't do much to stand out from the crowd. Rating could go up or down depending on more plays, but likely not more than a point in either direction.

I am updating my rating on this game. The base game alone is very repetitive with little variety. After playing more I find everyone usually hits the same strategy every game. The game is not too deep in gameplay making it good for an occasional play or something to maybe play with family. With the addition of the expansion I would rate this a 7 because it adds more to the game making it more interesting, including a variety to the possible buildings players can build. It also makes the battles more strategic. A must have expansion.

Fun game.  Lots of options depending on the results of the dice.  First play was with 2 players, so you do have extra dice on the board played by "msytery" players to get in the way, but that can be too random.  I want to play this game with 4 or 5 players to see how the dice interaction works with all players.

This may also be a game that my wife will like enough to play multiple times. - which is a good thing.

My wife hates that fact that it is nearly impossible to use more than 12 or 13 building chips in a regular game.  Therefore, she added a vairant that I don't mind having - we have one "pre-season" year, whereby we essentially fight two Level I monsters and play six years instead of five.  This is why the scores in my recorded plays with her involved are higher than average.  I don't mind this variant, as it adds some extra time and fun to the game.

Fun game that may be a bit too long for what it is. The dice rolling was neatly done and is really just there to signify what spaces are open to your workers for placement which can provide some interesting interactive decisions for locking out the other players.

Played lots on iOS.  My biggest griefs about this game is that there seem to be one or two optimal strategy that will win, as long as you don't make any silly mistake in calculating resources etc.  
My other dislike is that the winter phase is too random with what the king can provide.  A 1 or a 6 is a BIG difference in all 4 ages, especially the latter ages.  With minimal bonus but serious punishment for something that comes down to pushing your luck it really ruins the game experience for me, even when it goes my way.

28/12/2016. Played with the expansion, the king's tiles are a GREAT improvement and I like the different variety.  The event cards is a bit silly I prefer if they are all positive or all negative rather than random.  I lost badly because I have never rolled above 13 for the whole game. (Maybe once or twice with additional die).  Randomness of the die still sucks.

First time through will take some time to get familiar with what happens within each phase, how to distribute dice, where to move/place things, etc... but once you've got the hang of it it should move quick!

After one play, I'm pretty happy with this game. I played with five players, and that is admittedly a bit chaotic, but I like the flow of dice placement and building/teching over five rounds. I need to try this with 2 and 3 players to see if this has the potential as a spouse game. So far, so good.

Update: I've played this a couple times as a two player game. Ick. There's very little drama for two players, which tells me I need to try this more with 3 or preferably 4 to try and find that tension again in choosing spaces.

Update: Well, I ended up trading this one away. It's not a bad game... heck I'd play it again, but because it was a lousy two player game, I didn't see it hitting the table with any regularity.

tested at modcon, the game mix up all avrious successful mechanics from other blockbuster games, but it didn't have something...
the game is flat, after the third turn, in a five turn game, you expect something more, but in the end you got another two turns of roll, collect, build.
I'll give it another try.

Players: 2 − 5 

Games tend to be very close. That last round is a think-fest. Have to make the most out of you dice. 

Similar to "To Court the King", with more layers but less combos and a much longer play time.

For such high production values, the theme is pretty empty.

Over all, a good mix of chance and strategy.

This game had a flurry of plays when I first purchased it, but it's slowing down a bit.  It's still an interesting and fun game for 2-5 players (though I think I like more better).  However, I find myself doing the same building strategy each game.  I usually do well with it, and don't see much reason to change.  I might try some other tricks in the future, but I really can't see building some of the buildings.  If it does continue to be fairly scripted, I think my rating will drop some, but it does have some fun mechanics.

Sweet merciful crap, a game with monsters and dice that doesn't suck! This is the Euro gamer's Ameritrash game or maybe vice versa. This one's a mixed bag. It's a bit longer than it needs to be and I suspect that repeated plays would make this a bit samey but it's easy to teach and it makes a decent gateway game, plus it's a good way to hook in gamers who might be inclined to try Euros but are put off by the prospect of games that are just about collecting sheep and wheat to give to some distant unpleaseable monarch. Obviously it's still a game of resource management but you're managing resources so you can seriously f**k up some Orcs, which is a difference-maker for a certain crowd.

I am told that this game gets repetitive if you don't buy the expansion, and I don't like this game nearly enough for that, so there you go.

I think fight tokens from the expansion are required. I love the use of dice and getting bonuses from the buildings. I think it just lasts a little too long for me.

With that said I do want to play this game again and see if I have more fun with different groups of people.

Played twice with two players.  It's okay with that number, but I suspect it will be much better with more players.  There are flashes of visciousness in the selection of advisers that remind me in a strange way of Keythedral.  But there's not enough contention with only two players.  I suspect with more players, the extra contention will make that phase the highlight of the game.  The rest of the mechanics are good, but don't really stand out from many other games.

Good game considering dice are the driving force of all that happens....yet without being luck driven.  Obviously, luck plays a factor but it is somewhat mitigated by the various choices each dice roll allows.

Oh, Kingsburg. What a pleasant game you are. There's something about placing your die rolls to influence one of the king's advisers that is just so satisfying. The entire game is like this. You get resources to build your town at a drip feed though, so choosing what to do next isn't always straightforward. There's a gentle, euro-like level of aggression with other players where you can block and snatch up advisers before they can, leading to the need to be comfortable with modifying your tactics on the fly.

One negative I do have with it though is the relative lack of decision-making in preparing for the incoming monster hordes at the end of every year. It's very easy to see their strength before it arrives and dedicate a turn to bolster your forces to fend them off (or not and just take the hit for losing) I've heard that this issue is fixed in the expansion, along with adding a lot of other interesting choices, so I'll definintely be picking that up.

Seriously impressed with this one. I love the dice mechanic, and after a few plays I really do think there are quite a few viable strategies. The tactical play is fun and I think with 4 or 5 this game is great, with 3 it is probably only very good.

Kingsburg is the latest in what seems to have turned into a trend of dice-centred games. In this particular case, players are, in essence, given a mat depicting a bunch of different buildings, and 3 standard dice. Each round you roll the dice, and then use them singly or in combinations on the board to gain resources from the 18 characters present. Each character is numbered 1-18 (1 for each number, inclusive) and can have only one player present. So essentially this is the worker placement thing from Agri-Cay-Pill-da Vinci-III using dice. The resources are used in a similar way to the numerous other games as well, you collect them, and then use them to erect buildings which break the rules in various ways. At the end of each series of 3 rounds, a random bad guy from a deck shows up, and you need to have invested enough in military strength to defeat them, or face a minor penalty.

The bottom line on this is that I'm already way over my limit on this type of game, and adding dice to the mix did little to increase the appeal. It's not horribly random, though luck certainly comes into it, but it is just too derivative for its own good. On an aside, the board is garish.

I love playing this game, but only with the expansion.  Prior to paying a fortune for the OOP expansion, I wasn't a big fan of rolling the die to receive the king's troops, and I felt like the ending always fizzled because all points were visible. There was nothing extra to reveal at the end of the game.  The expansion fixed both of these issues and added some other fun elements too.

Kingsburg is my second-favorite game next to Through the Ages. It's surprisingly playable with kids and casual gamer, but especially with the expansion, it's plenty strategic. 

It'sa mix of a resource-gathering game and craps. You roll three die and then literally place one, two or three die on spaces marked 1-18. Those spaces have resources you collect and with which you build buildings, plus you must get military to fight the monster at the end of each of the five rounds.

Another reason I rate this game so highly is that it offers buildings and a board that somewhat alleviate the damage caused by bad dice rolls. Also, I enjoy permutations and combinations, and the game never plays twice because you can go so many different directions with which you build buildings on a 5 X 5 chart.

Really impressive game, it is a great marriage of AT and Euro games. Rolling dice is a central mechanic, yet it is all about strategy, building, collecting resources, and low player interaction.

After playing against the computer with the expansion, I think the cards (instead of one random roll) to determine how many troops the king sends really helps.

After one play, not sure about this one.  There is a lot of luck involved -- in the die rolling each season (which didn't bother me), and in the number of soldiers sent by the king (which seemed to have a major effect on who won the game -- the king was generous with soldiers, so actions spent building up military strength were more-or-less wasted).  I would happily try it again, but I'm not sure if it'll hold up for me in the long term.

Rather interesting game, pretty light.  You're persuading people of the court to help you out in giving you services to upgrade your castles/court against the hordes of monsters and fantasy foes.  In order for this game to work with two players, you must roll dice for two other players to block out other areas.

After a few plays, its starting to feel a bit same-y.  I've heard the expansion changes this, but not sure if the game will last long enough for me to experiment with this.

Love the dice placement, the board is pretty to look at, the resources and building is fun, and the game goes fairly quickly. Fantasy Flight should do more euros.

Kingsburg with it`s excellent expansion put dice games
on my radar again. Followed shortly thereafter by "Alea

and tech trees. "Troyes" scares the shit out of me as it 
lurks in my loft just waiting to pounce down and devour me. (That rule book looks intimidating) But in any case
as a start into this genre of games go for Kingsburg.You
have my blessings. Just keep those dice rolling and rolling down the line. For direct confrontation try
"Quarriors" instead.

Each round you roll your dice and assign them to various advisors, but if a space is taken, you have to arrange your values differently or you're out of luck.  As you progress in the game you'll gain resources to buy buildings which improve your abilities considerably.  But once a year there's an invading army to deal with - have you mustered enough defenses?

Outrageously easy to teach considering how complex a game it is.  I do understand the cries of balance issues, and we felt when playing it that a consistently poor roller can have a tough time catching up to the other players.  But even with those problems, this was a clear winner in our house and will get lots of play.

I'm a huge sucker for dice games so i won't be that much objective about this game. And this one is pretty nice. Blocking other players, building your city to your liking, constant threat of attack at the end of every year. Just great. Fun fun fun.

RATING: 5
Decent game. Nice tactile sense using dice and a good looking board.  The addon is important in this game. The first time I played I could see the limitation of the choice of buildings and wondered about replayability. Kids >8 like this game. The winter monster attack seems kind of arbitrary. It seems to improperly mix fantasy with the rest of the theme. 

I won't play this game unless someone pushes for it.

RATING: 8
This game is based on worker-placement, but the workers are dices, that you roll every turn and then select the person(s) that will help you this year. The trick is that all the others players can't take the person that you took, so you can sometimes block them.
The art is nice, there are a lot of components in the game (and the bags were included!). 
The thing is that my gaming group likes it more than I do, can't say why.

Components: Beautiful board. The various advisors are all very cool looking, and the other pieces of information (season track, score track, player order, number of soldiers, year marker) have all been well integrated around the edges. The invader cards are cool, and the player boards have clearly defined powers on them.

Experience: Great fun. Resources are very scarce, and it's easy to block my opponent from selecting a particular advisor, which forces us down creative paths.

Keeping up with my military is a must, as the penalties for losing a battle become crippling as the game goes on. This is perhaps a problem with the game, that military is so important, and yet there aren't too many ways to achieve it.

There are several buildings that are more valuable the earlier a player can build them, so the game sees an interesting and frantic race to get these built as quickly as possible.

I'm a bit concerned that there are some obvious building choices (e.g. Market) that tempt opponents into very similar builds. Not sure how much differentiation will surface after repeated play. I look forward to using the expansion to mix it up a bit.

Update: using the expansion's larger player boards doesn't seem to help much, as the newly added rows seem less valuable than the pre-existing rows. Market is still a no-brainer, and I'm not seeing much in the game that forces me to do things differently.

No 'slow-down-leader mechanism. (Yes-worst player gets a die-but that's not the same) Only strategy is to block production-and then the dice might dictate it's the player in last place becasue there's no reason not to.Worst graphics ever. The production dice are not excitement to me-just annoying as hell. A worker placement game where some spaces are unavailable 1-you rolled bad, then 2 someone blocked you. And 1 building per turn means it's predictable. Euro designers who never saw a World War 1 or 2 production game...sigh

This is a game that forces you to make decisions which are limited by (yours and your opponents') dice rolls. Figuring out what you should do with your roll is straigtforward. If you get bored with this repetitious game mechanic (and any gamer should), you can opt to put more effort into screwing-over your opponent. Weeee!??Although the colorful board and components are pleasing, they do not comouflage the rather bleached and colorless gameplay.

Fun family game, though I prefer it with more players and wish there was a bit more tension. It generally seems as if I get the roles that I want with the dice that I have -- I would like to feel shut out more often. Further, the Queen being better than the (higher-valued) King seems like a slightly broken element. Still an enjoyable time and I like the colors and the colored dice -- presentation excellent.

Overplayed it, so now I don't want to play it often. Defects? All 5 rounds feel the same, some strategies are way stronger than others, dice rolls have their weight, and with 5 players it's way too long. But it's still an original game for its dice placing mechanic. Waiting to see if the expansion can fix those defects to me.

After playing, all I could do is scratch my head: why is this fun? In what universe is there a point to a game like this? This is simply Ameritrash because unlike most dice-euros, if you roll low you automatically roll badly.  Why play a game that's random enough to annoy your euro-game planning senses, while not random enough to make it light-hearted fun? Wtf?

Fun game. Have to take it lightly though, as the dice can really play a roll. Bumped up one point because it is easy (so far) to get it to the table.

Played this several times with a variety of players and find it easy to teach and fun to play. It's a pseudo worker placement mechanic, but is also about managing your resources based on others' plays. The Geek has an excellent strategy guide that should be read. You have to plan ahead and take some risks, especially in the early rounds. Drive to the end of one of the tracks and reap the benefits, then use those benefits to garner even more points. Points are at a premium in this game and it is usually a tight score. The game can run a bit long, 2 hours is usual and if you have some high AP-prone people, it can bog down. But I like the mechanics, the art and the interactions among the players. The exapnsion only serves to improve the gameplay.

An excellent light worker placement game. There are a lot of different strategies to try and the expansion adds a lot of great modules increasing this games re-playability tenfold. Do not let the dice scare you, there are enough rolls in the game that the effect of luck becomes minimal. The soldier token variant that can be found in the expansions is a must. Without it I would probably rate this a 6.

The game is a fast and fun worker (dice) placement/resource collection game.  You can start out with a general strategy on what building paths you want to follow, but sooner or later the dice are going to dictate what strategy is actually available to you.  That makes it more of a tactical game, especially when considering how to place the dice to help yourself while hindering your opponents.

It is best played as a light game; over-analyzation can really cause it to drag.

I've played this a LOT on the computer, but I only log my face-to-face plays.  I was worried that I wouldn't enjoy the game as much due to the time commitment as compared to the digital version, but after several plays, I've come to enjoy the hour long gaming sessions.  It's a nice, relaxing and fun game.

I really enjoy the creative uses designers are finding for dice these days.  Really like how your roll determines which abilities you have available to pick from and that you need to consider what everyone else rolled and what they may need.  The abilities seem really well balanced as well, except for the queen and king (poor king).  At first I wasn't entirely sold on the game but I enjoy it more with each play.  At this point I'd probably consider the expansion a must-have, though... it adds in a lot of replay value.

I so much want to really like this game but something doesn't seem quite right. Occasionally the catch up mechanisms actually assist the leaders.

Seemed like a neat idea, but in practice it was deadly dull. Bad rolls are way worse than good ones, and nothing in the game will save you if you roll badly most of the time. Added to this is the repetitive nature of the game, and that it lasts way too long for what it is...I kept hearing how much people liked it, so I bought the expansion hoping it would make the game better. Maybe did a little, but not enough to save it. Traded both away.

RATING: 7.9
Worker placement with dice as workers. Players throw 3 dice and place them on 18 action fields (separately or combined). If one player has chosen an action field, another cannot use it, except if he has gained the king's envoy (given to the player with the lowest number of buildings in his town). Actions consists of gathering resources (stone, wood and gold - not lemons!!), trading resources, recruiting soldiers, taking a peak at the enemy which will have to be confronted at the end of the round, gaining +2 dice modifiers, and gaining points. After the actions have been done, one can build 1 building. There are 5 types of buildings, which can be expanded three times (20 different buildings). Each building offers specific advantages.
The game is played over 5 rounds, each consisting of 4 seasons. During spring, summer and autumn, workers are placed and buildings are built. During winter the enemy has to be fought. The enemies become stronger each round. A player with more battle points than the enemy gets an prize, a player with less battle points looses resources and/or buildings (and in the latter case probably points). The objective is to gain most victory points by means of worker actions, acquiring buildings and winning battles.

Best played with three people, I think, in that the board is crowded enough that decisions are tough, but not so crowded that everyone has leftover dice.  Also, the game runs awfully long with more than three.  It's an interesting game utilizing dice well, and caputring the city-building and defending theme well.

To me, this game feels kind of like 7 Wonders + Puerto Rico (the buildings) + dice.  Fun, but a little long for what it is. The randomness of the dice isn't so bad since it still gives you plenty of options on how to divide up your roll.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.9
Wow, i guess there is no way a dice game can be better than this one: High rolls can be used to achieve great rewards if summed together but they can be split to achieve smaller rewards, even if in greater numbers...that is, if that placement isn´t already occupied by another player, then you have to find a plan B, or a plan C or even more. 
Then there is a very nice city/civilization building that demands some planning, all combined with the need to store defences for the winter and combat phase, that come in random strength.
The art is nice though the components are weak (little more than cardboards) but this is a nice game for sure.

Ultimately a really good gateway game into the hobby but seasoned gamers will quickly bore of it.

I like many aspects of this game. It is simple, easy to play, and has a building aspect that I enjoy. The battle at the end of each season adds reasonable tension. What I have a hard time getting past is the dice. In many games I don't mind randomness with dice, but for some reason it bugs me with Kingsburg. I know people will disagree, but I've played several games with someone who consistently rolls well and they always win. It's hard to get past that for me.

An okay game, the dice/advisor mechanic seems luck-based but doesn't seem so in practice. Lower rolls can still accumulate needed resources (1-6 spots), and for higher spots players will have to use more or all of their dice to get multiple resources. Seems to "overbalance", by giving slightly trailing players too much of an advantage.

Beautiful materials, interesting risk management mechanics, but it is shockingly expensive for what it offers (german ~ 40 Euros, italian or english ~ 50 Euros).Need to try (several times) before I buy, to assess replayability.

******************************************************************

I managed to play it. Mechanics are good and straemlined, even though strongly influenced by the fear of having a runaway leader. Material are not on par, even if the game had a 25 Euros price tag (the board is too messed up with the arts, and the personal building boards are too thin). Replayability could be an issue.

Fun. The dice assigning part can go slowly because there really are so many things to consider - ways the dice can be combined, what your opponents might take, ways to use bonuses and when, what you need to collect, the enemy threat. Then there's what to build and when, which goes more quickly. Overall, a pleasing game.

I can't believe how successful this game has been in various groups.  The rules are simple to teach.  The dice make the game seem warm and inviting.

Player interaction/screwage is there, too.

Kingsburg is a simple-to-learn, resource management, town-building, character role selection game. Players build up their tiered town board by getting goods from a wide variety of characters, each with their own role. This is not the thematically rich role selection like in Citadels; each character simply amounts to a different mixture of goods and services, but the interesting part is the method of selection. Each player rolls a number of dice and then combines the die rolls however they like, and places some portion of them on one of the characters, numbered from 1-18. This provides the corresponding resources and also blocks that square from all other opponents. Players take turns doing this until all of the dice have been placed and then the building phase begins. Each player uses the resources they obtained to purchase one of a number of buildings, each of which  provides victory points and a special ability. The goal of the game is to obtain the most victory points by the optimum usage and blend of the mechanisms described.

I like the following elements:
*Its simplicity and approachability
*The dice placement mechanic
*The character role selection
*The building upgrade paths

I do not like that the following elements:
*Character roles are not very thematic (I'm a thief so I trade a victory point for some bags of goods?)
*Some roles seem imbalanced (I know a 17 is statistically harder to roll, but three victory points and a battle card peek and two goods of your choice?)
*Some buildings seem imbalanced (the Farm gives you an extra die to roll for the remainder of the game).
*It is difficult to build an economic engine when relying almost entirely on random dice rolls.
*The game takes longer than its simplicity warrants, sometimes due to analysis paralysis.

Pretty good but flawed entry-level game. Nice for family play. Designers take note: If you design a game in which higher dice rolls are preferable to lower ones, do not count on the luck to even out, especially over only 15 rolls. The luckiest dice roller should win this game. A few mechanisms attempt to mitigate the effects of luck, but later games do the job better.

Really solid game. Easy to learn, different options on how to try to win.  The side board (spending resources to build stuff) is the main focus, but the whole dice placement is very cool too.  I usually underestimate the importance of military, which has cost me a few victories.  Very smooth game play.  Can even be a little tense when finding out which monster greets you at the end of each round (or year or whatever).

I almost traded this game away at one point.  I am so glad I didn't.  Replaying it after a long dry spell re-ignited my love for this game (and my wife's as well!)  I really love the dice placement mechanic.  I love it so much that I have completely "pimped out" my copy.  I own the Forge a Realm expansion, have downloaded all the scenarios from FFG, and now have all the custom dice/token sets as well.  Now, I just need Broken Token to come up with a custom insert!

The dice aspect to this game is very well done.  Although I heard many complaints about not rolling high numbers, I think the options are balanced enough that a good player can do fine with just about any roll.  But there are some definite flaws in the game.  For instance, in my last game, it was obvious (at least to anyone who thought about it) that I was going to win for the last 6 rounds (2/5ths of the game).  By the 3 rounds, everyone pretty much knew I had it locked up.  We just went through the motions to finish the game.  Blah.

I love games like this where dice don't act as dice.  Roma goes on for too long, Ypshan has that stupid caravan sub-board, but this is just cool.  Very mean with four players - expect to have dice wasted each turn.  Wish there was less variance in the king's forces though.  That bit of luck feels outside your control.  Placing your own randomly rolled dice feels like it is your luck, if that makes any sense.  Just feels weird.

Had a lot of fun playing this game.  Our 5er game moved along at a pretty good clip.  A little AP, but not much.  It took us 2 hours to finish which felt about right given the nifty tech tree.  This is one of the games I'm not sure how well it would work with fewer players.  The best/funniest part of our game was when the selection you wanted to make was taken by another player...or when we tried to psyche another player into taking a certain spot.  "I'll take the 12, wait...it's not my turn...ok you go...but not the 12 please".  The main weakness I saw is the battles.  You roll a die and add that to your combat strength.  Greater than the monster is a win, less is a loss, even is a tie.  While winning or tieing is not a big deal...losing can be catastrophic.  So the difference between a win or a loss can come down to a critical die roll.  We rolled a "1" in a key battle, and it cost one player a level 4 building he had just built (a VP producer).  A "1" was probably the only bad roll for him and sent him from the penthouse to the outhouse just like that.  Very tough to recover.  Last, I'm not sure how many different strategies (on the tech tree) there are.  This game may become stale w/repeat plays.  If so, I'd probably drop it down to a 6.

Update: I have played this a *lot* online.  Finally got a 2nd play in face-to-face.  This one has lost its shine.  Lack of different strategies is the main reason I no longer want to play it.  Maybe I overdid it with the online plays.  Dropping it from 7 to 6..probably should make it a 5.

I played Kingsburg once in person and about a dozen times against the computer version downloadable here on BoardGameGeek. Unfortunately, while I found it somewhat enjoyable in those plays, I ultimately decided that the game just seemed to lack enough strategic depth be worth purchasing. Its not that there weren't choices in the game. There were. It just seemed that there were only a small number of paths to victory, and while they all seemed to have a reasonable shot at pulling victory out (assuming one got reasonable luck and made good decisions) exploring those paths over and over again lack enough of a pull to make me especially thrilled with the game.

Players roll 3 or more dice each, and take turns assigning them to roles on the player board.  Roles assign out goods, military aid and extra abilities.  Goods build buildings, granting special powers; aid fights off foes at the end of each year.  It's all about gaining victory points for buildings, abilities and defeating foes.  Nice growth game that plays intuitively and very well.  May be a touch too long for the gaming payback, but it's not a big deal.  I enjoyed this game but have a couple of concerns - you do have to roll well to have a chance of winning, some of the buildings seem very powerful (the Town Hall/Embassy in particular), and the end of turn enemy didn't really seem that terrible.  I like the game, but hopefully the expansion will tighten things up a bit.

This game is the perfect blend of strategy and luck. I love the tension that is presented as you build your kingdom with the threat of an angry horde come winter time. Do I build that really nice high point building or do I ensure my kingdom is safe from attack? Will the dice be in my favor or not. The risk and reward in this game and the satisfaction of building a interconnected kingdom make this game super fun and accessible!

The low rating is mainly for two reasons. The tedium of figuring out (and waiting for others) your options while re-re-recounting your dice & the inability to adversely affect an opponent. It's kind of solitaire in that a blocking move (if you're lucky enough to have one) will set you back too much to be beneficial. It's a decent game, just not something I would jump to play again.

I suspect the mechanics of the Kings Favour needs looking at and if I play it again I will try it without this element - probably remove kings favour and the kings dice roll at the end of turns as currently you are better building a couple of defensive buildings early on then stockpiling resources and taking advantage of the KIngs Favour before racing building production up the points line at the end. 

It isnt a bad game and would make a good introduction to worker placement but as I said I will try it without the king elements if I play again.

The dice allocation is similar to Yspahan or To Court The King, and the end-of-year event is like the Pirates from Galaxy Trucker.   The building phase is like a million other games.   So, you get the idea?   There's nothing new here.   It's done well, looks very cool, but probably isn't a game that will have much staying power.   However, I enjoyed it and probably would enjoy it a few more times too.   Quite a bit overpriced, too.

I like this game, but I'm not enamored with it. Several of the buildings seem like obvious choices (Inn, Market as opening moves, etc). I think the expansion would boost my rating by a point or two if indeed the new player sheets give you some other varied and valid routes to victory. Although $30 MSRP seems like a little steep for an expansion of that sort.

This game is much better now with the expansion. I've bumped my rating by a point.

Based on 2 games. I simply dislike the games where the dice plays such great role and 'Kingsburg' is one of them. Although you can influence the dice by same game feature it's still dreadful when you know the enemy card in the last round, you do enything you can to fight it successfully (buy proper buildings, employ the knights) and the only result on the dice which is the losing tie comes true because the roll is exactly '1'.

I found my first game of Kingsburg rather average. A second game is needed to have a better opinion of this game. Not sure what to make of Kingsburg.

Some interesting ideas. Nice components. Screwage factor. Too much thinking for nothing, A bit long, random, luck(dice fest) and boring. Light game overall.

Unlucky with the dices and it could hurt you. 
Not something I would want to play anytime soon.

Tryed Kingsburg again without the expansion this time and it adds so much to the game. Expansion is worth getting for any Kingsburg fan. Don`t play Kingsburg with the expansion.

Kingsburg is worth trotting out every so often.  It's very thematic, but not too much of a Euro.  High replayability and some unique mechanics.

Number 1 in my heart :D

I love love love this game.  The game board is absolutely gorgeous and the components are top notch.  I've yet to play this with someone for the first time and not had them stare interestedly at each piece as we pull it out for setup.  

It's incredibly easy to teach and pick up so I don't find you have to 'go easy' on new players the first game.  Every person I've introduced it to with my husband has found the game fun and competitive.  At first glance, the game seems simple.  However, it's incredibly strategic.  Knowing when to go for the statue, or locking down position 1 is crucial to being successful at the game.

This next statement is probably what makes me love this game the most: for a dice rolling game, you are not relying heavily on luck.  An opponent can roll 17 three or four times during a game, yet if you understand what buildings to go after, they don't necessarily win.

I could say more, but I think everyone who would read this has played Kingsburg with me and is well aware of my love for this game

This is a dice rolling euro in the same vein as Yspahan and Stone Age.  It definitely has some interesting mechanisms but I definitely have some issues with the game.  First it's a too long for what it is, especially with 5 players.  Second, you basically have to build a lot of structure's that provide defense to you in battle otherwise you could lose in the Winter phase which usually means an auto-loss.  This generally means that you feel like you're doing the same thing game after game.  I don't mind some dice rolling in games, but I feel like the combination of rolling low or rolling results that put you in competition for good spaces really frustrating.  The expansion really improves the game.

Very enjoyable dice based worker placement mechanic. Resource collection and conversion to buildings yields victory points. The card draft and reveal of the hidden enemy horde puts a premium on defense measures. The pleasure and the pain come from trying to strike the right balance. VPs are all out in the open and oh so very dear. Small gains and losses are meaningful in Kingsburg. Don't expect to lap the board ala Stone Age, this is tight one. Good with two. Looking forward to trying it with four.

Played once. Expect some randomness. May go too long for what it is; I felt like I reached a point in my game where a single die roll influenced by game heavily (1-2-3 I lose, 4-5-6 I win). If you're expecting that, it may not be a problem for you. Not completely random, there are a lot of decisions here, heavily influenced by dice.

This game is growing on me.  I don't really like dice games, generally speaking, but this one has a lot going for it. 

-- Update after a couple 5-player games.  Downgraded from 8 to 7.  Three and 4-player games are still around 7.5 - 8 for me, but I've seen a few situations with 5 where the high roller had litterally 0-1 options for placement early in the game, often getting only 1 resource.  Very disappointing.

Falls far short of To Court the King. TCtK has a brilliant story arc where players are given the opportunity to get more dice to achieve ever more difficult combinations. It doesn't happen in Kingsburg. You need to roll high dice but you don't get a lot of dice to do it in (which makes Farms an almost must-have in the game). Definitely a game of limited replayability.

RATING: 7
I like this game, but the luck of the dice can be infuriating.  Our last game, a player at the table was first in turn order the entire game, never rolled higher than an 8, and several times rolled 6 or under.

On top of that, early bad rolls are far worse than mid-game ones.

This is a hard one to rate since I think the expansion raises it to an 8 or 9.

RATING: 8
Not many games with dice are that great, but this one is nice! Good that there are also some advantages to having a 'bad' throw. For my taste, the game takes a bit too long with more than 3 players, because you then spend most of your time doing nothing (there is not too much you can think of during other people's turn). After a while it also really needed the expansion, but that definitely revived the game for me. One of the few games that I already enjoy playing for years.

Splendid family level worker placement game. Heavy on luck because of the core dice rolling mechanic, but there are satisfying decisions to be made all the time. I really like the buildings, kind of a simplified Puerto Rico thing. Kind of annoyed the expansion is necessary, not optional. The components are nearly perfect. I only wish the building sheet was cardboard and not just thick paper.

To Forge a Realm expansion included.

I would place this in the gateway game category, though it's a stretch from Yahtzee or any standard dice game. The placement rules are the easiest to grasp and you can become quickly invested in that aspect, as soon as players start getting cut off. It's revised form, Kingsport Festival, is certainly a step up in complexity and theme, but I wouldn't say is more or less fun that the original.

Weight of 2.40, so it isn't too hard to learn, another worker placement game.  Check the video review for more.

Impressions after one play:
1. The dice mechanism complicates things and creates analysis paralysis.  Rather than just focusing on making a decision from the choices available to you (as in other worker placement games, like Agricola, Stone Age, Pillars of the Earth), you have to do some brain burning figuring out which options are even available to you in the first place.  This creates downtime and I'd rather be using thinking time to be deciding on which option is best, rather than figuring out which options are available
2. The fighting at the end of each round adds a risk element to the game: do you play conservatively and perhaps "waste" precious resources to build up a solid defensive base of soldiers, or do you focus on expanding your kingdom and getting victory points, at the risk of losing big?  Is this element of risk management good?  I didn't care for it.  I don't mind games with luck (example: Thebes), but here the luck can trump good strategy.  It can have too big an impact on the game, and takes away from the strategic decision making in the rest of the game.
Overall: there are better worker placement games to choose from.  But I'd like to play this again with more players as part of 100 in 25 Challenge.

Kingsburg was a lot of fun for a while. I got over two dozen plays out of it, a lot of them on BSW while traveling for work, but I couldn’t be persuaded to play the game now what with Troyes on my shelf. I think it was a nice design for the period it came out, but it's been superseded. I played most of my plays with the military rule from the expansion, in fact, we played with that having learned of it on BSW before the expansion was actually released, and I think it's the only way to play or else a player who ignores military can get help too easily from the king. 

The problem with KB is that there isn't enough dynamism in the game in a couple ways. First, there's no way to mitigate high vs low rolls (as opposed to Troyes where you can buy other players' dice or Castles of Burgundy where 6 is not higher than 1). Second, we always went the same way, up the military track first and hit the top track for VPs last. Our games came down to us all pretty much doing the same thing and just seeing who rolled better at doing it.

The expansion tries to address these problems with event cards and different building tracks that you can lay over the original building tracks, but the events just added more unpredictability. I can't say I played with the new tracks enough to comment on them, but the fundamental problem of high vs low dice rolling is still here. I appreciate KB for the fun it gave me, but I'd much rather play one of the new dice strategy designs such as Troyes or Castles of Burgundy.

Lots of blocking other players' strategies and battling for scarce resources.  All the components were gorgeous.  Good fun.

After multiple plays, I've downgraded the rating for this game because there are other worker placement games out there that are more exciting. But I still enjoy the game's use of "influence" to determine resources.  Still has a place on my shelf and has been good with non-gamers.

Kingsburg is obviously a creative and well constructed game.  It of course relies heavily on dice rolls, and although there are many ways to mitigate against this, unlike Stone Age they don't seem to be helpful enough.  

So in the end Kingsburg seems a little too random and chaotic for my tastes.

My kind of game, although I played badly. Nice mix of luck and choices, progression and VPs. I can't pin down why this works for me and Pillars Of The Earth doesn't, but this isn't exact. I think that Kingsburg gives me a lot more options, especially in the placing of the dice, and the progession leads somewhere and not just to more VPs. *** Gave an extra 0.5 to my rating because finally I won, but only because the king's army roll was a 1 not a 2+, which meant that the leader's Cathedral was knocked down. This is the first time I've seen a building fall. In recent games, players race towards the Wizards Castle first, then to the Cathedral. Does the game need a tiny tweak, maybe slightly harder monsters?

Based on 4 plays with 2 players, and 1 play with 4 players. Setting the issue of dice aside for a moment, the game gets into a groove fairly quickly when playing with two. It's considerably better with 3 or more. I wouldn't recommend Kingsburg for less than 3 players, as otherwise it overstays its welcome. You can learn the strategy quickly, so you need those extra players to liven things up. 

01/19/2010 Update:
Funny how playing a new game, can prompt you to drop the rating for another. After playing Airships, Kingsburg has dropped in my estimation. (Two points) The problem with Kingsburg, is that the dice dictate what you can do. There's little tension, and no real "pushing your luck" element. In Airships, the tension is introduced when you choose what to go for BEFORE you roll. This simple change makes a world of difference.

Jan 2012: I am not a big dice game guy, but I thought this had potential. Played it (even won) but just didn't catch. Like most dice games, there is no mechanism to compensate for bad dice rolls, but even further the acquisition of buildings is linear and (to me) the powers are to samey and uninteresting.

I really like this one.  It moves quickly, and it partially subverts the whole "build things to please the king" trope by including threats from monsters, which is kind of awesome. A great game that I think deserves a place alongside Catan, 7 Wonders, etc.

We've used all of the [thing=39775]expansion[/thing] elements now, and we strongly prefer playing with the new Province sheets all the time. Everything else is good but not essential.

Allocate dice to draw resources, in order to build buildings and resist the monsters coming in Winter. Clean, elegant game.

Duration: Fast, little downtime.
Design: Played with dice, the board, a couple of counters, and the monster deck. You react to luck and try to block your opponents; interaction is limited to this denial mechanic.
Strategy: The major choices are how to allocate your dice, and which buildings to build.
Theme: Fun fantasy theme that fits nicely.

RATING: 7.5
Only played the 2 player variant, slightly different than suggested in the rulebook (throwing 3, 2, 1 & 1 dice from other colors, to have less options available). I had thought a bit more of it, though it sure is a decent game. But it lacks more building options (players tend to go for the same), more (bit stronger ?) enemy cards and perhaps also some more characters. So perhaps I should try the expansion when I can find it (cheap) ? And maybe it also didn't help our first experience that in the beginning I outthrowed my opponent like 7 times in a row, building a gap that eventually wasn't possible to catch up again. Though this surely has to become less of a problem when playing with more. Therefor I'm rating it a 7 for now, though with only 2 players I feel more for just 6/10.

Nem rossz dice placement játék. Egyike volt az elsőknek ezzel a mechanikával, ha ne az első. Sajnos ez kicsit érződik is rajta, talán először éreztem egyértelműen, hogy egy játék felett eljárt az idő. Nagyon hasonló játékokból vannak már lényegesen jobbak is. Fura volt, a harc randomitása, az hogy ha teljesen kiszorítanak a tábláról, akkor sincs semmi vigaszdíj, illetve a játékidőt irreálisan soknak éreztem a mélységhez képest. Több, mint két óra egy ilyen randomságú játéknál, szerintem már nagyon sok.
De egyáltalán nem rossz darab, csak ha ma diceplacementet kéne választanom, akkor számos darab kerülne előbb szóba, és ez a darab igazából semmi pluszt nem azokhoz képest, tényleg szinte pure mechanika.

Kingsburg is a dice roller's version of a resource conversion game. Ideally, in such a game it wouldn't matter much whether you roll high or low. Kingsburg does have a lot of options, and many ways to mitigate bad rolls, but high rolls are still far superior. This is because of the much reduced competition for the high spaces and because, when you do choose to hedge your bets, you'll still lose against those who don't and simply roll well when defending the realm at the end of the year.

Supposedly, the expansion fixes at least some of those issues.

Trouver une strategie infaillible a Kingsburg, c'est comme percer le mystere de la Caramilk.
Allez downloader et imprimer les 4 scenarios sur le site de FFG ou Edge. 

Upgrade a 9 si jouer avec l'expansion.

Feels like Alien Frontiers, but with AF, you can slow down the leader more easily. I still prefer Kingsburg with expension or online add-on.

Kingsburg may be my favourite action selection game of all time. The way that it utilizes dice as an input mechanism instead of a way to determine outcome is simply amazing.

It has several strategies that can lead to victory and finding out what you can do with your dice results is a puzzle that never looses it's appeal.

1/27/08 - raised rating from 7 to 8 after four or five plays now. Nice use of dice. Fun game with decisions to be had. Need to constantly change your gameplan depending on rolls. Not everyone will enjoy the luck factor of the dice but there are some balancing factors. It does appear so far that the envoy only keeps you in the game, seems better to play from ahead or middle of pack, not behind with the envoy.

A clever dice game where you use toe dice rolls to influence people to get resources that you use to build various building for points.  It is pretty light so I feel as though I have already played it out.  I'm not entirely unsure that there are but 2 or 3 solid paths to victory in the building tracks.  It certainly helps to roll better than your opponents.  I don't think this one has staying power after the novelty wears off.

This one has really taken me by surprise.  It's fun and full of meaningful decisions.  It feels medium weight and strategic, yet is easy to learn after just a few turns.  Very different from Stone Age, even if it scratches some of the same "itch." I think I enjoy it even more than Stone Age, and am glad to own both of these unique games.

Pales slightly next to its successors Lords of Waterdeep and Champions of Midgard, but breezier and features an interesting dice mechanic applied to resource gathering.

Kingsburg is a great game with a really fun dice placement mechanic. The game is fairly easy to teach and I will immediately add in the expansion when teaching new players, since the expansion makes it even better.

Kingsburg is a pleasant game and feels pretty good when playing it, but I find luck rules a little too much in this one. I never really feel the control that is granted through the dice combination makes up for the time that this game takes. I think if Kingsburg was 30 minutes and a little lighter, the luck of dice would feel more justified. Instead, I feel like I'm playing a middle-weight game with lighter mechanics. So, not a bad game but not one of my favourite dice games.

After one play we agreed this game was a good time, easy to pick up and fast to play (depending on the tendency the group has for analysis paralysis).  This game has so many "rubber bands", moreso than power grid, that it should almost always be a close game that encourages lots of ducking.  I really enjoyed the dice rolling and distribution, and the player interaction regarding advisor selection.

I played this game only 2-3 times and I was surprised for its original mechanics.

Good solitaire game against AI for killing time. But this is one I am very reluctant to play face to face with humans and actual dice. It's just far to sluggish and fiddly for the real world.

Clever use of dice lift it above the run-of-mill, but can drag surprisingly given the simplicity of the actions at each stage.

It looks like a dice game, in fact, it has dice!  There is a lot more to this though, even more so than Yspahan which I also enjoy.  The artwork is fun, the options for building are great and you have to love the impending attack at the end of each year.  We played with 3 and as soon as we grasped the options, the game played pretty quickly.  I suspect people that complain about the length played with 5 players and it was their first time playing, so that slowed them down as well.  Both games that I have played of this so far have been very close.  Nice game.

Unsure.  May be too much of a 'multi-player' solitaire.  Sometimes called light and gateway.
April 2008, ConVic 7 - first play.  Fun, if somewhat long game of building your 'barony' to be the best possible.  Place markers on your building track consuming goods granted by the rolling of your dice.  Defending the kingdom mechanic is somewhat lame and could've been improved (IMHO).  I'll begin with a hesitant 7/10 to be changed upon more plays and deeper analysis.  
May 2010 - The solider mechanic has been fixed with the expansion 0,1,1,2,3,4 chits that you use for your personal army.  This fixes my major gripe with the game and lets me give it a solid 7.  Without this "variation" I'd give Kingsburg a 5.

It's a simple game that plays quick, is tense and has some simple blocking interactions. Since the only thing that changes between games are the invaders, I imagine that it will get old rather quick. The strategy is rather obvious and rolling high is almost always better, so it's quite luck-dependent. It's a bit fiddly, there's a lot of powers that need to be triggered and remembered, which really hurt its status as a family-friendly gateway game. I enjoyed the game, it moves along nicely and it's always tense to roll the combat die at the end of each year, but the game feels underdeveloped. Hopefully the second edition will alleviate this.

It may just have been the group I played the first game with, but this game seems to induce AP. Being an analytical person myself, I usually don't complain about long turns, but one player in my game at bgg.con got yelled at (by his wife, fortunately) for taking 15 minutes to do his turn; while she might not have timed it precisely, sadly it wasn't enough of an exaggeration to qualify as hyperbole.

Apparently there are few enough possibilities that some people think they can calculate them all, but enough options that they really can't - at least not in a reasonable time. If this becomes a pattern, I may I need to either play only with math geeks who can do simple combinatorics in their head quickly, or bring a timer.

Played twice, four players was better than three players.  There's not enough interesting variation in what the different people (numbers) offer you.  It seems like the lower numbers need to be stronger than they are so that splitting your dice up is more profitable than lumping them together.  Also, there's probably too much information to analyze for such a light game - if I go here, she'll have to go here and then he'll be stuck with this unless she goes there instead in which case . . . .  Finally, the attack at the end of each year didn't seem to be threatening enough to inspire fear.  The game was decent fun, though.  I would play again if invited, but wouldn't ever suggest it.

[UPDATE] Played a couple more games that included the expansion. Wow, the expansion addresses all of the game's weak points and really kicks Kingsburg up several notches. I'm raising my rating a point as a compromise between the so-so base game (rating=6) and the excellent expansion (rating=8).

I have had some concerns that there are only a few different viable strategies to pursue and with repeated plays this view has been solidified. That does not matter that much because there are many small tactical decisions in the game which does make up for it. The game is quite long for its strategic hollowness, but that honestly don’t detract from the fun of the game. The turns go relatively quickly except when there are some tough decisions.

So what’s the main attraction of the game for me?  At least when this came out, in most games with dice, the decisions were trivial. Not in this game as there usually seems to be more than one way to place them, especially considering the psychological aspect of what other players plan are. You can play this game as a competitive game, but it also suit well for casual plays.

I think this game works best for three or four players. With just two players it seems to lose tension and with five players there can be problem with over analysis as there are many combinations of the dices. With more players this game is more cut throat as more dices are placed on the board. The second row is more important in those games because it gives more flexibility.

I really enjoyed my play of this, but I'm glad I didn't buy it unseen. I love dice games and this one is no exception. But I never really felt clever playing it (with the expansion). The player interaction is strong in this one and that's a plus, but the strategies didn't feel deep and it didn't seem like there was a ton of ability to synergize between buildings and action spaces. Willing to play just about anytime, but probably won't own.

One play with four. I definitely liked the idea of it, but I found it a bit of a chore keeping in mind all the fiddly little bonuses from my buildings.

My friend called it a fantasy-themed spreadsheet and he's not far wrong. Nice components but the look leans toward the busy side. Feels about one round too long. Scores seemed artificially close. I'd like it better if it had more theme -- rolling dice and moving them around just feels like rolling dice and moving them around; I never felt as if I was playing politics and influencing key citizens of the city. I'd play it again but I wouldn't call for it.

RATING: 5.5
Seems like an interesting game in theory, but in practice, several fatal flaws show themselves:

1) The supposedly balanced die rolls aren't.  Low die rolls force you to spend several dice for a single resource, especially when traffic clogs up the lower numbered advisers.  High ones get you almost a guaranteed 1 die per resource or better.  Roll a few fives or sevens back to back, and you might as well forget playing any further.
2) The rich get richer as their buildings protect their other buildings from the monsters.  Meanwhile the poor get poorer as they randomly lose more and more buildings and find it harder to protect the ones they have.  The production-helping buildings are interesting, but no one can focus on them, since the battle-helping buildings are so vital.
3) The "catch-up" mechanic doesn't nearly compensate, since getting the resources to build two buildings at once is next to impossible after the first column is done, and the extra die can fail you as easily as the first 3 dice do.  The doubling up on one adviser is nice, but an extra resource or two each year won't get you back in the game.
4) Being forced into losing your "best" building when you lose a building is crippling.  Late in the game, you've just blown several turns of resource collecting and a turn of building with nothing to show for it.  Letting you keep the victory points (or some fraction thereof) from a destroyed building would at least soften the blow, as would letting you choose the building that's destroyed, within some parameters.
5) Too many combinations of dice and action choices cause extreme Analysis Paralysis.  (Do I add my  2 here, and use my inn there? If I choose wood&gold here, I have to swap gold on 6, but if I choose stone&wood, I have to swap wood on 6, etc.)

Overall, I'd need some heavy convincing to make me try this one again.

RATING: 8.7
Reminds a bit of "when Yspahan meets Notre Dame" except the rats are the enemy hordes. I like the theme here a little better. It feels well balanced. There is interaction on the decision when choosing what action, because that one will be exhausted for that turn. Otherwise the players do not harm themselves. So it's still a family friendly game with enough options for an ambitious player as long as he is willing to handle de luck factor. The sweet spot are 3 and 4 players. Only two are too easy and 5 players takes too long. Rating after at least 5 plays (3-4player).Best personal score so far: 51 VP in a four player game.Even though there is luck of the die roll the game hits a sweet spot with me and I had to uprate it from 7 to 8 to 8.5 after ten plays. This game from a small publisher was a great surprise and I am looking forward to the expansion announced for Essen 2008.

I have only played a couple of times yet I could play it again in 6 months and I think I would remember how it goes without getting the rule book out. This game has a unique feel. The play grinds along a bit waiting for players to ponder the posibilities. I was introduced to Stone Age at about the same time as I was introduced to Kingsburg, the games have a similar weight and play time but for me Stone Age is the better game. Sept 08

*UPDATE* It is too easy to defeat the evil hordes at the end of each year when playing with just the base game, effectively removing a significant amount of tension and spoiling the theme. I only want to play this now if you include at least some of the ellements from the expansion. I have only so far played with gamers but I might try it with my teenage kids this summer. May 11

Based on one play. Interesting game. I'd would say that Kingsburg is what Comuni failed to be. 

Maybe future plays will change my rating.

Better game than first rated. It is not something I'd play everyday but I won't turn down a game either. A solid "7" from me.

One of the better "strategic dice games" designed in a while (I do not consider Yspafan to be a "dice game") and as such quite impressive. It would be even more enjoyable if its playing time was cut down by some 20-30 %, e.g. by having 4 instead of 5 rounds.

First reactions are very positive for this clever dice game. Partner likes it too so lots more games to come..

After 7 games I really love this game. The mechanics are superb, the turns fly by and the scoring is always super close.
With the addition of the expansion this is now in my top three games. Also with the easy variant it plays very well with 2.

Ok bidding game, would play again.  Really seems to be best with the expansion.  Might have been something I'd play with non-gamer family if not for the fantasy theme.  The threat cards at the end of each turn could easily have been various realistic armies/sieges.

It's not real heavy, but the demons, and other typical fantasy fare can be a barrier to many non-gamers I know.  My typical gamer group likes more ameritrash in their fantasy fare, and my non-gamer family who will play some lighter modern games are turned off by the theming.

A fun game with a fairly strong luck component.  It's like To Court the King in some ways, but a little less dice-centric, with a little more strategy.  Some parts lend themselves to overanalysis... just don't let it happen.  Also, there's a strange mix of a solitaire problem AND a "randomly screwed by other players" problem.  Not perfect, but fun.

There are some interesting ideas here, but they add up to be tedious and frustrating rather than exciting or involving. The luck of the dice have a substantial impact on the game that seems impossible to overcome. Also, basic gathering of resources felt more difficult than it should be for a game of this type. The battle at the end of the year seemed like a transparent gimmick designed to control the way resources are spent. The artwork was beautiful, but the graphic design was way too busy. I really don't understand the high rating for this one.

A fun little game. I'm a fan of the fantasy theme and the resource/building aspect, and I'm becoming a fan of dice in games where the luck of the dice can be mitigated with some skillful play, as in Yspahan. This has a good balance so that better players will probably win but new players will not be too far behind.

RATING: 7.9
Using combinations of dice as worker placement is very interesting.  The buildings make it feel like Puerto Rico, but the dice and resources feel like Stone Age.  It's a very tight game and always is close towards the end.  Can suffer a little bit from analysis paralysis.  

Overall a great game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game shines with fast, experienced players.  Do you split your dice and try to go for more stuff, or keep them together and go for higher numbers?  I love the worker-placement type aspect of this, and trying to get the most out of the numbers you roll.  This can really (REALLY) drag with AP players, which is why I stopped playing this in tournaments.  My wife has spoiled me - we can finish a 2P game in 20-30 minutes, so it *kills* me when it takes 90 minutes with a full table of APers.

I want to play this again to see if rating goes up.  First play was fine, I enjoyed it but didn't love it.  I think it was because I rolled horribly all game which limits your ability to do things.  I really wanted to like it, so will definitely give it a second chance.

I really enjoy this game. I like the dice allocation mechanic. It's fun trying to figure out what your opponents are going to buy so you can maximize your resources. There's plenty of strategy, but it isn't prone to analysis paralysis. Each decision is fairly straightforward. There aren't any tricky calculations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Rolling dice as workers and choosing between individual values or any sum of three to place is excellently done. This part is very enjoyable. The building tableau is a bit difficult. Each building gives an ability that will activate at various times over the turn. With over half a dozen buildings built, it is unnecessarily difficult to remember each bonus and their place in the turn sequence. I would like to see a similar dice placement mechanic with a better tableau implementation. Clearer "when to activate" cues would go a long way. Possibly individual tiles like Favor of the Pharaoh.

For me the java version temporarily ruined both the FTF version and the BSW version. I got so used to playing against the bots that playing on BSW seemed glacial by comparison. I went through the following stages: 
1. This game seems to be pretty much all about how well you roll. 
2. No, there's some strategy here with blocking and selecting a build path. 
3. I was right the first time. There's an ideal build path so it ends up coming down to how well the dice get you there. 

It looks like the expansion solves a lot of the replay problems of the original game, as well as fixing the random battle. (I don't think Kingsburg is worth playing without the combat tokens from the expansion.)

Lance (Undead Viking) turned me on to this and I will be forever grateful.  I tend to rate low (because I go by the ratings descriptions) and that is probably the only reason this doesn't get a 10.  Closest thing to a euro-type game that I will pull out any chance I get.  Nice little Java version available for the computer too.

The dice rolling can be frustrating, but not so intrusive that you feel you are completely screwed by random chance.

The ability to be played in 1-1.5 hours is a big plus too as it feels like you have accomplished quite a bit in that amount of time.

One of a new wave of Euro games that feature an interesting die-rolling, worker-placement mechanism.. this time you are building a town over 5 years and trying to protect it from marauding monsters at the end of every year. The artwork and components are really nice, and the gameplay is fun, with plenty of tough decisions and screwage.
Points are scored for various buildings, and for fending off the monsters, as well as from the various advisers used to obtain resources throughout the game. 


Although a decent game in it's own right, it is let down a bit by the mechanism of the King's reinforcements, which has been completely changed in the expansion by including soldier tokens (the the rest of the expansion is pretty good too, but this part is essential)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great idea, to replace the workers from Caylus or Leonardo with dice.
As it is the game is good, but:
-with more than 3 it gets a little long for what it is
-after a couple of games, you feel you exhausted its possibilities: it is still fun, but all the games are the same. Hopefully the expansion will solve this.

RATING: 3
IMHO, the player rolling the highest will win the game.  What gets built is very similar between players, so the strategy can not be dramatically different, thus the higher die rolls get you more stuff sooner.  The invader mechanism tends to be either a non-issue due to the king's roll, or just a roughly equal effect on everyone.  Since the player with the most buildings gets a VP, and the player with the most buildings somewhat gets the most armies, the leader can really pull ahead, while the catch up mechanisms only help the last-place player.  Thus, the only real tension can be avoiding last place.I understand this is $60 in the US - way too much for what it is.

Euro dice game - or dice rolling made right. I was on the fence after my first game, but further plays turned out to be very enjoyable. The negative points are the little variety in the advisors' rewards, a bit long playing time and lackluster (often too easy) battles. Also, the inherent luck of the dice may be manageable, but never eliminated, of course. On the positive side, the dice mechanic feels fresh, the buildings seem very well balanced and they provide many viable strategies. The fantasy theme is another plus.

I've played the PC game many times before I could play the boardgame and while I liked the PC version (which can be done within 30 minutes), the boardgame takes WAY too long. For a game this easy with very limited options, 90 minutes is atleast 30 minutes too long and it can still take another 30 mins. depending on the players.

The game itself isn't that interesting, though. It's not bad, but in the end, it's just another game about getting resources to build up buildings that give you abilitys and points. This time it's done with dice in a very overproduced manner, that's all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The farm track seems way too powerful, and the military buildings seem only good in the first year.  Otherwise, just spend a die to buy soldiers instead of wasting a building on a  1.  I really like the core of the game, but it seems like it could use a few tweaks here and there.  I didn't like the way the winter portion was handled at all.

Okay this has been a surprisingly enjoyable game for either 4 or 5 players.  Sure it's all about dice throwing and is really into luck of the dice, but we've found it pretty fun.

Easy to teach and learn, it's certainly one i find easy to bring off the shelves time and again on board game days.

I found the game enjoyable, but not quite as much as I would have thought. It's my sort of game, dice rolling, worker placement, but the whole thing felt a little... easy perhaps. At least when played with two players. The 'best' strategy seems pretty obvious, even from the first play, so it all really came down to the luck of the roll, though there was never a time in the game where poor luck seemed to cause particular hardship. Battles were won pretty easily, buildings were built every time by both players. Just hoped in the end for something a bit more.

Easy to learn, and diverse appeal. The dice allocation mechanic for acquiring goods / benefits is great fun, working the best with 4-5 players (which ramps up the tension and tactics given the limited spaces). It's enjoyable trying to strike the right balance of buildings to advance your score and protect your village at the same time. 

On the downside, you're building the same things every game, often in the same (or very similar) order, which does limit the game's replayability and strategic depth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Low interaction game with a lot of luck and a serious tendency towards analysis paralysis as people feel the need to work out what every player will do before performing their turn.  Its also about twice as long as it should be.  

Our game was surprisingly close for a game where dice rolling and the chaos of the other player's decisions can screw you over easily.

Despite all my problems with the game, its very easy and can be pretty fun.  The different buildings give each player different strategies to try out and the stuff going on is well balanced.  The components are pretty nice but the theme is tacked on.  The dice rolling mechanic is very cool and 3d6 allows for a nice bell curve.  If you build the re-roll building early the luck can't hose you too bad.

OK game for people who want something that isn't too complex, but not enough replayability to satisfy most.

I was ready to really like this one and it ended up just being pretty good. I liked the usage of dice. The main thing that I didn't like was that it was very tactical and not very strategic. I looked at the board and tried to make my plan for the game and was thwarted at every turn by the resources I was able to aquire. It seems like you need to roll and see what resources you can get and then decide what to do with them. In this way, it seems that the game plays you a little bit. For the amount of randomness and lack of control, it seems to last a bit too long. Even so, it was a fairly different approach to resource generation and I really liked that. I feel like there are probably just better games of this type.

RATING: 3
After one play, I'm not likely to play this again.  There is way too much dependence on dice rolls -- if someone consistently rolls high and gets to pick the Queen (17) or King (18) many times, they will win.  If you're stuck rolling 7s or 8s, it takes 2-3 turns to get the resources that they get in one turn, and you will lose.  Furthermore, the game can slow down a lot as each person tries to figure out the possible partitions of *all* the players' dice rolls, the motivation of the other players (that is, what numbers are they likely to try to claim), and how to block them while maximizing your own use of your dice.  This is not an interesting problem; it's tedious and rather random.

Someone said it was like Caylus combined with Yspahan.  I agree -- it has the weaknesses of both games.

The first play was horrible, I didn't see how important military is and was destroyed by rampaging hordes every single time they came around.

The second play was a lot better, even though I'd prefer a peaceful way of life in games like that, one where you'd build neat stuff that remedies the damage or sends them to the neighbours instead. Well, this isn't such a game, and realizing that helps a lot for enjoying it.

The expansion adds some really neat things, too, I think it's necessary to fix the game (at least concerning military with those token thingies) and adds variety with the alternate buildings.

RATING: 8
There is more game here than meets the eye! Gameplay is balanced, regardless of the fact that one rolls 3d6 at each production phase.  The die rolls act as a limit to your actions, as you can get from 1 to 3 "rewards" each turn.  The bonus " 2" markers and the Farm's extra white die work very well in this system.

During our first 4-player game, two players had not focused on scoring victory points, thus the spread was large.  The second game saw a result of 36-35-35-32, with the player in last having dropped from 37 due to failing a combat against the dreaded Dragon.

Feels like a mix of ROMA, adding multiplayer capabilities, and CAYLUS, where resource management is key.  Player interaction (i.e. blocking) is limited to the die placement on the Influence board.  Players can build what they want on their "land" (board), assuming they have the required resources, and follow the building "tree" (which is very straight forward).  The rules are easy to learn, and the game can be thought quickly.

This may just be the best light Euro in my collection!

Kingsburg is a simple, but fun, dice game.  I am not certain if it is considered a "gateway game", but it certainly could be used as one.  It is simple to teach and play.

Each turn, you will roll between 3 and 5 dice (usually 3 or 4).  Then, based on the numbers rolled by your dice, you can pick an adviser or advisers to gain resources, victory points, etc.  You can also block your playing partners from obtaining these spots for that season.

The game is fun to try to balance resource and/or victory point gathering with building up defenses.  There is risk here, so that adds a nice element, too.

The only downside is that I always feel like rolling 3 dice (or 4...and rarely, 5) is just not enough.  This is not really a problem with the design of the game, per se, but rather just a general feeling that my family and I get throughout the game.  In other words, we want to do more with our turns.  Also, while the defense mechanism adds value, it seems like something is lacking just a touch in this department.

Overall, an enjoyable and simple game that does not take a lot of time to play.  Also, while players are somewhat at the mercy of what you roll, there is definitely strategy involved in dice placement and what you choose to build.

Played in a back-to-back comparison with Kingsport Festival.  Overall I liked this implementation better.  Sometimes adding variability via card play is helpful but sometimes the added complexity doesn't pay off.  In this case, the simpler version is the better one (kind of an Occam's Razor for games).  I much preferred the favor selection as it seemed more malleable and the higher numbers were not nearly so overpowered relatively.  Also I loved the courtiers being generally very flavorful mechanically- especially with no text name, just an image.

This game is one in many recent games that use similar mechanisms, but it really works. When we first played it seemed that there was a problem with the leader just being unstoppable, but as we discovered later we were playing several things incorrectly. Once we got everything straightened out, the game took off for me. Yes, the dice rolling can really suck if you are doing poorly, but there are elements to help those falling behind and there are bonuses for those doing things right. Plus it plays just quick enough to not be too tough if you aren't doing well. The production is very nice and I'm very happy that they've got an English version that is considerably cheaper than the import.

Newer game with a neat dice rolling mechanic.  You influence advisers, collect resources, construct buildings on multiple paths, and fight a monster at the end of each year.  I'm very tired of the base game but looking forward to playing more of the "To Forge a Realm" expansion.

I do like this game quite a bit.  It has some planning, some luck, and doesn't overstay its welcome.  I think it may suffer long term from a bit too much luck, from each die roll to the battle monster and what risks you take.  The gameplay also seems prone to a runaway leader - if you lose a building to a battle and your opponent does not, it will take a swift breeze of luck to get on the same level again.

This dice-placement game is a clear forerunner to Alien Frontiers.  Unlike AF it offers a far widwe spectrum of choices for your dice; you are unlikely to not have anywhere to apply a rolled die.

It's a smooth-running Euro- accumulate resources, gather troops or build buildings, collect your VP.

It does strike as a little themeless (despite the attractive fantasy setting, the dice don't represent ships or anything recpgnizable as they do in AF), but it is a well-thought out game.

It seems many gamers feel that Kingsburg tends to play similarly after a while; I will want to add in the expansion set shortly and compare game variability.

Starting this at a 7 after (1) solo play.

Worker placement using dice.  Solid game and I will play it, but I feel the genre has progressed since this came out and there are better options now.  

It's kind of a light game so if you prefer lighter games run with this one.  Expansion is a great edition.

On the interesting mechanism for Kingsburg is the way you collect resources: by throwing dice AND choosing where you put said dice (splitting them up to your liking). The lower gets priority in choice as one can't share the same spot (with exceptions).

Large table needed though as there is an individual pad for each player to track down the buildings.

RATING: 7.5
A fun game based on dice rolls, gathering different building materials, and constructing buildings that give you victory points, military strength, resources and improved efficiency.  It seems luck-based at first glance, but there is much strategy in selecting the advisers, especially in a multi-player game.  I think this game is better with the expansion.

Not each development track is as interesting as the other. The building where you get 1 point per season is necessairy to win the game.So that narrows your strategies too much I think.
Plus if you throw high numbers, you have a much better chance to win the game.

RATING: 2
Dice-rolling yahtzee-fest. Poor rolling = poor game. That's how my first and last game of this luck-driven nonsense of a game went. It's a '2'.

Update (06/05/12): I was wondering why I enjoyed Castles of Burgundy so much, although it is another dice allocation game. The difference is that in CoB, the die rolls represent relatively [i]equal[/i] opportunities. Grabbing a one hex building may be more helpful, than selling goods, or placing another building on the tableau. In Kingsburg, the higher total rolls represent progressively better and [i]superior[/i] opportunities. Rolling 3x 6s is a rare event, and is arguably the best opportunity. Rolling 3x 1s is also rare, but is the worst situation. On the other hand, rolling 2x 1s in CoB does not carry the same meaning. It may represent an opportunity to pick up something in the '1' area, or put a building in a '1' spot, or sell a '1' good. One is not necessarily better than the other. How you discern the relative importance of each choice, and how you use those choices to leverage into more opportunities is the strength of CoB. Kingsburg is thus, arguably an inferior design that pastes a theme on luck-based results; you may as well play Yahtzee.

Thanks to my friends at ElfinWerks!  They are good people.  I've played this more with the Java application than live, and it has lost a bit of luster.  But, the artwork is beautiful, and the mechanics are good.  Five player gets a little cut-throat.  I won't turn down a game of this, but after so many plays, it doesn't hit the table as often.

Az egyik legjobb kockadobálós társasjáték. Három kockával dobunk és azokat kell felhelyeznünk a táblára, külön-külön vagy akár kettesével, akár hármasával. Így 1-től 18-ig vannak azok a helyek, amelyekre fel tudjuk rakni a kockákat. Ezeket a királytól, a máguson át az udvari bolondig a királyi udvar lakói jelzik. Mindenki más képességekkel rendelkezik, amelyek aztán segítenek az épületek építésénél. Három évszakban próbáljuk a királyi udvar tagjait befolyásolni, azaz nyersanyagokat beszerezni, majd az utolsó évszakban megküzdünk egy szörnnyel. 

Nagyon szórakoztató játék, sajnos az épületek miatt enyhén nyelvfüggő. Szép kivitelű játék, amely a kockadobások ellenére stratégiai játéknak minősül, ahol a győzelem több úton is elérhető. Én több mint 20-szor játszottam, de még nem untam meg, bár azt mondják, hogy a kiegészítő sokat dob rajta. Ki is akarom próbálni.

I enjoyed this game immensely.  The only negative is that the game seems to go on a bit too long.  The positives far outweigh that.  The game has dice, but the game really is about how to play the dice and negates the luck factor.  I think over the course of the game, it all evens out.  There are many ways to bend the rules with the dice as well.  I look forward to playing this one again, but with a group that will play quickly.

Another game, that didn't make the cut into making a (semi)permanent home in my collection due to never hitting the table. From the "solo" instances I played(4 ghost players essentially) the game has really good mechanics and doesn't seem like it would be hard to teach new people. 

Dice allocation is a nice mechanic that simulates worker placement to an extent, one of my favorite game mechanics. The game is made even better with it's expansion, "To Forge A Realm," which should be purchased without hesitation if you own the base game. 

Happy to hear that a reprint is on the way(2017) which incorporates "To Forge A Realm" expansion, and a bit more to boot. May pick it up again, because with the expansion, Kingsburg is amazing

OK, firstly this is what the designers intended it to be: light fun. Unfortunately it's still one pip short of a good roll. The problem is that rolling high is much better rewarded than rolling low (which is why an extra die is used as a catch up mechanism). Some of the prizes in the 18 squares are decidedly odd, with gold easier to get in quantity than wood or stone, which means getting the right combinations for buildings is harder than it should be. Bizarrely, the queen space gives a better reward than the king space. Finally, the various catch up mechanisms mean that scoring is tight, so winning comes down to luck on the final turns.

I enjoy the dice placement for resources and sense of building up your kingdom. However it does have its flaws which stop it from being truly great - can mostly pre-determine a strategy, luck of the winter battles, repetitive, low interaction. The expansion helps with some of these.

It's not that I mind dice.  It's just that the game seems designed to eliminate the possibility of long-range planning. It does have a very interesting variation on the worker-placement mechanic.  I'd like to see something similar to that in a more interesting game. (1 play)

RATING: 5
A lot of people like this game, and it has some mechanics I really enjoy.  Everyone likes building buildings that build on each other to give you nice abilities, and the resource management is accessible as well.

The biggest flaw in this game is the degree of randomness.  The dice placement is creative, however unlike many such games it is almost completely unmitigated: I don't care if I go first if I can only take one crappy action I wasn't going to lose out on anyways.  The foes that attack can be very harsh, which is fine, but all it takes is a series of bad dice rolls to be left totally aware of your fate and completely unable to change it.

These things would not be flaws in a somewhat more casual game, however it plays up to 5, and with 5 frequently takes two hours, which is quite a commitment for a game in which defeat can be so easily snatched from the jaws of victory.

Perhaps a little too much luck in the dice, especially the "armies the king sends" D6 roll at the end of each year, but even the 15 production rolls aren't quite enought to balance it out. However, overall this is a good game with lots of decisions and multiple possible strategies.

This game is FUN! It's POSSIBLE to get screwed by the dice, but you'd have to roll really, really badly. Otherwise, the built in balancing features more than make up for it.

You get the most resources by splitting your dice up, but people who don't split their dice up will obviously suffer the most from low rolls.

Mostly a fun worker placement game, but finally a game that makes the actual placement of workers an interesting game in and of itself.

RATING: 7
Based on one play: feels similar to Stone Age (the components are gorgeous, the basic gameplay is very simple, dice are combined with a worker placement mechanism). On first sight it lacks Stone Age's tension (or elegance) but has more different paths to victory (meaning it is more complex). The first play kind of dragged, because we were just trying to understand the usefullness of the advisors and building tracks. I think with repeated plays the game will be played faster and the subtelties of influencing the advisors by placing the dice will shine through. In that regard I feel it might be more strategic and interactive than Stone Age and might give more bang for the buck for the same game length. Also it plays with 5 and has an expansion for more variety.

Reasonably enjoyable dice roller that played pretty quickly (though I've heard it can bog down quickly if people try to maximize opponent screwage).  Not as interesting as Alien Frontiers, since higher rolls are inherently better and splitting up your dice to block other people usually means giving up a decent space to settle for two or three inferior spaces.  Is it really that much more beneficial to do that than simply grab the best space?  I mostly just took the best spaces I could and still ending up winning...

The game is honestly quite fun though it has its faults.  The expansion makes it much better.  The thing I really didn't like was the attacks at the end of each round.  The die roll ahead of the attacks made them seem dumb, because those who were unprepared could still pass them with a good die roll, making those who prepared for it disadvantaged because they spent resources preparing.

First played December 17th, 2008. Taught in 20min, played in 90min. This game has great luck/stragety ratio. The game is played over 5 years(round) of 4 season. Each player is given a player board to keep track of territory upgrades. The goal of the game is to have the most VPs at the end of the game. During the first three seasons in a round, each player rolls their dice to influence members of the council to gain resources. The lowest total is the first to place their dice on the game board and places die(ce) on one concil member and then turns are taken clockwise until all have placed all of their dice they wish. Then resources are awarded and you may build one upgrade per season. At the end of each yeas, you must fight invaders. Depending on if you are sucessfull or not, you can stand to gain or lose quite a bit. I'd strongly recommend giving this a go and consideration for purchase.

Traded Dungeon Petz for this plus expansion... mistake!
Kingsburg is similar to Alien Frontiers, rolling dice and assigning them to gather three types of resources.  When the dice rolls go against you, this game becomes hell.  Slow and extremely repetitive with little strategy, but holds a high degree of screw you (particularly against those who have rolled low die results).

Expansion helps with a bit of variety but can't overcome the dice rolling faults of this game.  Whereas Alien Frontiers is an excellent gateway game, Kingsburg is not.

Aug08: Oh look, more "worker placement", only it's dice this time. None-the-less, I almost enjoyed this game more. I only wish it had a deck of 300 cards to keep the game interesting. I followed the same building path as one other player and we pretty much left everyone else in the dust. That's not really a good sign to me. In fact, Ross even said there's just not much to Kingsburg after a few plays.

I like the short term dice work to an extent. Really though, most results came out samey. You pretty much get 2-4 resources per turn and can almost always get what you want.

So a good effort, but not that great.

A bit too dependent on luck for me (not something I usually say).  It seemed like the more experienced players had a system figured out for which buildings to buy.  The expansion with different paths for buildings should make this game better.  *Edit* I now have this on the iPad, I enjoy playing against the computer, still very luck driven.

It is an Ok game.  Somewhat like a more complicated To Court the King.

RATING: 7
Simple mechanics; moderate strategy; easy rules.  Very approachable for gamers/non-gamers alike both adult and teens.

While my rating for this game started with a 9 I have adjusted in after playing numerous games of Troyes, a dice rolling/worker placement game I have found to be far more strategic, replayable and rewarding.  Still love Kingsburg (and think the expansion is one of the best ever), but my tastes have changed (evolved?).

3/22/14 update:  just played with my 10 year old for the 1st time, and found two things to be true - very easy for this age group to pick up and that the game is not anywhere near as fun with only two.  The two of us played so I could teach her the game, but from now on I will never play with less than four.

IMHO this is a great gateway game to introduce non-gamers to games.I taught three non-gamers this the other day and they all enjoyed it.They especially liked the luck of using die but also the introduction of some strategy with how you use what you roll.  This perception was confirmed by my non-gaming wife (who would rather do almost anything else than play a board game)who after reluctantly agreeing to play stated at the end of the game, "I would play this again."Now that is some kind of endorsement!

I'm not a fan of dice-games.  Kingsburg seems even not so bad in that respect, but it was not exciting for me, buildings had similar abilities and some paths seemed to be more powerful than others.

RATING: 6
I liked this game but I played with the expansion which I heard fixes an issue or two (roll for king is one) and gives some more good choices so I'm unsure what I think of just the base game alone, I believe my rating should be close and with expansion about a 7.  

I really liked the different options on the main board and on the player board, some paths did seem significantly better than others but more than one way to skin the cat for sure and your decisions are meaningful for sure.  I Like the tech tree aspect and how there are a few paths to choose though I think the expansion helps here also. It seems even when rolling bad you still have some choice though rolling bad often will mean your chances to win will be much less than your opponents, over the course of a game it should mostly even out but not always. There are also ways to mitigate bad rolls which I liked, including some cards from expansion. I was surprised there was no end game scoring variant, even in the expansion. Expansion almost a must have for way more options and some fixes, the base game without would stale fast I think like 3 - 5 plays, with it not sure but many more for sure.  

The biggest plus might be it can work as a gateway and still keep a more avid gamer interested, very straightforward rules and play, turns move fast and the game is fun. Biggest knock is probably the length, 90 minutes would have been a great length, 2 hours is a little long for what it is. I don't remember off hand now how tweakable this is.

RATING: 6.5
Reasonably enjoyable game but it seems like there's really one way to play it. A full military strategy doesn't seem viable, it seems like your best bet is rushing a farm while making sure you can just barely beat the monster, and then work on getting as much of the top row as possible. I guess that's fine but for me for a game to be great I have to be able to do different things from time to time. Also the king's reinforcement die is absolutely terrible, the expansion is probably worthwhile just for the soldier tokens (though most of the other modules are also pretty cool). But yeah, probably a bit too much luck, though that's not such a problem with a lighter game like this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good, lightweight filler game that we often use to wrap up a session.  The gameplay is engaging, and even when you aren't getting anywhere, you still feel some sense of accomplishment with building buildings.  It's the right length for how heavy the game is, which is always a nice feature.

RATING: 7
A decent game. It seems to me that you'll be picking your victory path very early in the game and then it's just a question of sticking to it. The potential for player blocking and the monsters at the end of every year add some tension, but not enough for this to be a game I would request. Still, I'll play it and enjoy it if someone else wants it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There is enough dice rolling that the luck usually evens out over the course of a game.  Except for combat, but the expansion takes care of that.  I once played a game where four of the five players had a chance to win based on the roll of the last combat die (I was one of the four, but I didn't win).  I also played with the combat tokens from the expansion where two players were one point behind the winner (me).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.3
The luck of the roll can make you or break you!  Definitely fun, at least the 1st time.  Interestingly the leader kept getting the Kings help because she kept her building count lower than everyone else, and she was able to keep that lead the entire game to her win.  It was a 3 player game.

A far better game using dice but that does a great job of mitigating the luck is Yspahan.

Light-weight die-rolling game where players roll dice that allow them to influence various councillors. These in turn get the players resources. Resources are then spent on purchasing buildings, and these yield VPs and special abilities. Once each turn a common foe is revealed, and each player individually has to match the strength of the foe or suffer dire consequences.

My one experience with the game wasn't too good. While there are a lot of likeable and innovative mechanisms in the game, the combination of prominent die-rolling (resulting in quite a bit of luck) and rather slow and plodding gameplay doesn't work well, and I would really have liked the game to have been a turn shorter. I don't really have any desire to play it again, hence my low rating.

Rating after two plays, which I won.  I'm still trying to figure out why I like it better than Stone Age so much, or if it's just that warm fuzzy feeling of 'getting' a game.

Here are my possible explanations:

1. You roll BEFORE you make your choices.  This makes it a more interesting optimization problem for me, where you deal with what you are dealt, rather than making some choices and then hoping for good luck as in Stone Age.

2. The choices and placements of you and your opponents actually affect each other.

3. The buildings are more interesting.  Huts are all identical.  Resources in SA are all identical.  But here, the resources you get makes a more noticeable difference on how you'll play.

4.  Is it just the art?  Am I more affected by random fantasy art than a bunch of brown pictures of neanderthals?

Edit: I think this is going on my "no real desire to own but willing to play" list.  It's fine, not exceptional, and perhaps a bit overdone for a month there, without getting more interesting with repeat plays.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (January 2012)

At first I liked the game, but after one play I prefer to play Alien Frontiers, both games have a healthy dose of luck, but if you roll low numbers in Kingsburg you are toasted while in Alien Frontiers you can still do a lot. This is one of the few games I really wanted to finish soon because I was bored with it. The game can be long and the theme is almost nonexistent, a weird thing for a Fantasy Flight Game. I liked the end of turn attack, but the enemies are easily defeated and there are some buildings that are obviously stronger so all the players go for them. All in all not much strategic depth on this one but can be good to introduce to your family. I think I will play it again but this is a game I won’t actively pursue.

Sometime after I played Kingsburg, I realized the game explainer made a fatal mistake. When we played it, the player who rolled higher went first and it seems it is the other way around. Thank to this, I lost faith in this friend as a game explainer (he has a very bad record explaining games :D, we all make mistakes sometimes but he always does, it is uncanny how he can even make mistakes explaining a one paragraph rule :D, I still love him but if he is explaining a game I will try to sneak out, otherwise I feel I wasted my precious gaming time). 

I need to play again Kingsburg, when I do I will come back to give my impressions about the game.

RATING: 7
I don't know what to think... my first impression is that it was just a more complicated version of 'To Court the King' (which I like).

Initially, I didn't like the game much, but I'm coming around.  It's a little fiddly and the end-game is very anticlimactic.  Last round... the winner is determined!  There's no end of game scoring whatsoever to offset any mistakes made during the game.  There appears to be multiple ways to victory, but a string of bad dice (i.e.-low rolls) and you can get shut out early on, with no possible way to catch up.

I originally gave this game a '5' but, after playing the Java version a few times, have updated the rating to a '7.'  The game also plays well on BSW.

2013-07-22 - This is a really great worker placement game. The dice rolling/placing mechanic makes for very interesting and varied choices during the game. A little prone to AP because the dice also make it difficult to plan ahead. Also, the year/season/phase order of the game adds a couple of different layers to strategizing. Not much player interaction (aside from worker blocking), which I usually enjoy, but this game works well without it.

Nice artwork and good concept of using dice as workers. People can tend to forget building bonuses once they have accumulated lots of them. Dice results have huge outcome in this game.

Solid game which does not go on too long.  Its all about using the dice in the most efficient way possible.  In the end I think that the dice determine your strategy and tactics:  a simple computer program could be written to pick your best option on any turn.  However, the options will change each game, which leads to variability in the experience.  Perhaps in the long run the basic mechanism - roll and place dice - is simply not compelling enough, but its a very decent and attractive game.  Note that if you roll *really* badly then you won't win - but this doesn't happen often so its tolerable.

The dice mechanics remind me a little of [gameid=16496]. Okay sort of game. Easy to teach.

The dice can totally mess with your strategy and I'm not sure taking the cautious road is a viable alternative, if there is one.

To mitigate luck, Kingsburg uses catch up mechanics, dice rerolls and one time use +2 dice modifiers. I don't feel this gives enough control back to the player. For example, in a 4 player game, opponents can unintentionally block other players just because of the dice combos. Certain spots can go beyond a player's grasp at vital times with no ability to setup a good secondary strategy, just in case. The +2 dice modifiers mean if you roll only odd or even numbers, there is limited ways to get to odd or even spots (only thru buying a specific building). Rolling high gives a serious advantage to the player simply because it is unlikely they will be blocked and it guarantees using all 3 dice. 

The end game can be anti-climatic since their is no hidden scoring component. Everyone knows where they stand simply by looking at the track at any point during the game.

RATING: 7
It might be worth learning Kingsburg against the AI, but the experience is nothing like a real game of it. 

This is much, much better than Stone Age or Pillars of the Earth. And just because you're rolling dice doesn't mean it's not a straight up minion allocation game. The dice are supposed to make it a lightweight in the genre, but in fact they make it more interesting than SA or Pillars because there are constraints on everyone's placements. The building tracks aren't bad either - certainly better than Endeavor. 

Seven rating is only if the expansion is used. Game has too many drawbacks without it.

Rating based on one play, 5 players where I got hosed early and we found out late we were playing a rule wrong the whole game.  Willing to play it again, but probably won't change the rating much, maybe 1 point.  Very cool dice mechanic, but it still boils down to rolling high numbers = good, rolling low numbers = bad.  Would like to try with 3 or 4 players - 5 seemed a bit crowded.

Roll your dice, usually three, and place them on the numbered spaces on the board based on adding the value of the dice together. Higher numbered spaces give more resources so this introduces some luck into the game. Resources allow you to build different types of buildings. After a few rounds of this, there is a monster to fight. The hard choice is whether to focus on building your military to clearly beat the monster, or build up resources, but live closer to the edge for the fights.

RATING: 7
Tactical placement of workers is even more important here than in other worker placement games because the dice-based worker placement doesn't allow for strategic placement planning (this turn here, next turn that). Strategy comes into play with the buildings. In our group we all tended to build similar buildings. I hope that there's no too obvious building strategy. It would be a shame if the game boils down to who gets the right die rolls to implement it. Timing considerations (VP's for player with most builds, strongest defender, builder for player with the least builds) might mitigate this potential problem.

A solid effort that seems to be lacking a certain spark to propel it to greatness.  The dice mechanism is nice, as long as it doesn't bog down (how long does it take to evaluate your options?).  I like the unexpected nature of the end-of-year invasion, which must not be underestimated.  I fear that there may be an optimal path to victory, so hopefully further games will show that there are different viable strategies.  Right now it seems like you first get your military up, and then worry about building prestige buildings.

Update: Like Stone Age, I never had the desire to play this game.  There's nothing that I really dislike about the game, but it just seems boring and I can't imagine myself wanting to play this game instead of the others I already have.  Traded away.

Better on the second play, luck seems less a factor.  Still get the feeling there's an "ideal" strategy to this game, or an general ordering of buildings to get.

After a few plays I have one criticism.  It seems difficult to keep one person from racing ahead.  Once someone gets ahead on buildings they start cumulating victory points.  Then by the final year they're impossible to beat.  I've seen this happen twice now.   The bonus vp just makes the issue worse.

Quirky Euro-like game with dice?! Surprisingly, it works but that's assuming that overall, the percentages even out.

For a Euro, it has [b]quite a strong theme[/b] with 'influencing' the nobles to bolster your town and defenses. Simple building and combat mechanics, though certainly entertaining. Multiple ways to achieve victory is always fun too.

[b]Randomness of dice can be too penalizing.[/b] It is definitely possible to win without rolling the best though (unless one player gets the queen every turn).

Clever little dice game where players have to balance between upgrading their dice abilities and gaining resources to build buildings and fight monsters.

Its fairly simple once you understand the symbols, and plays pretty quickly. But because there is no random setup, I think the replayability will be pretty low. In every game, you use the same buildings and same characters, so games can start to feel pretty stale (I've played about 10 games so far).

Really fun, beautifully produced game, not hugely replayable in a short time period.

Fairly solitaire but maintains tension with 'yearly' battles.

Played twice at BGG.CON.  I think the placing dice mechanic to be rather clever, and amazingly it seems balanced.  However, there is one dice roll that I feel will be a problem--the King dice roll.  Somewhere you'll need to gamble on the outcome of the King's dice roll.  If you spend your resources to build up your army, and the King throws low, then you'll probably win.  If you spend your resources building buildings and the King throws high, then you'll win.  With such nice mechanics for the dice elsewhere in the game, I was disappointed in the die roll here to determine such a big part of the game. 

I think the game works better with 3 players than with 5 players.  If you throw low in a 3 player game, you still can get a couple of resources.  If you throw low in a 5 player game, you might be stuck with only one resource.

Dice placement is really cool. The character system forces you into tough decision, between splitting your dice or going all-in to one character, and has a push-your-luck aspect I really like. However, I feel it is way too long for what it is, and the buildings stopped being interesting 10 plays in. I traded it away, then after a while got a new copy, and traded it away again without even opening it. I'd gladly play a 30-40 min version, but this, no thanks.

Action drafting with choices restricted by die rolls, and a tug-of-war of catch-up and slip-behind mechanisms. As with Yspahan I'm surprised by the extent to which this is tagged as "dice done right"; rolls are still going to be largely good or bad. End-of-year battles are also highly random, but the token variant from the Java version can be easily emulated.

Very Nice Game. Both a gateway game and a gamers game. Light, but with layers. A little long but definately a keeper. I can see this one doing very well! Initial rating 8. Reduced Rating to a 6.5 - After 4 plays I've found the more I play it, the less I like it. Win or lose you can't take a ton of responsibility for your actions. The time factor really cuts into the fun factor as well. I think I'll be playing less and less of this one. Not bad but slightly boring after the 1 1/2 hour mark. Rated 6.5 update: Been playing this for a while now and it really is quite a solid game. It even plays well with two people! Rerated to a 7.5.

Really strong game, imo.
I love the options and the fact that you can win even with poorer than average rolls.
There is some compensation for bringing up the rear and over the long haul (not too long, though) of the game, the rolls tend to even out well enough.
There are several strategies as to build options, when to build, push your luck with soldiers, etc.
All in all, one of the better games I have played in awhile and this one will stay hot for a bit for sure!

Although I didn't play a single game of Kingsburg without the expansion, I can't imagine playing without it...

I imagine Kingsburg as the perfect blend of fun...  So if I theoretically play this game without the expansion, I would have to give it a less than perfect score or else the expansion+game would have to be beyond 10+...

So yes...  A 9...  Since I have the expansion, there is absolutely no reason for me to not to play without it...  Thus I would never know...  Since I keep all the items in one box, there is no way in hell I ever forget to bring it with the original game either...

I say a solid 9 just for the fact that it can house the expansion items inside the original box!

Rated after 1 play with 5 players. Came in first place on the last turn because the dice roll for the kings support was a 6 and I needed 4 . Would have lost 8 victory points if I had lost the last battle. A bit long for what it is. Prone to AP which makes it take a long time between turns. I personally didn't have a problem deciding what to do on most of my turns. I really like the artwork in this game.

I've only tried the Java version, but this is a fun little game.  The art/theme is absolutely lovely and the dice are innovative, but the actual resource/building exchange feels a little shallow and unsatisfying.

I consider this an improvement over the Settlers of Catan hedging your bets mechanic. Whereas in Catan one can easily be outplayed within the first 5 minutes of the game by suboptimal beginning placements (especially for people that haven't played before or for people who don't understand probability well this can be a real issue) this game essentially gives players the ability to revive from the ashes repeatedly, as well as gives losing players lots of chances to get back in the game. The game I played in was very close - I have a feeling most games will be very close. The rules are learned pretty quickly - there's a lot of small steps to the game but it's pretty easy and intuitive to figure out.

I've heard the expansion fits well with this game and would like to try it out sometime soon.

Played once, and I think there are some big flaws. I immediately spotted what seemed to be the only strategy that truly makes sense. Get the Inn as early as you can. That extra die every season is huge, and far outweighs the -1 in battle it costs you. With this one thing, you can get more/do more each turn, and I got ahead early and never looked back.  But then, no one else went this route; might be different if other players leveled the field. In that case, you probably should just roll dice for a while and declare the high roller the winner.

And yet, I found it quite enjoyable. But I suspect that's just because I was winning throughout.

A second and third play, and I was convinced that grabbing the Inn early has an opportunity cost, as going that route really hampers you in the battles. Luck of the dice is still too high, but the game is a bit deeper than I first thought.

RATING: 6
Initial impression.  I'd play again, but instead of a 5-player game, I'd hope for a 3-player game.  My one session ran around 90 minutes, too long.  For thelast 45 minutes, I was non-competitive with no hope of climbing back into contention.  I really don't mind luck-based games.  But this one ran too long for the enjoyment I got out of it.  But I'll try again sometime.

Second game was just what I hoped for a much more brisk event with 3 players.  Nice light dice game with some meaningful decisions.  Raises fro 5 to 6 in my estimation.  Still nothing I wish to own, or play much of.  But good for an ocassional filler.

This is a fun relativley quick game with a serious flaw in it's system. Many have complained that going the Cathedral path is the weak point in the game, but I belive the combat phase at the end of each year is far too simple. Players actually losing combat could affect the Cathedral line of buildings lessening their victory points greatly. In future playing sessions I will be adding +1 to every monster to see if that helps better balance the game. Without this flaw the game would deserve a better rating.

Often lumped in with the far superior Alien Frontiers, Kingsburg is a thoroughly ok game. Nothing against it, it's fun for a bit, but the art and graphic design are nothing special.

At my gameing club (Dudley Darklords) we occasionally do Board Games amidst the GW and WM etc. Last night Paul brought this with him, so we had a play (5 of us, first time for us all). first play (with rules out) took about 2 hours, then we played again (as the rules were fresh) in about 80 mins. 
Very good fun, a bit like Caylus light. Both games were close; I was in my traditional position of mid table obscurity.

RATING: 9
A perfect blend of simple mechanics, non-existent theme and short game length. Always ends before you've built what you want. Expansion OK. Adds bloat. Better to play other stuff then come back to the base game. A core game even though it isn't played as often as it should.

Just got 2e because, er, I like the artwork (I like both, which makes me odd). The expansions seem more integrated in 2e so I think the game will feel different and better with them. Still like the base game a lot though.

The rules are very easy to explain but the depth of options available and number of paths to victory makes this game a great game.

It's short, so can be fun as a novelty, but doesn't sustain repeated playthroughs. The different building paths aren't balanced, so there's a clearly established winning strategy. Once players realize that, it's a matter of who'll get the best rolls.

It’s easy to learn and very addictive. Great dice mechanisms. Good dice rolls doesn’t affect as much as you would think. It doesn’t matter if you play with 2 or with 5 players, it is still very enjoyable. Even non gamers will like it. In my opinion it is a must have game. The only thing that might annoy me is the roll for the battle, it might be the same roll for all the players but the tokens that come with the expansion are much more preferable.

This dice manipulation/placement game has long been on my "want to play" list. I loved Alien Frontiers and after hearing the two of these compared so often I thought that this, along with the medieval fantasy theme, would be the perfect game for me. The answer:  I think this would have been the perfect game for me a year ago. It's fun, and I'd never complain about playing. The strategy about how you use your dice and prepare for winter each year is interesting. Each player can choose a different path to victory and there is a catch up mechanic that can smooth over early mistakes. But in the end, it might just be a little bit short of what I look for in games today.

First thing- get the expansion- it's half of the game Kingsburg should have been from the start. 
This is a nice, simple euro game focused on managing your dice. Every turn you roll three of them and place either as a group adding the numbers or seperately on poles with coresponding numbers. When you place dice on a pole nobody else can use it- this is where most of the interaction comes from. These poles provide you with suplies that you need to build your town. I think the game should be played with timer because most of the final score depends on your calculation skill and with right amount of time you are able to make almost no mistake in placing dice in which case the interaction becomes only theoretical. Also for what it is I think the game should take no more than two hours and it often does. It should play smoothly as it really is a medium-light game it just doesn't feel that way.

Kingsburg has light medieval theme and fairy-tale artwork. It looks much better than most of such games although the game board looks campy. Everyone has his own city sheet on which he can build buildings that he wants, and these sheets though simple look really nice.

I really like this game.  We played it first on iOS, but like it better as a boardgame.  I love the simplicity of rolling the 3/4 dice and all the decisions you have to make as the game progresses.

I do wish the game was a little faster, though I am seeing us move faster and faster the more we play.

I've enjoyed the clever use of dice in games over the past year or so and this is one of the best. Some may feel the dice create too much of a luck element but for now I still feel like I can have a plan and work towards it and mitigate some bad dice luck with smart placement.  Maybe I won't feel that way after another 20 plays.

RATING: N/A
The game takes place over five years, a total of 20 turns. In every year, there are 3 production seasons for collecting resources, building structures, and training troops. Every fourth turn is the winter, in which all the players must fight an invading army. Each player must face the invaders, so this is not a cooperative game.

The resources to build structures and train troops are collected by influencing the advisers in the King's Council. Players place their influence dice on members of the Council. The player with the lowest influence dice sum will be the first one to choose where to spend his/her influence; this acts as a way of balancing poor dice rolling. Even with a very unlucky roll, a clever player can still come out from the Council with a good number of resources and/or soldiers.

[2012.Feb.14] A solid game that uses dice in an interesting manner to generate resources. That said, my biggest gripe--which left me feeling 'meh' about the game in the end--was that if any one player consistently rolled well (i.e., 4s, 5s, & 6s) over the course of the game, then he/she would have significant advantage over the other players. In most games, the well-known bell curve helps smooth out these types of die rolling anomalies. However, once in a while one player will have Lady Luck on his/her side. When this happens, the game becomes rather mechanical and obvious (and I've been on both the winning- and losing-side of this effect). I don't hate the game, but I certainly don't love it either.

If you're a low dice roller the game compensates you by letting you go first or get an extra vp, depending on the season.  You roll dice to gain resources by "influencing" the king's advisors and use those to build things like a statue, an armory, a smithery, etc. which give you bonuses.  Re-playability is not as high as I'd like but fun once in a while and easy to learn.

Played this a few times with some friends that own the game.  It did not knock my socks off like I had hoped.  I guess my expectations where too high for this game.  I really did not find the attacking monsters in the winter as suspenseful a game mechanism as was reported.

I found that the attacking monsters and their lack of strength/suspense, made them annoying noise in the background that really soured the over all game play experience for me.

The dice laying mechanism is a good idea and seems like it could be a great idea.

RATING: 5
The use of the dice in this game is very clever. But I am not sure if there is really en interest in splitting the dice on various space. Most of the time, people ended up using all their dice on 1 space. I think more space would have been used if players could get more than 3-4 dice. The 17 and 18 space are also rarely used.

The game is ok, it's not particularly annoying to play, but it could be enjoyable. There is one thing I could not stand and it's the building.

In most games I played, making a building seems like rewarding. For example, in Puerto Rico, you are always happy to gain an new special power. It's interesting to see what special powers you could get and you could try to focus on gaining a particular building.

But in Kingsburg, they are all boring and this is what kills the game, because most of the things you do in this game is to acquire resources to make buildings. And because the buildings are so boring and useless to make, you simply don't care about building them. So in the end, yo don't care about the game because that is the main objective.

Many abilities of the buildings are either repetitive, useless or unappealing. I think they should do more their math because some of the buildings have odds as low as 1/18th chance of being used.

I think they should place more time redesigning their buildings, it might improve the game. I saw that there was an expansion, maybe they did it.

I liked it okay the first play.  Then we got the expansion, which made it too easy, maybe just the powers we got?  We ended up buying about every single thing on the board.  The biggest problem is that even with the expansion it gets old really really quick.  There are just not that many different things to do.  It's okay, but pretty blah.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It slightly reminds me of Yspahan in that you roll dice and place them, you have the option of generating different buildings with various powers. With Kingsburg, everyone rolls their own dice and decides in turn order (of lowest rolled) what to acquire by placing their dice and generating special buildings.  There's really only a couple of certain building rows you should largely be pursuing and this became stale for me after repeated playings.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Another game which uses dice to determine actions.  This one allows a bit more diversity of actions and opportunity to mess with your neighbor from time to time depending on dice rolls.  This is one beautifully produced game, but I fear its overpriced for what it brings to the table.  I'm not certain you can win without completing most of the top row of buildings for major victory points and generally the barbarian army at the end of each round strikes very little fear in the heart.  If played to completion within an hour, this game is a 7.  Much after an hour though, this game drags for me.  This is a very different game with 5 compared to 3 as you should expect to lose actions through being unable to use your dice because someone else chose a character before you, particularly in the first round!  When playing, if you wish to win, you must always think horizontally on two of five tracks on the building board instead of vertically.  Play vertically, you'll get crushed.

Alle Spieler haben 3 Würfel und würfeln diese simultan. In aufsteigender Reihenfolge der Summe der Würfelwerte setzten wir die Würfel ein, dabei dürfen wir unsere Würfel beliebig kombinieren um höhere Berater zu beeinflussen. Je nach Berater erhält man verschiedene Bonies (Ressourcen, Waffenstärke, Sondereigenschaften, etc.).
Mit diesen Dingen kauft man sich Gebäude auf dem eigenen Tabloe, die wiederrum Eigenschaften mitbringen.
In einer Runde wird 3 mal beeinflusst und Häuser gebaut und danach müssen alle Spieler gegen einen Gegner antreten, der die Verlierer bestraft und die Gewinner belohnt.
Mir gefällt das Spiel sehr gut, das riesengroße Manko ist der Zufallsfaktor im Grundspiel, dass bei einem Angriff am Rundenende jeder Spieler einen W6 als Kampfstärke dazu erhält. Dieses Manko wird in der Erweiterung behoben.
Die Erweiterung lohnt sich aber auch sonst, denn es gibt individuelle Hofpläne, Gehilfen in Form von Karten und und und. Das Spiel wird durch die Erweiterung besser.
Das Grundspiel ist, abgesehen vom Kampf, aber sehr gut wie ich finde.

While the dice add an element of luck, there are so many possible ways to score and win this game that the impact is minute at best. The dice allow you to make multiple choices each turn:  Sum the dice and choose a powerful advisor or use the dice separately to choose several lesser advisors.  Don't forget to build your army.  The print quality is great.  Fantasy Flight still has no idea what packaging/storage is.

Kingsburg is one of those older games where you can tell it's older.

Every bit of the turn is a specific turn of a cog; it clunks a long with weird arbitrary limits expecting you to just accept that you can't build 2 buildings per production phase, or that you need some form of military because war isn't an option, it's a necessity you have to survive.

Even so, the dice placement mechanics are so unique that I simply enjoy a good game of Kingsburg.

We enjoy this fun family game although sometimes runs a bit long for younger children.  Kingsburg has a beautiful, engaging board that attracts non-gamers and kids.  I question the long-term replayability of this game.  Still, I am glad to have this family-friendly resource management game in my collection.

Strangely addictive fast-moving [b]dicing[/b] game. Since I want to play 'just one more turn' or 'just one more productive season' I have to add a point to this rating. What a truly awful name! evocative of absolutely nothing (no on ever remembers which game this is by the name of it).

I wish the spread of buildings was larger, with more variety. The lineup of buildings is occasionally odd: military buildings lead to the school of Wizardry?? ...for example. The lack of text on the main board makes the game longer as people try to figure out what is going on in there. And I hate when my military units go away each turn and I have to start fresh!

By examining this game piecemeal I could chalk up a number of shortcomings with the game (including especially the awful name), but that would be unfair because as a whole the thing works nicely for me. It's a 'sum is greater than its parts' game.

I have to reduce my rating by a point due to the non-English text which removes a lot of the [i][b]feeling[/b][/i] and thus theme which could have been part of the game. I marked up my copy, but shouldn't have had to. The game is too long, also.

May be biased, since I playtested it from day one. It's a very good light/medium game, very easy to learn  but funny and balanced. It also looks great, and that's a nice plus. And it's not that similar to To Court a King, the similarity stops at the fact that there are dice and they aren't used in a conventional way.

Worker placement game using dice! The dice mechanic is nice but can lead to some downtime as player are trying to figure out where they can place their dice. 

Pros:
- Tech tree
- Nice new dice usage
- theme is ok

Cons:
- Combat at end of season is almost too easy
- some tech are way weaker than others
- some downtime.
- Not a really good game with 2 players.

What a nice, fresh take on the so called "Yahtzee" genre of games. Much like Ysphahan, the dice luck has been per mutated into something entirely different, and almost entirely controllable. The characters and buildings seem well balanced, and the game is a joy to play.
I'm not so sure the king is worth it, as I feel the queen is the best deal on the board (tied with the alchemist). Beautiful art too.

Update: The luck of the dice kills it for me sometimes. There have been a few recent losses that I can attribute directly to luck. Downgraded to a 7.

Only played it a few times 2 players.  We I like the game.  We do a variant to the two player rules.  We add a third single die so 3 spaces on the board are taken by the ghost player.  If two roles are tied, we put them both on the same space.  This leads to more scarcity which is good.  There are a lot of dice and some luck, but not as much as you would think because there are a lot of different directions you can go.  The key is being adaptable.  I think the luck may come more in the military roles if a player is taking a more risky strategy and another isn't.  

Note: This game improves a lot with the To Forge a Realm Expansion.

I didn't find this game very interesting. Very little variation on strategy, and if you roll well you win. The most competitive part of the game was looking at your opponents' dice to make sure you get all your placements. There are plenty of other games that have that same interaction, but are much better.

This game falls pretty firmly within the "plays itself" category of Euros, and thus won't please purist fans of the genre who disdain die-rolling and want to be able to indulge in long-term strategizing. For the rest of us, the game is hard not to love. There's lots of drama, quick reversals, and cursing the gods, and the way that each of the games five "years" builds up suspensefully to a battle with NPCs is clever and totally original. It's also gorgeously and lovingly illustrated, with a playfulness that stops just short of self-parody.

A very solid, family weight dice placement game where you place dice to gather resources.  Resource build buildings and allow which give you special abilities.  The abilities can help your military or your economy. At the end of the year, you fight off an invader to get a benefit or a penalty if you did not contribute enough military to defend the realm. 

A family game that can feel "samey" over time without the expansion.

Obvious comparisons can be made to Crown the King, but this is a far superior title. Even though it's got the potential for dice screwage. It shouldn't happen frequently because you're rolling so often but rest assured there will be games where you just don't get very good rolls consistently.

Enjoyed this as our first worker placement game, but found it a bit limiting, with most games playing out similarly, despite the reliance on dice.  Sold after only a few plays.  Picked up again, post-expansion release, since the expansion apparently fixes the "samey" and limitation issues and makes the game as a whole stronger.

This game gets more fun and more frustrating the more people you play with. 2 is okay, 3 is great, 4 is excellent, 5 is aggravatingly good. I'm glad it still holds up well today.

This review is worth reading so as to make play easier: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/328797/kingsburg-a-detailed-review

90 min playtime and can play with 2

(BUT at potentially 2 hours gameplay, it could end up no being too much fun).


See one person's comments: "While Kingsburg is a great game, and I’m glad I own it, I do not consider it to be a “Gateway” game exactly. Namely because of rule fiddly-ness, numerical analysis and playing length.

1. Rules – when you hand the non-hobby gamer a veritable “spreadsheet” of buildings, each with it’s own rule, you might just blow their mind a little.
2. Numerical analysis – When you roll your dice you have about 7 potential placements (14 if you get an extra white dice with your roll). But then add in the modifiers (+2 tokens and Farms) and you just might have a bunch of AP zombies to deal with (instead of the ones on the cards).
3. Duration - Newbies are going to take 90 minutes to 2 hours or more (depending on number of players, mainly because of #2 above). Gateway games usually clock in at half that time.

The average weight given to Kingsburg on this site – 2.43 – is well ahead of other lighter games generally regarded as gateways. I’d consider Kingsburg more of a “next step” game."

Very good dice allocation game about managing resources and influencing spots on the board to get different items such as points, resources, military power, etc. I like this one a lot, and it's even better with the expansion. 

Edit: with more experience in the hobby my love for this one has dropped a bit. It can be very repetitive even with the expansion, and I don't like scoring as much for this game either.

RATING: 7
I think they should have developed some mechanics a bit further - as it is, the dice are still too random. 
A roll of 14 should be better, but not twice as good as a roll of 7.
The standard rule for assists in battle (roll one die for everyone) is way too random, and too easy as well. We'll use the tournament rule next game.

I read in a geeklist that the designers intended this game to be "Settlers, done right". That makes me think the designers are idiots, and that this game being good is merely a fluke, as this is nothing like settlers; there is no trading or placement aspect in this game. It is a good game though, with multiple paths to victory, and a building system reminiscent of RTS games for the PC.

After several plays, this game has become a bit dull. Not sure how much play it'll see in the future.

Kingsburg is a nice dice rolling game that uses dice values like a worker placement game to get goods from 18 different people. Players score points mainly from buildings built from goods and from defeating villains attacking their village. The one flaw from the game is well known, the dice rolled representing the king's force helping each player, this flaw is rectified in the expansion To Forge The Realm.

Played yesterday with the author. I like the dice mechanism (very similar to To Court the King) to influence the advisers in the King's Council. The luck is present but not dominating the game. The author said that after more than 100 games the game tuning is perfect, and I must say that it looks so. You need to know the buildings ability for a good playing.
I think it can be a goo family/ introductory game, as far as be enjoyed by more expert players.

Received today (2/20/08) but on the shelf until Pandemic gets a play.

Went through the rules, and decided that this definitely needs a players aid for new players learning the game.  5 years, 8 phases in 4 seasons?  It is a bit much to hear.  I almost think that the "seasons" lingo could just be left out.  EvanMinn's Player Aid served well.

The game has attractive art, and moves smoothly.  I like it more than "To Court The King" because the player moves are quite transparent.  In other words, everyone takes their turn to perform their actions, and there aren't so many manipulations of the dice that need to be carefully audited (as in TCTK).  In my games of TCTK, there have been people who weren't cheating, but just misunderstood or misremembered how to use the powers.  And yes, they usually won!  Kingsburg does not suffer from that same problem... I like its design much more.  Although my initial rating will be a 9, this has the potential to move either way after a few plays.  It also depends on how much fun is had by the people I play with!

UPDATE:  After another play, it gets even better.  The game moved quicker.  Three players:  initally led by red, but they didn't protect for a winter phase and lost the Church... never recovered.  Yellow looked solid, but started losing the King's Agent (?) to red and the most buildings and most military bonuses to blue.  Blue got the 9 VP building to catch up, then a building that allowed disposal of a good or "+2" for a VP each production round.  Blue graped the lead, but to do so had to take a bit of a risk, and had only 5 total military going into the final winter.  It was the 7 pt Barbarians, and the King sent 4 soldiers.  Blue won by 2 VP's.

I really like the "flow" of this game, there's always something happening and you're always torn between developing more buildings and increasing your army.
Would like to play the expansion as I think that will increase variability and replayability a lot.

In Kingsburg, players are Lords sent from the King to administer frontier territories.
The game takes place over five years, a total of 20 turns. In every year, there are 3 production seasons for collecting resources, building structures, and training troops. Every fourth turn is the winter, in which all the players must fight an invading army. Each player must face the invaders, so this is not a cooperative game.
The resources to build structures and train troops are collected by influencing the advisers in the King's Council. Players place their influence dice on members of the Council. The player with the lowest influence dice sum will be the first one to choose where to spend his/her influence; this acts as a way of balancing poor dice rolling. Even with a very unlucky roll, a clever player can still come out from the Council with a good number of resources and/or soldiers.
Each adviser on the King's Council will award different resources or allocate soldiers, victory points, and other advantages to the player who was able to influence him/her for the current turn.
At the end of five years, the player who best developed his assigned territory and most pleased the King through the Council is the winner.

A very interesting game. While I'm not a fan of dice-fests, this one uses them in an interesting mechanic that, while unique, adds to the fun and frustration level of the game. I can see it losing points with some players who have really bad luck with their rolls, but in my one outing with the game, I found myself enjoying it quite a bit, even though I came in dead last.  Surprisingly fast with five players, which is a big plus!

The mechanic is really cool.  But there are just too many permutations taking into account all your placements and your opponents placements.  I often found myself thinking for forever, and then just having to pick something that ended up sub-optimal.

Kingsburg is an excellent game. Using your dice, you determine which officials from the kings court you can influence. Build up your resources and build your section of the kingdom, while being wary of the winter season and the attacks from the beasts.
The player who best balances influence, buildings and defence will be the victor!

A decent dice game, but I felt like there were limited choices. But my biggest gripe is that right as the parts of the game that are interesting warms up, the game ends. I would play it again but it got removed from my wishlist.

Had this sitting on my shelf collecting dust for over a year.  I was somewhat reluctant to play it after I'd read some less than thrilling reviews.

I'm glad I finally decided to not the cobwebs off and bring it to the table.  The dice rolling is just plain fun... when is it not?  The strategy involved with placement and resource collection makes for an intriguing game.  And I love the building function.

Now I need to get the expansion which I hear is top notch and very necessary.

RATING: 6
(3/17) 7. A really cool dice-rolling worker player placement.  I enjoy worker placements games as it is and the extra touches in this game (the fact that your placement choices are somewhat limited by your rolls, the way that building buildings unlock new abilities, the "end of round" battles) definitely elevate it.  Looking forward to playing it with the expansion.

(10/17) Drop to 6.  Just haven't had the urge to break it back out again in a while.

I've heard the designers wanted to make a game that made every dieroll worthwhile, something they didn't find in Settlers. In the first place, they missed (there were often rolls in our 5-player game that weren't very productive). In the second, it's not a problem in Settlers because there are many dierolls over the course of the game, and the turns are quick. Not so here, where there are only five full turns in the game, with three "seasons" with a dieroll each per year. Too often you have to wait a bit to decide what another player will choose before you can determine your own play. Might be better with fewer player, because less interaction might actually help the game.

After a few plays of this (with no expansions), I feel like there is always an optimal move and even if an opponent blocks you with their optimal move, you are still left with a best move among your choices.  The game ends up playing itself, and it simply comes down to the best dice rolls will win.

The last game I played, we stopped halfway through because most of us were bored.  I'll likely not play this again, and certainly will never suggest it.

RATING: 7
The first time I played Kingsburg, I kept expecting (despite having heard the rules) that there would be a traditional Euro-style reckoning at the end, so I wound up dead last. After several plays, I still wish there were some hidden points -- it's just disheartening to know you're behind and have few ways to catch up.

It's not the game it sounds like: From the name, I thought maybe it'd be about 14th Century accountants working in cobblers' shops, or something, but it's really kind of like Warcraft: The Boardgame. Very RTS-like, and the combat is a nice twist.

Solid across the board (hah!), with a lot going on and plenty of tough decisions -- especially tough decisions that have to be gambled on for several turns. The way it uses dice is brilliant: random in a fun way, but nicely mitigated by giving you good options no matter what you roll, and by providing ways to up your odds.

---

After some time without any strong desire to play Kingsburg, I consider it a good game but its rating has gone from 9 to 7. When I think about suggesting it, I remember that it has no hidden scoring and I suck at it, so I spend most of the game knowing I'm going to lose. I wish it offered a way to keep everyone in the hunt.

RATING: 7
The base game can become a bit linear after a couple of plays, and replay value could be a problem. A beautiful game with simple mecanics and difficult choice, and a clever use of dice.  It is one of the rare game that I think the expansion is mandatory, as it adds more option and increase replay value dramatically. Do not waste money on the french version, as I grabbed the english version of base+exp for half the price.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Initial rating with 2 players.

Update: Still a great game (with 4 this time). However, if you lose a building early, this game is extremely unforgiving, causing players to disengage. Still an awesome game, but I am lowering my rating to 8.3 out of 10. I have not tried the expansion yet.

Update 3/3/13: After 3 plays and a second play with 4 players, I am going to bump this game back up. It is still rather unforgiving, but mostly if you have an expensive building to lose. The person who won tonight lost a building in battle, but still ended up winning by 4 points.

Update 7/6/14: We hadn't played this in more than a year, and I"m sure glad we got to play again. Last night, we played with Erin's parents and everyone had a great time! Such a classic game, and certainly a gateway! If it wasn't for the last turn feeling a bit anti-climatic, this rating would certainly be higher.

2 / 5 - Fair.

I think this is nicely themed and there's some genuine tension in picking allocating resources to the military or to building. However, if anything I've played is truly deserving of the title "multiplayer solitaire" this is it - the only way to influence your opponents is to  get to adviser spaces before they do and whether or not you can or would want to do that is entirely in the hands of the dice. There is also a cringingly obvious path to victory which effectively leaves everyone using the dice to race up it. Were that not enough the game is full of catch-up mechanics that don't entirely mitigate a runaway leader problem and your economic analysis can be, and often it, sabotaged by the dice. See my review for details: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/315003
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.57
Two biggest cons is that having 18 places to place dice feeds into the random factor determining who wins. If you keep rolling 7-10 between three dice, there's not a whole lot you can do. We had a run away winner and he said the strategy is simply roll high.

Second con looks like very low replay ability. When all said and done it is still a battle of VP and the highest pathway is with the top row on each player board. Second highest is the second row and similarly down the line. This means the path to victory is rather well laid out with no real further investigation. The monsters attacking balances the VP march to a point, but not enough by itself. I would like to play it with all of the players being experienced though. I think part of the issues was having two new players playing it.

I liked this quite a bit despite the lower scoring. It just needs tighter choices with the dice placement and more diverse player boards.

Rating Potential: Likely stuck at 6.5. I don't see it being a 7 and it's enjoyable enough for 2-3 plays to keep it from being a 6.

I really, really wanted to play this at the Australian Games Expo 2008 - and I almost managed to. Well, I got halfway through the game before hitting the omg-so-tired-i-cannot-stay-upright anymore and my kind opponents sent me off to bed. This seems enjoyable although a bit slow at times - but I suspect that me and my mostly-asleepness probably caused some of the slowages. Not to play with the AP-prone, but I would like to try it again & will quite possibly pick up a copy.

OK, so this game is beautifully produced and I like the theme. Allocating your dice rolls and blocking/being blocked by other players was great fun and "seems" to give the illusion of strategy within the luck of the dice rolls. However, I'm just not buying it! Your village contains a number of buildings that must be built in order (like a skill tree) to gain benefits. But, there are only so many resources and so much time to build. Defense and the ability to change your rolls a little bit are really important. Which means that everyone builds pretty much the same buildings, with the leader maybe having an extra building. It likes a slow plod to rolling one great round and being able to build that one extra building. It reduces this game down to dice rolls on a pretty board. Plus the AP of everyone counting each others dice is killer (cause really, what's the fun if you can't screw with your opponents)... I really wanted to love this game but it is pretty terrible, especially with 5 players.

07/05/08 Played a three-player game, once. I don't like fantasy themed games. But the fantastic elements of this game are extraneous and easily ignored. In fact they seem quite pasted on - good. The enemy should have been called generic barbarians, or if their tribes had to be named, then something like Vandals, Huns, Ostrogoths, etc. instead of Orcs, Goblins, Dragons, etc. I mean, come on, isn't the game supposed to be set during the Middle Ages? Anyway, the game itself is a nice one, though not that innovative as its at least the third "dice allocation" game I've played. Analysis paralysis is possible when allocating dice, trying to make sure you don't get blocked. The player boards are extremely flimsy. Plus the "+2" chits should not have been made with the same color background as one of the player colors (black). 11/08/08 A second three-player game. 04/14/09 A third three-player game. 09/05/09 A fourth three-player game. 07/24/10 Another three-player game. 03/19/11 Game #6, three-player. 10/16/11 Game #7, three-player, with expansion.

This game works beautifully as a second-stage gateway game and yet has enough strategy and multiple paths to victory that keep more-experienced players entertained.  I love that the dice are used as a means to get resources, but that it's your strategic placement of the dice that determines victory.  Definitely a "make the best of the luck that's given to you" type of game, rather than "you roll poorly and you get screwed".  Sadly, after many plays it felt somewhat stale as we'd all figured out our favorite strategies and only slightly varied them from game to game.  The "To Forge a Realm" expansion has been a HUGE boost to this game and has given it a second life within our gaming group.

Kingsburg is a good game, although I'm beginning to worry that there's a "correct" order for developments to win every time, so long as the dice are with you.  It is possible to roll terribly and still win, however, and I think says something positive about the game.

I initially was quite smitten with this game but after a few 5-player games my enthusiasm has tempered to the point where it might get traded away.  I've already decided I will never again play this with 5 players as the game easily exceeds three hours.  I also am not fond of getting stuck with unusable dice.  Just about any other dice-placement game provides some kind of action for any die, so none of them end up completely unused.  It would have been nice to see something like this added in the expansion.

This game was long forgotten, but recently resurrected. :P It's a good one, but far better with the expansion. The best part of this game is trying to make the most of your limited number of dice, making combinations that would most benefit you while blocking your opponent(s).

A good dice placement game taking place over five years. Each year consists of three seasons where players roll and place dice to gain favours from the various people on the board (each spot can only be claimed by one player), and once all dice are placed and favours are claimed players may in order choose whether or not they want to build a building this round. At the beginning of each season a bonus given either to the player ahead or the player behind in buildings depending on the season. Each year culminates in fighting the looming threat, and rewards/penalty is given to players depending on whether they ward off the threat or not. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.

It's an enjoyable game, with plenty of options in terms of building up the points you need. Though the queen's favour is a significantly powerful spot to claim in my experience.

I thought this was a fairly interesting game with a nice balance of luck and strategy, with multiple paths to victory.

I enjoyed the dice rolling and the screwage factor. Both made the game more tense and enjoyable. I played a five-player game with only one experienced player, and three of the four newbs (including me) were very competitive.

I like the luck factor, because it forces you to think on your feet and means you can't just go for the perfect strategy. You have a lot of options for placing your dice and can opt for blocking other people's moves, if you want.

Of all the Euros I've tried, I think Kingsburg, Small World, Ra and King of Siam are my favorites. Dominion, Age of Empires III, Taluva and In the Year of the Dragon, on the other hand, seem less interesting in retrospect. Mind you, Kingsburg is not a great game, and I don't expect to ask to play, but having to play it again wouldn't make me ill.

What is the big deal?  The enemy attacks are laughably easy to ignore, bad dice are just that, bad, and there is little interesting enough here to keep me coming back.  True, the action selection is pretty good, but only if you had a decent roll.  No, this was quite disappointing.

Very balanced game, The result of the dice rolling isn't so much determinant for the winning of the game. Very nice the mechanism for influencing the advisers in the Emperor's Council.
Depending on the number of player the game will be more competitive on the obtainment of the favors of the adviser. For me the perfect number of player is 5, I've heard of people preferring th 3-4 player game but for me there are too much place for influencing and in this wai the good result of the dice rolling can influence more the game.

Gorgeous artwork (1st edition anyway), and nice player interactions.
Too much dependent on luck with the dice and the invading monsters, and not enough that can be done to mitigate it.
The buildings you can build are really unbalanced and broken, including any from the expansion, so that's always a disappointment.
I'll miss the character/ally in setup and events from Kingsburg, but at least Kingsport Festival has the events.

2008-05 A mostly new twist (well, similar in idea to Ysaphan) on role selection/action drafting where players roll dice and then split them or add them to select various roles.  The roles generally provide resources which can be used to build... um, buildings.  Although the game does have two catch-up mechanisms and they aren't extremely powerful they are definitely needed because the leaders have an advantage in having more buildings (which give various powers) and being able to earn bonus VPs (for having the most buildings every round).  Get too far behind early and it's a real struggle to catch up.  There's also a build up your armies to fight the incoming hordes at the end of each round mechanic which has been used in a few other games.  It works and although I would be happy to play it again I feel a shorter version would improve the game.  Could get old quickly -- perhaps a expansion with a new twist could help the sameyness.
UPDATE: 2012-07 played again in 2011 with some enthusiastic players and enjoyed it.  Raising rating a half point.

Enjoyable light-ish worker placement game based on dice result.  Production values are good -- was worried the fantasy theme would be too blatant, but no issues.  Very nice flow of the game between the seasons and influence/build; easy to grasp.  Some good tactical considerations to make, and strategy can come in after a play of seeing various build tracks.

I like the basic mechanism of rolling dice and then placing them on differently restricted spots in sort of auction/worker placement manner. That said, three dice and only caring about total value seems too simplicistic. Moreover, if all we do is just collecting resources and fending off some events then this will not hold my interest for long.

Also not interested in the reimplementation, although it brings quite a bit more to do.

This is a pretty good game. It looks like many eurogame publishers have turned their attention to a mechanic that seemed vetoed from the true german games: dice rolling! Think of Yspahan, Roma, Kingsburg... even Knizia's Pikomino or Mmmm... Brains! (all right, that's not an eurogame, but, hey, it's still by Mr Knizia himself!)I like Yspahan better, but this would be number two on my list of dice management games.

Fun, lightweight and quick moving... especially good for resource optimizers and tactical eurogame fans.

I enjoyed my first play, so for now, recommended.

Pretty and light game that's rather accessible. There's some strategy to it, but luck can play a big part.

Beautiful graphics, nice components. Cute lightweight dice-driven worker-placement euro with a bright medieval theme. Thumbs up for good balance, anti-runaway-leader mechanics and a nice rule patch for the two-player variant. The game gives more with successive plays, as strategies emerge.
The player sheets could have been a bit more colorful though, or with more detail - like this, it can be hard to remember what buildings you have, and which does what.
All in all, nice to put to table once in a while, when I'm not in the mood for something involving...

Only played once and the teacher had no idea what he was doing. We played with so many incorrect rules. Still, it was a fun time and I want to get it to the table again, preferably with the correct rules.

The buildings offer a variety of development choices so every player can customize his strategy but without being overwhelming (the tracks are consistent) or too tactically driven (a la Eclipse). The dice introduce quite a bit of randomness (my final turn could have swung my score ~20% with a higher roll) but is mostly mitigated by clever allocation and developments and resources.

RATING: 6.5
Played once.  This game involves using the numbers on rolled dice to choose similarly-numbered spaces on a board, which gets players one or more of three types of goods that let players build things to get victory points and defend themselves from regularly occurring attacks.  

While the game is a fine medium-weight game, the major problem I ran into was that it was insanely long for what it is.  On each turn players roll 3d6 and then can use any combination of those (and possibly +/- 1 or +2 of any combination of those) to choose from one of 18 spaces on the board.  Each space can be entered only once, so planning your moves is key and takes a Very. Long. Time. (as players must both look at all permutations of what they can get with their dice as well as all permutations of what their opponents can get with their dice, and factor into that what's already been taken).  And, since all the choices are based on dice rolls, and your opponents' moves can drastically change what you wanted to do, it's difficult for players to plan ahead.

Added to this tedious placement mechanic is that players can choose from 20 different buildings to build with the goods they get; each building (of course) gives different powers.  So, not only must players ponder all the permutations of their rolls, they must also consider which of the many buildings they want to build (all of which require different resources).  

While this would have been a fine ~1 hour game, our game took well longer than 3 hours.  It's just not worth that much time.

Very beautiful game. It is a worker placement with dice with a loose fantasy theme. Easy rules, but for me a bit long for a 2 player game. Maybe just one round too long. The gameis good and solid, but not that exiting in terms of strategy. Sure you can take different paths, but in general it is rolling dice, acquiring goods and building buildings. After four plays I got a bit bored of the game, after 5 plays I am getting rid of it.

Lots of hate for this one, it seems, and mostly unjustified in my opinion; this is a great gateway/family game that will also work in many gaming groups. Dice as workers isn't as rare a mechanic as it was when Kingsburg was released but this game still does it as well as any, in my opinion. High rolls will usually do better, but it's the willingness to adapt that usually wins. Some small screwage in placement and a bit of push your luck in the winter confrontation. The expansion will bring this one back from the dead if your group has fallen into play patterns- it really shakes things up in exciting ways.

Great first impression. Seems like a good gateway game. This will see future plays. Luck of the dice roll with a good amount of skill. Bad luck is a deterrent but not a killer.

The only dislike I have is that the end game is pretty anticlimactic since there are no hidden points,

Printed up "The Demanding Capital" and "Starting Alliances" scenarios. Haven't played yet.

Did play "Goblin Valley," was trounced by my wife.

I still like Kingsburg, but it hasn't held up to repeated plays as well as I'd hoped. The bottom row of buildings seems to be the best path to victory. I really want the expansion.

The expansion really improves the game.

Nice idea, but just too long-winded for what it is. I'm not a huge fan of the die rolling thing, although I admit it's clever and certainly the dice are what makes Kingsburg interesting and not like all other resource management worker placement games. But no, it just didn't work for me: somehow the game just isn't fun to play, the game feels frustrating and unpleasant.

Indifferent.

Kingsburg is yet another worker placement and resource management game, this time featuring some trendy dice action. This game was worth playing a few times via the excellent Java implementation available here on BGG. Variant rules and differing player counts force you to consider slightly different strategies to start the game, and then you puzzle through fifteen snappy rounds (AI = zero downtime) to see if your strategy works. In this format, it takes as long as a game of Dominion or 7 Wonders and offers up about the same level of challenge and types of decisions. Not bad.

Playing live against real human opponents unfortunately offers little to recommend itself over the plethora of other similar games. Lords of Waterdeep, Homesteaders, Macao, etc. ad infinitum. Place workers. Get resources. Build buildings. Rinse and repeat for 90 minutes or, in this case, two hours. Kingsburg is just more of the same.

It all comes down to the monster card.  If all players are roughly equally skilled then the game is almost completely random.  You either pick the risky strategy, the medium strategy, or the conservative strategy.  You flip the monster card over and see who is going to win the game.  You're either ruined by the monster, or you've wasted resources being conservative.

The expansion replacing the white defense against the monsters dice doesn't help.  You still gamble on beating the monsters and the riskiest without getting killed will win the game.

An okay dice game. There's a decent amount of luck mitigation, although if you roll really well you will still probably fare much better than your opponents, particularly if you get a bunch of high rolls. I enjoy this game, but I doubt it would hold up well to repeated plays. This is a game you play once in a while, for a change of pace. The reason I say this is because what you're actually doing for most of the game is trying to scrape together a few resources to build your next building. A wood here, a couple gold there, etc. That starts to feel like a chore after a couple plays, much like it does in Catan.

In Kingsburg verkörpern die Spieler Lords und versuchen am Hofe des KönigsEinfluss zu sammeln. Dies geschiet durch Würfel, die am Anfang jeder Runde gewürfelt werden. Mit dem Ergebnis der Augenzahlen, lassen sich nun die 12 unterschiedlichen Personen am Hof des Königs beeinflussen. Da die Spieler reihum entscheiden und sich gegenseitig die Personen streitig machen können, ist die richtige Strategie wichtig. Anschließend erhält man Rohstoffe oder Soldaten und kann Gebäude bauen. Am Ende eines (Spiel-)Jahres müssen sich dieSpieler auch noch gegen eine Monsterarmee zur Wehr setzen. Ein bisschen Glück, Taktik & Strategie und Worker-Placement steckt in diesen tollen Spiel!

RATING: 7.5
Great worker-placement with dice.  This is much easier to pull out and play (with gamers and non-gamers) compared to other WP games because it doesn't seem to induce AP.  Something I find makes other/heavier WP games a chore to play.  The expansion is a must though.  Takes the base game to an 8.  Wonderful board!

RATING: 8.5
Interesting mechanics that uses dice in a relatively novel manner.  Aspects of the game remind me of Notre Dame (enemies vs. rats) and Yspahan (dice determining support vs. roles).  It plays fast, but can present a struggle to catch-up to the leader. Note: My #4000 game played/logged.

Beautifully produced, almost co-op game with dice used as in Yspahan. However, the design is almost too manicured for me while leaving holes elsewhere.  The catch-up mechanisms are too evident, but if someone blocks you out from a spot, you have absolutely no recourse.  The whole impending attack each turn is the meat of the game and the arc of the "story", but as usual with these types of games, the crisis isn't very exciting.  I'd play it again, but even with all the edges sanded off, the game doesn't sing.

I believe no game of ours hits the table as often as Kingsburg. Really good Euro with dice. The only thing, that I find offputting is, that towards the end it's quite obvious who wins the game. In this particular part of the game I like Stone Age much better.

Update:
Since The Castles of Burgundy has become the new shining star of our board game collection this one gets to be played a lot less. Nevertheless a really good game and always lots of fun to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun game that is easy to explain and moves along farily quickly (assuming no analysis paralysis). It seems like a blend of Caylus (worker placement and building), Yspahan (dice roll allocation) and Louis IX (influencing courtiers). Deciding how to place your dice is the fun part of the game.

The only downsides I can see is that it invites analysis paralysis (of which I'm often guilty), and a few bad rolls at the start can make it difficult to catch up. A lot of the game decisions about which "tech tree" seem pretty mechanical/procedural and it's mostly a game of working out how to place your dice efficiently.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First few times I played, this game blew me away.  The more I play it, the more it feels like a worker placement game with artificial or arbitrary limits imposed upon what goods/benefits you can acquire or even attempt to acquire.  I really like dice games, but the dice here don't seem to fit.  Still, its fun, and my friends love it, so I'll keep playing.

RATING: 7.8
A dice driven game which doesn't appear to suffer from the randomness that dice tend to introduce. You can however suffer from poor dice rolls, but these can be somewhat mitigated by other actions you can take.
The games is very well produced, plays quickly and has the feeling of a reasonably deep game.
RECOMMENDED.

2-5 players, best with 4. Roll dice to gain the benefits of different members of the court to build buildings which give you advantages.

For all the praise this game got, I feel a little luke warm about it. I do like it quite a bit, it very much stands on its own feet in an ocean of samey eurogames, yet if you have bad die rolls all throughout the game, like I did in our first session, it can become frustrating - even with the built-in catchup mechanics. 

*UPDATE*: Now that I played it more, I really start to love the game. It still has the problem of being more difficult if you're constantly rolling low, but man, this game is tense.

I love this game! Kind of a worker placement but not really. Better with at least 3 players. I love the dice mechanics, the fact that you can split them in multiple area or use them all together. The fights at the end of each round are the game weakness. Artworks are great.

J'adore ce jeu! Un genre de jeu de placement d'ouvriers. Meilleur avec 3 joueurs ou plus. J'adore le comcept des dés qui servent d'ouvriers, le fait de pouvoir les séparers en plusieurs groupe ou les jouer tous ensembles. Les combats à la fin de chaque ronde sont le poit faible du jeu, beaucoup trop faciles, innutiles. Les illustrations sont superbe.

This game has everything I want in a board game. It has beautiful components and the rules make sense. This makes the game easy to teach and learn. It is the perfect complexity (not too light or too heavy) for me to play it frequently. The fantasy theme is fun and should appeal to everyone.

An Ameritrashed-themed-Euro that uses dice...lots of dice, but they are used in an interesting way.  The three dice can be used in any combination to curry favor of various nobles in order to collect resources to build buildings that can score you victory points and/or special abilities.  I enjoyed playing Kingsburg and would like to try it again despite some reservations.  My constant low die rolls prevented me from pursuing what little strategy is available. Analysis paralysis can be an issue for some.  Also, the monsters at the end of the year are pretty weak and was a bit of a disappointment since they were easy to defeat.

Each season, everyone rolls three dice. In player order, the players put the value of the dice onto advisors to get their benefit (earn goods, VPs, soldiers, or look at monster cards, etc). After each season, everyone can construct buildings, which give further benefits and special abilities, but advanced buildings can only be constructed if the lower level buildings below them have been built. (There are 5 rows of buildings, some give benefits with dice, some give VP, some give soldier benefits, etc). Finally, in winter, a monster attacks. A dice is rolled to determine the player's strength, and each player adds their soldier level to see if they defeat or lose to the monster. Victory usually means 1 or 2 VPs, defeat could see you lose a building. Play over 5 years. 

It's an engaging game, with it's fare share of luck. The mechanics aren't new, but it is fun, and keeps you busy over the approximate 90 minute time period. There are various paths to victory to try as well. The luck part is where one can consistently get high rolls, as opposed to one who gets below average rolls, which can hurt you. Your bad luck could take you out of a game early, and that can really detract from the game. 

I do like the various strategies that one can try, and each game can be fresh and different.

One really senses ownership and responsibility of your region! There are always options when schmoozing the court, even if they weren't your original plans. Tells an interesting story as all players are growing the same kingdom, only competing at who grew their corner of the kingdom the best.

My only real complaint is the same I have for Stone Age; it overstays its welcome. If it were consistently an hour or so I'd probably buy it myself.

Other worker placement games like Snowdonia , Viticulture,or Champions of Midgard seem to have found a better length of play time, before it starts to feel repetitive.

Worker placement is one of my favorite mechanisms in games. I enjoy trying to be efficient with my limited actions, while figuring out what actions need to be performed first so you can get your needed action before your opponent takes it. Kingsburg shines in the worker placement area. The interesting part about Kingsburg is the use of dice as workers. What you role will dictate your options on the board, yet the game has many built in roll mitigations. The issue I have with Kingsburg is that there dose not seem to be enough options. Even with the expansions I tend to feel I am doing the same thing over and over again.

Like most Euros Kingsburg is quite an enjoyable game, but also like most Euros it is pure Euro fodder.

Fun two-hour game with a healthy dose of manageable luck.  One faces the tough task of balancing the creation of buildings and accruing victory points with the "unknown" amount of soldiers one would need to fend off the mystery attackers at the end of each year.  With more players turn order is definetely a deciding factor, since you can grab high-tier advisors before anyone else if you go first.  With two-players it would be a much more peaceful affair.

My girlfriend likes it a lot.

Update:  I'm worried that even with the expansion, the Church path is the way to go, since it directly gives you more points.  At least in our house, that path seems to be by far, the most taken and the most productive.

Had we not been playing Lords of Waterdeep, we might have liked this better.  The building cards are a little awkward to manage and difficult to keep track of with the other players.

Kingsburg is better than its contemporary, Alien Frontiers, for a variety of reasons, most importantly in how each player's dice placement is not necessarily done all at once. This provides players further down the turn order track the opportunity to place a least one of their dice before all the good locations are blocked up. This forces players to pay attention to what is happening on other players' turns and creates a level of anxiety with regards to ones options disappearing.

The end-of-each-year enemy attack is a frustrating feature, but one that forces players to not just focus solely on engine-building.

I'm still not sure whether or not I actually like Kingsburg, but I'm positive that it is better than Alien Frontiers.

Really high fun factor in this game, a more straightforward twist on an Alien Frontiers-style dice allocation mechanism (and I much more appreciate the medieval theme over outerspace).

O primeiro jogo destes boardgames mais avançados que adquiri foi o Kingsburg, sucesso em todas as mesas em que já passou - mas só com a expansão. O jogo básico é até meio chato, mas a expansão deu uma melhorada considerável no danado. A ideia é medieval: cada jogador está tentando fazer seu feudo da melhor forma possível. Mas, para conseguir os recursos, é preciso convencer os conselheiros do rei: e para isso são necessários dados. Jogo bacana, nível iniciante/intermediário.

The game's not too bad, but I think it misfires in places. The dice phase is very chess-like, and not many would enjoy playing in a 4-way chess match.

Making carefully considered choices with poor die rolls will never beat the guy who rolls 17 every round to "influence" the queen.

Good mechanics, I just suck at it. Despite the large amount of dice rolling, it is at its heart a game of resource management and those are the games I'm worst at. Kudos to the developers for keeping poor die rolling from totally debilitating you. In fact, this is kind of a different game than it appears at first glance - not just gaining resources, but when to build and when not to relative to the other players is tremendously important. Having the least buildings at the right time can be huge.

The overall idea is nice, nothing revolutionary, but it's easy to explain, and relatively fast to play. It's nothing revolutionary, but it works... to an extent.

Once you play a few games (very few in fact), you are likely to develop an ideal building strategy that you will probably repeat most of the games you'll play, with very few alterations. 

The expansion "To Forge a King" is a must, because it gives the game much more diversity. There are also some free print and play expansions that add to its life.

I need to play with different people to see if this is really true.

A nice, straightforward game featuring great artwork, a good balancing mechanic and multiple paths to victory.

An interesting, creative dice game. The dice serve as place-holders and blockers, gaining resources and preventing others from accessing specific advisors. This, to me, is a very innovative use of dice. This game is certainly luck-based, but a player who rolls poorly can still succeed, if he applies his rolls properly. There are also ways to minimize the luck factor (+2 Markers, the Inn, the Chapel, the Market, etc). A lot of the time the best player wins, but bad luck can disrupt even the best laid plans.

Addendum: luck is a limiiting factor, and a good player can win with bad die rolls. This game gets better with each play. It is also one of the most fun to play games out there.

An original take on the worker placement mechanism. Not too long either. Except with five players, since the game is somewhat AP prone during the worker placement. The game end is a bit of a letdown, because there is no kind of end scoring.

Compared to component quality, and number of components, the original 40 EUR price tag is very high. The cards and player boards are thin, and the wooden dice are very light. The artwork is very nice, though.

I enjoy a little randomness in games, but the luck of the dice is way too high a factor in this game.  Also, it doesn't feel like it supports different strategies.  For example, the "military" aspect of the game feels tacked on... the risks are too low and the rewards are even lower to support a strategy based around it.  The buildings vary too much in strength.  Overall it felt more like a multi-player dice puzzle to me than a solid game.

KINGSBURG - Un gioco italiano, e solo per questo merita attenzione, anche perché effettivamente è un bel gioco. Molto carina l'ambientazione e i disegni che l'accompagnano, parlo del tabellone e delle carte. Qualche cubetto di legno, le varie schede e i dadi completano la componentistica che forse non giustifica del tutto il prezzo così alto.

Complessivamente risulta essere un gioco semplice e tutto sommato veloce, anche perché le partite volano senza troppi tempi morti.

Il gioco però ha un grandissimo difetto, è decisamente troppo legato alla sorte dei dadi. Malgrado le strategie che si possono adottare, le varie idee, alla fine probabilmente vincerà il più fortunato e non il più bravo.

Dal mio gruppo di gioco è stato definito un Monopolone... forse eccessivo, ma c'è del vero.
A me però nel complesso è piaciuto.

Let's start with the good thing: a new mechanics (dice rolling, splitting the dice and assign). Stop.

Bad things: 
- the mechanics seems smart, but it is basically open only to the "grab now what you can" strategy. Apart from the first year where you can make some speculations on what the other players will choose based on their dice, in the other 12 seasons you have no idea of what others will take (thanks to dice splitting, market and +2 tokens). Strategies are so open that you can be lucky and being left with the things you want with your second die or unlucky and throw your dice away. This no-strategy really annoys me and this is the reason I do not like the game.
- the buildings rows remind me of many other games, but they are not so well diversified (as, for example, Caylus' favors) nor their ending building are so much powerful to invite players to go deep into the row (look for example at the Cathedral with its weak power)
- the theme is non existant. It is not enough to draw a good board with nice pictures to attach a setting to he mechanics. Everybody in this games "takes the 5" instead of "ask for the sergent's advice".
- finally, the winter battles are ridicolous. They become really problematic in year 5, for the rest its just enough to hire somebody in year 4. If they become problematic earlier it's because of very poor die roll... but can a game being influenced in a so crucial part by a SINGLE die roll? The variant http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/366312/kingsburg-winter-reinforcements-expansion makes this part of the game much better (raising my score to +1).

Good use of dice. A bit similar with StoneAge in that dice actualy does work here. Variation on the worker(dice)-placement. 2nd/3rd play should be better as diffrent stragies/building-paths start to matter more.

An enjoyable growth game with a dice controlled placement mechanism. Allocate your dice roll scores to various advisors to obtain building materials or militia. Use your materials to build buildings, which help you build more buildings or improve fighting capabilities. During the winter season of  each of 5 years, you have to fight a monster and if you lose you take victory point or building penalties, so you have to balance between the two areas of growth. In the game I played I lost against the final monster by one point, whereas others just won by one point and that caused me to slip from 1st to last place, which seemed a bit extreme, but still quite an enjoyable game.

[b]Kingsburg[/b] was traded away for Alhambra Anniversary Edition 3/11/14.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]The one big negative I have for is that the game is usually is decided by the end of the 4th year. This is compounded by the fact that the scoring is all open, there is no hidden scoring like all of the civilization cards in Stone Age. This lead to me trading the game away.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Love how the dice are used as your workers, this adds some great tension to the game.
- I also like all the different ways you can choose to build buildings, there are lots of ways to combine powers from different buildings.
- Good family game, however I believe Lords of Waterdeep and Stone Age are better introductions to worker placement.[/i]

RATING: 6
A good game marred by two key problems:

- Unlike games like Settlers of Catan, Agricola & Power Grid the victory points aren't strongly linked to anything; they almost seem tacked on.

- The end-of-year battles are too random. There are two linear random variables at work (the king die and the strength of the foe) that are stacked against each other, amplifying the random effect. The penalties for losing some of the battles are huge, but putting all your resources into soldiers (for little effect, when a 6 is rolled on the kings die) can hamper your building efforts significantly compared to players who didn't bother and relied on the kings die to save them. Too much of it is down to luck.

The main issue I have is that most of the time, once you've rolled the dice there is typically just one optimal way you'd use them, so all 'hands' would always be played the same. Sometimes it's not obvious though and perhaps there are 2 good options.

Rolling higher is better because all the best spaces have high numbers.

Dice games need to be fast. This one ain't and it's poor as a result. Everyone rolls their dice, and you're trying to split 'em up and allocate 'em to as many of the spots numbered 2 thru 18 as you can (taking turns, first on a spot gets it). These'll give you resources used to complete buildings on a tech tree, which give you more dice and abilities to manipulate them amongst other things. You want to maximise the resources you get each turn, which means checking out what other people have rolled, working out if they can take a spot you want or not, can you get multiple spots or should you just combine everything and settle for as big a spot as you can get. It's just not that interesting turn after turn. You'll expect to build over half the tech tree in a game, and their effects are usually minor, so that part doesn't provide much interest either. It might be better when played with more than the 3 we played it with. It's allegedly much better with the expansion which provides more variety in the tech tree. But as one of my game brothers said, why pay double price for an average game when you can buy two good games instead.

What I like:
- Fun theme and good use of dice
- Definitely better with the battle chits instead of dice

What I don't like:
- Feels just a bit bloated
- You have to roll high to do well
- It would be more fun at 60 minutes than 90

This is definitely a bit heavier than the 2.4 BGG weight, so I'll give it a 2.8.

I find this one to be a nice pos-gateway game, its easy to teach and to play, and not very deep even if it has plenty of choices to be made! The art in this one is superb!

The dice may ruin some games, as bad rolls will definitly take you out of the game, but there's some catch up mechanics that help with that problem.

Another thing to mention is that the game ends too abruptly and that's very anticlimactic, still, its a nice game and one i'm happy to have in my colection!

Leggi le regole e già ti immagini un piccolo capolavoro. A questo aggiungi una grafica ben curata (sebbene il tratto non sia tra i miei preferiti) e alcuni particolari (le armate invernali) che non ti fanno veder l'ora di giocarci. Poi ci giochi e rimani basito: il gioco è più monotono di quanto ti aspetti, e la guerra d'inverno è molto meno drammatica di quanto sembri sulla carta. Inoltre, mi aspettavo che il dado aggiuntivo arrivasse con più facilità. La sensazione è che il gioco difetti di bilanciamento (poco playtest?), visto che da più parti si consigliano varianti appoggiate dallo stesso autore. Una mezza delusione. Discorso a parte sul prezzo: inizialmente lo ritenevo adeguato (la qualità dei componenti, schede personali escluse, è ottima), ma a un confronto con la dotazione di giochi simili esce con le ossa rotte.

Curious as to how Alien Frontiers stacks up with this one. Has a mandatory expansion.

Just seems to be an unremarkable game. Aside from picking a good set of buildings, it generally seems to lack strategy. Even the expansion with the added buildings and roles just doesn't seem that engaging.

The wife likes it though so I guess it will hang around for a while unless I can find something similar she likes more.

Kingsburg is a game about throwing dice, and then use them to get resources, as in a worker placement game. It's less luck-dependent than the presence of dice would suggest, although high dice throws still give you a significant advantage. I liked it, although it was slightly too long.

I played it yesterday with some friends: it is very appealing at the first sight but the game does not completely mantain the promises. Graphics is cool (box in particular) but not always (inside the box). I liked the system of dices but eventually there is too much luck and sometimes the game is not really balanced: you quickly see that are things more important than others and all players immediately started focus on them (ex. the Alchemist). I will play it from time to time, but nothing special.

A unique worker placement based on the dice each turn.  I love the progression in this game from year to year and having a build tree for your buildings.  There are often many paths to choose for buildings and influencing advisors.  The battle aspect is a nice touch.

This game has pretty long AP and seems to take longer than it should, since people are calculating all possible dice outcomes.  Two main issues were also fixed with the expansion, however present without: the king's reinforcements are based on a die roll and the building tree had same strategies used by players.

RATING: 4
Unrealized potential. 

The art is attractive, the components solid, and the  gameplay is streamlined. What's not to like? Unfortunately, lots of things. 

Simply put, the game lacks any real tension. Each time we played, I felt a vague sense of dissatisfaction by game end. It was like hanging out with an attractive guy, only to discover he's really shallow and boring. 

My primary problem lies with the dice. I love the little critters, don't get me wrong, but in Kingsburg they're used in a rather tame and uninteresting manner. If you intend on including dice in a game design, they should sparkle. When they're rolled, they should invoke excitement, anticipation, and maybe even dread. The player should feel something; anything. I'm not expecting a profound, life-changing experience or anything, I just want to care about the outcome. 

Maybe the word I'm looking for is "tension." If I was required to choose what I wanted to roll for ahead of time, rather than allocating the dice afterward, the tension would have ratcheted up several notches. 

"But wait," you may exclaim, "then it would be an entirely different game! It wouldn't be the Kingsburg we've come to know and love!"

That's exactly my point. Kingsburg is tame. That's one of the most damning things I can say about its design. I didn't feel any tension about the upcoming attack, and the competition for favor among the members of the court felt rather low-key. 

Parting shot: I don't do tame. If you're including dice in a game, or using any kind of randomizer, then make sure that it adds tension. The line between tension and chaos is rather fine, like the edge of a knife, but it's well worth walking.

7/15/12 - This game has grown on me. The expansion really takes it to the next level with the governors, soldier tokens, asymmetrical building choices, and event deck. It really fleshed out the basic game and gave it much more strategy, especially when fighting in winter. I just wish the game would support 6 players.

Pros:
* Beautiful game board.
* Dice placement mechanic is unique and works well.

Cons:
* The designer(s) is clearly a social justice warrior unrealistically making the "master hunter" a female - stop putting this nonsense in games please.
* The King's reinforcements are far too random. (Fixed in the expansion)
* The player boards do not have recessed places for your building tokens, allowing for them to get messed up too easily by simply bumping them.
* Without the expansion the game gets to repetitive.

I played this on BSW. It is a very interesting game and there is definitely some strategy to it. I got my behind handed to me by a veteran player there. It requires some thinking and it does offer some interesting decisions to be made throughout the game. I think I've saved up too much of the dice modifier chips and I didn't find a good balance between building buildings that gives more VP than the army buildings. I was too afraid of the enemies that will give me negative VPs. I can see this game that offers some strategy but also depends on luck of the roll. I really wanted to roll high but couldn't. What a bummer. 

The sole interaction in this game is blocking someone else's die and make them pass or use a die modifier. 

I would play again, but I don't think this game will gel well with my sister-in-law than other gateway games.

This is what Settlers should have been, turning a string of crappy die-rolls into still-meaningful decisions, and with balancing mechanics to get stragglers back in the game. Add in some blocking of the advisors by other players, and it can be a tense, back-and-forth, coming down to the die roll at the very end.

Expansion is absolutely mandatory, though.

Great game. Played with my wife and son and found out that unless someone is doing something really silly or something extraordinarily good, the game manages to keep the group points close until the end. Great simple game to understand. There was a bit of "Analysis Paralysis" but I am pretty sure it will go away as soon as we get used to the roles and the benefits of specific buildings.

An interesting strategic game which may seem dependant on luck a lot given the dice you throw every turn. After tens of plays however I've noticed that can be almost completely minimised and it is all about the choices you make and how you distribute your resources.

RATING: 8
Build your city to be great and able to withstand the attacks each winter.

The core mechanism of the game has every player rolling three dice simultaneously, lowest total starting out.
Each player in turn places one or more dice on one of the advisors (numbered 1 to 18) at the King's court.
When all dice are placed (or no more dice can be placed), the players gain the rewards of the advisors from the Jester (1) to the King (18). These mainly consist of wood, stone and gold to build your city, hired soldiers for the defense and straight up victory points.

Then the players have the opputunity to build in their city in order to gain VPs, add defense and other effects.

This is done for three turns called productive seasons (spring, summer and fall).

When winter comes, some kind of attack takes place. The players can see the approximate strength of the attack  beforehand and some advisors also let you take a sneak peek at the attack, which means you know exactly what's coming.
A single die is rolled and added to each player's result. All players that have a total strength higher than the strength of the attack gains a reward, lower is penalized and with a draw nothing happens.

At the end of the fifth year, the player with the most points win.

The dice placement mechanism has the players figuring out what spots are possible to reach given the dice they have. The lower numbered spots are more efficient but easy to reach, which means that more players probably can reach them with a single die. This adds the need to look at the other players dice in order to figure out if there are useful spots on the board that noone can reach but you. If that is the case, that placement can be deferred in order to take a more contested space.

Since the board is static at 18 spaces, gameplay gets a lot tighter at higher player counts. Still, the shifting player order makes it fair, since the last player to go has the highest total and probably has at least one spot noone else can reach.

Really interesting way of using dice to select & compete over which resources/actions to benefit from each turn. The variable turn order & placement of dice keeps everyone involved throughout. The enemy cards provide good intermediate goals to aim for.

WARNING: Can run upto about 2 hours - perhaps a little too long?
WARNING: May start to lose interest after 5-10 plays? There are a limited number of options, so strategies may become stale (although there are always tough decisions about where to place youor dice). This is perhaps more of a light, introductory game which works well with (and is attractive to) newer boardgamers.

Interesting stuff, but I can't shake the feeling that Kingsburg could have been a lot better. The choices, resources, buildings are balanced, up to the point where I feel your decisions don't really matter, and it all comes down to two or three dice rolls (the later end-of-the-round attacks). Guess wrong and you lose. The analyzing, puzzling, planning part is fun, but that - and the game length - make it too hard for a light game, and there's way too much randomness for a medium-heavy game. It looks cool, the gameplay is fun, but there's too much work and not enough reward.

I stand alone here but I find Kingsburg more entertaining than Dominion.

In this game, your dice are your workers. On each turn you roll your dice and then you can assign the results to numbered action spaces that match the numbers you rolled, or you can combine multiple dice to add their sum to take a higher action on the board. It creates a nice tension of trying to block players from taking their actions by getting there first and making you think about the benefits of one big action or several small actions.

The game also gives you a development board in front of you, which improves various things you do in the game through unlocking slots in ordered rows. Unfortunately some of these rows are better than others, which hurts replayability a little.

Another worker placement game with dice. Although I really like the advisor-influence mechanic, ultimately the game is too luck-driven for the duration. A series of poor rolls, especially early in the game, can knock you out of contention with capable players, and you're left to sit through a 2 hour game with no hope of winning. I personally find the theme more appealing than Stone Age, although at least the latter's theme is more original.

RATING: 5
First 4-player games revealed both the good and the bad. It is easy to play, initial buildings are easy to build, and intentional screwage is minimal. Poor die rolls, AP, and (perhaps) a few optimal-strategy builds can result in: a hopeless position, excessive delays, and limited build strategies (respectively). These latter factors may push the rating down to a 6 (yep, the rich-get-richer did it). Overall it plays too slowly and it even 'feels' long... not good.

With the +2 chit Inn, Market, & Farm gives an option for the Queen 50% of the time (a natural 17 on 3 dice is only 1.4%) and, with a little Soldier management, risk of loss is minimized.

The 'Monster' problem can take up to 1/3 of the game and make the outcome dependent on 1 or 2 dr (rating drops to a 5). And, on a pro-rated value of the buildings, the loss penalties are 4.3x worse than any reward; this is ridiculous. A solution would be to make 'Armies' permanent except for changes due to (now infrequent) loss of buildings while deleting the' King's Aid' and any losses, in VP,  would be the difference between the 'monster' and the number of armies.

Next time I will ratio the total of all die rolls to the VP.... see how close it comes to being a constant.

There are possible balancing ideas but why bother with so many other games to play.

Wow - a Euro with dice?

There is a strong resource acquisition - building element. Very much like how the dice roll drives the play order and who can get which resources. The better rolls can be penalized. Lots of balancing mechanisms in this phase.
Like how the end of the round you have to acquire troops which don't score points to protect your gains.  

Tried with expansion - the new strips give a nice variation it is good to have players with slightly different objectives.
The best part of the expansion is the use of the disk for the kings favor. Makes a ho-hum part of the original a more tense affair

Good games were you have to manage your luck with the dices like you would with Yspahan. You also have to check what the other players might play with there dice results in order not to be blocked when it's time to choose a role, or block the other players for there next moves. You must always keep in mind that during the winter phase, you must fight the barbarians and win in order not to loose VP. The mechanic of the game is simple and the rules are easy. Good game for the whole family.

Bon jeu ou vous devez gérer la chance avec les dés à la manière de Yspahan. Vous devez également vérifier les résultats aux dés des autres joueurs afin de déterminer les choix de personnages et ainsi de ne pas être bloqué lors des tours suivants ou de bloquer d'autres joueurs pour leurs prochaines actions. Vous devez toujours garder en tête qu'à la phase de l'hiver vous devez vaincre les barbares afin de ne pas perdre de points de victoire. La mécanique du jeu est simple tout comme les règles  Bon jeu pour toute la famille.

A worker placement game with extremely limited choices.  The better you roll, the more resources you get.  Those who say rolls don't matter are fooling themselves.  There is also little decision making involved in placing the dice, because you are always going to place where you can get the most resources.  The only thing to think about is that you may want to go one spot before another, so another player doesn't block you from that spot.  But the fact is, higher rolls get you more stuff, period.

There are choices to be made on the building track, but most of the tracks aren't worth going for.  This part of the game is simply engine building, and if you rolled better, and got more resources, you will build faster and have more advantages than your opponents.

I don't like random die rolls and I don't like engine-building games.  Put the two together and you have a horrible, horrible game!  How is this fun?  I don't get it.

The simple mechanic of rolling the dice and "deploying" any subset of your dice to the board is really what this game is made of. The rest of the game is slightly below average and your run of the mill resource gathering, building and so forth. The artwork and theme are good but this game is a heavy Euro disguised as light Ameritrash. Player Interaction is limited, which would be my biggest complaint. Maybe allow players to trade, steal, switch resources / dice or else. Apart from the dice roll, no luck is involved which works fine in the game but I do prefer some luck in my games. At least, the success is not accumulative and the tide can change rather quickly, unlike in so many similar games.

I really like this game but I have two major issues with the game.

First, purposely tanking in the first round gives you a huge advantage by getting an extra dice and providing you the caravan. This doesn't guarantee you the victory, but of the 3 times I have played I've never seen the person who gets that advantage do worse than second place.

Second, I end up doing the same strategy every single game. I have found a combo that gives me a very good chance of winning each time, so I don't stray from this strategy.

Only played it the once, but I really enjoyed it.  it would have been an 8, but the yearly invaders were just too easy to beat - grab a couple of military bonus buildings and you're basically safe, barring a low die roll for the King.  Get a couple of soldiers too, and it doesn't matter what the King rolls.  Nobody lost a fight during our entire game.

However, I haven't bought a copy.  50 Euros is too much.  If the German edition costs 40E, and the olny difference is the rulebook (Queen have started selling games with 6 different rulebooks in the box, sothey can't be that costly) and the player boards (which didn't look like very thick cardboard).  Wake me if the price of the English edition falls to 40E.

FINALLY picked up 7/12/16, and in a local trade no less!

Just fun with a capital F. I had read about tons of games on BGG for 7 years, and Kingsburg was the first game I read about that I immediately put to the top of my "Want to Play" list.
[b]And it didn't disappoint.[/b] THAT's saying something, for me. So many top-rated games have such obvious unbalanced aspects (PR's Small Market, early Quarrys and Warehouse/Factory, San Juan's Guild House, Notre Dame's Park, PoF's Professions/Recruiters/Jesters, T&E's Red tiles, etc etc etc) that it was refreshing seeing so many viable buildings and character choices in Kingsburg. 
The only no-brainer seems to be the Queen, but she is hard to get, so that's a big factor buffering her unbalancedness )also, the house rule to fix her is to make her only worth 2 VP's).

[u]On the luck factor, and comparisons to Stone Age:[/u] 
There are multiple buildings (Market, Farms, Chapel) that mitigate the luck factor in KB somewhat.
Further, the 3d6 probabilistic curve is there to likely result in middling numbers that - *gasp* - you then need to CHOOSE where to put them, amongst steep competition for spaces from the other players. And +2 chits modify that further. Heck, I can look at the monster in Kingsburg, and use that information to help me *gasp* plan. Heck, we can all even use the alternative rule and play with the tokens which eliminates completely the King's Aid random roll.

But now we come to the biggest reason why Kingsburg arguably has LESS luck than Stone Age:

Because in Kingsburg, you roll your dice and THEN make your choices.
But in SA, you make your choices, and THEN are screwed over (or rewarded) by the dice.

You can't make any decisions once you've rolled the dice in SA - you are at their probabilistic mercy.

Caylus with dice, basically.  It has some very interesting game mechanics, with good player interaction, and the luck is manageable.  It's a solid game I'd play again.  Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed that I didn't get a sense of improving my capabilities and resources as I built new buildings, the way I do in Caylus, Puerto Rico, and many other games.  So many of them duplicate another building's power, and the only ones that add to production are built so late in the game it hardly matters WHAT they do. It also has a bit of an analysis problem, especially once every player has built a market.

This game is very okay. It is too light to be particularly strategic compared to Alien Frontier or Stone Age and is quite long for such a light game. Something about it is still satisfying and I will likely play it once every few months. ~12/20/13

Added 16mm plastic dice with digits instead of pips to my FF 1st edition copy. The dice that come with this edition are wooden with very rounded corners--easy to knock off the number that was rolled when moving them around the board. Also, the yellow dice have white dots that are very hard to read. The new dice have square edges, so they're easier to keep in the number rolled; and the digits are easier to recognize than the pips.

I used to rate this game 8, and was very enthusiastic when I first got it. For over a year, though, it's been beat out by other games that I've acquired. Finally played it again with 5 players, and I've decided to lower it to 7. What puts me off about this game is that it's difficult to keep track of the timing of the effects of the abilities of all of one's buildings. There is no help on the board, filled with 20 buildings, for when the effects apply. I'm thinking of getting some small stickers for the seven different times when the effects of buildings can take effect.

For me, then, it's design flaws that I think hamper this game. I understand they've addressed the dice problem, which is good, but I think a second edition redesign of the player boards in which the buildings each have an icon or color distinguishing which season they take effect in would help.

Fascinating game and one of the few with traditional dice that I truly enjoy. Develop a fief for your liege lord better than the other players and repel fantasy monster invasions every winter for five years. Fun with a healthy dose of screwage. Works best with multiple players.

Growing to dislike this one. It's just too samey game after game and the more I play the more I dislike it. I feel maybe the expansion could fix it but I'm in no hurry to get that.

The expansion totally rescues this game for me.

No big surprises here, it's a fun game, a bit light and could perhaps use more player interaction apart from laying down dice. Easy to learn, but feels you could be following similar building strategies in later games as well. Expansions seemed interesting.

RATING: 9
After 2 plays I am rating this a 9.5, and it just may well hit 10 - only time will tell.

Kingsburg is a fantastic game that has both euro and ameritrash characteristics.  I personally enjoy the gradual construction of the province's buildings as the game progresses.  As season's pass, you collect resources through die rolling and placement.  Resources are used to build buildings which aid you in some way.  You must also be mindful of the invasion which occurs each winter - if you have not properly recruited soldiers or completed defenses you will suffer the consequences.

Update 12/31/09 : After 8 plays I am rating it a 10.  I find myself thinking about this game way too often during the day at work.  I really like the use of dice in this game - fantastic!

I also highly recommend the expansion to this game which adds in more flavor - more buildings, governor cards that give special bonuses and event cards really make no two games the same.

Update 2/15/16 :  Lowering a little.   Still enjoy it, but not as much as before.

Great game!  Hard not to enjoy this game in the family setting.  Perhaps a little too much luck for the hard-core gamer.

The only negative I can see about Kingsburg is that if someone gets a lead, it's nearly impossible to catch them.  Often in year5, it's already clear who is going to win.  The obvious solution:  don't let them get a lead.

One other potential negative:  My kids get overly agressive when they play this game.  It sometimes is a little more 'mean-spirited' than it shoud be.

RATING: 7
Very good game in which you collect resources to upgrade your building in order to produce victory points. Pros: easy to grasp; advantages of various buildings are obvious; choices revolve around the dice you rolled; every game should be different. Cons: if you roll poorly, you'll have poor building choices: planning in advance is limited - you're a slave to your dice-rolling; you can get blocked and not have playable options when your turn arrives. Definitely better when played with four players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There are clever things about this game, but you can get screwed by the dice. Yes, there are ways to mitigate these factors, but there are still bad rolls. Also, the game feels somewhat repetitive, with the same actions being performed round after round. Finally, the "catch up" mechanism is a little too good. And yes, this game is balanced, in the fact that all players usually finish within a few point of each other. Got talked into playing this again. Liked it better with five players. It's pleasant enough but there's not enough depth for its length.

Like this game.  At first, it's just about figuring out how to best get the resources you need to do what you want.  But eventually...you also start to look at your opponents, sizing them up, and figuring out how to best screw them over AND get what you want!

Have played numerous times with wife and 6-year-old son and a few times with brothers.  Good with all player counts, but better with more players.

Revised rating down to a 6. This is taking us two hours. Too long for a mid-weight game. At two hours, I'd sooner play a heavy resource management/ role selection game like Puerto Rico.

========================================================
Met my modest expectations. The building tracks are a nice little puzzle. Some genuine choices for dice-play and blockage. I don't know how much depth it has. It's biggest merit is it plays cleanly and briskly. And it looks nice. Probably make for a good cross-over game for non-gamers.

Just picked it up today (June '08).  I've played a bunch on the computer over the last couple weeks.  Great game.  Give it an 8.  If I'm still playing it a bunch in a few months then it could move to a 9.  Wife likes it a lot (and that says a lot because she hates learning new games).

Update (Feb.'09): Just upgraded from 8 to 8.5.  Don't believe when others suggest that there's too much luck.  The luck is controlled.  And the game is great.  Still takes 75-90 minutes but you're constantly doing stuff instead of sitting and waiting for something to happen.  Only drawback to me is the weirdness of the winter season.  Just feels very contrived and a little tough to explain to new gamers.   My daughter likes it even though she hardly likes any games at all.

I enjoyed playing this game. Players roll dice, which they use to select roles and gather resources. They use these to construct buildings and fight off invasions of the Kingdom. Other than the dice mechanism which is very clever this is very similar to other worker placement games. The upside is that the game has more nuance in the turn by turn tactical play than worker placement games. The downside is that players can suffer badly from analysis paralysis and the game can slow. This is a natural product of giving players a lot of small decisions which appear to have an important future impact but which are not easily analyzed.
If you can find four or out of preference five players who will play fairly quickly - and are willing to manage random elements rather than moan about them - this is clearly going to be a fun game.

(10/21/2008) - This just came in today after ordering from Pozy.com. This is the newest reprint. I have heard good things about this one.

(12/21/08) - [6.5] - I like playing this game, but I think that it really only has one viable path to victory. Simply build a ton of military (usually by completing the track that goes up to the Wizard place), then build the top row for as many VPs as you can. I've used that strategy 4 times in 4 games and have won every single one.

(5/2/13) - Kingsburg has been sold as part of a larger liquidation of my collection. It was a great game to play initially, but wore off a bit as time went on.

I am a huge fan of this game. Its a tight game of trying to do as much as possible, but you could never do it all. I love the dice placement and decisions of risking splitting up your dice and possibly getting blocked or group them together to take one big reward. Those 2 pip bonus tokens are some building that give you versatility when placing are a HUGE help. Having to balancing gathering resources and building to having enough of an army to fight at the end of each year is a constant push/pull. I highly recommend including some (if not all) of the modules from the expansion.

Play 5P. Too long for what it is. Prone to AP. Would be much interesting if not broken i.e. rolling high gives you more choices but not rolling low. Statistically, rolling high is as "difficult" as rolling "low". That there is a player order does not balance this since order is from low to high, hence competition for high positions is non existent. And the monster event never was a problem really, even without landing on 10.

Kingsburg loses points for me simply because I don't like games in which luck can completely undo choices and strategies I have made as a player. The mechanic of manipulating the dice to activate different areas is fun and the ability to block other players is interesting. Spending resources to build buildings that give different powers is another plus. The randomness of the end of year battle where resources spent on military could either be wasted or not enough just on the roll of the die is very irritating to me. I've played it twice now and this is my initial rating.

Kockadobáson alapuló társasjáték. A mechanizmusa elég érdekes, ugyanis a dobott értékek tükrében kell nyersanyagokat szerezni, és így lehet a királyságunkat fejleszteni.
A dobálás elég szerencse alapú, de a második fele, azaz a kockák felhelyezése meglehetősen komoly előre gondolkozást, és előre kitalált stratégiát követel.

Love the dice placement, and I overall find the game nice and interesting, but I think it's a little too long and lacks a bit of pace. There's not much variation and you are basically doing the same thing in your first production season as in your last. You don't get the same feeling of building something as you do in other similar games. But don't get me wrong. Overall it's a good game.

Enjoyed the first play with the multiple decisions how best to proceed in terms of development and the benefits they provide.  More possibilities at all stages in the game than time to do it.  Our game might have been a bit of a fluke also as we had the weakest enemies and rolled high for each battle making them non-events.  Some complaints about the luck of the dice but that didn't seem to impact the standings.  Good players seem to be able to build on most if not all rounds. 

The warrior chits from [gameid=39775] are a permanent part of the base game as I will only play with that instead of rolling for the King's Army in winter.  This reduces the variability of the winter phase adding a nice decision in winter for a bit more control.

 My rating has gone down after every play. Too much luck, too much downtime and above all, far limited strategy options. Final year battles are horribly random, every game i have played depended totally on last season battle roll.
 Many weird decisions, e.g, between seasons there are phases in which both fastest and slowest builder players get rewards (usually they have the highest and lowest scores in game), so, whats the point?. I can understand to reward trailing player to get him back into the game, but... rewarding who is already winning?.
 It has many interesting but underveloped mechanics. Not a bad game by any means, just very limited and random one.

A fairly straightforward Euro with nice graphics.  You roll dice, then use the values to select roles which give you resources.  Use the resources to give you abilities in future rounds.  Fun to play, but kept reminding me of similar mechanics in other games.  The *only* player interaction is in trying to select a role before someone else does, possibly making them waste their dice.  And this only happens when enough people play.  I have no need to own, but will be happy to play occasionally.

This is a really fun game where you roll dice and then place them on a board in order to get resources. The game is simple, attractive and straightforward, with easy to learn rules and a surprising amount of strategy. There are eighteen spaces on the board, each one representing one of the various members of the kingdom (Architect, Court Jester, Smuggler, etc). Once you place your dice on a space, no one else can use that person for help. Gather resources like gold, stone and wood, build the buildings that will help your strategy the most and see what happens! Lots of fun for players young and old, both new and experienced.

I like this more than Alien Frontiers - the options of 1-18 is just much more straightforward, but for the length of the game (I think 2 hours is more likely for 4 players), I would usually prefer a heavier worker placement game like Agricola and Caylus. Stick with 2 or 3 players.

This game is really fun. In Kingsburg players play as nobles trying to influence members of the kings court in order to gain resources for building buildings that score points. Players roll dice and can use the values on the dice to influence certain members of the kings court. The player can block other players out and be the most efficient is the winner. I really enjoy this game.

Pros: easy game to learn and play. Fast set up and play time. Deep decisionmaking without a long playing time.beatifal artwork. Smooth gameflow

Cons: some building rows seem overpowered appearing to be a single strategy for game play. Base game has a limited building variety which could reduce replayablity.

I've only played two player. The theme is what grabbed me the most, but I'm not as impressed with the mechanics. 

I'd like to see the winter season altered from its current condition. Instead there would be a map where you had to move your units around to fend off the invaders and where all of your unique building were represented on the board. A tactical combat aspect to the winter turn is what this game needs.

Everything I wrote about changing the winter turn is all a bunch of pie in the sky nonsense, because of course that's not what this game is. If you like worker placement type games, this may be up your alley.

I'm sure this game is much better with more players, but as a 2 player game, I'm not terribly drawn to it. My rating would probably go up if I could play this with more than 2 players.

Dice rolling, millions of them! While I have a great love for dice, this game still isn't my cup of tea. And that doesn't even have anything to do with the fact that I've lost every damn game. I don't know. It's just missing that spark I look for in games. I'd still play it though.

--Dec2008-- (After one play.)  Harmless game that plays a bit like _To Court the King_++.  Not sure I'd look to buy a copy or even suggest a play myself, but happy to play if it was suggested by others.
--Dec2009-- Ended up trading my copy of Dominion to my youngest son for his copy of Kingsburg.  Not sure it was a good trade for me, but it made him happy.
--Jan2017-- And then traded Kingsburg+Exp away last year for a copy of Evolution.  Dominion->Evolution seems a giant step up for me, no matter of the midpoints!

I might have rated this game an 8 after the first play, but the notion that it is a bit scriptable as far as builds go bothered me.  Turns out I was right.  I enjoy the dice placement mechanics and the subtleties of the board, but I find myself building the same buildings and scoring about the same in ever game.  I also think the King is terrible un-important.  I've never seen anyone spend the dice on him..  I feel like he should offer one of everything and/or steal the special marker.

RATING: 8.5
Kingsburg uses dice to represent your workers, and allows you the choice to combine your numbers for more powerful actions, or to use each separate die to take several weaker actions. It's a great little twist on the WP genre, and it is easy enough to teach to newbies. This is a staple, with an expansion that elevates the game one of the best WP I have played. Another one that I've had for a while and just played it enough to move on.

By far, my favorite worker/dice placement, gateway board game. Everyone that I have played this with so far has loved it. The game continues to move so there is minimal downtime. There is always something to do even if you can't roll dice very well. The only suggestion that I have is to get the expansion to use the reinforcement tokens instead of a random die roll.

An underrated Gate-way game. We play a major of a mid-century town, roll dice to befriend the King's advicer, use the resources to construct buildings, and fight against barbarians. A bad dice roll can ruin you game, but a good management can save you. I'm starting to think that Kingsburg is a more suitable Gate-way game than Catan since there are less rules to memorize and more obvious choice to make. Coming to the down side, the reinforcement dice is a total ass-hole! With such strong relief force you don't even bother to set any defense, a clean 3+ and your country is safe.

Worker placement...again...but with dice instead of anything really representing the workers. My reaction to this was the same as to Stone Age: nice enough, but having played better worker placement games, this did not impress. Perhaps it's a little more accessible than other worker placement games, but there are games of the same level of accessibility that I find more interesting. I'm no opponent of luck in games as such, but I found the dice rolling frustrating. The progression of the buildings also did not interest me: perhaps I'm missing something, but there did not seem to be any of the interesting combinations that one otherwise finds in this type of game. 

I'd play it again because I'm sure there are layers of strategy I'm missing, but I can't see myself suggesting it.

There's certainly a level of strategy involved, but when players of roughly equal ability play, it very often comes down to die rolls (and, in particular, to the last roll of the game, which determines who successfully fends off the final invaders).  One modification I'll make if I ever get around to it is to replace the coloured dice with coloured chits (48 of each colour, evenly distributed between one through six) that are drawn and not replaced, to normalize the players' rolling a little.

Played once with the expansion.  Not a bad game by any means and I like the general dice-placement mechanics.  That said, I'd rather play Alien Frontiers or other games with more options if I wanted to play a game with this mechanic.  It feels like in Kingsburg that once you have chosen your path of buildings you largely are just headed in that same direction for the rest of the game.  I prefer something with a bit more tactics or changing strategy.

An interesting game, with dice rolls as a 'resource' effectively. Luck plays a role, but not as bigger-one as you imagine, and the Expansion solves that to some degree.

While dice are heavily used in this game, this is not your typical dice game.  Each player is governor of a realm of the kingdom, each trying to build the the better castle.  The game is divided into 5 years, with 4 seasons each year.  During three of the seasons the players are able to gain resources and build on their castle; during winter each player is attacked by a monster which can either harm the player or give the player a reward, depending on failure or success.  During each productive season all the players simultaneously roll their dice, then progressing from the lowest total to the highest each player may spend their dice to gain resources.  There are 18 advisors on the board numbered 1-18 and the dice are used to determine which advisors you can use.  For instance,f you rolled a 3-4-5 then you could use advisors 3, 4, and 5, or 7 and 5, or 3 and 9, or number 12.  Once an advisor has been claimed for that season, no other player may use them.

After gaining resources players may then spend them to build; each building offers a bonus to the player, and each player has the same choices.  The buildings are arranged in a grid on a player mat, and you have to build left to right (columns) but you can pick which rows.  Most buildings award victory points, although points are awarded for fighting off the monsters as well.

The game has a fair amount of luck involved regarding what numbers show up on the dice, however deciding what to do with your dice is a large part of the strategy behind the game.  It is light-to-medium as far as strategy is concerned, but it is far from a luck-determined game.

RATING: 9
What I love about this game is how how easy it is to set up and explain yet it offers a depth that I find challenging to master. It kind of is a pick the best of a b or c and through out the game your decisions slowly add up for the final push toward the end. Even though last winter may of been easy Don't forget to defend yourself from the unbearable dragons that may lay waste to your buildings at the end!

RATING: 6
(After 1 play, 4 player) Enjoyable, would certainly play again, but would generally prefer to play Caylus, which this feels similar too, wioth most choice and strategic potential of any decision removed. The dice-allocation mechanic is quite fun with 4, but it doesn't feel like the randomness adds an awful lot of value to the game, which is fine. A good 'gateway'? Maybe, but the apparently overwhelming choice of where to place dice, combined with the relatively low level of impact of good or bad decisions, might make this tedious if played between players of disparate skill levels. Nice bits, though.

Long, tedious, repetitive, boring. And I had such high hopes. It sounded good reading the rules, but in practice it drags even when played quickly. There's a wash, rinse, repeat cycle going for fifteen rounds and I just couldn't wait for the ride to stop.

I can see how you could get a game situation where a player falls behind and the catch-up mechanism gives them the opportunity to fight back. However, in a game with equal sensible players it really just tends to dominate. The building paths are fixed (definitely NOT Puerto Rico style), and all players seem to aim for more or less the same buildings on the same uninspiring path.

I can see how you could maybe have the occasional entertaining game due to circumstance. Personally though I think this game has some major problems that needed to be ironed out before it was released on the market. That means that I see potential - issues that could be smoothed over, It sounds like the expansion might greatly improve the game - I'd call it a "fix" and not just an expansion.

This game reminded me of [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/21632]Um Krone und Kragen[/url][/i], because players try to get help of different characters in the King's court with dice in order to achieve greatness.  Nevertheless, it is again a game where you supose to place workers to mainly get cubes and then exchange them for victory points and some special abilities, in which, besides, the luck issue is determinant.  Maybe my rating will be better if the game lasts half of the time it takes to be played.  Besides, it seams to be very lineal, so every time it plays the same.  Perhaps the expansion may fix this problem.

Kingsburg!  A pyramid of possibilities.  You roll some dice, and place those numbers somewhere on a board that gives you resources or certain abilities.  Not too complicated, and still fun.  This is brought down just a bit for me do to the games feeling a bit 'samey'.  Also, it is almost impossible to build much of an advantage in this game.  Maybe that is better in higher player count games, but it does take away a bit of the enjoyment in a 2 player game.

A nice twist on the worker placement game. Plus, it (basically) has a tech tree, which is awesome. Although you're doing the same thing over and over again, the dice do a good job of changing up your choices each round, while limiting them at the same time.

The base game is only a 5, due to potential replayability issues.

The expansion ramps it up to an 6.5.

Update: After repeated plays, the game feels very, very, very samey, even with the expansion. Also, with (basically) only three resources it's not that difficult at least some of what you want every turn. I dunno, it was fun at first, but it just fell very, very flat after a while.

Theme: 
I like the medieval theme so that's a plus for me and whilst its not incredibly immersing it does add a nice flavour to the game.
You do get the feeling of establishing certain types of buildings and trying to sure up your defences for the oncoming monsters.

Components & Art
OK - not a lot of components in here.
There is just the board, your own dice and your personal board of buildings you can build.

Mechanics
I love dice so throwing dice is fun, and the mechanic of using your dice as effectively your action placement was something different for me to use.
It doesn't create a massive amount of luck and randomness though and whilst i am there may be 'good' strategies for making a low dice through work it feels like if you get get good dice roles early it really sets you up. 
It also feels like a game that is hard to come back from and you are reliant on the law of averages coming through - but if you start well you can mitigate your future turns by getting some good foundational buildings that cover for you
I think the expansion adds a great change with removing the dice role of the king for additional defines against monsters and gives you a little more control on your actions

Complexity
It's fairly straightforward game to learn so that's really good for getting up and going and is good filler/starter game for the night.

Final Thoughts
A good game, and happy to play it. 
The randomness/luck element can kind of dictate my feelings into the game. If you are having some bad roles can reduce the fun of it.

Yeah, yeah, it's a dicefest, but there are some cool things going on, especially when you consider that you have to break up your dice rolls to gather your resources.  A built in help mechanic (king's favor) allows for some help for the trailer.  Great art and a fun theme go well together.

After some additional plays, I have to say that this one has gotten more blah in the face of many other excellent titles out there.  It's definitely borderline trade material.

I found this to be an intersting take on a die-rolling game with lots of interesting stuff going on.  Unfortunately, it seems to just keep going on and on and on.  I had to leave my game at the start of the fifth year after two hours of play.  That is really unfortunate as there is a lot of interesting stuff going on to really recommend this game.  However, not so much as to make that kind of time a worthwhile investment.  (6.5)  [02/17/2008]
-------------------------------------------
Looking back on this game, I think my initial rating may have been overly generous.  I will say that we were playing a rule incorrectly which directly led to the extended playtime.  Still, I'm not sure this is my type of game.  The choosing of actions based on your die rolls is not something I really like (in general).  I was reminded of this recently in a game of Dark Horse.  However, unlike that game, I would be willing to give this one another go (I think).  I have hopes that it would be enjoyable (as Troyes is).  Unfortunately, I don't have all that much desire to seek out that play.  [11/22/2012]

Kingsburg (English) -- Played three-, four-, and five-player.  The balancing mechanisms really only work for the ends of their respective spectrum.  For example, a tie for fewest buildings is broken by fewest goods.  So of the players tied for fewest buildings, one gains a benefit and the other gains [i]nothing[/i].  This benefit is either an additional white die before the first phase, or the King's Envoy after the Summer phase.  These are significant benefits.  I would like to see the loser of the tie receive some lesser benefit.  Similarly, the people between first and last on the turn order scale can really miss out.  (I generally avoid house rules, but the imbalance in benefits to such tied players really does seem to warrant some modification to the rules.)

That said, I've enjoyed playing this game several times, trying different strategies along the way. 

It's worth mentioning that the game is long — arguably too long for its weight.

RATING: 5.5
Played once with 3P and the expansion. I generally enjoy games where players have to work creatively with dice rolls, and the core mechanism of Kingsburg delivers in that respect. Players roll 3 dice each, and then delegate combinations of pips onto the corresponding advisors to take actions. There is some angst in figuring out how to divvy the pips, while keeping an eye out for opportunities to block opponents from coveted spots. 

However, the rest of the game is terrifically monotonous. The tech tree looks interesting at first, but it offers rather incremental abilities and the wide array of choices can inflict unwanted AP. Also, low dice rolls, like in [thing=34635][/thing], will get you nowhere. The lack of progression and repetitiveness is obviously problematic, but the nail in the coffin is that the game lasts a round too long for what it offers. It's alright, but I won't be seeking this one out to play again.

[1 play] Never again. This wasn't fun, interesting, thought provoking, or memorable at all. The tech tree aspect is useless since none of the decisions are difficult or offer opportunities to develop strategies of any substance. The dice even out over the course of the game and aren't really cleverly employed other than some minor blocking - but since you can just as well build something different that turn, it doesn't really matter what resources you end up with if blocked.

I hadn't played before, so I should have peeked at the distribution of power amongst the monsters. Other than that, it just seemed too easy and meaningless. Perhaps a good kid's game.

Uninspired design. Boooooo. Trade pile.

Most recent play 3-13-10 at Cabin Con 2010.

RATING: 7
Puerto Rico style buildings with special abilities, resource gathering…sure we’ve seen it all. The only difference is the use of dice to grab special abilities (Caylus style) of the King’s advisors. Each year (turn) has several similar phases and a last one where the land is attacked. Players who fail to fend off attack (usually based on value of attackers against defence) lose resource/buildings/etc. VPs are scored for buldings, etc.

The game clips along fairly nicely but is still a little long especially when everyone is trying to maximize moves towards the end game.

It's like a hybrid of Caylus and Yahtzee. Naturally, there is a degree of luck, especially when it comes to how many soldiers you get at the end of the year.

Nice enough worker placement dice game, but also a bit boring. The problem is that it begins to feel repetitive pretty soon. The luck element in the final combat of each season is a good bit too high, I would say.
Needs players who are reasonably quick with simple mathematics (adding dice and seeing distribution opportunities in different combinations) without making their head hurt. I myself tend to be a bit too slow with this one, thus adding to its already rather overlong length.

RATING: 7
When you want to roll some dice, this is one of the best options.  Surprisingly, the theme works for me.  Using your dice to influence the king and members of his court works well because the game effect of each persona is well integrated with their status and occupation.  Each season has an appropriate little interlude between dice rolling/influence rounds.  I especially like the battles at the end of winter.   

Only 2 things stop this from being rated higher - game length (it's a little long and difficult to teach for a light-medium weight game) and AP (this game invites players to overthink their moves which can make the game drag).  

Play with decisive cut-throat friends who like to roll dem bones and this is a "9".

I liked this dicefest a lot more than I thought I would.  It still seems kind of overrated in some ways, but there are lots of interesting strategies.  Don't forget to defend against the invaders.  The theme reminded me a bit of Succession: Intrigue in the Royal Court.  The graphics were a little dark, but at least they weren't cartoony and seizure-inducing like that game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
The only thing keeping Kingsburg from getting a perfect rating from me is the combat system. The combat system seems like it was tacked onto the game as an afterthought. I feel like combat could be more exciting, but it sadly isn't. Other than that this game is fantastic. It is the perfect blend of luck and strategy. The game is remarkably unlike any other game from FFG I have ever played, hands down their best game out there.

Szép kivitelezés, könnyű játékmenet, de emellett jól meg kell fontolni a szerencsével kidobott kockák jó felhasználását. Nekem a játékról rögtön a Stone Age ugrott be és persze nem azért mert bármilyen erős hasonlóság lenne a játékok között, de abban mindenképp hasonlóak, hogy jó játékok, amelyek körülbelül ugyanolyan szinten támaszkodnak a kockákkal a szerencsére, mint a kőkemény taktikára. Nekem tetszenek az ilyen játékok. A kockadobások megadják a játékhangulatot és a kevésbé gondolkodós játékosoknak is tetszeni fognak. A játékban a kockadobások jó kihasználásával lehet különböző nyersanyagokat, győzelmi pontokat és haderőt gyűjteni, a nyersanyagokból fontos épületeket építeni, majd év végén legyőzni a támadó sereget a gyűjtött haderővel. A játék elég hosszú, hogy akár többféle stratégiát is ki lehessen gondolni. Kellemes játék gémereknek és nem gémereknek egyaránt.

[2011-10-08]
A második játékomban megvertek az alsó sor épületeinek gyors megépítésével működő stratégiával, amit nagyon erősnek érzetem. A harmadik játékomban kipróbáltam és nyertem vele én is. Lehet, hogy verhető, de talán csak akkor ha a többiek figyelnek erre a játékosra, illetve mások is pont ezt követik, amúgy szerintem nem tartható. Annyiban a Stone Age-nél jobb, hogy a pontszámok a végén nagyon közel vannak egymáshoz, de ha ez az egyfajta stratégia nyerő benne, akkor az nem túl jó fényt vet a játékra. Marad a pontszám még, de később eggyel csökkenhet a biztos nyerő stratégia miatt.

Action drafting with a twist.  Certainly one of the better dice games out there, well because this really isn't a dice game. The dice are more just a limiting factor to the action drafting more than they are the heart of the game.  Those that are sick of the AD mechanic should avoid this.  Yet while the focus is on action drafting, bad dice rolls will still ruin your game.  The buildings mitigate this, but you can still get worked. Still, for a big dice rolling Euro, I'd rather play Elfenwizards. 

All, and all, the game works well, and there are some significant choices that keep you engaged throughout the game.  The invading hordes aren't usually much of a threat, but because of the slight possibility that they could really mess you up, it inspires you to keep the odds in your favor, but usually the soldiers' spaces seem more a consolation prize for not getting the resource spaces you need.  

All in all there is a nice balance to the game, and it works well, but the reality of it for me is that it just doesn't merit it's length.  If the game were a third shorter I could see really wanting to get this played often.  As it, by the end of the 4th year you are really ready for the game to be over. I'd say with less players it would be quicker, but then you lose any kind of blocking on the board.  I understand why the game needs to be as long as it does (the tech tree), but because of the potential AP and the sheer number of turns it just keeps on going...

Good games are a series of interesting decisions and that's exactly what this game is. The board and pieces are all beautifully made, colourful and attractive. The luck of the dice rolls can be frustrating but once you realize there are buildings and tokens/dice that you can use to adjust your dice results fairly easily things are usually fine. It's really tough sometimes choosing how to use your dice during your turn the best way possible and the powers that you buildings give  create some really interesting strategies. Great fun.

A nice Euro-dice game with some smart choices for box out opponents for resources. The progression of seasons, acquisition of buildings with special powers is all well and good but the end battles are just too easy.

This game makes for a fantastic introduction into the world of board games. Sure, you can spring Settlers of Catan on non-gamers, but that gets old, and Kingsburger presents an alternative gateway game that throws in some mechanics seen in heavier games, and every newbie I have taught this game to has liked it. 

For me though, honestly, there is just too much luck. There are so many games out there that I lose all the time, but will always love to play. This game gets me very frustrated when I lose because I may have simply not gotten the good rolls. Yes, yes there are tactics that mitigate the luck, but come on! No mechanic can mitigate that much dice rolling! But, even with all the luck, I still rate it a 7 because it is well made and fun to play even though it makes me mad. Oh - and by the way, the expansion "to forge a realm" does improve the game for sure.

You would think that all those years of D&D would have tapped the depths of my ability to hate my dice. You would be wrong.

Yspahan meets Pillars of the Earth, in a way.  You roll dice to select the various roles, and depending upon turn order and dice placement, you can elect to perform certain roles.  The placement of the dice makes for some interesting interaction, and trying to build the various buildings does provide for some interesting goals.  It's a big long, but quite enjoyable.

UPDATE:  I'm just not all that good at it, and it's long for what it is.  There are just too many other games that offer better bang for their buck than this one.

This is a fun game, but it does rely upon dice.  If you consistently roll poorly, you won't be able to win the game.  However, you can still have fun.  I think I ended up with half of the points of the next player up (and this was my 2nd play), but I still enjoyed the game experience.

It has some of the flavor of To Court the King, made much longer and more complicated. Too long, actually.

I am a very picky person when it comes to worker placement games.  It is probably my favorite board game style/mechanic and I have played an awful lot of them so it takes a good deal to impress me.  This one is pretty good.

Before this I had played two very similar games.  Alien Frontiers, which I didn't care for, and Troyes, which I did enjoy and actually own.  They are similar in that they are worker placement where your workers are represented by the roll of dice.  I believe the reason I didn't care for Alien Frontiers was that the actions you were able to take were mostly not based on the total of your dice roll but rather on runs and duplicates/triplicates/etc. of the results. In Kingsburg, like in Troyes, the total of your roll is all that matters.

There are some things I like in this game even more than Troyes too.  In Troyes, the higher your roll (in the end, ignoring the fact that you can have high numbered results taken from you) universally correlates to the better the action you take.  In Kingsburg this is MOSTLY true as the higher numbered rolls generally provide more stuff but sometimes you really do just need one more of a resource and only need to spend one low dice roll on it.  Also, assigning the actual values to actions rather than having actions that can be taken by any value with varying effectiveness provides a lot more opportunity for interaction and interesting competitive plays.  It is also a much simpler and therefore more accessible game than Troyes.

I will say the game does have some issues that keep me from, overall, liking it better than Troyes.  The set of 18 actions can get a little stale and lowers the shelf life of the game I think.  It's really just an increasing chart of different combinations of the games resources.  This also makes the game a bit of a luck fest because while there are opportunities, like I said, where taking a lower-numbered action is the best move the players who roll the highest numbers and consequently take the better actions are going to win 9 times out of 10.  The catch-up mechanic also doesn't really work to alleviate this problem.  After two of the rolling/building rounds the person with the fewest buildings will get either an extra die or a marker that allows you to cheat by taking an occupied action space or building two buildings in one round.  The main problem with this is that number of buildings does not universally correlate to who is weakest in the game.  In the one game I played I got these bonuses almost every round and was ahead the entire game in victory points.  The other big problem is these bonuses are huge benefits.  An extra die and not being locked out of an action space and the ability to get these while still being ahead kind of break the game.

In the end, I like the dice roll/worker placement fusion and how it is used in a lighter, more accessible game than Troyes so it is a fun game if not the most strategically interesting one.  I like the 5 different building tracks with special abilities to make the game more interesting.  And I should also mention I played just the base game and have heard almost universally that the expansion is one of those that really makes this game "complete".  I look forward to trying it again with the added content to see for myself.

I also have to add that playing this game with the full complement of 5 is the way to play.  My other game was with just 3 and there was a lot less screwage and competition over spaces.  Many might find the increase in this with more players frustrating but I consider it tense and makes the game more exciting and fun.

In this game you place dice on the board to obtain various resources or other benefits. The resources let you upgrade your kingdom and at the end of each round you fight a monster. While there are ways to mitigate poor dice rolls, it wasn't enough. In other dice placements games, there are still some good benefits from low dice rolls, but in this area I felt the game was lacking. The catch up mechanics for low dice rolls wasn't enough to help. 

I also recommend playing with the expansion at least for the winter reinforcements.

A very good dice-worker placement game.  I like the effects of turn order on role selection ... those with the lowest totals with the advantage of first role selection.  Various building tracks lets you explore a bit in building tech.  The dice do have an impact (and add variance) to keep this from becoming a pure logic puzzle.  

I find the game can be compared to Troyes (which i find superior in many ways to this game but is a bit heavier), and Alien Frontiers (which I have not played).

I like the game. First of all it has a vey beautiful board. Second it has a very clever mechanism, using the dice.
I didn't like the downtime, which could be a big problem, and also the randomness of the dice. The dice tirany although some state it isn't that important, a few bad, really bad, dice rolls could keep you distant from winning.
It could be a solid 8 if we're able to reduce the downtime.

I like games with dice (like Castles of Burgundy) where you have different options to use them.

In Kingsburg you have more interaction with the others, you always have to check what they rolled and what could be their plans with the dice.

Also you have to keep an eye on your defence, because a year is passing by quickly and "winter is coming" :D

The only negative thing is that some buildings are much more powerful than others so we basically build the same 2 (or 3) lines in every game. I know that the expansion balance better this problem and add some really cool element to the base game, but i can't find it anywhere...

He he he. Dice.

Always good to throw dice; and the luck factor is really mitigated well with this one. 2 players so far, and enjoyed it a lot, though the victory seems to have come down to whether or not you get the roll you need on the final turn... not sure if it's just that that's how it's gone with us, or if it's something wtih the game, but we'll see.

Always fun, but the board and the buildings seem a bit detached somehow? Thematically, or design-wise or something it doesn't feel like it all fits together seamlessly... Hmmm... must think about this a bit more.

Kingsburg is a neat little dice euro with simplicity as it's main quality. Because of the game's simplicity, which in no way limits it's inherent fun factor, it is a game that is easy to get to the table. The two things that do bother me, however, is it's complete lack on end game which usually makes the end feel somewhat anticlimactic and the fact that the available expansion pack is considered mandatory for playing the game to be worthwhile.

Copycat purchae. many plays prior to joining BGG.  introduced to us by our gaming friends, this was the next step in removing ourselves from the frustration of catan, where we had issues with long droughts of resource scarcity, kingsburg was awesome!  you get something every season!  no matter how you role, you got something...not ideal but still better than the catan robber and the *^%#%^7's you'd role.  so things we liked were the artwork, dice, the use of the dice, the fact you received something every season, other players couldn't take things from you (only blocking but thats different than stealing things from you.), finding a path of building to help acheive victory and still planning for the monsters at the end of every year.  the base game would get pretty stale so i highly recommend the expansion, to forge a realm.  that has kept it fairly fresh.  it is pretty common to get into a "building path" and play it everytime. i go wizard guild row all the time with either cathedral row for more points or the farm row.  a buddy will use the mint row (with expansion) to great success.  another will always try for embasssy row.   once we have had various levels of success with our strategies, we don't really branch away from it.  so it just comes down to who roles best and can get the most from their dice.  but there in lies the fun of dice rolling....

This is an interesting “worker placement” game where instead of workers you have influence in the form of dice that are rolled at the beginning of the turn. These three dice can be split up and summed and placed on spots on the board that give some sort good or bonus to the player.  Each spot can only be influenced by one player so there is jockeying for position for the juicier spots on the board.  The goods earned are used to purchase buildings which earn the player bonuses and victory points.  In addition, the buildings are in columns and rows, you need to purchase a level one building before building a level two building, and so on, up to the best, which is level four.  The die rolling mechanic is pretty cool because it forces you to change you plans when you roll poorly.  I am not a fan of the battle mechanic, rolling a die and adding bonuses to determine if you beat the baddies, is too much random proven by the fact that it was changed in the expansion.  I am also wondering if this game is too luck based or if good play can overcome the dice.  To accomplish this, I would like to track the overall sum of dice from each player and see if it correlates to player finish.

After one play with 3 people: this is an OK game.  Although you can mitigate some luck, luck still plays a big part, too much for such a long game.  Once you get behind it is very hard to catch up.  I would hate to play with 5 people - the contention for resources would be crazy.

Played with 5 people: no change in my opinion - very luck driven.  The contention for resources was about the same as with 3 - do you use fewer dice with 5?  Not sure.

Kingsburg is a solid game but one that failed to hold my interest beyond a couple of plays. [thing=22345][/thing], [thing=97094][/thing] and [thing=37380][/thing] suit me better if I'm in the mood for a dice-based Euro, and [thing=28620][/thing].

Kingsburg isn't just a dice game, because it also has multiple developmental paths, but even there I have better choices, e.g. [thing=28620][/thing]. Again, I don't say it's a bad game, but its sizeable shelf footprint and lack of sparkle led me to trade it away.

This is great!  It's euro enough for the fans of that genre (though some of them will frown at the use of dice) and certainly does have theme.

Good game!  Luck elements mitigated by both the ability to place in a number of areas, as well as some buildings which further mitigate a poor roll.  It's highly tactical, with not much strategy since even with an overall plan you may have to adjust depending on what the other players appear to be doing.  Well worth the time to play.

RATING: 6
My least favourite of the big dice allocation games (Troyes, Alien Frontiers, Castles of Burgundy etc.). by a significant margin. The best part of the game is the fun to be had from blocking others' allocation choices, though the downside is that it's possible to be shut out. It's also improved by the expansion's removal of the luck factor of the reinforcements.

What really sinks it is that the upgrade paths don't actually provide much variation, so what should have been an interesting bit of engine-building is a tedious sideshow.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
With good players, they will block the lower level advisors before you can use all your dice, if you roll poorly, so the ability to choose first is not sufficiently balancing to the luck of the dice.  I never got anything higher than 14 (and that only once) while others frequently got 17 and 18.  The advantages to high rolls mean that you can build the higher-level buildings sooner and reap more of their benefits, so I was in the middle of the pack for the first couple of years and ended up far behind for the rest.  Part of this was that I invested in defense early, and the first 3 invaders didn't hurt anyone because the king's rolls were all 5's and 6's.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.7
Intriguing.  Will we get faster at figuring out where to spend our dice?  The roll of the die for the battle at the end of every year is the controlling piece of master luck, but I can accept that and still enjoy the process of getting there via exchanges and builds.  More thoughts after a half dozen plays:  In my opinion this game works really nicely.  Indeed, we did get faster at figuring out where to spend our dice.  There's usually that long minute of pondering when we first see our dice rolls, but then everybody gets a plan and it happens.  Also it came as a pleasant surprise that the game worked so well for two players, which is why I'm giving it the extra 0.2 of a rating point....  All this praise aside, I still can't seem to stop reflexively calling it "Diceburg."

Game time is short at around an hour.  The components are excellent.

[3 plays] My take was not a bad game, not a great game.  In general I like resource games like this.  They are among my favorite types.  I am less fond of rolling to dice to see what resources I get, although in this one because you roll three dice and can combine them in so many different ways it actually worked pretty well.  My biggest dislike was rolling the dice to see if we defeated the monster at the end of every year.  The difference between rolling a 1 vs a 6 is huge, is there is a lot of difference between getting rewarded for defeating the monster compared to getting a penalty for losing.  I would not mind playing this game a few more times to get a better feel for it.  Try some different strategies for what resources to go after, which building row to focus on etc.  It seems like it could be a fun game to learn better and try different things.  However, after this play I didn't find it anywhere near as enjoyable as something like Caylus where I don't have to roll dice to place my workers, and there is no monster that I randomly could either win or lose too.  NOTE: the expansion fixes my biggest issue with dice rolling for the monster fights.  Really the expansion is a must for this game.

From what I've read, my perception is that this game absolutely needs the expansion.  I've played the Java version of the base game, and there seemed to be just not quite enough, and I can't quite justify buying the game knowing I also need to buy the expansion (and buying both is an expensive proposition for something I'm not certain about).  I'm not even sure it would add enough anyway... it just seems like there's something missing.

As it is, I find it too long, a tad to random - especially at both ends of the bell curve: if you just roll 17s and 18s nobody can beat that.
Also the monster fight at the end of each year is a random do-or-die affair which I totally dislike.

Something of an oddity - an economic engine / development game disguised as a fantasy dice-fest. Players compete Caylus-like for sole right to choose particular actions, but dice rolls dictate your choices.

Looking forward to future plays, especially with more players.

Hmmm.  I like the idea of Kingsburg and I like the way it looks and even plays.  There is just a little something missing from it.  I suppose it's the little bit of strategic element that is under the surface.  Maybe I have not found it yet?  I don't think so.  It is very straight forward and it takes a bit to get a turn done.  That said I enjoy playing it and it doesn't tax my brain too hard.  The art is cute and my wife likes it.  I have the expansion buildings and I think I will add in the governors to see what they do.

update : This game perplexes me.  I don't really like it but I find myself pulling it out now and then.  It's not very dynamic even with the expansion.  Maybe I should get Alien Frontiers.

Before buying it I thought that the dice-influencing system was something unusual, and I looked forward to it. However, the game is not so funny as it might appear, and there seems to be just one path to victory (complete the first and the third row of your chart and you did it!). I don't own the expansion but, honestly, I don't think the improvement would be so relevant

Part Settlers, part Puerto Rico, part Goa. Very fun and some great decisions. Just like Goa and Puerto Rico, there's many ways to win this game, but the main thing to make the fewest mistakes. Unlike Goa and Puerto Rico, it has a great theme and uses dice in a way that I never thought was possible: rolling low isn't always that bad.

Initial impression is very cool.  We played the two player game, but messed up a rule, which is adding a white die to the Soldier count in Phase 8, so we were umm, well, we couldn't manage to do much other than gather  1 buildings and soldiers every year.  We still had fun, but next time should be much more enjoyable since we'll be able to use our resources to build more than 8 or 9 buildings.

A game in which the haphazardness of the die roll dominates your capabilities and tactical choices do not really have the power to counter them. The catch-up mechanisms do not help you enough to stand a chance in case of some bad rolls. Some call this a worker placement game but there is no sign of the tactical depth of those here. If you are a person who enjoys exceedingly long times of dice chucking then Kingsburg is your game. I just hoped that it was over sooner rather than later.

RATING: 7
26-Sep-08: Played this with the Java AI. I thought that it had mild interaction (ie. if you can take something before someone else can, do so), but that's about it. Fairly straightforward; less of a game and more of an activity sort of thing. Pick a strategy and stick to it, swear at the dice rolls, etc.

11-Oct-10: Played Kingsburg with Cynthia on Sun arvo. Not too bad with 2p, but i think it's better with 3p+. There's not enough ability to hinder the leader with 2p. I can't see how Kingsburg can be played with 5p in 90 mins though (as stated on box).

27-Oct-10: I feel that it's a good game but just suffers from beng a wee bit too long. I feel that the Market is almost too crucial though. The joy of screwage/risk taking comes from trying to predict what dice other people are going to use and then taking the action before they do. The Market waters this aspect down. I've heard that the Queen was originally designed to give only 2 VPs - the designers calculated that her VP worth is really 2.5 VPs and rounded up instead of down, but now most feel that they should have rounded down instead. 3 VPs makes the Queen too good to pass up. No one really takes the King, which is a pity since you need that rare 3 sixes roll. I'd love to give the game another go, but this time with the Battle Tokens (either self-made or bought).

This is a fantastic game, it quickly moved to my groups most played games list.  It has everything, Fun, Strategy, Screwing your friends, just the right amount of luck.  I would love to see an expansion deck to give the invaders more variety.  The theme is great, production is fantastic, theres a lovely board and some interesting mechanics.  All and all this deserves an 8 theres very little to dislike.  Even the for a game that involves so much rolling it really doesnt come down to luck.  After a number of plays it should be noted that the building strats change from game to game, I've seen all sorts of paths win the game.

07 JUL 2009 - A great dice game where every roll has value. Yes, there is some luck in the dice rolling, or course, but there are many many choices to make, even when your roll sux (such as getting at least a resource or VP, or even blocking someone else from what THEY want). There are even a couple of mechanism that help those falling behind to catch up a bit.

One of my favorite games currently.

Really fun worker/dice placement game. 3 dice determine you options for resource collection and army building.

Bottom row of buildings seems to always be a strong choice. I have played it using a variety and I usually do well. My wife always seems to be buying points because of that bottom row and seems to win a lot.

Expansion is almost a must. Game could get pretty stale without it.

Easy to teach and fun to play. I can't decide if the 18-King or the 17-Queen is a better option.

RATING: 8.5

When I first played Kingsburg, it was like playing a deckbuilder for the first time - it blew me away with its unique yet fun system, I guess you would call it dice placement? The idea of dice in a euro game had always seemed like it wouldn't work, and this was one of the first games that made me realise, it can. The dice don't dictate what you have to do, but only limit your options, sometimes meaning you have to make some tough choices. 

After a few plays it does get a bit repetitive, and my suspicion is that the expansion will greatly remedy this. But Kingsburg has definitely got me interested in trying more dice placement games.

Kingsburg combines dice rolling with worker placement and resource allocation.  The board and mats are both drawn on the busy side and that is offputting, but the bigger issue is the linearity of the game.

RATING: 7
Man, I hate to keep giving games a "7" rating, but Kingsburg just fits that criteria so well.  It is just on the cusp of getting a higher rating, but I remember how I felt the last time I owned it....

The story is, we had it, played the heck out of it, and then I felt both Caron and I had kind of reached a plateau with it.  I felt that we had kind of gotten to this point where the game kind of went the same way every time--not a good sign.  So I traded it.

Big mistake.  After I traded it, Caron was really not cool with me trading it.  Seems that she really did like it--quite a bit.  So, after trading it almost two years ago, I got it back.

Well, what about the game?  It is nothing spectacular whatsoever.  It is a typical Euro game about influencing advisors, gaining favor, blah blah blah.  But, dice are stuck into the game as the fuel for the engine, making for large amounts of chance.  We just played a game that was so close, I had one chance to win, and that came on the roll of a die.  So, the game, even though it has a great amount of strategy in it, can really hinge on the roll of a single die.  If that kills a game for you, then stay away.  

But, if you don't mind a lighter weight game that allows for strategy, conversation, and the occasional head scratching AP moments, then give Kingsburg a spin.  It is a good game for what it is.  Nothing earth shattering, but I feel it is a pretty enjoyable ride.

In "family style" board games, I prefer games that have simple mechanics, but offer lots of meaningful choices. Despite this being an almost perfect description of Kingsburg, the game just didn't "grab me." I was dissapointed with the game's boring characters (these characters seem more appropriate for a non-fantasy themed game) and felt the buildings didn't alter strategies as much as they might have (It really felt like a couple of the tracks were signifigantly more powerful than the others). These opinions might change with more plays. This isn't a bad game at all; I'd certainly be willing to play the game if someone else wanted to, I'm just not going to be the one to suggest it.

Kingsburg is a bit unusual for a Euro, it feels at first like an Ameritrash game because you are rolling a fistful of dice every turn.  But from there it goes in a very different direction.  The dice are used to pick roles (similar in nature but not in function to Puerto Rico).  And the roles help you construct buildings.  The battle at the end of each year can be brutal, but overall Kingsburg is an interesting game that meshes fast play with some deep strategic thinking at times.  There are faster and deeper games out there, but none quite like this hybrid.  If you are in to trying something different, give Kingsburg a whirl.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A dice worker placement game where you roll your dice, assigned them and get resources to build up your city on your player board. This happens 3 times per round for 5 round. Each round will have a monster to defeat. Depending on the result, you will get benefits or lose resources. During my plays we have rarely lost combat so its very anti-climatic for me.

The game is solid and I wouldn't mind playing it. However, there are better options in this genre currently and does it better. Rating might increase if I try the expansion which I heard is a must for variability.

Dice rolling with quite a bit of decision making (read screwage) thrown in the mix.  It sure feels like lousy rolling can doom you, though.  The original rules for the king's support let you ignore defense too much in my opinion - midway through the game you still have a good chance that the king will take care of the attackers without you doing a single thing about defense.  The expansion helps balance this issue greatly.  May overstay it's welcome a little bit, but when the game stays tight (and the rolling is reasonably well distributed) the game is engaging and fun even when it's pushing three hours.

Not sure why we don't play it more often in our group. Might be player limit though.

Kingsburg is a worker placement game with a twist in that rolled dice represent the workers. I'm typically no fan at all of dice games, but the way the mechanic is utilized in Kingsburg does a good job at minimizing the random element sufficiently that it is rare a good player cannot work around the rolls. The tiered building mechanic is well designed and makes this game accessible to a broad audience. My only criticism of this game is that it lacks long term replayability. The expansion helped add some flavor but not enough so to put the excitement back in.

I'm enjoying the game quite a bit so far, but I'm getting a sense that 3 players might be the worst number for the game.  Much like Witches' Brew, I think it becomes more interesting when the blocking strategies come out more, which hasn't happened much so far, and I've only played w/ 3 players.  Apparently 2 players is essentially like playing 4 players because each player rolls 2 sets of dice, one for themselves and one just for blocking.  I really need to play the game w/ 4 and 5 players to get a feel for how a higher density of dice play affects strategy.

This game shines in a group of 4-5 players. It's fun, strategic (though not too deep without the expansion) with just about the right amount of luck. Long live the queen!

On the downside, the dice system isn't perfectly balanced as still the high rolls are better than the low rolls, though it's not that much of an issue here - unlike in troyes and marco polo for example where dice rule the game.

OK game, but not more than OK.  I'll play occasionally and get some enjoyment out of it but would always prefer something else.  Tends to take too long for the amount of luck and randomness in the game -- to the point of being near unbearable with new and/or especially slow players.  I suppose the expansion would address some of my concerns and give the game more variability, but I can't really justify the expenditure for a game I'm not that thrilled about

Ehhhh it's a dice game. I find it a bit dull in all honesty. Really does feel like "To Court The King" but better thought out...just not quite thought out enough.

One of the games that belonged in my Attia Family Tree article, but which I hadn't had the opportunity to try beforehand (fortunately the BoardGameGeek community helped fill in the gaps and wrote an explanation of why Kingsburg belonged in the conversation, which I included in my follow-up Grandfather of Worker Placement article. Now, a little over a year later, I've finally tried Kingsburg and confirmed its placement in the family tree. Of all the twists on worker placement that each game has brought to the table, I have to say that Kingsburg's is certainly one of the most innovative. Substituting dice for each player's workers is not somewhere I could honestly have predicted the family going, but hindsight is 20/20, so after the fact it seems like a natural innovation (a contradiction I suppose). Unlike Caylus with its growing expanse of potential locations to place your workers, Kingsburg presents you at the outset with 18 locations numbered 1 through 18. You roll three dice and take turns assigning them to the locations that match the sum of the die or dice assigned to that location. Thus, reaching the coveted 18 location requires a roll of three sixes (or the necessary dice modification tools procured through other game locations). That's essentially where the innovation stops though because like just about every worker placement game, the locations give players some combination of wood, stone, gold, and other such resources, which players convert into buildings worth victory points and special abilities. It's certainly a clever game and one I'd happily play again, but something ethereal kept it from quite reaching the threshold of purchasing the game. It's always hard to pin down exactly what makes a game worthy of being added to your collection versus being relegated to only playing someone else's copy, but whatever spark is necessary was missing for me despite all of the game's tangibly good qualities.

RATING: 6.5
This is a pretty good game for the right crowd. I like the dice placement mechanism quite a bit -- like Yspahan, it is a mechanic which makes better use of the dice than a straightforward numerical comparison.
My big beef with the game is the fact that you roll a die, on top of the random card, to determine the (effective) strength of the enemy opposition. The swinginess of rolling a 1 on that die can be huge (especially given the penalties for failing in the early and mid-game), and that bothers me in a game which takes as long as Kingsburg does (at least, to make good dice placements).

Great components. The game mechanics are simple and work well together. The battles during winter should have had a little higher rating (just by 1 point up all the cards), this would have made the decision to get soldiers more intriguing. The game fails to become a Great game due to the fact that a player that rolls higher for more turns than other players has a higher probability to win. I did an analysis of the game and although it is not perfect by any means this is what it suggests. Also it showed that the player that will roll lowest  will always fail to win (see more discussion under "Initial Thoughts" thread-line).
I hope an expansion will come out that will give an additional advantage to players that roll low. It is a very good game.

Solid little game; seems a little too dependant on dice rolling and the tech tree you pursue... some of the buildings seem way more powerful than others.

Regardless, a very fun game that I'm willing to sit in on almost every time.

RATING: 7
A solid dice game - going for a interesting use of the dice rolls: even smaller number can be of use, the decision is: use the dice all together or one by one, facing the risk to not being able to use some of the slots.

I like the game, but with only one play under my belt, is hard to give a more complete judgement.

What initially intrigued me about this game was the dice-as-workers worker placement mechanic used when influencing the advisors on the board.  Although this mechanic is slightly interesting, I was underwhelmed by its implementation here.  It does create interesting decisions when trying to decide which advisors you need to influence before your opponents get them, but that's about all this game has.  I don't like the way a game round has to go through eight different phases, each slightly different.  Maybe it provides balance, but it feels fiddly and unnecessarily complicated.  I really don't like the "combat system" where the players have to fight invaders each round.  Way too much is on the line for one die roll.  The end of the game doesn't feel tense at all because pretty much all of the points have already been distributed, the winner is almost always completely predictable.  I would play it again but I don't really feel the need to.

RATING: 8
Kingsburg bring the fun of rolling dice back to real board game play. There are just enough ways to manipulate the dice to keep them fair while still keeping them random. A nice building track with interesting buildings allow for multiple strategies as well. My biggest complaint about Kingsburg is the "Kings Reinforcement Dice" rolled before you battle in the winter. While I understand why it's there, it adds a random element that you can't really effect or predict. In a game that's already walking the fine like of randomness, this single die roll pokes it ever so slightly over the line.

Even with that said, I greatly enjoyed the game and can't wait until our next play to try something new.

RATING: 8
The game takes place over five years, a total of 20 turns. In every year, there are 3 production seasons for collecting resources, building structures, and training troops. Every fourth turn is the winter, in which all the players must fight an invading army. Each player must face the invaders, so this is not a cooperative game.
The resources to build structures and train troops are collected by influencing the advisers in the King's Council. Players place their influence dice on members of the Council. The player with the lowest influence dice sum will be the first one to choose where to spend his/her influence; this acts as a way of balancing poor dice rolling. Even with a very unlucky roll, a clever player can still come out from the Council with a good number of resources and/or soldiers.
Each adviser on the King's Council will award different resources or allocate soldiers, victory points, and other advantages to the player who was able to influence him/her for the current turn.
At the end of five years, the player who best developed his assigned territory and most pleased the King through the Council is the winner.
Many alternate strategies are possible to win: will you go for the military way, disregarding economic and prestige buildings, or will you aim to complete the big Cathedral to please the King? Will you use the Merchant's Guild to gain more influence in the Council, or will you go for balanced development?

Only played once as a 5-player game, and while I might play again, I wasn't overly excited by the experience.  I think part of the issue was the time it took to figure out how other dice rolls might affect your choices.  Update after 2nd play:  I enjoyed it more the second time and would play it again.  I still think that it takes too long for the type of game it is.

The game has some good aspects, but it's really not well-developed. The battles are extremely random - both the dieroll for the king's support and the enemy card draw can be very swingy (the enemies' strength is in a small range, but the effects of losing to them can vary a lot). Some of the development paths seem to be clearly better than others. For a game that takes as long as this does, I want more control and more balance.

With five players, the game got quite long, so I prefer to play it with 3 of 4 players. I like that the game is so simple to explain and understand, that all information is "out in the open" (no drawing of cards, no differences in abilities or powers) and the game's components and artwork are attractive and very clear. In the end it is a light, but engrossing game in which luck plays a remarkably small role considering the dice: The winner was not the player who rolled best. Also, in both cases, the winner was not clear until the last round, making those last turns very suspenseful indeed. Looking forward to playing this again (and I am not the only one)!

An enjoyable dice & resource game that often gives a nice tense end-game. 
It can however run fairly long, as analysis-paralysis often stalls proceedings: because dice placement rules are fairly precise, if someone nabs the spot you wanted then a few minutes re-thinking your building strategy can be required. 
Other than this however, there is very little player interaction other than asking to pass the snacks. 
All-in-all though a good (weirdly 'Agricola-esque') game that, for some odd reason, I find relaxing to play...

The bastard offspring of Puerto Rico, In The Year of the Dragon and Can't Stop. Five years - end of every year the bad guys are going to come a calling and wreck something. You have three seasons to meet with advisors, get stuff from them to erect buildings and recruit soldiers so by the time winter hits and the bad guys show up you can chase them away with your trooops and gain favour from the King. One problem - the dice decide which advisors you can call on and most of the time they can only meet one person per season, so tough luck if you don't get to the one you need first. There's some AP with allocating the dice but that speeds up as the players get used to the game. I really liked it after one play, even though there's limited player interaction (which I would say is its only real flaw.)

Take the worker placement mechanic from Caylus / Leonardo / AoEIII, but randomize your workers each turn so each player will have differently abled workers to grab powers: welcome to Kingsburg. While I love worker placement games, and will play Caylus or Leonardo Da Vinci anytime, anyplace, the random worker thing took a lot of the fun out of the mechanic for me. There isn't as much anguish if only 2 players can vie for special power x because of the pip count everyone has, and there is no anguish if your dice roll gives you a lock on something nice. Unlike Caylus, there aren't even painful choices over controling turn order-- here it is simply a matter of high rolling. An extra smidgen of tedium came from the lack of differentiation in the building tracks. After all, with only 2 soldier spots on the board, and the need for soldiers ever escalating, everyone will have to basically get quite a few   defense buildings. That makes a lot of the building choices obvious. All in all it had neither the tension that I crave in games nor enough brutal decisions. Did I mention it feels long for what it is? On the positive side, it sure feels nice to roll crazy high numbers all night. I should have been at a craps table with the luck I had!

Certain routes (e.g. Market) are overly strong and thus pretty prescribed and the dice variance can be very punishing, with lower numbers mostly just worse than higher.  Also runs too long for that level of randomness.  Still ends up being a fairly enjoyable little worker placement/development game overall though.

Alright, I've only played Kingsburg once, so I don't have a great idea of the involved strategy. This will be more first impressions, so I might need to adjust my score accordingly after more plays. 

After first play I really liked Kingsburg. It is a very basic worker placement game where you you can build up certain tracks/specialties. This allows a couple different paths to victory which is nice for replayability. My biggest gripe with this is that every player as the exact same track, however I hear the expansion fixes this. There is also kind of a cool mechanic where all the players need to work together to fight off an attack and the end of a round. 

Overall, I liked this game on first try. Components were nice as was artwork. A good entry level worker placement euro game. I hope to play it more though.

A nice game with a very clever dice rolling mechanism. Bad rolls won't necessarily cost you the game, although a chronic bout of low numbers will seriously hamper you. It's interesting trying to figure out how to influence the advisors without people blocking you.

3/23/08 - I think Tom has an ability to make all games sounds complex, hehe.  It took a while to get through the directions, but looking back, it was a fairly straight-forward game.  I will have to play it again to look at longevity, or wanting to buy it for myself...  The only thing was it took a little too long to play (somewhere about 2-2.5 hours), but it was enjoyable, and both Ed and I liked it =)

Simple dice allocation game with a small "tech tree", gateway style, nothing ground breaking

[+] fast-paced, easy to teach, the allocation mechanism offers some choices (sometimes, not always), the "tech tree" is good
[-] few ways to mitigate bad rolls, the "attack" at end of year is very unsatisfying. Most of the time, year 1-4 the king dice plus a few developpements are enough to make it a non-threat. only the last year seems to matter, and even there a good king roll will destroy any tension.

Great, innovative use of dice, similar to [gameid=22345] in that manner.  Beautiful components, and enjoyable (though generic) theme.  I have not played many games of this, but I am interested to know whether it would hold up past plays 5-10.  There's certainly lots of variability in how you roll your dice and how the other players choose to distribute theirs, but building patterns tend to cluster.  Some building paths are popular, and it can result in people taking very similar strategies game after game.  (To be fair, the expansion addresses this.)  This is definitely worth a play, and might be worth buying if your collection needs some quick games for newer gamers or lighter gamers.

I am a big fan of worker placement, and initially I really really liked the game because of its use of dice as workers and how easy it is to teach.  However, my enthusiasm for the game waned as time went on.  I realized that the game is easy to teach because it is really quite shallow.  There are multiple ways to go about adding to your tableau (which is supposed to add variety to forging a strategy), but it seems as though there's really only one way to win.  Since there is really only one way to win, whoever gets to it first tends to win.  To me, that is defeating the purpose of worker placement mechanics and why I wouldn't rank this game any higher than a 6.

I have played many a game of Kingsburg and have yet to turn one down. A worker placement/engine-building/dicey box of fun. I love that you are simultaneously trying to outguess your opponents and leave the most options open for yourself. Takes a play or two to really understand but will almost always be pretty tight amongst evenly experienced and skilled players. Something about this one really hits the spot for me.

After MANY plays this one can feel a little samey. However, if you are playing with equally skilled opponents it is a very tight and enjoyable game.

First play - 3 players - 7/9/08 - Apart from a few beginner mistakes my overall strategy paid off and I wound up winning by 1 VP. Get the Wizards tower and then get the Cathedral. The player 1 below me went for the farm early and nearly caught me. He was a bit lucky to have never lost a battle. Being able to adjust your influence by +/- 1 seemed helpful and I may try for that one early the next time I play.

Играл полпартии. На мой взгляд ничего сильного в игре нет.

1. Множество разбросанных компонентов, и еще с мелкими значками. Например 17 советников, каждый дает что-то свое. 20 зданий, каждое чем-то отличается, причем при строительстве оно на общем планшете отмечается фишкой, и у каждого игрока свой планшет. В итоге сложно ориентироваться или определять какие бонусы у кого есть, или какие могут быть.

2. Броски кубиков каждый сезон. Причем они не просто не дают следовать какой-то нужной стратегии, но еще и чем меньше выбросишь, тем реально хуже.

3. Набеги в конце года как-то не впечатлили. Ну ладно они случайной силы и эффекта, так еще и мы бросаем кубик. Ну ладно еще что сил может не хватить случайно, так еще и обидно, когда старался, наращивал силу, а тут кубик справился с набегом сам по себе - зачем старался...

4. Разнообразие зданий и набегов как-то тоже не впечатляет. Ну например механика битв ну совершенно неинтересна (а я считаю что в игре все должно быть интересно). Ну и здания которые отличаются типа как "я даю +1 в битве", а "я +2 и еще 1 ПО, но дороже" - не цепляет. Скажем 8-й ролей в Цитаделях значительно разнообразней чем 20 построек в Кингсбурге.

5. Ну и конечно игра просто на очки и без нормального взаимодействия (отбирать советников у других - едва ли здоровый пример взаимодействия).

На мой взгляд игра бы сильно выиграла, если бы планшет был один на всех игроков (и два игрока не могут построить одинаковое здание). Ну а бросок кубика перед сражением лучше вообще убрать.

If you like Yspahan so much that you'd like to play a more complex, 2 and a half hour version of it, then you'll like this. I'll pass. The action selection mechanic is so tired at this point and despite the dice  this doesn't do much that other better games haven't done before. Wasn't awful- maybe if the game were half as long I'd play it again.

This is a neat take on the dice-rolling genre.  There are enough options here to make it more than JUST a dice-rolling game, much in the same way that Yspahan does the same thing.  I see a lot of different influences from other games, but it puts a little more fun into those formulas, and makes for a great game to play with family or children.  I recommend playing the Java implementation of the game just to learn the mechanics, and to get an idea of how the game flows.

After several plays against the computer, I wonder if the same sort of strategy is optimal for each game.  Of course, this doesn't mean I win against the computer, but it does make me wonder if people tend to follow the same strategy each time they play the game.

fun game. played too few times to be definitive on this but expansion add a lot of variability to it. playing it normal, then playing it with nobles, then playing it with events, then playing it with new building tracks, etc., then rinse and repeat = lots of re-playability. PS: always play with kings reinforcements tokens from expansion instead of from the die roll

also my rating is taking into account that the original game is not the expansion. my rating for the expansion is obviously higher.

In Kingsburg, players are Lords sent from the King to administer frontier territories.
\13\\13\
The game takes place over five years, a total of 20 turns. In every year, there are 3 production seasons for collecting resources, building structures, and training troops. Every fourth turn is the winter, in which all the players must fight an invading army. Each player must face the invaders, so this is not a cooperative game. The resources to build structures and train troops are collected by influencing the advisers in the King's Council. Players place their influence dice on members of the Council. The player with the lowest influence dice sum will be the first one to choose where to spend his/her influence; this acts as a way of balancing poor dice rolling. Even with a very unlucky roll, a clever player can still come out from the Council with a good number of resources and/or soldiers. Each adviser on the King's Council will award different resources or allocate soldiers, victory points, and other advantages to the player who was able to influence him/her for the current turn. At the end of five years, the player who best developed his assigned territory and most pleased the King through the Council is the winner.

RATING: 7
A worker placement game that makes clever use of dice for claiming resources and scoring VPs. There is more luck then usual for a game of this type, but I think it makes things a bit more exciting than the usual perfect information Euro. The randomness also serves to drive the game's building aspect, as quite a few of the building spaces allow a player to manipulate future dice rolls. This small bit of control isn't perfect...If a player rolls consistently high, they will probably win, but it usually takes a particularly long hot or cold streak to really imbalance things.

Overall, I'd say Kingsburg was a neat, but slightly repetitive game. I highly recommend the expansion, "To Forge a Realm". It addresses a few issues with the game, adds a mountain of re-playability and (in my book, anyway) about a point and a half to the rating!

This is a rather fresh idea into the world of Eurogames. It's easy, simple enough for almost anyone to learn and appeals to people who don't really like to micromanage and count their beans down to the last detail.

I'd recommend this to beginners and people who're looking to have a good time for about 90 mins without too many complications.

Looks interesting,  but there's potential for AP here.  Actually,  I feel the AP bug when playing solo against the AI!   Looks like the luck of the die roll can play a big role - you can get some really bad rolls and end up wasting a lot of dice.  

Not a bad game,  but I feel like the dice can be rather mean.  Sure,  it's far from the end of the world (and really, rolling low numbers and getting the jester might actually be perfectly balanced),  but it feels like you're getting unfairly penalised/options limited by the roll of the dice.

A fun worker-placement game that has enough randomness to keep it challenging but not overly frustrating. I personally think it plays best with 3 and 4, as 5-players creates just a bit too much tension over the available spots on the board and said dice rolls can really impact your options. But with fewer players, it never becomes too much of a problem.

If I have a complaint, it's that the game does tend to run a little long and that there often isn't much of a surprise in the endgame scoring. Most often, the lead player will be apparent by the last few turns of the game, unless set upon by some very unfortunate events.

Still, a fun game and good as a "gateway" for non-gamers.

A more tactical than strategic game once you understand the 3 or 4 viable long term strategies. Only down side is I don't care for more than 3 players. 4-5 gets too tight and then it just comes down to who rolls better.

nice game, seems complicated at first but after the first season it all comes very clear and easy. Nice and original use of the dice, good interaction with other players. The game flows well, lively and fast. There are different strategy to follow to reach victory and this is very good.
The only downside is the dice thrown against the invaders: too many points are at stake with just a single dice thrown, expecially in the last 2/3 years. Therefore my rate is 7.8 and not a full 8.

RATING: 5
Far too long, fiddly, repetitive.

Rating upgraded after a 3 player online game. At this pace, it's playable and an ok game (30-40 minutes). But with our usual 5 player face to face games, it's a 150 minutes game - and out of that, 120 minutes of boredom.

I was really hopeful with Kingsburg and it let me down. I loved the art and the concept, but at the end of the day you're still rolling dice and if your dice keep handing you 7 and below, you're just not going to do as well.

Cool Game. Great art work. I like dice games so this was for me. The way you use the dice is interesting. I goofed when setting up to buy the right items to buy a building 2 times. But even with that I still won. It has a good catch up mechanism during the different seasons. So if you are behind and you get an extra dice, that helps. Easy to play but it takes a few rounds to get use to the symbols. Your first game will take longer to play, so expect to add an extra 1/2 hour. Give it a try.

RATING: 6
This game is not terrible, for a dice game. There is some reliance on luck, but there are also ways to mitigate the dice rolls, so that's good. It also played out less hostile (through blocking) than I expected, though that may be due to my carebear group more than the game itself. I can't give it a higher rating, though, because A) the stress of the attack at the end of every round is annoying, and B) it gets repetitive and feels too long for its weight.

RATING: 7.5
A very fun game that's quite different from other games I've played.  It relies heavy on dice which can be good and bad.  Though what I like about it is having many different choices on what to do, so there are always different strategies to use.

Kingsburg is a neat, light dice placement eurogame. For my tastes, Kingsburg unfortunately gets replaced by the deeper 'Castles of Burgundy', even with Kingsburgs expansion that I got it's still a bit too light.. We almost never have to face the monsters in the winter in our games, I guess we might play it too 'safe' in a way. If I'll play more of this, I'll do a risky playthrough just for the sake of it.

Nice combination of worker placement, resource management, phased play, dice rolling, building, and point acquisition.  

I've never played Caylus, but it seems similar in that the turn order changes, and is represented by coloured wood tokens.  Also you "earn favour", build, and there is a scoring track around the outside of the board.

Also to Dominion in that advisors you earn favour from all give you different bonuses similar to playing an action card in Dominion. 

Want to play again and might purchase.

In dit spel moeten spelers zich voorbereiden op de aanval van verschillende monsters.

Opnieuw een spel waarin dobbesltenen goed gebruikt worden. Het spel geeft me een beetje het gevoel die civ-games mij geven. Het is een echt groeispel, maar daarnaast ook erg taktisch.

Minpunt is het vechten tegen de monsters aan het einde van de ronde. Het is zeker een erg leuk idee, maar niet helemaal goed uitgewerkt. Doordat je er een vrij willekeurige (je gooit een dobbelsteen) extra gevechtskracht erbij krijgt is het erg moeilijk plannen voor het gevecht. Daarnaast zijn de gevolgen van het verliezen van het gevecht enorm. Je bent praktisch kansloos voor de winst als je één keer verliest van een monster.

Wil dit spel zeker nog vaker spelen, want ik houd nou eenmaal van civ-games.

RATING: 7
Played a few times face to face (with 3 to 5 players) and on BSW (with 2 or 3 players). An interesting game with a clever use of dice. What matters most is not to roll high dice, but to be able to make good use of all your dice (blocking can definitely happen with 5 players - it is less of a problem with fewer, which in turn increates the influence of luck). 
It looks like there are several possible strategies, depending on the buildings you want to specialize in - but it seems difficult to do without the (cheap) buildings in the first two columns, and I am not sure how much variety it really gives in the end. 
Also, the abundance of different tie-breakers in various circumstances is a bit annoying. But I think the main possible problem which will prevent me from liking this game more is that it feels a bit long for what it is. Still, I am looking forward to the expansion.

RATING: 7
Played at Essen 2007. Kingsburg involves a dice rolling mechanic to decide which goods you get, and therefore which buildings you can build. The higher you roll the better, but there's usually something worthwhile you can do with your dice no matter what you roll. There are also a couple of reasonable catch-up mechanisms to help those who roll abysmally. 

There are a few paths you can explore depending on which buildings you go for, there's some tension over whether other players will grab the best spots before you, and whether you'll be able to defeat the enemies at the end of each year.

The conversion of goods cubes into beneficial abilities and progress along various bonus tracks is nothing new, but it works well enough here.

Solid fun. Good introduction to Euro building (goods->buildings->VPs). Accessible with some luck and some planning. I wonder if with many plays the limited number of paths may become stale. (Yes)

This game would have dropped to a 6/6.5 over time just from the feeling that the paths are obvious and fairly balanced. There is not too much luck just your choices do not seem strategically important enough to outweigh it. Why did it not drop? Because the expansion brings both more choices and more interesting events that change up each game. The use of tokens for troops at the end of the year adds a nice bump in strategy also.

Kingsburg is an engaging dice-and-resource allocation game that combines tactical, brain-burning decisions with plenty of strategy. Luck certainly does play a role, but it adds a push-your-luck element that keeps the game lighter and less static that it might otherwise be. Replayabiliy might be an issue for some, but the expansion mostly fixes this.

My wife and I really enjoy Kingsburg.  I was surprised at how much she enjoys the game.  It is one of her favorites.  I enjoy how you can manipulate the dice and the vast technology track.  The tech. track provides a lot of variety in strategies to pursue from game to game.  One of my favorite parts of this game is the risk vs. reward aspect.  Do you not peek at the monster but risk losing the fight later on because you don't have a strong enough defense in order to take another bonus?  The artwork is top notch and really brings you into the game.  I have played this with kids and they enjoy it a lot as well. The fantasy theme really draws them in.  I'd call this a small step up from a gateway game.

I am not as taken by this game as the similar [gameid=34635].  It looks like there are only a couple of ways to get points - the embassy, the fortress (winning battles) and the farm and [i]hope[/i] you roll the queen often.  At this time I am more willing and wanting to play Stone Age while my wife is more willing to play this one.

After more plays, there are some interesting things going on with this and I am a little more enchanted by it.  I am looking forward to [gameid=39775].  I am really looking forward to the two rows of extra buildings and character cards.  I think these will address at least one of the concerns I have with this game - there is only one or two winning strategies.  As I play more, this one does have some staying power.

Kingsburg is a good light weight game.

I like the dice rolling and commitment combination. What originally felt a bit hampered -- since there didn't appear to be that many dice rolls to help smooth out luck over the course of a game -- isn't actually that big a deal, as there are several nice, subtle catch up mechanics and the game has a very brisk pace. Some of the special abilities of the buildings help soften the impact. And some nice planning out to block opponents' moves based on die combinations. Some players may experience a very slight slowdown by AP as more dice/number combos lead to more choice evaluations for a 5-player game, but it's minimal. Excellent components. A great 3 player game. [Update] After running exactly 50 demos of Kingsburg at GenCon -- I STILL love the darn game. That says an awful lot!

I enjoy this game, but it needs more interaction than just trying to block spots on the influence track. It's too much like solitaire IMO. Looks awesome though, and I've had fun with it, but it needs a little boost of something to make it a keeper. It's also "solvable" to an extent IMO; or perhaps I should say that there are some paths to victory that are simply dominant!

I like the resource aquisition style of this game... and it even felt more like worker placement than I expected it to due to the dice determining your choices.  I also thought the threat of having your buildings destroyed would be a turnoff, but balancing military defense vs. point advancement makes this pretty tense at times.  This could easily get samey pretty fast, but I think the expansion goes a long way to fix that problem.  Solid base game as it is.

RATING: 6
As feared the repetitive dice rolling for 3 seasons each year for a total of 15 times was more than I would have cared for.  The rest of the game felt like an advanced version of To Court the King.  Maybe that's not a totally fair assessment, as there is actually a bit more consideration required when choosing the kind of resources you want to obtain, as well as which character to influence so you can utilize all of your dice.  However, more or less it came down to the luck of the roll, then you just mix and match to come up with the best combination you can get.  The wintery raid seem rather superfluous, since rarely does one actually succumb to the disaster, so the inclusion of such element felt more like a nuisance rather than essential to the gameplay.

The production for the most part is wonderful, the mechanics just failed to interest me.  Won't likely play it again any time soon.

This is a pretty cool game with way way WAY too much downtime and length for what it provides the player.  I think I would rate this an [b][bgcolor=#66ff99]&nbsp;8&nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b] if it were a computer game you played against AIs.  One other bother about the game is that high rolls are strictly better.  This is a bothersome trait for dice games, because your odds of rolling high are equal to your odds of rolling low.  Let's just flip a coin, and declare that heads is always the better flip while we're at it.  To Court the King (Um Krone und Kragen) mitigates this much better, in that straights and n-of-a-kind are the primary beneficial patterns, and by the time you really need to deal with high rolls being strictly better, you have had plenty of opportunities to get abilities that can increase your die rolls.  On the other hand, Kingsburg provides a little bit of a plot, as you progress and build, hoping to fend off increasingly difficult foes, whose strength is only vaguely known, unless you sacrifice opportunities to see what the creatures are.

Seriously, I would love to play this against only AIs.

After 5+ Plays: I really liked this one after trying it for the first time, but subsequent plays all unfolded in essentially the same way.  Without variance in the buildings, it is too easy to follow the same strategy every game.  In addition, I think the push-your-luck element of the battle is out of place and poorly implemented, as there are too few dice rolls to make it even out over the course of the game.  It seems that the expansion will address both of these issues, so I look forward to trying it.

After 10+ plays: I really like the expansion, and will not play without it now.

Liked it but I remember none of the group were real impressed with our first couple of plays.  We need to play it again to make sure.

Nice dice game. Plays well with 2-4 players. A bit too long for what it is. Artwork, components and mechanics are all good.

Уникальная (до выхода наследников - Troyes и Alien Frontiers) игра с кубиками, полем и европейским уровнем стратегии. И простая, и стратегичная. И семейная, и геймерская. В общем, при цене локализации в 800 рублей просто идеальная вкусняшка с симпатичной графикой.

Enjoyable game to an extent, but I feel it becomes increasingly liable to analysis paralysis as people get more dice, and more options with what to do with them. And you cant really plan your go until it gets to you, as you are dependant on what others chose. Thus for me its too long, Troyes is a much better dice game.

A solid dice placement game with neat mechanics and a good flow. Overall, I enjoy it, but wish it was a bit more varied between players and had some endgame scoring.

However, the expansion raises the bar on this game. It is an absolute must and fixes a couple of small issues I had with it.

An ok game.  I had a good time with it when I played, but it was a little bit too dice-luck oriented for my tastes.  I didn't like that there felt like there was little to no tension from the invading armies each year.

Todos lanzan sus dados. Luego quien tenga la suma menor asigna primero a algún consejero de la corte. Cuando todos terminan reciben los beneficios del consejero. Luego construyen estructuras que dan PV y ventajas. Al final del año enfrentan a un enemigo.

Nice light worker placement with interesting mechanics using the dice rolled as workers. The expansion is a great addition.

A dice placement game that gets nearly everything right. Lots of dice means luck plays a large part, but this rarely detracts from the game as a whole.

The expansions seem almost like a requirement to me. Otherwise there are certain aspects of the base game that turn me off, like the random number of soldiers you get at the end of each year, and the similarities in pursued strategies without the character cards.

Also, the fact that constantly rolling very low will still make it harder for you to perform well is kind of a bummer (as opposed to, say, Troyes, where you can use pretty much any number, but for different purposes, and you can buy other players' dice as well).

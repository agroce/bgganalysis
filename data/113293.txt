GAME: Article 27: The UN Security Council Game
RANK: 2324
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The components are nice and on the whole this is a well designed game. It is a game you can play quickly even with six players, and the level of interaction is really high, another point in its favor. That being said, this game is very luck-based. Too often my secret objective token that comes out is for a color that everyone will veto if voted on, or my colors that I draw from the bag cancel each other out. Bribing to influence your colors seems to actually do more harm than good, but if everyone didn't bribe it would be a dull game. 

It looks like I gave this a 7 earlier so I'll stick with that rating only if I consider it a party game. Otherwise, I would drop this to a 6.

After playing this at BGG.Con, I bought a copy online. Played with my wife and parents, and I still liked it. I think it'll go well with my wheeling and dealing friends, and it plays quickly, both a plus in my book.

RATING: 7
A good game entirely about negotiation and bribery.  Works very well.  Theme is excellent although the goals are kind of abstract (but then what else would the UN Security Council be debating other than things like "peace" or "weapons proliferation"?).  Negotiation games aren't my thing, so this one isn't really for me, but it's good.  Very good.  And if you like that sorta thing, you should check this one out.  The wooden gavel is beyond awesome!!!

RATING: 5
Not bad, but for the dynamic - negotiation using bidding - it feels overwrought. Understanding the pressure points at particular amounts, such as 5 to veto, are really important and take a few plays to get a feel for, I imagine. For me, the Secretary has too much power to rake it in. This just ends up one of those games where the players moderate the game, and while it's quick enough, it's overproduced and takes too long to explain.

RATING: 6
it leaves a bit to be desired if you are looking for a serious bout of negotiating, but as a quick social game it works pretty well.

RATING: 5
Article 27 is one of a rare breed of pure negotiation games.  In terms of mechanics, it is just as sparse as Intrigue.  An aspect it does well is to bring time pressure in the form of a sand timer.  Thematically, the haggling over resolutions at the UN works very well too.

My problem with this game is with the random draw of issues each round.  Happy is the player whose issue colours align with the Secretary General's.  Happy is the Secretary General who finds an opponent desperate to include an issue colour that he just doesn't care about.  Unhappy is the player when tokens of his secret agenda always seem to score negative points when included in a motion.  Unhappy is the Secretary General when opposing interests just can't be reconciled and a sack load of influence is lost.  It is true that clever negotiation and a touch of bluff can mitigate all of these issues, but I'd always prefer the level playing field that a game like Intrigue offers.

Production quality is good, though the white on yellow on the issue tokens wasn't a good idea.  The artwork is quite jolly.  The rules seemed to make slightly hard work of explaining what's a pretty simple game.

RATING: 6.5
We'll get plenty of mileage out of this one. Good pure-negotiation game with an excellent theme and great components.

Drawing new tokens from the bag each round does break the flow of the game but is obviously essential.

It's light, it's quick, it's easy-to-explain and depending on the group you play with it could work very well.

Edit: Dropping this one to a 6.5 after a few plays.

The premise of this game is quite good, and when the rules of the game are explained, it sounds like it is going to work out great.  But I was slightly underwhelmed by the tractability of the decision making in the game.  I would like to play it again to better understand optimal strategies, as opposed to just having fun with all the arguing.  Nothing wrong with just having fun arguing a lot though.

RATING: 4
I enjoy the pure negotiation aspect of it, but there seem to be a few rough-around-the-edges areas:

* The "Secret Agenda" seems to be a non-factor, in comparison to the colour-matching points and the bribes.  The amount of money and work that would be required to get a perfect set does not make the reward worthwhile.
* For the first play, it is very hard to get a sense of what things are worth.  A player making a "bad bribe" has the potential to be a kingmaker.

I enjoy the mechanics and play-time, but the points scheme just seems like it should have been tweaked a bit.

RATING: 7
Negotiaion, and not in a backstabby way.  In our first play with six, it took a little bit to get a feel for the game but by the end, we were bartering like pros.  I think we want to get this one back out again.  I like that the negotiation is wide open (and non-binding).  Really different than most of what we get to the table and it plays six, which is good.

Ooo, note.  Being the person with the gavel is huge.  Reminded me of Dragonmaster in that way as you will make the majority of your points at that time.  Watch who you veto.  ;)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I quite like this game - it's quite a fun and light negotiation game that moves along quite quickly. Not much dirty back-stabbing or screwing the other players, it's more of a game of picking your battles, outbidding your opponents when it really matters and letting things slide when it doesn't, while all the time playing for the long game with your secret agenda. Only question is that I'm not sure how often this will get played.

Two games so far and it's been fun. The issues generally got called by their colours or such things as 'monkeys with guns' or 'house repossessions'. The wheeling and dealing is totally unstructured so how much fun this is, will depend largely on having players who are confident enough to throw themselves into the negotiations.

There's something weird about it I can't quite put my finger on. But I do really like negotiation games and this is one of the "pure negotiation" games I have ever played and I really like that aspect(for the record, I don't consider Cosmic to be pure negotiation). You live or die on your ability to negotiate and it comes out well in this game. Plus you get a wooden gavel! Best component ever!

RATING: 6
:indigo: :( :( :what: :what: :) :D Pure negotiation game with a short running time. The short running time is key -- the game's mechanics allow for occasional moments in which the token draw simply leaves you rogered in every orifice, and while its "n-dimensional overlapping temporary self-interested alliance making" act is more complex than, say, Incan Gold, one cannot help but compare it to another lavishly overproduced little game called Chicago Express and have even an amateur recognize the relative presence of Quality.

Article 27 does have a gavel in the box, so it's got that going for it, which is nice.

All this is faint praise, and I don't actually want to damn A27. Creating a game for five-six people (I wouldn't play with fewer than five for a variety of reasons) that delivers fun in 30 minutes is a trick worthy of at least a golf clap, and I personally find A27, given the right crowd, to be a far more engaging use of half an hour than, say, 7 Wonders, and the ticking sand timer (and fevered cross-talk) is a barrier, however artificial, to a grinding calculation of profit and loss that could make this game trivial for someone who goes in for that sort of thing. A table full of such Vulcans will likely want to give this a miss. For everyone else, there's a game, even a gamer's game, in this box.

A nice negotiation game, that mostly benefits from its theme! It s nice, feeling you represent a great nation in the UN. Has some minor problems in its mechanincs, but probably that makes it quite balanced and does not allow someone to win easily. However, when you re the secretary general, you must try your best to pass the proposal; otherwise you usually don t have chances to win.

I'd prefer this idea over Chinatown.
(There are hidden informations, wich make deals not so clear, so negotiations are better.)
But I don't know why game don't allow to order my goal dscs before each round. It could make it much better and less random.

It is not for Mall of Horror fans, it's much more 'pleasant'.

RATING: 3
Negotiation game with a UN theme and short playing time. Sweet! But sadly, this game fails on many counts. Many times, you don't feel like negotiating. E.g., goals for each turn are random. Sometimes, goals cancel each other out so there's no point in negotiating. Or you are faced with a choice to bribe with VPs to cancel out a negative VP which again works out to no point in negotiating. Or your secret symbol is on a colour which gives you roughly the same positive and negative points. When players become indifferent in a negotiation game, that's a bad sign.

Negotiation game that plays in only 30-45 minutes.  Especially good with 4-5 players (with 6 players it's a bit long and many proposals end up including nearly all issues).  One draw-back is how goals can sometimes conflict.  

But it's a good negotiation game that has a good bribe system (you get your money back if another player doesn't do as he says), has a good political theme, excellent components (except the yellow stickers, but the real gavel is good compensation for that!), invites friendly negotiations,  plays very quickly, and I especially love the asymmetrical aspect where you get a turn as secretary general and make the proposals.

RATING: 8
A good negotiation game. There is an interesting time where you are trying to gauge the other players' intentions and bribe them more or less based on your reads. The main problem with the game may be the times when your secret agenda and scoring tokens are opposed, leaving you with few options, but I am not sure that cannot be overcome. I would like to try the "cheating/bluffing" variant.

It's probably not best with 3 or 4, which is no great surprise. The negotiation is all a bit tepid unless someone gets obstreperous about their veto, but even then things can get derailed by weird draws. There are better quick negotiation games out there.

One of the best negotiation game out there, and I have done plenty. What I really like is that the game is not confrontational compare to most other games of the genre. It's really a nice feature, because even if I like conflict, this is not the case of every one, so I could still get this game out and get my negociation fix without losing my friends ^_^.

I will not rate it over 8 because there is a little too much "randomness" for my taste, and I would have prefer the subject tokens to have at least a name, in order to help roleplay. For instance "International Court of Justice" for the [peace / justice] token.

A negotiation game based on vote system. The game is quite funny, but has more drawbacks. First, the game is unbalanced. The power of the Secretary General is so strong that the agenda of the bills are usually decided by the Secretary General. Second, the proposal cards are determined by tile luck. If the proposal card luck is bad on the day, players has nothing to do but accept the destiny of cruelty. Third, the bribery system sometimes cause too much damages to the players who try to bribe. Four, the cost of veto privilege is too high. The game Article 27 is quite ok, but not my cup of tea.

Wonderfully overproduced (yay gavel!) negotiation game that also takes about half the time and feels much less mean/manipulative than most games in the genre. (And I *like* mean games, but this fills a nice nitch in being more friendly/light-hearted.) Also fills a good nitch in being good for 6 yet not too long. 

On first play, I thought this game would be all about hectic wheeling and dealing, a la I'm the Boss, but it turns out you need to be fairly stingy with your influence/points. The game is as much about figuring out what other players want (and hiding your own goals) as it is about bribery.

A good concept, but doesn't move quick enough or have enough tension to really work.  Strives for pure negotiation, but in doing so, may have oversimplified things.  The artwork is cartoony, many of the design choices, both physical and mechanical, are not quite up to par, and the gameplay floats more toward boring and tedious than fun and exciting. 

The gavel is very cool and the player boards are nice.
The yellow stickers, however, with White symbols are awful.  The symbols themselves can be confusing for new players, too, between the secret objective stuff and the main issues that are really only used for their color.
The random drawing of colors for issues each round (which are often both plus and minus influence for you) makes the games less tense, is less thematic, and makes the game feel off.  

This will be leaving the collection in favor of other, better negotiation games.  Too bad.  I was really looking forward to this being good due to theme and negotiation mechanic.        
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The negotiations in this game are extremely simple and mostly revolve around the secretary. Essentially your stance is forced by the agendas you're dealt and the bribe amounts are determined by the payout.


It is extremely risky to deal with the other voters because you may need two persons to fulfill their bargain but have to pay each separately.

For example, if you require 2 other players to abstain but only one of them does, then you do not get the desired effect and still have pay one person.

There are a ton of negotiation games that are better than this one.

Essen 12 Negotiation game - 30 minutes.

I really enjoy negotiation games and this is a very very good one. Each player has to balance his short term goals against his long term goals as well as what is happening between the other players.

Being vocal and forthright is important in this game otherwise you will find it hard to turn a bad situation into your favour.

Strategic use (and threatening) on a veto provides a great option for deals, as does making temporary alliances to abstain amongst several players.

Does not outstay it's welcome.

Great introduction to negotiation games. Fun open forum style play lends itself to all kinds of wacky deals, but the game forces you to agree to deals in order to reap rewards - which is fantastic for friendly games. The absence of backstabbery means that this is better suited for families or groups that tend to shy away from the lying/cheating variety of negotiation games.

Also, bonus points for having a big wooden gavel to pound on the table.

I was truly disappointed by this game, mainly because I had built it up so much in my mind prior to the release. I really like the UN theme, and the quick play time is a huge factor for negotiation games, which can tend to get drawn out. 

But in actual play there just didn't seem to be very many interesting decisions to make. There was a ton of luck involved in whose goals happened to overlap with your own and there simply wasn't much incentive to work with the person in charge. Even vetoing didn't seem to be too harmful.

I'm holding out hope that subsequent plays will reveal a more interesting and fun game, though it will be difficult to find willing opponents.

The concept is interesting, but I find the bribing part of placing tokens on various sheet too fiddly.

The other part is that bribing other people than the secretary general seems pointless or very random because you cannot easily predict what other people wants because their demand changes all the time.

If you want some people to abstain to make sure the vote does not pass, who do you bribe. The best solution is to bribe them all, but in that case, using the veto seems easier.

You could try to predict your opponent's secret goal, but it's very hard to do so and it does not give that many points.

So there is some potential mechanics in the game, but I think there is still some work to do.

So much fun arguing and negotiating in such a short time.  Fantastic with 5-6, not quite the same with 4, haven't tried it with 3.  Works best if everyone's really trying to make the deal go through.  We played 6-7 games of it before someone actually successfully vetoed, and that was our least enjoyable game.  The final scores tend to be fairly closely bunched together and its hard to tell if the winners succeed through skill or just the luck of having a good tile draw.  Still tremendous fun, don't get why it isn't rated higher on BGG. Also IT COMES WITH A GAVEL! worth it for that alone.

I like the negotiation parts of this game really well which is good because that is mostly what it is. It has a couple of issues though in that the bonus tiles can often come out so that you really can't make a gain no matter what gets passed. If you start the game as the last turn player you have a long wait until your big payday as the Chairman and you may get drained of cash well before the gavel gets to you.

Deal, bribe and vote to pass agendas for most points.

Plays: 2.
Type: Political game - a game that is played by discussion.
Complexity: Light.
# of players: See BGG.
Playing time: 45 mins.
Player interaction: Competition for unlimited resources by diplomacy. Very interactive.
Randomness: Low – tile draw, but you can make a deal with anything.

Replayability: High. You’ll likely want to play again immediately.
Fun: The political dealing under time pressure is great fun. Everyone is trying to get their agendas passed, handing out bribes right and left and threatening to veto. The chairman is desperately trying to pass the resolution, working to find a compromise. It’s exciting!
Memorability: Low. This is about the moment.

Thematic integration: Strained. You immediately start referring to the agendas as “red” and “blue” instead of their thematic names.  
Components: Good. The player screens have cartoonish art that set the right tone. The board looks good and everything else is functional.

Who will like this: People that enjoy fast-paced political dealing.

Annoying game. The "veto" is the single worst mechanic I have ever seen in a game. We played a 5-player game where 3 rounds were vetoed - basically an hour wasted of my life. Intrigue is a way better game of this sort.

RATING: 2.5
The production value is quite good. Thick cardboard, curious art in a questionable style, and even a wooden hammer (almost useless). The yellow pieces with white letters are a BIG FAIL!

I've only played it once and I'm not going to play it again, so I might be wrong, but this is one of the games that makes you wonder how the playtestings are conducted... The rules have many holes:
-> Allowing the Secretary to draw decision tokens is a mistake: he will try to mislead everybody by making them think their bribes will actually matter in the decision, but at the end he will decided based more on his decision tokens.
-> If you have kluck and you are vetoed while being Secretary, you're out of the game.
-> Too much time for negotiation. Instead of making the Secretary change the proposal forth and back by offering more and more money, people (smart people) will wait.
-> The spaces to bribe the Secretary if he approves/denies the proposal are usless.
-> The secret agenda is almost worthless. The pitiful reward will not justify the money you'll put in.
-> etc.

We all 6 agreed, this is very low value game. Some people will say it's a "group dependant" game. But for the number of plays registered on BGG, there doesn't seem to be a lot of groups interested enough.

My rating would be even lower if it were not for its production value.

This is fun a few times, but gewts old fast. It's way better to be chaiman first. If you get a good start and makes much more money than the others in an early round, which is easier the earlier you're chairman, you can just sit the rest of the game and sabotage anything that don't make you more money, or even bully others to pay for veto's that you gain the most from. The later you're chairman the less advantage it is, and the last and maybe second last will lose from being chairman.

Based on one play: A simple game of negotiation where one player is the Secretary General while the others bribe that individual to include or exclude tokens into the current "bill."

This is a nice little pragmatic optimization negotiating game. My 10 year old son had a really hard time at first being able to deal with suboptimal but positive outcomes.

Our first few games were quite tense, but now that everyone has a feel for it, most votes are passed with little to no opposition.

The veto option makes for interesting analysis. It mostly seems like a kiss of death for both the veto player and the Secretary General player.

This was good, though not great. I think there are a bit too many scoring mechanics that get in the way, e.g. I rather play [thing=542][/thing] which conveys the same idea with more silliness. 
I kind of feel this is a bit too much in the middle road. If I want social interaction I would probably prefer something with simpler rules. I also thought that the mechanical aspect of placing money on so many places then going back and forth for the six minutes really felt all over the place. Not sure why this one did not feel right.

There's a lot to like about this design, not least that it can't outstay its welcome because it consists of just one 5-minute negotiation round per player. The rules are admirably pared-down to their pure negotiation core, but we did have one concern. Each player has a secret long-term goal for the whole game, and a short-term goal assigned randomly each round. It seemed to us that if you happened to get short-term goals that coincided with your long-term ones you'd have a much easier time of it than vice versa.

A game for kids that like to shout and yell. After all, it's about optimizing your money by convincing others to use theirs for bribes you need. Also, I don't like the graphics - they're very stereotypical and quite disturbing most of the time. I would probably prefer not to show them to children, really. Yellow tokens have yellow stickers with white graphics on them - almost unreadable. 

Also, there's no bluffing here at all. You just push your stuff, that's all.

The rules are just a bit convoluted for such a light and silly game, but once things get rolling it is very entertaining.

I appreciate that despite this being pure negotiation, the dealmaking is structured such that players are only ever rewarded for following through on their promises, leaving no room for sleazy deal breaking or backstabbing.

There is enough luck factor to be bothersome, but it's not game breaking. Would happily play again!

Like most negotiation games, how much you enjoy it depends a lot on the group you're playing with. This has a lot of potential to be a very satisfying and tight game. Plays fast and is simple enough to teach. My main problem lies in the random token draws at the beginning of each round, since they basically determine your entire strategy.

A rarity: a pure negotiation game with next to no screw-your-neighbour element. There's a bit of randomness, especially with fewer then 6 players, but the game is quick (under 45 minutes), so it doesn't hurt at all. Very engaging, with a time limit to your negotiations, it's also one of the simplest negotiation games, making it a very good gateway for larger groups. I recommend playing with 6 - the game loses somewhat with only 4.

RATING: 3
Fully functional design, that could have been so much better than its result.  The game suffers as it frustratingly throws away bits of control that would allow for players to be more involved.  You can't choose what colors are associated with each negative or positive bonus, so it isn't infrequent that you have colors netting close to zero when they cancel each other out, leaving you with nothing interesting to do in a round.  If people veto the election when you are councilor you lose $5 (not a small amount in this game) and you have no control over it and are set dramatically behind other players.  Players that are councilors at the beginning of the game have more money to work with and have a huge advantage over players that are councilors at the end.  It is also quite frustrating when your negative colors coincide with your secret symbol and you can't do anything about it.  

The worst thing about this is that money translates directly into points so it is frequently clear that bribing against a negative will net you zero (aiding another player) or worse, so there are a number of times where you'd want to bribe, but the math makes it stupid, taking you out of the fun part of the game.

Plus, the Chinese caricature is a bit uncomfortable making.

The game is consumed by the luck of the chit pull and caprices of the other players. Blargh.

There are some good things here, and a couple of great things but it doesn't quite work for me.

The negotiations are too heavily guided by the random tile draws and I can't quite see a solution to fix this. If you end up with your -4 tile being your secret agenda, you end up losing out either way. If only there was a fairer/better way of determining short-term goals, this could be really good.

Negotiations with time limit, I like the idea. Quality components. The gavel is amazing!

What kills the game from being awesome for me is the amount of luck. If your secret agenda issue is something you'll score negative points from round after round, you will lose. If you don't vote for them to pass you are out of final scoring and you'll lose. On the other hand someone can be very lucky and get points with very little effort and again you'll lose.

Try to convince your opponents to help your cause through bribes and votes.

RATING: 6.5
Reminds me of Dragon's Gold, except all players are always involved in the negotiations, and wrecking a deal has a cost. In DG, there is instead a cost to being part of a negotiation in the first place.

I'm a little skeptical reading the rules. In an effort to keep information hidden, the player to your left verifies your scoring each round. The game also wants to have binding agreements (so that if you don't do what you agreed, you can't keep the bribe). Seems unwieldy.

In theory, at heart, this is quite a bit cooler than Dragon's Gold because players inherently want different things, rather than only incidentally wanting different things because of set collection.

But also, in theory, I don't think this game should work... If no information were hidden, everyone would know exactly what every other player can make off of a given proposal. Then, until everyone receives bribes equal to their shortfall from the average, the proposal should not pass. The only catch is that the cost of a veto may be higher than one's shortfall. I think I'd try playing this without bribes being allowed.

...I feel the need to rate this having played it. Quite torn. I would never say no to playing it, but the design frustrates me. I don't like how, if you found out all the hidden information, you could calculate how much "the pot" is worth, and then shift around influence down to the dime to ensure that no one felt he was getting cheated.

While it's true that, in practice, you might not be able to have perfect information, that doesn't satisfy me, because I guess that the alternative is just ignorant chaos rather than contests of deception and deduction.

I tried a variant, of replacing influence bribes with a system of "IOU cubes" where a player, instead of giving influence directly to another, can only agree to forfeit some of his own influence (into a black hole). It still bothered me and it was hard to figure out values. I will try it again using no bribes whatsoever...

...Ok, the most successful way for me to play this so far is with no bribes and all info public. (That still makes for a pretty random game, and obtains nasty endgame problems as well, where the last SecGen can't even win.) Players discuss what they want and will support but can't offer anything to each other in exchange except for vague IOUs that may or may not be possible to redeem in any form. If you suppose that nobody bothers to issue such IOUs, all that's really left is the chicken game of whether someone will actually go through with using a veto even though it hurts them more than just letting a proposal pass. Extortion and chicken games don't interest me much though.

The decisions are interesting but it's very complex to think through deals and whether they are equitable. I like having smaller decisions that aren't reducible to the arithmetic of how many points everyone is going to get from something.

Article 27 is a purely a bribing and vote-getting game where players use VP chips to sway other players into getting specific agendas to be tabled in the security council. Following that, players then once again vote to pass or reject specific agendas. Each player has both short and long term objectives they would like met and pushing those agendas forward allow them to score points. Negative points can also be scored if other players push agendas that are not relevant to your scoring tableau. Game is decent, but I found that the long term goals do not offer enough enticement (VPs) to sacrifice short-term goals. It would be great if I could feel the tension of choosing between getting lower short-term scoring in favor of getting more points in the end-game scoring. As it stands, the points offered in the secret objective in the end just isn't enough for me to sacrifice my short-term scoring. This really makes the game less complex by giving me fewer choices to push for specific scoring tracks.

A fine idea for a party game but, because of the timer constraint of the gavel, each round pretty much revolves around everybody ignoring any other player but the chairperson.  The "wheeling and dealing" degenerated into the wielder of the hammer having their one day in the sun and selling out to the highest bidder. 
The cynic in me felt this was far too much like real-life and, all-in-all, rather depressing. Perhaps some house rules? Sadly I can't be bothered.

Jeu où chaque joueur incarne un diplomate des Nations Unies qui essaie de faire adopter les lois qui correspondent à ses objectifs.

1e essai à 5 joueurs. Après relecture des règles, j’ai constaté certaines erreurs faites durant cette partie d'essai (surtout au niveau de l’utilisation des plateaux de propositions) mais malgré cela je ne tiens pas à le réessayer car même si le thème est plutôt bien rendu, ce n’est définitivement pas ma tasse de thé.

Played it at Essen with designer Dan Baden. This is a pure negotiation game, and in that category I think it is very good. Unfortunately, it will suck with people who don't like/get negotiation games. And my group is full of this kind of people.

Love the negotiation, love the hidden objectives (even if they are often easy to figure out by the end). The game is pretty enjoyable, but the luck of blind drawing your 5 tokens each round can be a bit crippling. Can't get too competitive with this one, but if you take it lightly it is a lot of fun.

Played once with 3.  

Rating could go up or down with future plays.

My initial reaction is that there is something missing from Article 27.  Negotiation games need fun and/or challenging valuation.  This one doesn't have any really fun element (compared to, for example, I'm the Boss), and the valuation is pretty simple (I get 4 points for this item, so I'm willing to give up 1-3 to get it).

So, overall, I think that there are other negotiation games that I'd rather play.  But, I'd be happy to try it again, particularly with a full complement of 6 players.

The second game i bought at Essen this year. Have to play it a number of times to see all the angles. But quite funny.

Negotiation game with influence to pass temporary and long term hidden agendas in the UN votes. Great components and artwork. More fun with more player. Hard to negotiate without first understanding the value of the agendas. Take turns as security general. Plays to theme especially with over exuberant gavel wielders.

Extremely simple concept that is easy to teach and play. You have your goals that you want to meet and you need the help of others to make it work. I played in the prototype game with the Stronghold rep and thought it was a great new game. I guess he thought so to.

This game can be a real hoot with the right crowd. Depends on honesty about your own hidden information. And you have to like negotiation games.
It's a shame that the hidden information wasn't cards on a player board rather than disks behind a screen. I'm thinking I might create a DIY card set and player mats to try out.

Unfortunately I can't see how this game plays especially well with anything other than 6 players, but with 6 it's a cool negotiation game where you're trying to get points however you can, with bribes and deals and the works. Fairly chaotic but that's part of the fun

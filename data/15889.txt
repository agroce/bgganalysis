It's a fun, traditional card game from Italy. I picked up an awesome Italian deck from a game store in Florence for 4 Euros. It fits in your pocket and is just classic. No, it doesn't take a lot of memory or cunning, but it takes some.

It has a very classic feel to it - even down to the odd way a Primiera slips the "Ace" up in scoring. It is very simple to understand with great card play. I've not played it yet with teams as is more properly done. But even with 3, it is quite fun.

RATING: 8
Rating is a little high relative to my ratings of other games. But the "will never turn down a game of this" is just so true. To turn down a game of Scopa would be like backing down in the face of a challenge. Can't do that. Can't have that.

A classic 'fishing' card game that has a very elegant feel to it. I've barely played the full version Scopone, which is the one I'm rating here.  Two player Scopa is an enjoyable activity that's about on a par with five card cribbage as a recreation; I'd give it about a 6.5.

A game I remember watching the old men play at family reunions.  I was fascinated by the weird cards and the fact that they could play while conversing and appearing to not even look at their cards. That formed my definition of a good social game, one that doesn't demand 100% of your attention, allowing you to enjoy the company. A very fun game.

I have a weakness for fishing games, for some reason I like them. For me, I feel this has more luck than Koi Koi (due to the small hand size and how winning the seven of coins can be very luck based), so I enjoy it less, but still a fun game.

Fascinating classic Italian card game.  Especially good for two players.  Especially good for four players as a partnership game (this version is called Scopone, and players are dealt 9 cards each at start of the game), which can be more strategic due to more cards in hand, and also exciting due to the larger number of scopas, and the partnership play. 

Rules: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopa
http://www.pagat.com/fishing/scopone.html

Common scoring: 
1 point for every sweep/scopa
1 point for most cards
1 point for most diamonds
1 point for most sevens (technically: "primiera" by calculating total of highest ranked card for each suit)
1 point for the 7 of diamonds (the "sette bello" = "beautiful seven")

For beginners it's easier to play with the 8,9,10 cards instead of the J,Q,K since they are worth those points anyway.

I've also played the Scopa di Quindici variant common in Brazil, which goes by the name Escoba in Spain, and works well with 3-4 players.  In this version of the game, you capture cards that add up to 15, including one from your hand.  This form of the game requires more mental maths, as you're constantly trying to add different combinations of cards to find a total of 15.

RATING: 5
The national card game of Italy, so they say.  It's a pretty straightforward game with slightly less straightforward scoring, that can also be played in a few different ways.  I got it expecting a variation on a routine trick-taking game, but was pleasantly surprised to find that it's somewhat unique among the many card games I own.  The goal is to score as many cards as possible by  matching one of a set of cards face-up on the middle of the table with one or more cards from one's hand, either with a straight x equals x match, or x = y + z.  The coin suite of cards is more valuable than the other suites, and it also pays to work on capturing high cards.  I recommend playing it as a partnership game - it can handle either 2 or 3 pairs.  There's not a lot of strategy, but there's a little more than meets the eye.  My wife really enjoyed its simplicity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I enjoy playing this game on the computer, but I'm rating it based upon in-person play. This is a potentially interesting card game killed by the tedious primiera scoring. Worth playing on a computer that handles scoring for you.

This is hard to admit...but I discovered Scopa while playing a guilty pleasure of mine...the "Nancy Drew PC mystery games" This was featured in one of them, and I honestly didn't know it was a real game!! haha, yeah yeah...anyhoo, When I discovered it was in fact a real game, I went to Barnes and Nobles and picked this up.  This was really fun with 3 or more players, and If you are a card game playing person, you will enjoy this little twist.

Nothing better within the genre of card games than beating an Italian at scopa.  They are so cocky at the start. they have been playing this game since childhood, of course they are going to beat an American by a huge margin.  By the fourth hand they have stopped talking and are applying the tactics and strategies that their nonno taught them.  However, their overconfidence and careless play in the first three hands have given you a lead that can not be overcome.

After three games with two players, I don't think Scopa is much fun for that number. The best card to play seemed completely obvious for each turn, and I didn't feel that I had enough choices to make.

The Winning Moves Games edition of Scopa has good-quality, attractively colored cards and a well-written set of rules. I thought it was much easier to play the game with this edition than with a Modiano Siciliane deck.

Con: All the silly little eccentricities that accompany a public domain game like this. (In my play, J and Q values were reversed, because of reasons)

It seems a bit luck driven--I won my first game without understanding all the scoring minutiae. 

Not bad, I didn't love it but I'd play again.

RATING: 6
A light fishing game, well suited to play in a pub. In the 4 player version, Scopone, all the cards are dealt at the outset which makes matching the cards on the table easy, so getting Sweeps becomes a bigger factor in the scoring. The 2 player version, Scopa, is more luck driven as cards are dealt three at a time and matching is much more random. Some simple tactics, but Casino is a much more sophisticated game. Play with an Italian deck for the best experience.

First played April 23rd, 2008. Taught in 5min played in 20 with 2 players. I'd be interested in seeing how this plays with more people. With two players, there doesn't seem to be much strategy. The non-dealer seems to have the advantage since they have their pickins from the play area first. The deck could be played with a standard deck if you take out the 8,9,10's. Queens are named Knight instead. Jack = 8, Knight = 9, King = 10. Each player is dealt 3 cards and the play area is dealt 4. You must play a card each turn. If there are cards that their total equal your card played, you get all cards involved. If you match a card, you get it and yours back as a score. Otherwise you leave your card for your opponent. If you could meet both criteria you pick which one you take. If you capture(take) all cards on the table you get a bonus "sweep" point. Play until all cards are gone. One point is awarded to player who captured each of the following(total 4): 7 of Diamonds, most Diamonds, most cards, and most 7's. If there is a tie for most 7's, then most of 6's, on down. It's woth a gameplay for those looking for something to try. Try it with a standard deck, it may be easier anyway.

RATING: 5
My rating is for Scopone and not affected by nostalgia

Kind of a Set Collection game, seems farily unique as I can't place it to anything else just now, its a little like Go Fish believe or not. There are a few things to always consider here thanks to the multiple ways to score and 2 ways to capture cards. Though I 'think' more skillful players should win and there is some subtle strategy here in how to play your cards it seems tactical luck is fairly present here, I should play more to see just how much but it seems significant. Note card counting is pretty important here and especially against good players.  

My rating is for Scopone Scientifico a 5 point game, the Scopa variant game with 4 random cards turned up (9 card deal) would be rated less due to the luck element of the 4 cards and turn order. Maybe my rating should be a little higher but with 4 players there are so many card games I would choose over this one.

UPDATE: I like the game due to the multiple scoring aspect but more play does show too much luck when getting a "Scopa" (clearing table) and even just matching cards, you can try to prevent these things and counting cards helps but its often just luck of the draw.

[i]Scientifico[/i], played in partnerships with all cards dealt, is neat. For a two-handed game, I've enjoyed [i]Quindici[/i] ("fifteens") more than the standard game. In this variant, one captures in sets of 15 points, including the card played.

The [i]primiera[/i] is an archaic complication. "Most 7s" is a good way to start for learning/teaching.

"Scopa" is also Italian slang for sexual intercourse.

I "own" it in the sense of having standard 52-card decks from which can be removed the appropriate cards.  For newbies I'd actually consider removing the face cards, to keep the math easier.

RATING: 6
It's a pleasant enough card game to whittle away the time. Claim cards as you can. Play so it's not easy for opponents to clear the table or collect big sets with a big card. Keep track of the scoring cards to perhaps edge you into a decision one way or the other. But with only three cards per hand, you're pretty limited in what you can do and decisions are usually straight forward.

Another classic Italian card game but slightly simpler than briscola. Probably the better option for 2 players and easier to teach. Cards are very cool and points scoring is interesting, very solid card game.

[2-6 players] Classic Italian card game. After mastering "Scopa", you can progress to "Cassino". Popular in US, also with kids. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quick setup. Great fun. The ratio of Luck to short-term tactics can be easily scaled by playing with the minimum hand-size of 3 for a breezy quick charming but relatively lucky game to a game with a significant tactical element with a hand size as high as 9

"Italian Cards" constituted such a distraction that there were laws regulating play during working hours. Haha - the Facebook of our ancestors. ;-) If you like Battle Lines or other tug-of-war or trick-taking games, you'll like Scopa, or its more thinky variant Briscola, or its older variant, Tute.

It works very well with two, three or four (in teams) with a variant called Tressette.

 To maximize your fun, get a traditional 40-card deck of Scopa/Briscola/Tute/Tressette cards with the traditional suits (coppa, spade, denari, bastoni). Makers of these cards with many regional artwork variations, include: Modiano, Masenghini, Del Negro, Fournier, and Piatnik.

Simple game that you can play without thinking (good while chatting with friends) Italian cards add to the feel (and make it surprisingly more difficult. Only 40 cards so you can try counting the cards.

RATING: 7
A simple fishing game that's taken over Cribbage's place as the go-to for my wife and I (at least for now). Like Cribbage, there's enough skill to make it interesting but enough luck to make it relaxing to play over a coffee or a beer. The 4p partnership version is excellent too.

We learned this visiting friends in Italy, and got quite hooked. The social aspect is definitely one of the things that makes it great - this does arise, however, as a result of the lightness which nonetheless includes gameplay elements that aren't entirely devoid of thought or skill. It feels quite like a modern light euro card game in that regard. Scopa!

Addictive traditional game.  Heard the Spiel guys going on about this one and snagged it for my iPhone.  I've since divided up a Tarot deck to play Scopa with my son.  Fun, fast, light strategy but scoring is a bit of a hassle (I've been spoiled by the iPhone version scoring itself).

--- Summary (from scopacards.com) ---
An Italian 40 card pack is used: swords (spade), clubs (bastoni), cups (coppe) and coins (denari). Cards in each suit = Re (Italian King), Cavallo (Italian Horse; = Queen), Fante (Soldier = Jack), 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace.

Cards have point values for capturing, and a separate set of point values used in scoring the Prime:

Card             Capture value       Value in Prime
Re (King)             10                    10
Cavallo (Queen)        9                    10
Fante (Jack)           8                    10
Seven                  7                    21
Six                    6                    18
Five                   5                    15
Four                   4                    14
Three                  3                    13
Two                    2                    12
Ace                    1                    16 

Random first dealer. Deal 3 cards face down to each player, then 4 cards face up on the table. If 3-4 of the table cards are kings, redeal.

The dealer's opponent plays first, then alternate until all three cards have been played. Then deal 3 more cards each and repeat till all cards in deck played?

TURN
- Play a card face up to the table, which may capture one or more table cards. If so, place played and captured cards into score pile face down. If not, the played card remains face up on the table. Play passes to opponent.
- Capturing rules:
   1. if the rank (capture value) of the card played matches that of a table card, the table card is captured (if >1 match, pick only one card to capture)
   2. if no match, but played capture value = sum of the capture values of 2+ table cards, capture that set of  table cards (if >1 set, pick only one set to capture)
   3. if a card matches both a single card and a sum of cards on the table, the single card must be captured, not the set.
   4. The Sweep (Italian scopa). Score a sweep when you play a card which captures ALL the table cards. Place the capturing card face up in your trick-pile of the capturing side. Exception: taking the last cards from the table at the end of a hand _never_ counts as a sweep. 

- After all the cards from the players hands have been played, the last player who made a capture also takes any face up cards remaining on the table.

SCORING
4+ points possible / deal:
   1. Cards. Player with most cards (>20) scores 1VP. Ties = 0VP.
   2. Coins. Player with most coin-suited (diamonds) cards scores 1VP. Ties = 0VP.
   3. Seven of Coins. The player with the 7 of coins (diamonds), known as the 'sette bello' (beautiful seven).
   4. The Prime (in Italian: la primiera). 1VP to the player with the best prime. "Prime" = set of 1 card in all 4 suits; sum the prime point values of the cards in the set (usually, player with most 7s). Ties = 0VP. Rare: both players missing an entire suit; prime = set of 3 suits.
   5. Score 1VP per Sweep.

WINNING
- First player to have 11+ VP at the end of a hand wins.
- If both reach 11 in the same hand, player with more points wins. If both are equal, play further hands until one side has more points at the end of a hand.

[Poker Game] {Card; trick-taking, partnership; optimal 4p}  Scopa, in my opinion, is not a true trick-taking game.  However, it is still quite interesting to play.  There a few decisions to make - capturing which cards, giving up which cards to the table for the partner or to avoid losing more, etc.  The scoring rule is quite interesting, but I think a player aid is needed for new players.

RATING: 7
Played with a Latin/Spanish deck, though regular cards work fine, I believe this is considered a fishing game. Essentially you're trying to collect specific point winning combinations of cards (most cards, the seven of coins, most coins, most sevens* or the sweep which is clearing the 'market') from a central market by playing a card that matches anothers rank or combination of ranks. If it doesn't match it gets added to the market. Played over multiple rounds it's a very light game.  With small hands of cards play is primarily tactical though there is some scope for counting cards and using that to make better decisions in the later rounds. 
The different deck takes a little getting used to but is not that hard and is a nice change of scenery. At the end of the day it's a perfectly enjoyable game but I'm not sure if it is anything special.

This is a coffee house style game.  Small area needed, quick game-play, light, yet tactical decisions.  I enjoy the cards because it just feels so medieval as I play.  I picture myself on a 400 year old palazzo, throwing down cards and yelling violently at some local spice merchant.  The game itself is fairly unthematic, but it's history is rich in theme.  Remember to yell "Scopa" when you get one and do the following routine starting at 1:18:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZCqWQlUJl0.

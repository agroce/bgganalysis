Base game and various expansions. Great opportunity to design custom boards. Still need the tentacle monster LOL ... rated based on what comes with the game. I believe that  this game is what you make of it. Get a good GM to design and run a solid campaign and it would be a 10. just playing the supplied encounters, it's kinda lifeless once you're run through the mechanics. Need more depth to 'care', and the players must supply the depth.

Can't wait for this one.  Anything Conan is amazing. Everyone should help Kickstarter this one. They are throwing so many stretch goals at this game that anyone jumping on board is getting a great deal. This game will blow any game I have away, just on playability alone. Excrement work, Monolith

Better than I expected. It's a pretty fun game. It feels like a more streamlined Level 7 - Omega Protocol. It plays in about 90-120min per game after the first 2-3 plays. It needs a bit of research on the rules even with the updated rulebook released.

I usually save my comments on art and production until the end, but in Conan both are so strikingly good that I just have to say that up front.  The game you play with all this lovely stuff is a skirmish pitting the players' heroes against a bunch of bad guys controlled by a GM.  While I admired the simple mechanics that make Conan very accessible, the alternating stop-start of hero turns felt odd to me.  And while the heroic actions of the heroes generate some narrative, lets not confuse this with actual role-playing.  Ultimately, Conan feels all dressed up with nowhere but another skirmish to go.  All that remains to be said is that the rules are indeed a mess.

It was a pleasure and an honour to meet the gifted creators of this gem of an adventure game at the Spiel Essen this year (2015).
The most surprising info for starters: You can learn to play in 3 to five minutes and get straight into the game and get immersed in your very own episode of the Conan Saga. The mechanics of the game are streamlined and functioning effortlessly, they allow you an enormous range of choices and mobility on the board and you almost completely forget you are acting along a set of rules because you get drawn into the adventure and think only of your story, your shared strategy, the experience itself. The game achieves a perfect flow and it feels like living through a story by Howard. (With one difference: Conan might die...) Our trial game, like the others before, at the Spiel attracted a crowd. It is even fun to just watch. The minis we got to play with at the Spiel were partly the resin prototypes, but many of the playable characters already were the final products in plastic and they looked fantastic, just as finely detailed as the prototypes but, of course, no longer as fragile. The minis absolutely looked like their conterparts in the 2D artwork. When the game will be out, you will be in for a treat! Promise! "An age undreamed of..."

RATING: N/A
Based on what I saw and read. Publisher says that "Howard-expert" Patrice Louinet was hired to make sure the art and the scenarios are compatible with Howard's vision. 
Then, it is stated that the game is based purely on Robert E. Howard's novels and short stories (and not the movies or other non-Howardian material).

Now let's talk about Mummies and Skelettons in Howard's Conan... and let an expert quote where he can find them in any (canon) Conan short story or novel. 

Otherwise, it is only a very repetitive battle game.

Members of the team are excessively impolite. They look themselves as (petty) gods and are really ridiculous.

Edición Kickstarter "King Pledge" junto con los addons exclusivos de la campaña.

Juego de "1 contra varios". Se explica en poco tiempo y es muy sencillo de jugar. No obstante la gestión de "energía" requiere bastante más práctica y estrategia de lo que parece inicialmente. Saber administrar tu energía disponible para el siguiente turno puede darte partidas o quitártelas.

Todas las partidas que he jugado me han gustado mucho (y eso que no es uno de mis géneros favoritos)

Un consejo rápido. Tres ataques de 2 dados no tienen por que ser mejor que un solo ataque de 4 dados. (ahí lo dejo ;-))

Rich subject matter and beautiful bits. The design's rough edges have rough edges though, and the challenge level is massive. The lack of player growth beyond looting chests during the game also feels flatly wrong. But, there is clever euro design underneath the Ameritrashy trappings, so I'd play it again... but a whole campaign mightn't satisfy.

Good game, but not a fan of action budgeting and unstructured turns. Games often go in a way, where every other turn you can't do anything, because you have to rest. Or you have to limit your options for the turn to save actions for the following turns. Which in a game that favors 1 bigger attack than a few smaller ones, feels counterproductive. The system offers a lot of cool stuff players can do, like breaking through walls, but puts artificial barriers to limit your use of them. Not a fan of this mechanic.

One of the best assymetrical 1-vs-all i have ever played. Equally interesting as a player as a bad guy, many options for the same scenario that can make it play out totally differently from session to session, beautiful components, easy rules (although faq or house ruling seems to be a must). Overall a very good experience for a short dice driven combat game. Kudos to Monolith

UPDATE: After a certain number of plays and a campaign book, it still retains its charm as a game but a few flaws appeared. Rules need faq or else.. Then the game is heavily AP-prone (unless you homerule it a bit with a timer or smth) when hero players take it as a puzzle and spend an aweful amount of time going through all possible scenarios to find the optimal one. It makes for a very mechanical playthrough of a game that is supposed to drip with theme, something that isolated the game on the shelf for quite a while. Be warned and homerule!

Wow, the King Pledge comes with a lot of stuff.  The shipping box was so huge that somewhere in the shipping process the whole thing was dropped with nasty damage to a corner of the main game box, which was on the bottom of everything.  Fortunately with the cardboard reinforcement at both ends of the game box, the boards were not damaged at all.  It's what's inside that counts, and this one looks to be a longtime "keeper."  Beautifully produced except for a couple of "blurry" minis such as the lion.

Upfront, I can't approve of all the art in this game as the presentation and exposure of ladies is really only considered appropriate in France, which is where this was made. 

That being said, this is one of my favorite games of 2016. It's a one vs many style dice-rolling scenario driven conflict style game much like descent and the like, although no campaign is necessary. The main thing that's different is the method of selecting your actions. Each hero gets a player sheet with stats and potential actions, and a number of gems (usually 10) which essentially represent your allowed actions, health, and stamina all in one. If you want to attack, simply put 1 gem on your attack and roll the dice shown their and on the weapon your using. Your opponent blocked it successfully? Put another there. Maybe let someone else start taking actions. Pick a chest and then throw the sword you find there to conan, who then uses it to slay some picts. But wait, a Giant Snake bust through the wall into conan's spot, blocking his escape! CONAN ESCAPES BY SMASHING THROUGH A DIFFERENT WALL INTO ANOTHER ROOM, WHICH HAPPENS TO HAVE THE PRINCESS HE HAS BEEN SEARCHING FOR!

Sorry, I kind of went on a tangent there. The heros perform their actions in whatever order and however many they want until they decide to be done, generally saving some gems for defense. Then the overlord gets a turn doing similar things. The overlord is also the most fun overlord I have played in a 1 vs all game to date. The overlord gets a few similar actions to the heros, but the overlord activates his minions in groups based on tiles in a track on his board. The cost to activate numbers from 1 to 9 from left to right, and when you activate a group or monster, its tile is moved to the end (right) making it more expensive, and making anything after it become cheaper. This gives the overlord many options but also forces planning and thinking like a true overlord. The overlord also does not need to go easy in this game. 

Every game I have played so far has been close and epic, leaving behind great tales, and the occassional hilarious scenario question you might expect from conan. "Can Conan just throw the princess through the door to Chevatas? Nah, she ways to much to throw, but you can throw that dudes head!" Yes, that in fact was a conversation in our first game.

Basing my impressions on the single demo of the Pictish village map I played at Essen 2014, I found that not only is Conan Hyborian Quests thematically appropriate but it also does real justice to Howard’s Conan, mainly thanks to the simple rules that allow players to focus on the game and story rather than on the rules themselves: you feel it has been made by people who really love this character having same-minded gamers in mind.

I know nothing about the lore on this game except from the movies that came out, so its not a theme that I get excited about.  Overall the production is very nice, and the "Gem" action system is really cool.  The 1 Vs Many thing has got a bit dry for me, but overall this is a really cool game.  Got me more excited for the Batman game... which has a theme I am interested in.

RATING: 9
I am a hair away from rating the game a ten. This is a rating based only on the free print and play (with an idea, of course, of what's coming, but not factored into my assessment of the gameplay). For my preferences at least, it's the best tactical minis game I've ever played. I'm familiar with Doom, Descent, Claustrophobia, Level 7, Earth Reborn...and this is the one I'd play before any of them. In fairness, it is a good bit lighter than those, but it is just breezy fun for that reason. The needed gravity comes from genuine player elimination (gasp), deadly randomness, and the laudable attention to staying true to the canon of the Robert E. Howard legacy. On that last point, it is true to the canon (I'm a purist myself and I am surprised to find some who still have quibbled). The rules investment is minimal because of the genius of Overlord "Book of Skelos" board and the stamina gem system. What both of these do is engage the players in interesting decisions without overt gaminess. Moreover - and why it inches towards a "ten" for me - is that the decisions are THEMATIC decisions. Because the game allows the players to act organically, interrupting and cooperating with each other, the players can argue over whether it would be better for Conan to burst through the wall, pause, let the thief run through to hurl a vase at the Picts, get out of the way, let the mage run after with throwing daggers, then have Conan follow...or instead let Conan wait by the door, ready to cleave invading enemies while the...well, you get the picture. The skills differentiate the different characters in ways that are thematic and mechanically impactful. Simply put, I feel like I'm in Conan's world and it's a blast.

Forgettable tactical mini game (with rules that are seriously in need of work). It's 'ok' but I can't see why you'd ever play this with more than 2 players (one per side), what do the other players add? There's no hidden information here. What kills it for me is it is just standalone 'battles', no campaign, no development.

Overall for my conan fix I'll stick with my old Age Of Conan (with expansion), for a tactical minis game claustrophobia or space hulk.

King Box Kickstarter edition
Overlord Compendium 1

So... cool...
I am a big Conan fan, I love this Low-Fantasy-Setting so this game was almost a no-brainer. Several months late finally a big and heavy box arrived, containing two big game boxes. Too big to fit my Kallax and fully loaded with stuff.

Conan starts to shine from the moment you open the box. The component quality is incredibly high, the artwork is stunning, the amount of stuff and variety you get is unbelievable.

My main reason to back the game, besides being the first real Conan game, was the stamina system. This system is great.
You have a certain amount of action points, the more you spend the more you can do. But, you only get a fixed amount each round.
Do I spend more to move a few extra spaces and try to kill these guys? But if I fail I will be standing in the middle of them, being pretty vulnerable. Or do I approach slowly and risk that the enemies move away or attack me first?
Very very very cool system and way more thematic and way better than "You have 2 actions"-Descent-style.

In my King's pledge is a pretty good amount of scenarios included, around 18 or so. Since playing the Overlord is pretty fun and challenging itself you can double the amount of scenarios for playing both sides.

My only negatives are:
-Each scenario has recommended heroes and recommended items for them. These are almost everytime the same 3-4 heroes, out of 20+ available. If you want to swap them then you don't have an item setup and you have to make up your own and this will kill the balance of the scenario unless you simply use the same items. But then these might make no sense with the new character (mechanically or theme-wise). It would be great to get a list of standard-starting-items for the other characters.

-You have no character progression. I knew that before, so this isn't really a deal for me (and I also get a campaign system via the campaign book).
But if you consider buying the game you have to know that.

-The rulebooks aren't the best. Yes they are easy to understand and you can play the game by reading them but they could use some restructuring and an idex.
Monolith is aware of that and already announced that they are reworking the rules. So don't take that point too serious.

Conan deserves a 9, maybe a 10.
Monolith, get us a balanced list of starting items and the game will receive the rating it deserves.

I regret not backing the addons. Now I'll have to wait until they are officially released.

After a few plays with different people I have to point out that Conan is the most accessible Dungeon Crawler I've played, despite the "not so good"-rulebook.

RATING: 4
This seemed like it had some ideas that sounded good in theory but didn't work so well in practice. Maybe because I was new to it, maybe because I was playing a warrior with no armor, but already by the second turn I found my available dice being horribly constrained by the need to defend and the low amount of dice that I could commit to any turn without having to rest up. Pretty much everybody at the table was spending minimum half their turns doing nothing, which seems like a terrible clash with the theme. You'd think a sword and sorcery game would have a lot of free-wheeling, constant action, instead this plays like a grittily realistic ancient skirmish simulator.

I liked it very much. Although I had some minor problems. Let see my thought:
Pros:
*overlord rotation is really cool
*looks gorgeous
*turn planing is behind -1move 1 action- thing
*item weights and limited carrying capacity are cool
*single scenario rocks

Cons:
*but not sure about the campaign
*very few characters in the base game
*why not modular maps?
*hard to heal while damages causes actions too

Overall I think we can compare this to Descent. I prefer Descent over this for anything more than just rare single scenario occasions. I miss the character developments a lot I didn't feel I have any impact on my character also the items are a bit unimpressive. I do recommend this if you are not into campaign modes, you have less time but want to play a good dungeon crawler.

Update from 7 to 6:
Since the last time I tried many new games and while I still love the overlord mechanic here I think everything else is just mediocre.

Back to 7:
The overlord part is just amazingly fun. I love it.

Solid scenario based war-like game. Not in the same league as similar games from the fantasy flight catalogue in terms of game design (there are some fairly significant rules issues which I understand will lead to the rules being re-released).  However the theme makes this one fun to play. Also comes with a HUGE number of good quality minis, so this is one shiny game in big box.

An amazing game! As a fan of Robert E. Howard and a miniature game hobbyist, Conan meets my expectation and I am very glad for backing the kickstarter.

Currently there are a few small hiccups, such as the bad rulebook. I heard the v2.0 rulebook will be out soon and the problem will be fixed. But to be honest, even with the bad rulebook, you can still learn the game very quickly because the rules are intuitive and easy to learn. 

The core of the gameplay is basically resource management, and it works beautifully! You spend gems to do stuff. You can spend a lot of gems and pull off one big action, but then there will be consequences for depleting your precious gems. Alternatively, if you don't spend enough gems to do an action then you may not succeed. The system really pushes your character to their limit, so you have to carefully weigh up your spending decisions. 

Combining dice rolls with the gem resource system, a gaming session of Conan usually moves at a lightning fast pace while forcing players to think strategically. The gameplay is fast, fun, and highly addictive. You play one scenario, then at the end of it you will want to play another session with the same or a different scenario; but you won't be dreading the setup process and the time, because Conan can be setup quick and easy. 

There are some complaints that Conan doesn't have a campaign/level up system to connect the scenario. But I think not having a campaign system, counts as a strength for this game. Because it captures the original REH stories, where all Conan stories are episodic in nature instead of being one giant narrative. Furthermore, the scenario-based narrative in this game means you can play/replay another scenario you want at any time, instead of having to commit yourself to a long campaign.

Eitherway, for KS backers who pledged the king box, a campaign book is coming next year and I am eager to see what it will offer.

Components wise, the arts are beautiful, and most of the miniatures in this game are beautifully crafted; they look really good once painted.

Another complaint is that there are no scenarios for the KS exclusive minis, and there is no rule that allows the players to customise the hero selection. Apparently works are already in progress to bring scenarios to KS exclusive minis. 

So in summary:

Pros:
- Amazing gameplay system that creates a challenging, fast, and addictive playing experience. 

- The gameplay captures the original REH stories brilliantly, and it also re-creates the theme of Conan really well.

- Excellent components, beautiful artworks and excellent miniatures provide eyecandies.

Cons:

- V1.0 rulebook is unclear and not well written

- Currently waiting for the release of scenarios for KS exclusive minis. But maybe the community can also start making our own scenarios.

- No rule to allowing players to customize hero selection for the scenarios.

The rules that came with Conan were *terrible* and took a relatively simple game and made it hard to learn. On top of this, the scenarios seem untested and imbalanced. BUT...it was fun! Unlike the vast majority of fantasy battle games, your turns are interesting and fun, and the scenarios have some flavor to them. The art, especially the boards, is very nice and the minis aren't bad. This reminded me of how much I loved the Conan comics of the 70s when I was a teen and inspired me to pick up some of the recent ones. Not many games have that kind of impact, so I guess I'll keep this one around.

I played the first scenario, the one with the princess & the pictes. Beyond the pleasure of playing a good game with a good adventure, I enjoyed seeing the possibilities. This game is a toolbox, like Heroquest was two decades ago and like Claustrophobia is (but for two players only).

Some players were so involved in the creation process with Fred Henry, the author, that they ended to elaborate their own scenarios or campaign that will be inclueded in the KS box game or his stretch goals.
And creating his own scenarios will be possible for each player. Based on R. Howard novels or not, everybody will be able to propose his work on the future website...

This game will be a never ending story as long as there will be people to play with it.

Mechanisms looks interesting but finally the gameplay is not. Rules are bad (but really bad), quality of miniatures is ok. However, the way the Kickstarter has been handled is really poor: high delay, strange communication, lot of mistakes, the campaing book is really strange, all the addons are useless, most of the scenariis are unbalanced, and second KS campaign for the Seth book is the worst I ever seen.
I won't play this game ever again. Honestly, avoid it !

Rating after only one play. Easy game to learn the rules. Short down-time as you almost always have to make decisions during the game. Strong Conan feeling. On the negative side is that the characters are very different. Conan is the best compared to the other heroes, so your gaming group has to cope with that.

There's a lot to like here in terms of the basic mechanisms. I like the active-resting stance decision each turn and the way the enemies are, for the most part, just cannon fodder and can be taken out a few at a time. That gives me the feeling of playing a true epic hero. The overlord's river is a nifty way of managing their unit opportunities on a turn to turn basis.

On the downside, the rules are a hot mess with both ambiguities and translation problems. Far too much friction for a game this simple. I'm still not convinced how LOS works in the Pict village. I'm also not convinced of scenario balance. I'll give it one more shot to see if holds together in terms of rules and balance.

Update: Some friends played again and came away convinced there's nothing to see here but some extremely nice minis.

Admittedly, I'm a huge fan of all things Conan. No doubt that influences my take on this game, however, I would not rate it as a 10-star game based solely on my appreciation of it's source material. I truly enjoy playing Conan, it delivers exciting, pulpy low-fantasy thrills every time. I own several of the top-tier board games which currently enjoy a devoted fan base and critical praise, and I'm always offering my gaming crew options, but they have wanted nothing but more Conan for months now. The gem-energy system is simple, yet allows for profoundly deep variation in strategy. The asymmetrical 1 player vs. all is incredibly fun, and really extends the replay value of the scenarios. The components are beautiful, and drenched in the pitch perfect theme. Almost every game has come down to the wire and yielded very exciting and unexpected moments. Highly recommended!

Interesting game and I like the gem management system however there is a distinct lack of healing for the characters and the fatigue that affects the players does not affect the GM therefore he is just as effective every turn whilst players continually struggle against the system oft times taking 2-3 full turns of doing nothing between single turns of being combat effective. 
It certainly needs a bit of a tweak... or even we just need to come back to it with fresh eyes as we all enjoyed but our GM felt like he had to really hold back to enable us to even play the scenario let alone be effective. 
Hope to revisit this one soon

It might look like a generic dungeon crawler, but this quite a unique beast. It feel s like a mix between Claustrophobia and Battle Lore. It is a miniatures game which plays asymmetrically, though not entirely and it has tactical combat because of the limited action pool.

I am quite taken by it. The rules are elegant and very easy to explain. The game plays fast and the rules do not get in the way of the enjoyment. The missions are interesting and the potential for future mission is nearly limitless.

There is a good game at it's core, but it is shrouded by some unclear rules (yes, still after the revised rulebook) if you play strongly competitive. The setup time is too long for what it is and most scenarios are seriously unbalanced. The biggest downside for me though is that the heroes/monsters are not easily just swapped out (You can disbalance the scenarios quickly and even totally break them dependig on their abilities - the only thing I really hold a grudge against monolith, because in the kickstarter they made it sound like you can use all minis in all scenarios). Now, when playing, after falling really in love during the kickstarter and going all in, I just had to realize that the game is not THAT good to waddle through all of it's problems.

I want to like this game more, but it's a rather fiddly experience, and quite swingy as well. While they've added in a lot of theoretical depth to the game play compared to similar skirmish/dungeon crawlers, the actual experience on the table certainly is no more fun for it, and no more tactical in reality. I've had several games go off the rails within a few turns, with one side swamping the other both easily and immediately. It all leaves me wishing they would have spent more time on the rules, and perhaps stuck with more tried and true designs, as where they've tried to innovate, they've failed to actually improve.

My favorite game of all time. Couldn't stop smiling from the moment we started playing up to the last moment. If I could rate any higher than a 10 I would. As a Robert E Howard fan this game was a dream come true and despite the translation errors and the rulebook stuff, it's still my best game. I want more!

UPDATE: Just keeps getting better every time I've played it and every group I've played it with has had a blast. I've played it with eurogamers who've loved the stamina system and I've played it with role players and thematic gamers who really get into the characters and enjoy the swashbuckling of the pirate ship map or the fact you can hit someone over the head with a chair in the tavern brawl.

Every time I play this with a group they come away from the table grinning and telling stories about their exploits in Conan. Can't wait to try out Nordheim, Stygia and Khitai soon! Also the minis haven been used every single time I run the Conan RPG.

Still my favourite game of all time and it's going to be really hard to unseat it.

RATING: 8
There is some rule ambiguity, which depends on how comfortable your group is pushing through it. We did it fairly easily and had a great time. It seemed very lopsided initially in favor of the overlord, but it quickly evened out and came down to a nailbiter. The flow of mechanics is nice and any casually seasoned group will quickly grasp the mechanics. The flavor is nice, quality pieces, and we had a great time.

RATING: 7.5
Conan-themed miniatures based adventure game.  An excellent value for the money (if you pay 2/3rds msrp or less).  Components, including miniatures, maps, dice and cards, are all excellent quality.  Each scenario plays within an hour, but there is no real character development at this time.  Gem driven action point system is clever and engaging, but this is still a dice chucker at heart.  Not difficult to play against yourself if you play both sides fairly.  I need more plays under my belt to determine if balance and swinginess of dice are tolerable.  Doubly useful components for other miniatures or Conan-themed games.

Action-packed scenario-based skirmish game that it's easy to learn and play. The battles are fast and highly enjoyable. There are no turns as such and heroes need to cooperate in order to defeat the Overlord, which reduces downtime and encourages communication between players. Some would have preferred tiles instead of a board, but the fact is that Conan includes four truly magnificent boards: the battle at sea and the Pict village, for instance, are a pleasure to look at. Let's hope developers continue releasing new materials.

All 5 players had a good time and we can't wait to play again. They really got it right with this one. The second time, everybody wanted to be overlord. Never before happened in our gamegroups with other 'dungeon-master' games, as you are usually the bored master, that has to send monsters out to be killed. In Conan the OL has a real chance to win, and his minion are a real threat to the heroes.

Already liking the ameritrash games, I am thrilled by this one: miniatures are great (a couple KS stretch goals are sub par, but this only bothers backers like myself, and the color chosen for heroes is a pity, but once painted they are awesome - if you do not paint minis, give a try to prime + quickshade for low time-$ investment and cool result), but the game mechanic is the best I saw in similar games, especially the overlord mechanics and heroes playing simultaneously.

Most scenarios we have played so far have been won at the very last minute of the game with the heroes making dare devil plans and last ditch efforts to win. If you read any Conan comic you know how true and in character that is! :) 
I would have put a 10 if I wasn't a tiny bit annoyed with the packing "ceremony"! 
Everything fits in the box(es) , but only in a certain way.
(of course you can throw away the miniature holders and have them all thrown in the box, but once you paint the miniatures ... you will think it twice and thrice)

This game is a lot of fun!  The mechanic of using gems for action points, fatigue and hit points makes for very interesting choices.  Playing as the Overlord is great fun, too,  and the gem/tile order mechanic works very well here as well.  The main criticism is Conan is much more fun to play than the other characters.  While it's understandable the Conan is the best fighter, it would have been nice to give the others a few more interesting abilities than they have.  Secondary criticism is the rule book - the ones in the box are visually great but informationally lacking.  We downloaded updated rule books which are much better, but they're still vague on a few details.  Example - does the teleport spell require line of sight or not?  It seems like you should need to see where you're going if you've never been there before, but if you do require line of sight and can only teleport to an adjacent space, then it's the same as normal movement.  Most other things are cleared up with the updated rule books, though.  
Bottom line, everyone was laughing, yelling, certain they would die and then suddenly finding their way to victory on the very last turn.  Very exciting for everyone!

I was hesitant about playing this game because of what I heard about the rule book, however, game play for the most part was very intuitive and straightforward.  My friends and my daughter always ask for Conan on game night.

Great Dungeon Crawl/One vs Many game. Great mechanics,  fresh mechanic, very dynamic, climatic gameplay with, unfortunatly, bad instructions.

My only con is that Overlord still feels very limited. He has more decisions to make on heroes turn (blocking/rerolls) than in Descent for example but I am still lacking any kind of response/reaction mechanism.

It is a sort of dungeon crawl, cooperative and played against another player that controls the enemies. The artwork is excellent, the miniatures and the maps, everything is gorgeous. But what stands out about this game, clearly, are the enemy mechanics, the way the turn is controlled, I really love it. It provides the game with something else than just "I move here, your turn". Maybe one negative aspect of the game is that it is extremely dependent of the map/mission you are playing. If the mission is well balanced the game will be fun for both sides, but if it is not (more often favoring the "bad guy") it is just waiting for the end of the game. In addition to that, I think that some of the maps may be difficult to play, the ships one for instance. It is small and it is difficult to planned anything, you are just there from the beginning.
In any case, the game works very well and it is highly recommendable.
Positive:
1. Artwork
2. Miniatures
3. Enemies mechanics
4. If the mission is well balanced, it is not that obvious for any side
Negative:
1. The mission has to be balanced
2. Maybe to have two sides with not the same amount of players (the loneliness of power..., it is a bit stupid, I know, but I can't think any other bad aspect)

RATING: N/A
Watched the rules video and did some reading, looks and sounds like they are doing the theme a good service. 

The dice luck mitigation and multi-use energy gem mechanics looks great, and gives you light decisions to make, but that is the thing,  gameplay looks very light overall not unlike designers other games.  I appreciate streamlined rules but I don't want to play HeroQuest (noted inspiration) ever again, D&D games were too light (this looks even lighter), and I also found Claustrophobia on the light side (Earth Reborn was meaty enough as a comparison). 

There is no campaign currently, so no character leveling etc which could have really added some heft here and maybe pushed me off fence (sucker for that) but there is "reportedly" (rumor only) one in the works. Missions are one-offs and reported to only take 60 - 90 mins. I like Conan but am not a crazed fan so for me I will stick to WHQ, Earth Reborn, KDM and the new SW Imperial Assault for this type of gameplay. Fans of HQ or Claustrophobia who are also fans of Conan will likely love this.

Only three PnP games behind (two with Pictish Village and one with Hunt of Tigress). Even with this very far-from-the-real-product-quality the game shined and was very enjoyable, nicely streamlined and still offered good amounts of planning ahead and very very tight situations. The two scenarios had very different strategies and playstyles, almost two different games! We had great stories with the game even at this stage... Eager to wait this arrive to my door step in 12 months and actually start playing

Scenario-based game in which players, as the heroes, must compete against creatures played by "The Overseer" within a limited number of turns. High quality components and an effective combat power system try to keep the game balanced... but then the Overseer has a hard time using the same unit for combat, and heroes' abilities make them very hard to beat. Overall, an enjoyable experience.

PLUS: high quality components, theme, decent power system
MINUS: imbalanced combat abilities skew the game in favour of the players

I might give it a better rating when they write a better rule and scenario book.  However, right now it is just a massive nightmare of lost words in translation, missing rules, missing definitions and explanations for models, and all kinds of using three different words for the same term.  I think there is a good game somewhere, but this is a damn perfect example of more kickstarter chrome than game.  Again I think if they fix everything it could be an amazing game but right now its boarder line crap.

After waiting for the English rules and being told it will take awhile I gave up and sold the game.  I have been burned too many times and just decided the game was not worth it to me.  Just so damn disappointing so I wanted to sell it before too many copies clogged the market.

Update: a year later and got the new rule books (available online for awhile) and this still doesn't solve most of the problems I had including scenario balance, the ability to use all the kickstarter extras that were included but not used or used once, and a lack of a clear LOS rules still.  If this is the future of board gaming I want nothing to do with it.

Update a few years more.  Played it once again and boy this is a floater.

Conan is a very well done and simple yet strategic minis combat game with a heavy dose of Euro-ish resource management. The minis vary in quality but are generally very good--certainly "board game good" if not always optimal for enthusiasts. The rules as originally published are actually quite simple and clear; where there are generally problems are with errors (translations and otherwise) in the scenarios and on some KS stretch goal components. If I were considering buying retail and found the theme and mechanics appealing, I think the only thing that would slow me down is the relative paucity of figure types relative to what KS backers got (although we also got a lot of stuff that Monolith hasn't produced uses for). "Concerns" about this game are, in short, blown out of proportion and are either confirmed (new rulebook announced) or likely to be addressed by Monolith. Scenario support will be the critical thing, and Monolith has (as of November 2016) been slow off the blocks in giving fans the tools needed to craft.

Harmless and swift playing dice based hack and slash. The game is heavy on luck dice. but there are at least a couple of smart ideas, namely the flow of action gems and overlord's river of cards.

RATING: 7
The game itself is a solid players vs DM brawler, much like a faster paced Descent or Imperial Assault. There were issues with the English translation of the rulebook, and, more egregiously, a complete lack of any system to include the myriad of stretch goals and expansions for the game. Several points removed as players should not have to homebrew a points system to even be able to use several hundred dollars worth of expansions, something like 75% (probably almost 100) of figures are absolutely rule-less as to when and how to include them in the scenarios. Boo Monolith, Boo!

My rating has been raised by one due to Monolith releasing various scenarios on their website which include stretch goal/expansion content, as well as an updated rulebook and updates to previously ambiguous scenarios, but it's a long way from being feature complete. Props for listening to feedback and starting to sort things out though.

Just a few notes (from bgg owners) for future purposes: 
*Level 7 Omega protocol beats Conan as gameplay experience and FFG's new Doom will eliminate Conan's chances to hit the table.
*The kickstarter exclusives seems useless anyway. I just don't see Monolith spending the next year building out scenarios and rules for all the exclusives that will not make them any additional money moving forward.
*Almost 2 years and the rule book still has problems? They should have had more proofreaders.
*No amount of priming will help because the detail isn't there. I was shocked when I saw the lion compared to the Overlord minis. 
*limited scenarios and replayability

Based on one demo game at Essen 2014
Four players - three hero's vs the one overlord - took about 75 mins including explaining the rules (which the majority of which were quite straight forward.)

Not my typical choice of game - but enjoyed none the less - some very interesting and new mechanics and the game seemed well balanced. I believe the plans are to have lots of scenario's so plenty of replay ability. 
Although only a demo the artwork was also good.
So if you like things like Descent I would have thought you'd love this.

Not played this game yet, definitely a lot of content, Like Blood rage the quality of miniatures made me go for this kick starter. When it arrived It looked cumbersome. Lots and Lots of content and I was excited. However after doing an unboxing and had a look ad the miniatures I was in two ways. the majority of the models which is in Dark Grey had fantastic detail to them however the Light grey models lacked detail and I thought the consistency of the quality failed me. I looks to me that they rushed the game out half complete. This does not bold well in my books. On top of that some of the miniatures looks like they have been drawn in 2d then Embossed into a 3D model. Not impressed me at all with that ( the gargoyle is the most obvious.) 

I am hoping the game play will make me forgive the manufacturing problem of the models. 

Saying that the amount of Content you get in this game is fantastic for the price you pay for,

Conan, designed by Fred Henry and based on the Conan universe by Robert E. Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game. One player is the Opponent, playing the Opposition forces, and the other players (1 to 4) play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard's novels and short stories (and not the movies or other non-Howardian material). The publisher has hired Patrice Louinet, a Howard expert, to make sure the art and the scenarios are compatible with Howard's vision.

Each game is a scenario, played on a map. There will be several maps — Pictish Village, Underground temple, Tavern, Pirate ship, etc. — and each map can have several scenarios set on it. The game is fast, one hour approximately. It's possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually. There will be a dozen playable scenarios in the base box.

I have played one time on a prototype on the board of the Citadel (one of the board proposed in the Core box deluxe). I was Valeria, the pirate.
 At the beginning of this scenario, Conan and the Princess were prisoners in the Citadel. Shevatas and Valeria, the two friends of Conan, have infiltrated the guards inside the fortress. The Cimmerian has killed the keeper and taken his sword. The jail was open and he was ready to go out and fight. The game could begin!
To win, the three heroes must fetch the Princess and escape the Citadel with her by finding and using a secret passage before the end of the eighth turn. But the “Adversary” and all his troops blocked our way. The forces present are : 4 grey guards, 3 red guards, 3 green guards, 5 archers, 5 dogs, 2 tough-guys (Baal-Pteor the Strangler and the Captain of the guard) and 1 special event card.
The game was epic.  We, the heroes, cut into the flesh of the enemies with pleasure  but possessed by the blood frenzy we lose too much time and finally we fail to escape. The adversary won.
I have enjoyed the liberty of the actions and the system of the gems which represent our energy. The rules are easy to understand and the gameplay is intuitive and very pleasant.
I’m waiting impatiently to play it again with the final board and the minis and to try the role of the “Adversary” which is totally different.

First impression playing 2 player.  I managed 3 heroes:
It struck me like a much improved version of "Last Night on Earth". Better art and minis.  The Ameritrash element was very strong but there was more room for clever play and cooperation between the heroes. We had good fun with this.

Update: I have now played with 4 as well (3 vs. 1) and it told a fun story and still moved quickly.

Tested a prototype with a bunch of volunteers, great fun to play and watch. Game Designer (Fred Henry) was around and sharing his thoughts, ideas, etc... since then, the game has evolved: testers report even smoother gameplay (approx 100 testers played it), and now the design team have turned to balancing the scenarios that will be available in the box.

Backed on Kickstarter. King Pledge with all the exclusives and the add-ons. $624.10 including shipping. It seems like there are a lot of delays plaguing this unfortunate initial-success project. It was originally scheduled to ship in October 2015, but now not likely to be delivered to backers until October 2016. Things keep slipping though. Quite frankly disappointing for the thousands of backers who helped contribute $3.3 million to Monolith. And with all that money, they still don't seem to be able to afford a decent camera to take photographs of the components for updates.

Update: 28/10/2016 - I received my King Pledge, Kickstarter stretch goals and add-ons yesterday. The core game is stunning. One or two typos on some of the components and some vagaries in the rulebook, but otherwise a beautiful game.
    And now for the bad... I'm going to try very hard not to be bitter about this... but I am very disappointed with the level of quality on almost all of the add-ons, extras and guest box miniatures.
    They are not of the same quality material or do not have the same level of detail as the core game miniatures. Not even close. Some of the female miniatures in the guest boxes have no facial detailing at all. The quality of the lion miniature in the core box is so far removed from the snake sculpt that when I had the two on the table while I was opening the rest of the components, my wife actually said: "Oh, are these from the same game?" Which kind of says it all, really. 
    Now I have since learned that the Conan game will not be going to retail production. Which means that the only way to get scenarios for all of the miniatures in the add-on packs will be by visiting fan sites or by coming up with them myself.
    I have had to just grit my teeth and... well, lessons learnt about how Monolith approach things... try to enjoy the core game and the reason why I backed this Kickstarter in the first place: Conan!

Update: 02/11/2016 - Two plays through the first scenario - The Pict Village - tonight. Once as a hero. I played the hero Conan, with two other hero players and my buddy (who also owns the Kickstarter King Pledge) as the OL player. Conan died. He sacrificed himself to the giant snake for the greater glory of letting the two other heroes escape with the head of Zogar Sag and the fair maiden. Only then did I discover I had only 9 blue gems for Conan's energy and I should have had 11! Gah. Wasn't paying full attention to my sheet at the start. My fault.
Next game I played the OL player and my friends had another stab at the Pict Village. This time I set them a tough challenge and through (skillful?) use of my resources I managed to hold them at bay until turn 8. OL player won! Yay, me!
Overall: 
The good: fun and exciting game, everyone mastered the core mechanic quite quickly and the second game went a lot faster than the first. A lot of interaction with your fellow players, trading off each others strengths and special abilities, animated discussions and strategy. Some clever moves. Disappointing dice rolls now and then, but that made the good ones even better!
The bad: The rulebook! Oh, the shocking, bad, awful rulebook! And the awful translations - viz. "Wall Breaker" ability - "2 *additional* moves" and "wooden walls" only, and the spell effects/area damage. The first game we spent at least 20-30 minutes referencing the forums here on BGG to clarify rules and get the correct translation for some of the skills, spell effects, and other vagaries. But we managed to muddle our way through and we made sure everyone understood each and every clarification as we encountered them. Hurry up with the updated version of the rulebook, skill reference sheets and cards, Monolith!

Great theme, great art, interesting game mechanic.  There is a lot to love about Conan.  But not the rules - and the same goes for the  text on some cards / abilities. They are woeful and really let down the otherwise high production values. It is clear that they were both written in French and then translated to English.  Fantasy flight would never publish a rule book in this state.  It lacks key clarifications, a table of contents, even a basic reference describing what each of the tokens do.

As with the escape from the Picts scenario, Hunt for the Tigris really highlighted problems with the line of sight rules.  They really need clarification for each map as it isn't immediately obvious which terrain will block or not.   The base rule just says that terrain features block line of sight, but this is too simple an explanation when the maps themselves aren't necessarily clear.  The rules suffer a lot from translation issues from French, and it seems that the playtesting wasn't undertaken thoroughly - I expect they either didn't do blind play testing, did it with the wrong group or didnt do enough of it in English.  What they really needed was some wargame grognards or train gamers who weren't invested in the them to pick apart the rules and seek all the clarifications which have subsequently been raised in the BGG forums.

Happily as a kickstarter backer I'll be getting the updated rule book sent out for free. I feel very sorry for those who bought the retail version. Can't rate it higher than a 7 until the rules are fixed - I'm just not motivated to keep playing  until the updated rules arrive.

The value that is provided for hour money is great. Gameplay is easy but provides all possibilities of an open world game. Every depiction is tactical but comes easily. There are so many unique things in this huge box. There are some minor issues with the rule book and there must be plater elimination given the theme. Therefore 9. A modern classic for me.

RATING: 8
My first impression of the game was horrible. I started with what looked like the most epic scenario 9the boarding action between ships) but it really fell flat. Leaping between ships was dull and added little strategic options and key enemies had too much armor and most importantly defend missions just suck.

So I finally went back and tried the first mission (pict village) and I really enjoyed it. It just had the right mix of magic and epic action. Conan bursting through walls and his ally teleporting through walls to search for the governors daughter made for an exciting game. In the end it was that feeling that these heroes didn't have to play by the rules (use doors like normal people) that made it feel epic. 

It's strange that the same mechanics resulted in such different experiences. Bursting through walls to surprise enemies is infinitely more fun than hiding behind a mast to keep from getting sniped... Game mechanics are only as good as the moment to moment gameplay they create and the feeling of creativity they give the player.

The gem system- I like that I can push the characters beyond their limits but hate having to do nothing to get them back. There has to be a better way than this. The whole rest to recover mechanic means you always end up with timed scenarios? This turns what could be a rich story driven game into a series of time trials... this and the long setup time is what essentially killed imperial assault for me. 

The Labyrinth board game had an interesting pro teamwork take on resting... When you rested as in a group you could choose which character gained the extra willpower. It would be interesting to have a support character that could help the character they are next to recover quickly.

Much to do about nothing when it comes to the rules.  I have probably owned over 1000 games and trust me, these rules are pretty good.  I did have some questions but not enough to drop a rank.  Conan is a fairly simple, scenario based miniature warfare game.  There is no campaign or leveling at this time.  This again does not drop my rating as I fully realized what I was buying.  Fun? oh you bet!  Every game I have played has been a nail biter, as the Overlord I tried to stop Conan and his buddies.  The management of resources for moving and fighting is a game in it self for both players and the Overlord.  Components are 10+  Minis, are amazing, and again some naysayers on the detail are only justified a bit if you don't give them at least a coat of primer.  I primed them in white and the details just jump out at you.  I paint my stuff, as this is a very enjoyable part of the game for mine, and the detail is good but not overwhelming, and I appreciate that as a painter.  Great game, buy it, play it, have fun!  VERY glad I Kickstarted this, can't wait for the expansions.

The miniatures, decors and combat system are great overall, but the balance is horrendous. The difficulty works on a 3 point system, one being the easiest and far too easy, 2 being medium, still not posing a challenge to the players and 3 is unbeatable difficulty.

The scenarios, while flavourful, aren't flexible and I would strongly discourage against using any heroes other than the ones suggested in the set up instructions, which is a bit sad considering how many heroes there are.

The fact that there were such things as kickstarter exclusives is also saddening, I got the game off kickstarter, but I also think that people who buy the game in retail contribute just as much to the game's success.

Despite the praise this has been getting, I found it to be a pretty run-of-the-mill skirmish-style game. I've played as both the heroes and the villain, and I think I would give the game a 5 as the heroes, and a 6 as the villain. The villain's river of cards is very cool, and reminds me of turn-based video games I've played like Temple of Elemental Evil. Otherwise there is nothing really new here. The allowance of actions crystals you're given is very similar to the dice pool from the Super Fantasy games, and while I do like the fact that you're given so much freedom on what you're able to do, I didn't find it as compelling as I thought it would. Although admittedly it was a cool design choice to have the Manipulation Action cover so many different things in such a cool and streamlined way. Along with how well they incorporated encumbrance rules and character skills, this really should have been a home run of a game.

Unfortunately, I just didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. I went into this expecting something similar to Zombicide or Mansions of Madness 2nd ed. By that I mean something where you are moving minis around a map, fighting things and accomplishing objectives, but it's all very streamlined. Conan is a very streamlined game as well, but almost to the point where I feel the same way some people do about Zombicide; It's like they came up with a very loose rule set to hold the game together while giving you a chance to move high quality minis around a map. So despite some flickers of innovative design and a pretty incredible presentation, I found the game to have too much dice-chucking, and not as much structure as I would like.

That all being said, I think the sexism levied against this game is unfounded. If this game is misogynistic, then Super Mario is as well. Having the mighty hero storm the gates, so to speak, to rescue a princess isn't sexist, it's chivalrous. The cover of the hero rule book, for instance, struck me as Conan standing above a slain woman, ready to seek revenge. People online have said it depicts more of a masculine ownership over her, which I think is reading into something that isn't there. Seriously, people, it's just a game.

I backed the all-in on KS for this game. I was waiting a lot from it and I'm not disappointed. I don't know if it's balanced but I don't care. I have a lot of fun to discover and replay the scenarios. The miniatures are well detailed and add a lot to the immersion. The rules are not very complicated but there is some inaccuracies and pending issues after reading the rulebook but you can find answer on the net. Heroes have to cooperate and discuss the best strategies to win. There are a lot of replayability with just the base game (you can find a lot of additionnal scenarios on Internet).

I really like this game. It's been about a year since I've played it (since I don't own it), but I played Conan himself and really felt like I was playing an over the top barbaric badass by smashing through walls, and then killing 4 enemies with one slice. It was very satisfying. I like the fatigue system used in this game, and I think that the Conan theme is one that isn't done enough lately, and it has a huge universe that is ripe for board games, so it's a very welcome game to be played.

Tentative rating after two plays: The attack of the Pictish village and the Pirate ship.

We were 5 players. We made some rules mistakes but, as both scenarios ended on the last turn or dice roll, we were all very happy of our game session!

The game rewards coordination between heroes (or villains for the Overlord) and requires some tactical sense. It's not very deep, but it's all good flavor and simple fun! :-)

The Overlord explained the rules before play, using the rules rework. I do not own the game: Right now, I cannot comment on the rules layout and clarity.

This game has quite many awesome mechanics and innovations, but the energy gem system is both good and bad - you have a lot of freedom until you have used all the gems up and then you are out of options. Would probably prefer a regular limited action system so a total overrun by overlord or heroes side is not possible and every scenario would play out as a back and forth struggle until end. The possiblity to elliminate hero player or fulfill win condition for heroes in the first 15 minutes of play is way too swingy and offered too little reward (as a gameplay experience) for such a huge setup and teardown time this game requires. I tried 4 different 4-5 player scenarios and only the very first scenario (rescuing the princess) worked the way I liked (although hero player ellimination was still a problem). All others scenarios I played were over way too early.

L'attente fût récompensée, il n'y a pas à dire... après 25 ans sans avoir touché un pinceau, me voilà reparti et mon excitation est à son comble vu le potentiel lié à la pléthore de matériel de qualité que contiennent les 2 boites du kingpledge.
Rien à redire sur la qualité des figurines mis à part les coups de sèche-cheveux obligatoires pour redresser une bonne partie des fig'. Sinon, le rendu sur la table est magique et la majorité des figs sont vraiment magnifiques!

Oui, le potentiel est là donc! Et heureusement que la V2 des règles est enfin là car on sentait bien qu'il y avait un paquet de points obscures non traité dans la V1 (ligne de vue, activation des alliés,...). Bref, il fallait un réagencement et une mise au point des règles!
Today, on attend encore celui de l'Overlord...

Maintenant, moi Kingpledger, je ne peux m'empêcher de penser au développement du jeux, au delà de la dizaine de scénars actuels. On doit donc attendre le livre de campagne et, SURTOUT, on attend de voir comment Monolith vont nous aider à exploiter tout ce matériel, comment scénariser des parties en campagnes, comment équilibrer les forces belligérantes, gérer les équipements, la magie en fonctions des persos... 

En tout cas, on pourra dire que Conan fût une aventure laborieuse mais tellement extra-ordinaire et vu le niveau du résultat, on se dit que ça valait vraiment le coup (de hache;) d'attendre.

Vive Conan!

This is the long-awaited Conan game that set out to raise $30K and ended up raising >$3 million. It was, I think, the very first game I backed on KS. The various extras and add-ons aren't separately listed on BGG at the moment but, core 'king pledge' box aside, this came with a huge and heavy box full of stretch goal minis and other extras. I also have the following add-ons: Crossbowmen, Vanir, Baal, Black Dragons, Sabretooth Tiger, Wolves, Demon, Scenery, Doors and coloured bases.

With Wave 2, came large expansions for Nordheim, Stygia and the Tower of Kithai, as well as the Art Book.

The 'river' activation system is neat, along with the action point allowance/refresh system. 

Too fiddly, though. It's stupid how there are a number of very similar skills which pertain to hinderance, but then they've abstracted away a lot of details for blocking LOS etc. Rules are incomplete on a lot of important details. A bit too heavy on the dice rolls. 

Shame it features misogynistic depictions of women and their role.

I really wanted to love this game as I do think the core mechanics are strong but out of the 7+ missions I've played I just keep leaving each game feeling indifferent  (win or lose).  I can't shake the feeling that the "depth" is more of an implied illusion than a reality. This is not a complaint born of rulebook issues or poor clarity concerning terrain and LOS issues (though both of those things don't help).  I want to like this game but as of now I just can't shake the "meh" feeling.

Great 1 vs many skirmish game.  Stamina gems give a resource management bent to the otherwise Amerithrash gameplay.  Additionally, allowing the players to alternate their actions instead of going in turn, gives the heroes some flexibility and really encourages cooperation and communication.

The boards are beautiful as are the minis helping make the game immersive Conan-like adventures.

Rule book wasn't perfect and updated ones (available online) are improvements.  But the game was perfectly playable as-shipped.

One of my biggest complaints about dungeon delvers of the Heroquest/Descent/Imp.Assault variety is that they ask for so much of your time and mental energy, then throw all of your decisions through a luck-fest of dice such that none of them make much difference anyway.

Conan doesn't fix this.  It does however, have the good grace to be short and have a flair of humor about its dice and setting.  
You're not just some random adventurer who slowly amasses an entire armory of gear only to fumble a roll and die to a spider... you are CONAN the BARBARIAN and when you miss 4 swipes in a bar brawl, it can be safely assumed that you are just reaaaally drunk.

Love the energy system,  still hate the dice.

RATING: 7
Ya know, this is actually really fun. I have played as the bad guy and as one of the heroes and the decisions of when to activate who and how much to spend to do it (how powerful you want the action to be) is interesting and it keeps the game from being just another dice fest. I'll see where it lands but for now Im enjoying.

Solid skirmish wargame with great components. Many excellent scenarios in base game, but needs to be expanded. Captures Conan theme well. Energy management system is very well done for both the players and the Opponent. While there are minor ambiguities in the rules, they are not as egregious as advertised. Play is fast and intuitive. Glad I picked this up along with the expansion box.

After a couple of plays, this proves a very engaging game. Acting heroically is fun, but over time, your luck runs out. One player commented about the "ebbs and flows" of fortune within the game. (Initially reviewed: about Oct. 2016) ...Still liking this game. I think many of the scenarios favor the passive player, but they are still great fun. Each scenario is a bit of a puzzle and a game unto it's own. The heroes generally get more effective the more times the scenario is played.

The stamina/health mechanic is an innovative way to differentiate Conan from yourntypical hack & slash dice game. I don't usually care for 1 Overlord Vs All style games, but the enemy tracker board seems like a fun way to bridge the gap between the overlord and the players. The only reason I don't rate this higher is despite the cool unique mechanics of this game, it is still another fantasy campaign system in a sea of similar-ish titles. I highly recommend Conan to anyone who isn't already burnt out by the genre though.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I struggled to even play the game, given the terrible rules.  They set a new low.  The game is simple, the rules are poorly organized, bizarrely ordered, incomplete, incorrect, and poorly typeset.

The game itself, as best I can tell, it quite forgettable.  It's mostly alternate dice chucking with very little in the way of tactical maneuvering or choice, or even any real theme.  There is superficial theme in the miniatures and narrative background to the scenarios, but the actual gameplay is bland and tedious and does not evoke the kind of dramatic battles described in Conan books.

I fell for another classic kickstarter.  Good theme.  Good components.  Good mechanical idea.  Forgettable execution.  Abysmal rulebook.  Maybe I'll learn my lesson this time.

the positive:  I will note that the villain player's unit activation system is great.  They can activate each unit once for very low cost or re-activate units more often, but it costs them more the more they do so.  In fact, act great cost, they could just activate the same unit over and over.  The sliding 'river' makes these constraints emerge naturally without fiddly or complex rules.  If the choices about what to do with an activation were more interesting and the rules more coherent, this mechanic might have carried the game.

22-02-2015. Rated after 2 plays. Coonnannnn. Yeah, I've kickstarted and a buddy (Giliam) made the PnP. 

Conan is a 1 vs many tactical miniature game in the spirit of Descent and Claustrophobia, although it's no true dungeon crawl given the many outdoors environments. 

The game is strictly divided in an overlord and a hero phase. Each hero turn, the heroes get a certain amount of energy gems back. If the hero is active, the hero gets 2-4 back, if the hero is inactive they get more but can't act. These 'stamina-gems' are used such that they can be attributed to perform actions such as movement (although you have some for free), get attack dice, rerolls or interact with items. Heroes also need to save some gems in order to be able to defend against the overlord attacks.

The overlord works similarly. They have a 'book of skelos', which is a set of tiles with their minions with activation costs on top (1 to 8). Each minion activates when the overlord pays the cost and subsequently moves to the back. The overlord may then use their minions to strategically block/protect/attack the heroes. The overlord can also respawn tiles if all minions are damaged and he activates the respawn tile. 

Conan is good fun. I played the game 2 player and twice as hero so I cannot comment on how the game plays from an overlord perspective. I feel that Conan is a LITTLE less immersive as Descent, but that could be because I played with 3 heroes and not 1. I feel the game is highly interesting, fun and different enough from Descent and less restrictive as Claustrophobia to fully warrant the purchase I did on kickstarter. I am highly curious to play the game with 2+ and see multiple scenario's.

Mechanics aren't too much different than your usual dungeoncrawler dice-chucker. Energy cubes are a good concept, but the niggling rules, calculating dice numbers, ambiguous LOS on the first board, mistranlation in rules, etc. make me suggest you wait until they revise the game past the 2.0 rules (which only updated the rulebook, not components such as LOS on the Pict Village board). Mini's are nice though, and can be used in the Conan RPG or other games.

Surprised by this game! Great club game - is very fun, plays quickly and fluidly and is easy to teach. Rules aren't *that* bad - more examples could help. Scales very well from 3-5 players (3 players can just control 2 characters each). I feel sorry for those who will just have retail version as it only contains 4 characters - my King Pledge copy has 25 - adds so much replayability.

Only two words: AWE. SOME.

The fatigue mechanics just blow me away. They're a fantastic fit for cinematic-level heroes such as the ones portrayed throughout Conan literature.

That said: i would rate it a 9 of 10 if it were simpler to create custom scenarios for. The flexibility of the rules, and asymmetry of the teams, have their advantages but make it impossible to apply a simple point-buy system to the game. Creating well-balanced scenarios requires playing and modifying playing and modifying and playing and modifying and playing and modifying and playing and playing them again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great game in my opinion. Would definitely be a 10 if not for the rule book issues in the initial printing and the unfortunate controversy built into the theme and artwork. If you can get past those things this game provides an amazing box of fun. Mechanics are clean and simple, turns are fluid and the asymmetry works great. With the multiple different scenarios and all the extra kick starter stuff this makes a great sandbox with endless potential.

I wanted to LOVE THIS.  Everything looked great -- the art, the theme, and the gameplay too.  I was STUNNED at how much came in the box, and the extra stuff was almost overwhelming.

But the gameplay was the most important aspect, and while I liked it and I'd play it again for sure, it didn't grab me.  And for something worth $250+ it has to grab me.

This rating is based on my first play of the game.  I would play the game again, and would expect that the rating would go up, if anything.  The first game was very frustrating at first as the whole gems=exhaustion thing seems impossible to make work for you, that is you just can't seem to do enough!  But then, as the game goes on you do see that it will work. but it will be tough (which is totally okay, even preferred as you don't want it TOO easy.)  In the end, we (the heroes) did win the scenario, but only barely.  We also recognized some serious tactical errors we had made, so all in all was pretty good.  Like I said, will definitely play it again and revisit this rating and comment.

Very cool game. The game is very thematic.  It is also strategic, while keeping it light.  Lovely bits, easy to set up and so on.  I have heard it compared to Claustrophobia and that is a sensible comparison.  It's slightly heavier than Claustrophobia, but even better.

The biggest problem is that this game is very expensive and it is too good not to own.

It could use better rules explanations for certain things.  The basics are very well explained though.

You really feel playing in the Conan universe, the game devellopers use brillantly the backgroud create by Howard.

About the game itself, Because every player play at the same time (except the overlord) there is no dead time, it's priceless. 
All characters had different skills, so you can have various strategy for a same scenario, it means that you can play and play again the game and it's never the same game!

A great game, no doubt!

The game is decent, but the balance issues and rules just kill it. The mistranslations and one-sided scenarios just make it a blah experience. If the game came with double or triple the number of scenarios, the rules were better explained, there were less errors, and the game was a bit more balanced it might be a 7. But as it stands now it is merely average.

Cool things: sliding mechanic for the overlord, free format turns.
Meh: fiddly by using an action point system (stamina markers) with lots of small moving pieces.

Seems to be ok game, but absolutely no need to own this when owning Galaxy Defenders or Descent: Journeys in the Dark.

That is, unless you are a big fan of the Conan universe of course. If you don't own any Dungeon Crawler already and dig the Conan universe this might just be up your ally. But not mine.

A light, fairly simple skirmish game. The rules are pretty straightforward, though they've added a lot of (currently) unnecessary icons in there - it's important to know that Conan can climb and swim in this 2d village.

I quite like a lot of what they have done with the river board and the activations. It's not perfect, but delivers a pretty accessible skirmish game.

Unfortunately, where I fall down is that I see about £40 worth of value in this game. But it sells for £100+

Rating based on 2 PNP games and 2 games with the full game (King pledge).

UP's
++ Minis are awesome for a board game.
++ Game is co-op and flowing freely. Players are actually encouraged to play together and mix their actions and not wait until another person is finished with their turn.
+ Rules are easy to learn, still allow quite some depth-of-play and urge the players to make meaningful choices.
+ Many more scenarios to uncover, and it already urges to create some of our own.

Down's
- Rule specifics are quite unclear for a boardgame, would rather fit the freedom of a roleplaying game (it was best for us when the Overlord acted as mediator).

Outstanding game. Fun and playable for both the heroes and the overlord. Minis and maps are terrific (although one minor quibble is that the maps could make clearer how line of sight works), and the scenarios are tense and well balanced. I'm enjoying Conan quite a bit.

What a mess. They had millions of dollars and several years to work on this, and the end result is still way below average.

First there's the rulebook. I read through the rulebook and thought "Got it. That's nowhere near as bad as people have said." Cut to my first game where we're trying to find rules for elevation, what counts as an obstacle, how is this item used, armor value vs dodge value, and all sorts of questions that either aren't addressed at all or not to the extent that they should be.

More about elevation and obstacles: why didn't they use some sort of coloring or other distinguishing feature to make obstacles obvious? Descent uses dashed and different colored lines and it works great. Here you just have to guess at what's an obstacle and what's just art on the board.

The quality. Some of the minis, the lion in particular, look much worse than others. The graphic and text layout are really bad and some of the icons are inconsistent. Everything just feels amateurish. They used some kind of weird justification on the text, so the words are all spread out like somebody's               spacebar                got             stuck.

The scenarios are underdeveloped, and it seems that you have to use pre-defined heroes and equipment per scenario. This is the opposite of Descent where you can use the heroes and items of your choice for any of the scenarios/campaigns. One of the scenarios features a magic-user who gets bonuses for using magic, but he doesn't have any spells to use in that scenario. So... he's just a guy. They couldn't have given him at least some sort of minor spell to throw around? Also each scenario has a different player count, unlike Descent where any scenario scales based on the number of players. Got three people together and want to play some Conan? Have fun with the two scenarios that you can play.

The gameplay. This should be great: it's just Descent but with an added layer of resource management. Maybe it's just me, but it felt incredibly boring. It could also be that everything else was so bad that the gameplay just wasn't enough to redeem the game. I don't know, because I'm not playing it again.

I really wanted to like the game. If anything positive has come from this, it's that I know not to waste my money on Mythic Battles from the same company. Even at this early stage Mythic Battles already repeats most of Conan's graphic and text issues and the rules are shaping up to be just as bad.

If this game follows the usual big-budget Kickstarter trend, then in a couple of years there will be a Conan 2.0 that tries to fix most of the issues. Maybe I'll take a closer look at that time, but until then...

Sold.

Played two scenarios - and I know for a fact we got rules wrong both times.  Still, the resource system is great, the combat is fast and easy to grasp, and I look forward to getting it right sometime.  Can't believe this and Doom came out at the same time, both are incredible 1vMany games.

Great balance, good game.
Is really challenging for all players, the art is good and mechanism simple yet interesting.

Edit: After more plays, the scenario balance is not that great however the fan base developped so many new scenario that it is not really a problem.

Campaign book is disappointing.

The play style is unlike any RPBG I've ever played. despite having a lack of experience bonuses for leveling characters the realism of a stamina gem mechanic makes it refreshing and original. the down side is the current limitation of large and small campaigns - especial for those who have kick-starter editions or expansions.

RATING: 7.6
Excellent little scenario based one-vs-many miniatures game. The use of gems for both the heroes and the overlord makes for lots of interested choices every turn. The combination of this and some good scenario objectives can lead to games creating their own rich narratives. I think this is a better game than Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Imperial Assault (in campaign mode) and Descent. 

The biggest downside is player-elimination which is completely unacceptable in a game this long. Unsurprisingly given the title, Conan is much more powerful than the other heroes and this can also lead to non-Conan hero characters feeling unsatisfying. This can be at least partially alleviated by having players on the hero team controlling more than one character each. It's easy enough to play with just two players.

The original manual really wasn't great, basically throwing the player in at the deep end. The new version gives a much better overview of what the components are and what they're for.

Some of the imagery in the game, whilst supposedly true to the source material,  is sexist. It's a shame as it isn't a necessary part of the game. See the "Grab ‘em by the Board Game" post on the internet for a more detailed analysis.

It's a good game though with a lot going on and plenty of interesting scenarios online. I'll be watching the Batman implementation to see how they improve on an already good game.

Over the top minis and awesome artwork. But everything else is underdeveloped. It seems like the designers had one good idea, slapped on a great theme and then had no idea on how to put it all together. Don't be fooled by all the bling. It's not worth spending money at its current state.

Conan is as overproduced and lacks substance.  The in-game decisions are as shallow as the depiction of half naked women and muscle ripped men.  The only redeeming quality is the minis.  This review lacks any further depth just because I refuse to waste any more of my time.

I really liked the gem mechanics and tile enemy activating. However, I had to let this go as i'm not a big fan of Conan lore and the game gives you the sense of potential but is limited by the number of scenarios and lack of a campaign. Gives me the feeling that 25% of the game is missing and they released it too early. With a Batman reskin set in the future, I'd rather get that and hope they work out the kinks to make it a more 'complete' game. Still a fun game, but the cost isn't justified by the gameplay...it's focused more so covering the cost of the minis.

Not having played all of the scenarios yet, I have to say that I think there are some serious balance issues.  I'm interested in checking out additional scenarios to see if they are able to address the balance.  I don't buy the "this is a sandbox game" argument.  Components are top-notch, possibly one of the most beautiful games in my collection.

Fun dungeon crawl along the same lines as Descent. These kind of games are very hit and miss. It captures the theme really well and the minis are fantastic as are the other components. I'm a little disappointed with some of the artwork as I expected more gritty realistic art and some is certainly not that. Scenario based so there are clear cut goals to meet. Fun game with the right group and right player count. I wouldn't play with three players.

RATING: 7
Mechanically and components-wise it would be an 8, but it gets 2 points less for:
- an incomprehensibile rulebook (especially the english translation);
- too many components that are not used in any scenario.
Rating subject to change when these issues will be addressed.
UPDATE: the new edition of the rulebook is a definite improvement, so it gets back 1 point.

Fantasy scenario based miniature romp between the overlord player and the Conan heroes. Contains some mature content. Crystals activation point system combined with the variable phase order works so well when you splurge and play out the epic Conan like hero actions. Revolutionary monster queue and activation cost system for the overlord to bring the pain and foil the heroes is brilliant and great fun. It will be a standard in future miniature games.

2 play for now (though first one with set-up error unbalancing the game). Quick and quite strategic. I love the the exhaustion/wound mechanism, the encumbrance including the fact they do make use of it as a factor in some scenarios, the overlord river motivating a troop rotation...

Has the right idea, but I think the execution is poor.  A lot of that probably has to do with the rule book, which is easily in contention for the worst rule book I've ever seen. With some tweaks and clarifications, I think it could be a fun game. Other than that, it's standard cards and miniatures, though the player mats could use an overlay to keep gems where they belong.

well.. after playing 3 szenarios (4 heros and a overlord) i still think the minis are very nice.. the game (not counting in the horrible rulebook and two things we did wrong) was a bit uninspiring.
the mechanics are quite fun and such, but the scenarios feel a bit bland.. hope there is a nice one in the yet unplayed ones or at least in one of the expansions, but for now we'll use the minis for Open Combat :)

This game has a couple (one rulebook and one for the overlord) of the most horrible rulebooks I've seen in years. It's simply a nightmare to read through and get your first game started. Game play itself is little over mediocre, if it wouldn't be for the theme the game is set in, I'd score this a lot lower. But in the end Conan saved a couple of points. Not recommended, there are similar and a lot better games out there!

Lots of content and scenario's to play and an interesting mechanical system of managing gems. 
Not always easy to find an answer to the gameplay questions that come up. And hard to get it right. 
It certainly is harder for the monster player to win. He needs to play very chesslike and every move counts for him. Heroes are much more forgiving and easy to play and win with.

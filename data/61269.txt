Fun, light 'take that' game. Pretty slow at the start of the game, but gets pretty exciting when one player's about to win--it becomes a race to screw the other players over while gaining coins for your own.

RATING: 2
Components: Attractive and functional tiles, with lots of added detail that doesn't distract from the play, but enhances the theme.

Experience: Far too chaotic for its length; it seemed to take forever for one player to gain the requisite amount of gold, because the other players could all design the dungeon in such a way as to make it very difficult for the leader to triumph, thus prolonging the game. I felt very little control over my fate. Makes me want to play some other dungeon game; just not this one.

With my six year old, this is a great developmental game. We use the expansion.

The black and white rules (to describe color icons) fall short sometimes, but mostly they're pretty good. ("Coin" looks like "portal", the "heavy wind" and "heavy gale" look alike, etc...)

Frankly, with adults, the game bored me silly with it's simplicity, but with children or as a gateway game (with folks who don't like strategy games), I've kind of seen the light.

It's a quick game. And as such it should have simple rules. It does have simple rules and that's all. Too many different tiles (constant checking of their function is boring), disgusting graphics and dull gameplay. Avoid.

The game is overly complicated and simply not fun enough for me to play it again.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (June 2012)

This game was a surprise for me, the rules are about 1 page long and upon reading them I though the game was going to be very bad, however when I played it was a winner and I liked it (which is surprising because I´m not a fan of tile laying mechanics). It is a very short and simple game. You have very little choice each turn and it has some luck in it but it can be a blast with the right crowd. To win you need to ally yourself with other players but , probably, you will need to betray them :devil: so it can get a little messy.

The theme is very similar to Dungeonquest (also from FFG), and the components are adequate (although I want to buy the 3rd edition who has better components).

Not a game I want to play all the time (otherwise it could go stale very fast) but a good filler.

It passed a long time between plays, but I finally played Drakon again. I enjoyed it, but I have changed a lot in these years. I no longer enjoy Ameritrash games as much as before. Due to this I’m downgrading Drakon´s rating.

Also, I prefer the second edition of the game. The third edition has better components, but it smells very bad and FFG changed the rules to the worst IMO. The luck actor increased a lot.

Right now, I’m downsizing my game collection, I’m culling the ok to good games to play the best games. In this culling, Drakon has to go.

I would play Drakon if requested, but I won’t actively seek more games of it.

RATING: 5.5
the concept sounded cool to me, but it didn't work the one time i played it. 2 other players were content to just follow the third player around snatching up gold while i was the only one trying to foil them, of course the third guy ended up winning easily. i think if everyone played 'properly' it'd be an ok game.

DRAKON 2ND EDITION WAS DELETED, moved this comment from 3rd Edition, annoying.
Okay. Not great.

(UPDATED: 17-Apr-2006) Plays much better with my player aids, cool. Silly, not essential game in any way, but fills a niche, why not.

This my first board game from "new wave" of boardgames. And it's cool!

The game have simple rules, fast gameplay, bunch of interesting choices, some possibilities of combos, some amount of negotiations (all vs leader) and good dose of chaos. 

Now, after many plays I don't want to play it again too often, but I still can recomend it for novice players.

I do like this game in concept, and it can be fun to play.  However, it can be a little bit of a game of extremes.  With competitive playing, it can be nearly impossible to win when other people conspire against the current leader. Great concept, but a little rough aorund the edges sometime.

This game can get a little nasty, but it's fun to watch the dungeon unfold as players place the tiles.  Sadly, the second edition is inferior to the third, and there's really no dragon in it.  I traded it away for Red November.

2nd edition.

This game has found new life lately as it was introduced to others in the group who really enjoy this game.

You can see how this game was derived from an original computer programming game where the goal was to complete a logic loop.

Lots of fun with many opportunities to screw over the other players (the mark of a good game)

27-01-2015. Rated after 2-3 plays. I own Drakon 3rd Edition and a friend owns the second + expansion. Before I started logging plays I played several games of 2nd edition Drakon.

I do like Drakon a lot. In Drakon you are a bunch of adventures stuck in a dragon dungeon trying to get out. The Adventurer with most gold is spared by the evil dragon Drakon. Each turn you play a tile or move your character. All tiles have special abilties, like steal money or rotate tiles etc.

I think Drakon 2nd edition is a light but very fun and interactive game. I do feel that 3rd edition increases the fun by making the coins of dissimilar values, which makes the coins and stealing more tense.

I do like it a lot, also this version.

Very simple, very cutthroat, but requires some home rules in order to remove player elimination possibility. I recommend using the  variant in which you have to return to the entrance with gold in order to win, as it seriously diminishes the importance of luck factor and the game requires more tactical approach both to escape and to thwart winning plans of other players.

One of the first new gen games that I bought. Initially I was blown away by this and absolutely LOVED it. Over the years it has taken a backseat in my games collection but I will always retain a fondness for it. I think it's probably best as a two player game when it feels a lot like chess. With more it is still great fun but it becomes longer and more chaotic. Difficult to see me parting with this - if only for sentimentalities sake and the occasional outing with long time adversary Philip. Grudge match...... grrrr!

A very interesting "how can I win without easily being blocked" kind of tile-laying game where you alternate between laying dungeon tiles and walking with your character, trying to amass gold.
After some 10 plays, we adjusted the goal to be either 4 gold in Drakon's chamber or 6 gold anywhere, ignoring having to be in the key rooms.
The result is a tense game where you have to really plan and take advantage of the fact that sometimes you can use another player's advantageous position to your advantage.

Fun light war game that has so much "B" movie cheese. Can't take this game too seriously as the weapon effects changes game to game (as part of the theme) to having a well thought out strategy is hard to do. But playing the crew does make you feel like your in panic of trying to save the crew from the aliens. The main drawback of the production of this game, is the smallish board in contrast to the number of chits that can be in an area.

Picked up from Brad at Origins--I traded TV Wars for this game.  I should play Planet Busters sometime while I'm at it, too--somehow I've ended up with two Tom Wham games but have not yet played either!

Initial impression is annoyance at having to cut out all of the chits, but I guess that was to be expected.  Will hopefully get that started soon.

Works fairly well as a solo game but hasn't been played for quite some time.  My version is in a snap shut plastic case, the "board" is a folded piece of paper, which is hard to smooth out and the bits are small printed pieces of card, which are quite fiddly.

It reminds me of [thing=2613][/thing] with a lighter theme and more challenge as a 2-player game.  Lots of light-hearted fun and challenge for each side and plenty of randomness to make it one that you could play a decent amount of times and still have the game be fresh.

Kind of complicated to digest all of the little rules, but once understood players can quickly get things moving from turn to turn.  Plays a little longer than I'd like two player game to go, but is still a lot of fun especially due to the theme and wackiness that can occur through each weapon use.

A classic. Played it a lot as a kid and even today it's still pretty cool.
Very much luck dependent, but this game is a lot of fun so I don't care.
But it's not totally devoid of strategic thinking. Well placed units and knowing when to sacrifice them is very important. So a bit of experience with tactical combat games will help you a lot.

I love the theme and the graphics. TAGTFAS seems to skew heavily in the aliens' favor. I won't be playing this game regularly, but it is good for a round of chaotic, silly fun once in a while. I enjoy having to figure out what the random weapons are good for. Oh, and the eggs hatching... those adorable baby aliens... haha.

Curiously enough, the only Tom Wham game I own. Pretty fun. Not immediately apparent that some "bad" effects (like, say, 1 die fragments) can actually be quite nice for the crew.

I've mounted the board on foamcore and sometime soon I'm going to finish mounting the counters on little colored tiles, because I'd really like to play this more often.

6/2011: My aborted art-supply-store attempt to improve the old copy of the game I had is done. SJ just released a new version with (gasp) a mounted board and die-cut counters. I am getting it because I would like to play the game more often.

RATING: 2.5
Got this on a whim as I remembered playing it as a youth when it first came out in some gaming magazine (TSR?) in 1979.  It hasn't aged well...

I realize this game was based off the movie "Green Slime" (1969) and tries to re-create the atmosphere and feeling of that movie.  This it does, and does well.  However, once the novelty of the game and the overall situation wears off, the replay-ability of the game - or lack thereof -- becomes glaringly apparent.

The game is fun, if fidgety, the first half-dozen times through.  Then you realize that a.) the Spacers must stack as many units as possible on top of each other AND the robot, and b.) the Slimes need to avoid combat and spread throughout the ship every game.  Major standoff ensues for that and all following games.  Meh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.4
Simply one of the best classic board games I own, with a hilarious theme that is actually felt throughout the actions taken in the game. Mechanics are largely cute and straightforward, my favorite being the 'Grow' action of the Green Things as well as how the weapons effects' are randomly determined at first to see which will be the most effective against them.

I'm not a huge fan of the 'choose your own' adventure ending, that seems a little tacked on, so I prefer to play it straight up for victory between the two sides (or Escape victory), but otherwise this is an absolute delight for two-player tabletop.

RATING: 8
The silly pretense, the goofy cartoons, the rediculous weapons, and one-eyed monsters hiding in the garage, laying eggs.  From the outside looking in, everything about this game says it's a gimmik, but in the end, it delivers.  Behind the silliness is a solid game of decisionmaking, tactics, and overall strategy that's light enough to draw from the wargamers and non-wargamers alike.  I own a TRS copy.  I've heard the later versions are low-quality.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A good laugh, but I can't see how the crew win.  Will get round to trying a rules tweak to balance it one of these days.  Even without that I'll still keep playing it.

The premise is funny and the game is easily played, but it has a tendency to get tedious. Feels like a game about finding a cure for cancer. The interesting part is the random effect of the weapons and dealing with the encroaching Green Things, but again that can overstay its welcome... Sporadic playing keeps it fresh. I finally sold my copy.

Supposedly a good game, the production value on the game was a real turn off for me. The counters were cardboard, which had to be cut with scissors, and the map was unmounted paper. I would still like to play the game eventually, hopefully the newer release with greater production values.

Traded away
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial Impression: The production value of this game is outstanding. The counter thickness rivals that of VPG's Gold edition and the mounted board is really nice. Even the included dice are full sized and customized. The gameplay is simple but fun as both factions are asymmetrical in nature. The game plays fairly quickly, is very thematic, and is easy to teach. This is the perfect game to introduce budding young wargamers to the hobby.

I never played the game when it was new, or for a couple decades after that, but my nostalgia for the ads alone I saw for this game inserted into other TSR games back in the day pushed me to pick it up in January of 2009 after having it set aside at LP for a few weeks. Looking forward to play...

<fighting off powerful feelings of nostalgia> Always felt that the Things had the stronger position by far, but it's just too much fun being the crew. (I tend to choke up a bit when either Marvin or the Mascot become chow.)

After a number of plays, you find yourself falling into the same pattern of play, and the game drags on near the end...but I still enjoy pulling this one out every now and then.

Showing its age a little now but still a lot of fun. It is a frantic dash to try weapons out on the AGTs, establish which work and bring them into use before you get buried under sheer weight of numbers. Surprisingly balanced considering the sides have such different strengths and weaknesses.

RATING: 8
Sadly most gamers I know think that a light-hearted game isn’t worth playing so The Awful Green Things From Outer Space doesn’t get the credit it deserves (nor hit the table as often as I’d wish): but I have a soft spot for this little game, its kitschy theme and the chaotic fun it spreads on the board quickly.

Hehehehehe YES! This game is a riot.  Fun little two player game with asymmetrical sides.  The crew needs to quickly figure out which weapons will best neutralize the AGTFoS.

RATING: 7
This is a surprisingly fun game.  I wish the components were nicer and this is one of the main things that hold this rating from being a 9.  They need to make this on a larger board with actual room for the many, many chits that clutter the board in the later game.  With the many pieces, it would be difficult to make it work as a miniature game, but with a larger board on cardboard instead of paper, it would make it better.  My rating decrease isn't me being a snob, but the actual fact that it's cluttered and difficult to pick things up and move them around.  The design aspect of this effects the game.  The artwork hails to an earlier age, but I would like to see a really nice version of this with large wooded chits with the pictures painted on.  Maybe the wooden chits could have a channel for putting the cardboard weapons perpendicular to the person holding it.  It might make stacking hard, but with a larger board, I think it would work, since you could still stack the Green Things.  I think I will make a proto-type of this with a semi-modular board, with the ship broke into four quarters on a heavy board.  Both sides will have a slightly different layout for the rooms in that quadrant.  Anyway, I'll stop rambling and someday I'll post some pictures of my finished idea.

Very fun game and lends well to telling the story of the dramatic yet goofy things that happen in deep space.  The first game I played, I played against my 10-year-old son and he was very defense using the Green things.  I knew he would lose using the approach he did, so I made a house rule that forced my main weapon to randomize between a "1 die to fragment" and on channel two a "4 dice to Kill."  I made the rule that if I used the weapon I would have to roll a 4,5,6 to Kill.  I lost the game when in the final room of mopping up the Green goo, I rolled a 2 on both guns firing at a group of 6 Adults.  They fragmented and turned into 22 fragments.  My son happily turned them into babies on his next turn.  He made quick lunch of my Captain, Robot and the mascot dividing the 44 attack dice correctly.  On his next turn he maxed out the adults and hunted down my last two guys.   My final man ran into the Bridge, knighted himself Captain (bending the rules a little) and initiated self-destruct on the ship.  I made it to the escape hatch and then died of starvation in deep space all alone.

Great game, lots of story telling fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
TAGTfOtS is a fairly simple, old-school wargame based on a silly premise. The crew of a weird little space-ship accidentally bring on board alien eggs, which hatch, releasing awful green things that try to eat the crew.

The games I've played have been (mostly) fairly balanced, but weapons have a random effect, usually damaging or killing things, but sometimes stunning them or even making them grow, and this random chance can occasionally result in a game that is unwinnable for one side or the other.

I reccomend this for wargamers who don't take their hobby very seriously, and very much warn away anyone who dislikes randomness.

Wackiness galore! Just reading the rules is pure entertainment. Hapless spacelings try to stamp out a spreading plague of "awful green things" threatening to take over the spacecraft ("The Trouble With Tribbles" anyone?). Individual spacelings grab anything they can lay their hands on and hope the effect (which is random) will be something useful. What about that pool cue?

You never know what is going to happen and the game soon disolves into chaos. Perfect beer & pretzels two-player mayhem!

The multi-player "Red November" would remind you of this (and may have been inspired by it).

RATING: 7
Good game with a nice sense of Humor. When weapons turn up in game has a large influence on outcome for both sides. Good weapons early and Crew wins, poor weapons early Green Things win. Great humorous art. Must watch Green Slime to really appreciate how close game is to this bad movie.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Light hearted game - but it really all hinges on what the weapons do to the AGT, good chit draws and the Greenies are toast, bad chit draws and it's all over.

I own several versions of the Green Things, but the 1st TSR boxed edition has IMO the finest artwork of all of them. The Steve Jackson versions of the game replace Tom Wham's excellent original art, and also IMO are inferior.
The Dragon Magazine/TSR editions are the best. Period.

Edit: I now also have the new SJ 8th edition, which I will concede has outstanding quality components. TSR art is still better though..

Cute for (pre)teens, although perhaps it's also a requirement that it be the 80s. Actually, the game is not *entirely* trivial - unlike the recent SJG garbage, there is some thought to go with the fun flavor in this one. Not sure I'll ever play again, though.

RATING: 7
This game really deserves two ratings: a 9 for humor/style and a 5 for play.  Draw the right chits for the best weapons (e.g. Fire Extinguisher) and the Crew can mop up; draw the wrong ones and they are helpless before the Green Things.  This random factor limits the game as a game, but the humor still makes it well worth it.

A fantastic Wham game that should be a staple of every collection. A little unbalanced in favour of the Awful Green Things, in my experience, but after so many years since first publication, there are a lot of homebrew rules that work nicely.

But with far better components - 'tis a classic worthy of a second purchase!

This game is good for some laughs.  Not knowing how your weapon will function (or IF its even a weapon) against the aliens always dictates situations that bring out some chuckles...and cussing.

RATING: 6
Fun, but fiddly.  Though the board isn't quite as cramped as Red November, it feels tight quickly as all the chits begin to stack and you need to sort through them to figure out your attacks.
Outcome of the game seems to depend heavily on weapon effects that are drawn relatively early.  In our game, 4 of the 5 weapons drawn resulted in heavy damage to the aliens and they never stood a chance.  Will have to see how further plays go.

Fun fun fun - and totally silly. This is Monty Python in space. The game is frequently unbalanced and the outcome nearly always rests to a large extent on the luck of the draw. But who cares - if you don't laugh yourself stupid every time you play, there's something wrong with you. A classic, and should be in everyone's collection. This one gets an "8" for gameplay from me and an extra "1" for the wonderfully silly and atmospheric character artwork. Forget "Alien special edition" - this deserves to be made into a film in its own right.

This is one of those games (like [gameid=380]) which I find really [i]neat[/i], but which I rarely want to actually [i]play[/i]. Perhaps because 2-player games don't tend to hit the table as often among my play-groups, perhaps because we lean a touch more towards euros than ameritrash. Regardless, I'm immensely pleased this game exists - it's wonderfully thematic, and the most bizarrely entertaining things can happen.

Sentimental favorite - I had the first version where the map was on the wraparound box cover, as well as the SJG "video box" version. Utterly wacky, as so much depends upon what sort of effect the area weapons have (esp the fire extinquisher), but extremely evocative of the theme.

I love this wacky game.  The rules are simple and the random nature of weapons effects is brilliant.  This is a nail-biter in which the more experienced gamer should play the somewhat disadvantaged crew.  Your wrist may get sore from all the dice rolling, but you will definitely have fun.  The components are nothing to write home about in the SJ version, but what do you want for $10-15?

Good, light hearted, and fun alien vs crew action. This is a game that certainly accomplished what it set out to. Not knowing just what effect each weapon will have until you try to use it is pretty neat. You'll get to see the crew player cringe because his area effect weapon caused more fragments to appear instead of doing damage.

The 8th (2011) edition is very nice, with a mounted mapboard, some nice thick glossy counters, plus expansion materials if you want to play with the variants.

Probably something I would have enjoyed more as a kid, but I probably wouldn't refuse a game of this if offered. Easy enough to play solo, too. I also think it's the sort of game that's more fun to "just play" and not hyper analyze as a wargame. Just enjoy yourself, drink a beer, and roll some dice man.

I have the reprint of this game, however, I learned to enjoy it because my dad had the original copy while I was growing up. 

I've learned to really like this game, though sometimes the upkeep phase can get a bit tedious in the late game, if the Green Things are winning.

But it's definitely awful random, and it can be played with a subsantial amount of beer in one's stomach.

Very fun popcorn kind of game, essentially a 2-player wargame in disguise.  8th edition components are very nice - large thick counters, and a mounted board.  The optional rules for moving outside the Znutar are not recommended - way too fiddly and it removes the focus of the game from discovering the best weapons and degenerates into everybody jumping off into space.  But the best thing about this game is that every time you play it, it tells a silly story.  Million-to-one odds, and fear the Comm Beamer, baby!

The concept of the game is appealing, but the gameplay just isn't engaging for me. It takes some time to properly set up the crew (quite a lot of tiny tokens and contraints on where they can be put) and the green things are just to strong! Maybe the crew should have some more hefty wapens... I like the idea that the effect of the weapons is not know before you shoot at an awful green E.T.

Always a fun game.  One of the few Science Fiction games I enjoy.  The humor in the game is not driven by the cutesy drawings or any conventional joke (which would have gone stale 28 years ago), but rather by utter chaos.  As such, it is always the same and always different. In order to accomodate the 8.0 rating this game deserves, I hereby resolve to recommend this more often.

I remember reading about this game when I was a kid back in the 80's in Games magazine. It made the Games 100 and I just thought it sounded really cool.
I don't know how I lucked out in getting a new copy of this game, I got it only a few years ago (I think on ebay) and my understanding is that it's out of print now. I'll never sell it as it has a lot of sentimental value. I've played it with my 10 year-old son a few times and we have a blast with it. Personally I prefer real components to paper maps and counters (I wish the map was a bit larger because there are a lot of counters stacked up, especially when the green things get blown to fragments). The random weapons effect really is the heart of the game and I'm sure that's what made this game unique back in the day.

Humorous light dudes on a map game.  Unfortunate crew picks up an alien monster egg which hatches and spreads across the ship before a battle for survival between crew and green things begins.  Lots of randomness here, but played with a wink and nod, it's ok.

Green aliens have invaded the spaceship Znutar.  Your multi-species crew move from room to room fighting the critters, searching for weapons and seeing what effect your weapons have on the aliens.  Sometimes the weapons make them grow or split in two and that makes it worse!

Awesome 2 player game for either side. It's a bit fiddly and the map on the game board should be bigger, but this game is just so much fun. The theme is perfect and the game play has lots of flavor. Not knowing what the weapons do and having to test them is great. Some funny things can happen. Love it!!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Just a pure fun and chaotic game of aliens vs. humans. The aliens have infested the ship and the humans are trying to escape. There's lots of crazy weapons and a lot of goofey things, that can happen in this game. All of which provide a very good time, with a lot of laughs along the way.

The components are a bit sub par and the game is a bit fiddly, especially with the older version, with the smaller game board, but it's still a hoot to play.

Silly, silly fun.  There's no deep strategy to be had here.   However, if you like the idea of throwing a flaming barrel of rocket fuel down a corridor and hoping against hope that it doesn't just splurt the green blobbies into more rapidly-growing bits, this is a game for you.  Great fun, although I wouldn't want to play it weekly.  Thankfully, the rules are simple enough that I can easily take it off the shelf and enjoy when the fancy strikes.

An old school game with a great theme, though maybe a little unbalanced; it's tough for crew to win unless they get lucky with the weapon effect chits. It's also a little wonky in that the crew players has a somewhat more involved/interesting game than the alien player. Still, it's good fun.

A fun game with a fairly light and campy feel.  The game has surprising depth and re-playability.  Crappy components on the "production" in *some old editions* were so bad I did not buy it and just used the copy I got out of "The Dragon" magazine as it was just as good.

8th edition's quality is however fantastic and at a great price!  Very nice thick mounted counters and fair-sized map board in a nice small box!

Great game to get "non-gamers" into the action IMO.  Great for running at conventions!

I have the "first" Steve Jackson games edition in the VHS box.  Might buy the new version as a Tom Wham fan and completist.  

I give this quintessential beer and pretzels game a 7 because it's by Tom Wham, one of my favorite illustrators/designers.  

An "old-school" two-player asymmetrical game where one player represents the exponentially spawning Awful Green aliens, and the other player represents the crew of the starship Znutar.  I say "old-school" because it's got tons and tons of counters and D6, the rules are fiddlier than what one expects in Eurogames of today, it's very chaotic and random and reliant on luck, and the game takes a while to play.  But it's a blast IMHO.  

The crew attempts to defeat the alien invasion and/or escape if things get too grim.  They equip themselves with weapons that have different random effects on the aliens with each new game played - some deadly, other effects useless.  The aliens are stronger, more plentiful in number, and grow in four stages each turn.   Ideally two games should be played to give each player a taste of both the alien- and spacecrew-sides.  Humorous and playful, with some strategy and more luck.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I own the TSR edition from 1981, great nostalgia that I would love to see remade.  It's like Space Hulk with a sense of humor.  Plus I like anything by Tom Wham.

Of all the silly little games of my childhood, this one probably holds up best.  Still very playable and fun, even after all these years.  Well balanced, although very much influenced by luck: for example, an effective fire-extinguisher result pretty much clinches it for the crew.

Has the potential to be a very funny yet competitive game, but a lot of the enjoyment is dependent upon how well the players can both get into the theme while also treating the game as a (simple) wargame.  My experience is that there a fewer and fewer people that fit this bill.

Really on the fence about this one.  I wish it was shorter and I wish it was a bit more balanced, but that would take out some of the chaos which is admittedly the fun part.  Desperately want to love it but I'm not sure it'll see much table time.

Good theme though and quality components.

I've now added the Orange and Purple things to my game.  It does add some good replay value to this one.

UPDATE:

I've come to really enjoy this game.  It's light, goofy, tells a good story and serves as an interesting introduction to wargaming.  Not a war-game, but it's the right game to get the conversation going.

You've never really been up the creek without a paddle until you've blasted a room full of AGTs with an area weapon and drawn the "1 Die Fragments" chit. Unpredictable and a hoot to play, with a lot of strategy packed into the box. Particularly fun with kids, and a great introduction to wargaming.

Would rate it an 8, except for the incredibly chintzy components (2003 edition) that can actually affect play if you breathe too hard.

I have a soft spot for this old TSR game that faithfully re-creates old sci-fi monster on the loose in a space ship movie... reminiscent of a cartoony version of Ridley Scott's Alien.  Pretty simple fare, that uses classic war-game chit counters and battle methodology.  Rudimentary compared to modern games, but still fun to play.

Fun cartoony art by old D&D artist Tom Wham.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
Fun and silly wargame.  The crew quickly finds effective weapons, while the monsters quickly breed.  The result is usually a race in which one side is thoroughly squished.  A couple caveats: The crew can simply be toast if none of the area weapons are useful.  And watch out for a powerful electric fence, which can result in a painful stalemate.

Fantastic game, with great art if you get an original Dragon Magazine copy with all Tom Wham artwork in it.  Can be fiddly in that counter stacks are packed into tight spaces (enlarging the board by 200% would fix that), and can go on for a little too long some times.  Still, the rest of the experience is so good, I give it a high rating.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As with [I]Snit's Revenge[/I], funny theme and artwork.  Good game mechanics, still simple enough to play with some kids.  Because each weapon has different capabilities in different games, play-balance varies wildly from playing to playing.  But if you can see this as humor, it's part of the entertainment value of the game, and the tactics of learning as fast as possible which weapons are effective can be interesting.  

(We enjoyed the playing where trying to blow them up with a drum of rocket fuel only made them multiply, but we quickly killed them all when we learned to stab them with pool-cues.)

I played this when it was published in the Dragon magazine.  I was glad to see it republished, even if the SJG components are a little lower quality than the magazine game.  I probably enjoy this game more than I should on objective criteria, i.e. it is heavily dependant on luck and offers relatively limited strategies.  The theme and humorous artwork carry the day somehow.  It's a game that hits the spot now and again, but doesn't hold up to heavy amounts of play.

RATING: 6
A surprisingly deep strategy game for two players. It's a lot of fun, but it can be difficult to keep track of everything that happens each turn. A lot of this is probably due to the chit-like game pieces. I would gladly have paid more for the higher quality components a game like this deserves. The comic-book feel suits the game very nicely though and adds the Steve Jackson charm to the game.

Played first game as The Green Things and lost to girlfriend. Fun game! Even had the luck of having an electric fence that Grew my monsters placed in the room right next to a stack of my monsters :) Even better, these monsters were attacked by a new weapon and got shred into 9 fragments. Next turn I grew them and moved them into the fence, creating 9 adults in one turn, albeit all in the same room. An easy target for the crew to pick at a distance with weapons that affected all the monsters (2 fire extinguishers and a comm beam with 3 and 4 dice to kill), ouch! My stack of monsters was almost completely vaporized. The monsters were neutralized the turn after this one.

RATING: 9
This is, for me, the epitome of the light wargame.  It's short, sweet, small, and has just enough wiggle room for both players to approach the game with different strategies time after time.  It is random, and the roll of a die or draw of a chit can swing things irretrievably toward one sideor the other, but it's a heck of a lot of fun nontheless.  One of my all-time favorites.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Zany. Crew members have to run around and try to kill off the Green Things before they multiply. Problem is no one knows what the various weapons will do until you use them. Will that baseball bat squash that green slime flat or break it into six, living, pieces? Draw a chit to find out!

The game seems not really balanced and fair and it can take hours to play a game (if you want to). The reason for the 10: whacky, twisted game with even a little strategy. I love the artwork, the idea and the theme: it's easy to understand and really fun to play and that's the biggest reason to play games for me! You can even cut the game short and still have a fun game!

Same comment as the english 7th edition, though this edition has better components: a 10!

Edit: adjusted my rating: I really have fun playing this game, but you really need the time (and I recently discovered that the time-aspect is important to me and especially my opponents: if a game takes too long, they burn out...). I am still a fan of this game: I love the theme, the art and the chaos and fun.

New in collection jan. 08 Bought from Lajos.

Despite the fiddly continuous counterswapping this is fun for the right occasion. If you're into 60's SF B-movies, that is. This is probably THE game to play after a long night of SF movies and beer.

NL: 2-persoonsspel. 1 speelt de crew van een ruimteschip, de ander de vreselijke groene dingen. De groene dingen zien de crew uiteraard als voer. De crew heeft een berg wapens, maar de uitwerking op de aliens is pas bekend als je het hebt geprobeerd, en kan nadelig zijn. De beroerdste is dat het monster uiteenspat in kleine stukjes die allemaal blijven leven...

Beetje goedkoop uitgevoerd, maar wel grappig. Thematisch erg sterk.

Good value for $21 CAD.  Mounted mapboard, 150+ thick, die cut counters, 5 green dice and a colour rules book.

If SJG would put out an edition of Ogre/GEV (not the super-duper deluxe set with supersized maps and counters) with comparable production values, I'd be happy.

RATING: 7.75
Despite the enjoyable theme, this game suffers from the whim of randomness - even moreso than the diceyness seen in other games of this vintage; the random weapon effects can collapse the most well-played strategy.  It is what it is: a fun, light overly-random themey game from the 1970's that plays in under an hour.

Not as bad as I expected, but still pretty random and chaotic.

The theme is funny and it does become a bit of a dicefest, but it's not a horrible game.  The biggest problem, though, is that the outcome of the game is essentially decided by the random effects of the weapons and a few rolls of the dice.  If certain weapons make the green things stronger, the crew is doomed.  If the right weapons turn out to be 5 dice to kill, the green things are history.  That's a funny concept, but not the best game.  Still, I'll probably be willing to play this one once a year or so.

I really liked the theme, but my wife and I tried to play and the map was too small for all the little cardboard guys to fit in one room.  Talk about aggravating.

RATING: 7
A quirky dice fest with some cool concepts that keeps gameplay interesting and replayable.  I like how thw Awful Green Things grow each turn, the randomized weapons damage, and the two different endgames.  The optional rules are really an expansion of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A very elementary war game with a quirky theme. I don't dislike it, but it does feel a bit uninspired by today's standards. Playing as the Awful Green Things is much more fun than the other aliens, and I really like how each weapon is going to have a different effect from game to game. That being said, it's a very simplistic game of moving around the board, getting what you need, and attacking when you can. It has a great theme, and I think this would be a great game to bring out for kids to understand the basic fundamentals of games in this genre, but for me it wasn't that special, mechanically-speaking.

RATING: 6
Quite an amusing little game.  The atmosphere is well done, but there is little or no skill aspect.  Works best when you have 30 minutes to kill at 3 a.m. after you and your opponent have downed 20 pints of beer.

I got this game way back in high school, and have been a Tom Wham fan ever since.  I always have new players play the monsters; I take the crew and show how to try out the weapons so you dont screw yourself (eg, never shoot an unknown area weapon into a full room of green things...).

I played this game about a dozen times when it first came out.  At the time, I'd never played anything like it.  I just played it again last year, and the game has lost none of its enjoyment.  That says a lot right there.  I like how it captures the race against time, the "you've got to try it to see what it will do" and tactics of containment.  I wish someone would come along and give it some nice production value.

{My rating is for the 2011, 8th edition} Purchased the 2011 (8th) edition in July of 2011. A mounted board and thick, coated cardboard chits really do help to make this a more enjoyable game to play--an idea probably long overdue. I do find the extended ending fiddly and confusing, and for my money, better to simply skip. Got 1990 edition in trade, November 2008. My 10-year-old son (April 2009) Trevor rated it a 10 (10-27-09). Traded, December 2014.

Fun theme, but not a real fast game as there are lots of counters to consider, move around and attack with each turn. Cheap components, a lengthy setup and a dice fest to boot.

I can take it or leave it.

I have the original TSR version of this game from way back.  I play with my son occasionally.  The green things usually win, but that is how the game is setup.  Something about this game has alway made me like it.  AS a kid, I even had an Awful-Green-Things-themed birthday party, with a cake like the saucer from the Znutar, and we played pin-the-eye on the green thing and Mom made green thing bean bags and we played toss the green thing into the de-contamination barrel for points, etc.  Cool mom!

RATING: 5
I have pleasent memories of this game despite the low score. A fun 2 player game, where the weapons have different effects on the "green things". Will it destroy them or make them grow? Very nice idea. Problem is the randomess of draws! If you keep attacking and you get unlucky the monsters keep growing. By the time you get the right weapon the green things, have turned brown in your pants. So ultimately one player has fun the other gets beat down. On top of that the ship is quite big so moving all creatures is quite plodding. Even though I had the most recent version, the game board had a crease in it and fitting the pieces in the ship during a big attack meant alot of overlap.

Didn't make the cut as there were too many negatives. Shame as had so much potential.

The best thing about this game is Tom Wham's quirky sense of humor, primarily depicted by his artwork. The game itself is a lot of fun, but it feels heavily biased towards the Awful Green Things. Making a custom board is highly recommended because the paper board is folded, and is difficult to keep flat.

RATING: 5
A very fun and funny game. The board is solid and the counters are heavy enough to stay where you put them. For a light game, there seems to be a lot of record keeping. Green things start as  fragments and grow to babies, young things and adults. Adults lay eggs and, when they are blown apart, create new fragments that grow into more green things. It is a little hard to understand the use of the robots and the escape pods. I think that, in a silly game like this, a lot is left up to the players.

A guilty pleasure.  This game takes a while to set up, you can tell who is going to win as soon as you have tested the fire extinguisher and the comm beamer.  Despite that, I still enjoy playing this silly game once in a while.  For the crew to win they NEED a powerful area weapon, but if they get a 4 dice to kill Comm Beamer the green things are toast.  Some sort of house rule that assures that a medium power result occurs for these two weapons would likely go a long way to making more ballanced games.

Straightforward game. Try to set up situations where you get enough dice to destroy your enemies. The epilogue is kind of a ridiculous dicefest, but I'm ok with that since I think the crew should be discouraged from bailing on the ship as much as possible. Board is way too small.

The quality of the components of this game (or at least the Steve Jackson Games version) make my head hurt. Very poor quality for the price. When I was younger, 6th or 7th grade, I would have probably really liked it…now, it’s just not for me.

RATING: 7
Very silly fun random science fiction game! Not to be taken very seriously: the random luck of the draw for weapon effects has a huge influence. But for a fun romp, I enjoy it. If you like Tom Wham's whimsical art and game design style, this is one of his classics.

I owned and enjoyed one of the early TSR original editions in the early 1980s, so I reaquired Awful Green Things in a burst of nostalgia in a math trade (in May 2017). The 2011 SJG edition is nicely done, and has good clearly carefully written SJG-style rules.

A pleasant surprise. Fast and fun system made above average (for a game of this type) by the random weapon effect mechanic. You don't know what a pool stick (for instance) can do to the green goo until you take a swing, which increases the tactical playability.

I'm always on the look-out for two player games for me and my husband - we've played this one a couple of times but it always just seems needlessly complicated and has all these cardboard bits I don't want to deal with. There are usually other 2 player games I'd rather play.

RATING: 6
This is one of those games that is fun even though it shouldn&#039;t be. The green things nearly always win, but playing the crew is still fun. This is probably because of the unique system of determining the effects of the various &quot;weapons&quot; as you go. Lighthearted fun!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A classic from my salad days. Romp through the spaceship as the aliens or fight a desperate battle against them as the ship's crew. Harder to play if you're on the crew side; just remember not to try out area effect weapons on large groups of Green Things. There's a lot of luck involved but the game is still quite entertaining.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A fun little wargame in which the effect of weapons is initially unknown. Despite being fairly light and very lucky, it's got a lot of fiddly bits and may turn off the casual punter with its set-up time and chit-wrangling. Great artwork and flavour, and the best rulebook of any SJG game.

To improve set-up time, I suggest you use a pie rule. One player sets up (perhaps while the other player is obtaining beer), and the other player chooses a side (perhaps on his or her return from the bottle-o).

I'd really love to see a deluxe version of this game with a hardmounted board and minis (or blocks or plastic tokens) instead of chits. Failing that, I'm tempted to get a thrift store Scrabble set and mount the counters onto the tiles.

Snit's Revenge (by the same designer) is back in print now, and I think it does all the same things better.

Chaotic.  Played once so far, got crushed as the crew, but had a lot of fun and laughed a lot.

traded as sweetener for Liberte

I'm not sure about this. In the game I played my opponent activated self destruct on turn 1, which he told me was his best move. If that's true I couldn't picture wanting to play this much more, but for now I'd play it more to find out. The theme is REALLY fun, the way you determine what weapons do is fun, the epilouge could use a ton of refinement though.

10 plays. Fun game, if not taken seriously. Components are, in my experience, typical of the lousy quality found with Steve Jackson Games. The map-board is flimsy paper and way too small. Despite that, I liked it enough originally to make a blown-up and laminated map, and glued the thin counters to wood blocks. This improved the playability, and our enjoyment of the game.

Most recent play in mid 2004 at the lake with Garrett.

I owned the TSR big box version of this game back in the early 80s and used to play it solitaire. The green things won every time except once, which got frustrating so I sold it.

Anyway, the game is silly fun that adds a bit of humor to my game cabinet, even if it's not really worth playing anymore.

I may eventually pick up another copy of this.  I love Tom Wham's art, and the game its self is fun. 

What it comes down to, though, is whether or not the crew can get an area effect weapon that works well against the Green Things.  If they can't, they are better off (as far as their score is concerned) immediately abandoning the Zunitar and getting all their points from the epilouge.

Bumped this up after playing it again for the first time since oh 1980.  This was a lot of fun, and fun for a new-to-wargaming friend.  Simple rules, moderately quick play, and cool art!  The artwork and the fun random weapon effects, as well as the feeling of unrelenting pressure as the game progresses makes this an excellent game to bring out occasionally.

Stacks of chits crowded on too-small spaces. Games over almost before they started because the crew can't draw a useful weapon effect token. There's fun to be had, but there are way too many great two player games out there that deserve my attention.

Given this game's age and where it came from, I think it is a bit unfair to judge it by modern standards. Yes, it has some flaws, but the fact that it keeps getting reprinted must say something. The game can sometimes end quickly if the crew player does not get a good chit for an area effect weapon, but it is as much fun to play regardless of the outcome. Tom Wham, I take my hat off to you for this little gem.

Bought off eBay in the TSR longbox, I was surprised all the chits were present.  I had played this in college and then not again until 2004.  I still think the AGT's have an enormous advantage - but maybe that's because I end up drawing all the "no effect" chits first when I'm the crewmembers.

You don't know what the weapon does until you try it, every game.  Dice luck: starting AGT, fights, weapons. 

Playing as the green things felt frustrating.  Individually you're weaker, and slower, and so far we can't multiply fast enough to keep up with, much less pass, the good guys.

I haven't played this game in like 26 years...and when I saw it at the store, I just had to get it.  It still had the same charm & intrigue when I was a wee lad, but UGH!  The cheapness of the playing field (hills & valleys major problems) and tininess of the chits made the experience fairly dreadful.

Should not be fun because the green things are always going to win.  But Tom Wham art, plus the whimsy of throwing Zgwortz rations at the green things, wins out.  

Saved by the fact that the crew can escape the ship and maybe make it home alive.

Still one of my all time favorite games.
The later releases have been bad because they ditched the Tom Wham artwork and made some kind of almost-but-not-exactly Tom Wham art that just looked bad and made me more protective of my copy.

I found this in a FLGS and with its small size, all contained in a plastic box, plus I was going camping that weekend. It was perfect, a fun, silly and easy game, my GF [wife], liked it too. So did our other friends who went camping as well. About 25 years later, my 13 year old son found the game, looked at it and asked to play a game. He liked it too. That Christmas I bought him the larger newest edition with the mounted board and thicker counters. This game is fun out of a box. 

June 30th, 2016 I've increased my rating for this game as I find it even more fun now than in the past. I do play my son this game fairly frequently and I always enjoy playing and look forward to playing again in the future with him.

UPDATE: Picked up the new (8th) edition, mostly for nostalgia's sake. And it's very nicely produced. Munchkin dice are annoying, but pretty easy to ignore. Played it with my daughter and had some fun. Not a good game, exactly, but great atmosphere and color.

Well, what a fun theme, but...just a pretty random exercise, with crappy components to boot.  I still like to play on occasion, but it's deficient in many areas. Plastic minis would not only be fun, but would improve playability, and adding a coherent single-sheet reference chart seems like a no-brainer.

RATING: 5
An evolution of Tom Wham's design work on Snits' Revenge, Awful Green Things is a silly but fun game about fighting off an alien invasion. The only detractors are the occasional intrusion of complexity (there are a lot of creatures roaming the board and many numbers and effects to track) and that the game seems to drag on for a bit longer than it should.

It is a nice strategic game with a fair bit of chaos (the effects of each weapon are randomized each game...but that's part of the fun) and a silly sense of humor. If only it played in about half the time, I think it would be a more enjoyable affair.

A game my memories hold more fondly than actual game play bears out.  (I bet the same would hold true for Snit's Revenge as well.)

Unless the crew gets really lucky on damage chit draw, this game is terribly unbalanced towards the Things. 

A silly, beer-and-pretzels, light wargame.

RATING: 7
This is a simple game, but a lot of fun.  It's got a nice theme, whimsical artwork, and some interesting mechanics.

The best thing about it is that since these are weird alien green things, you don't know what effect different weapons will have on them until you try using them.  A weapon might actually be beneficial to the green things.  And since the effects are random from game to game (but consistent within each game), you never know exactly which strategy will work best on them at the beginning of the game, adding to the replay value.

This is the first game that I bought with my own money, many years ago.  I loved it, and was soon playing more and more of these games that I now refer to as "BGG-style games."

RATING: N/A
This humorously entertaining game pits two players against each other aboard a spaceship. One plays the ship's crew, trying to kill the evil and rapidly-multiplying aliens controlled by his opponent. And although the crewmembers have several weapons available to them, they don't know what effect those weapons will have until they try using them in combat against the Awful Green Things.

As loopy as it sounds, this game changed my perception of reality.

In the early 1980s, when I was a kid, I walked into a hobby store and saw [i]Awful Green Things[/i] displayed on the shelf.  I didn't have enough money to buy it, but that was beside the point.  What mattered was that it existed at all.  It was colorful, goofy, kid-friendly, and (I was convinced) utterly fantastic.

What I learned that day, thirty years ago, is that my reality contained non-mainstream products that aligned 100% with my sense of humor and irreverent worldview - products that were aimed at entertaining their designers (mostly) as well as the few people in the world who happened to appreciate their work.  To me, that's just neat.

Funnily enough, I wouldn't know whether [i]Awful Green Things[/i] was any good until decades later.  I stumbled across the "digitally remastered" VHS version in 2002 (twenty years after my original encounter), at which point I was delighted to shell out the money and finally own the game - though I never bothered to actually learn and play [i]AGT[/i] until just two days ago (in 2012).

Did the game live up to my childhood dreams? Well, no.  But do I cherish everything that the game represented?  Yes, of course.

From a standpoint of a biased critic, the game is silly fun, and my kids find endless joy in crushing my spirited crew members with their alien hordes.  If the alien side plays conservatively and ensures growth every round, though, I'm not convinced that the crew members can win.  But it's a good time regardless.  And I will always enjoy slaughtering an entire passageway of monsters with a 5 DICE TO KILL fuel barrel.  Or, better yet, the barrel accidentally causes the passageway aliens to GROW, sealing the fate of my crew members forever.

The funnier choice is always the better choice.

A dice-dependent tactical game with items of varied seriousness (yet all believable, for such a situation) for the protagonists, and interesting proliferation and growth decisions for the antagonists, this game's art and character really add to the experience.  If you happen to own the plastic travel case version of the game, then it is a very portable diversion that should play enough differently each time to keep it fresh.  I first found this game in the 1980s, and I even now get the craving (I feel it at this very second!) to play this game on occasion!

Dice-based combat resolution bothers me a lot less when the whole game is kind of crazy:  Not knowing what effect an item will have until you use it really sets the tone of the game, and the dice are right at home in this classic.

Old skool gameplay, and a board that gets cluttered to high heaven as you try to cram stacks upon stacks of fiddly counters into small rooms.

The theme is sillier than the gameplay implies.

Although random, some seemingly useless weapons can become very powerful indeed when combined. Fer instance Fragmenting a load of AGT's into even more smaller AGT's and then blasting them to high heaven with one shot of a weapon that effects every AGT in a particular section.

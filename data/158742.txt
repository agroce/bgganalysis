I've come to associate Kickstarter games with underdeveloped mediocrity.  This was a fine exception.  Simple rules, not an apparently terrific amount of control or skill, but it rolls by and I found it sufficiently enjoyable to go straight into a second play.  Dig the minimalist production too.  Pretty well done!

RATING: 6
Traded. Underrated gem. It has everything that needs to be a good micro game. Caboose expansion is almost necessity for it to work though. I think people are disappointed due to high expectations prior to play the game. If you accept what this is and what this isn't, the game really shines in such a niche situation.

Overall, the base game seems to be more of an activity than anything else. With the huge amount of luck, obvious decisions, and often no decision to make... the game really plays itself. This card-drafting game makes sushi go feel/look heavy in comparison. There just isn't much here.

The game plays very quick... but I rather just chat for 5-10 minutes instead. Shame, because the components/aesthetics of the game are well done.

I enjoyed this light filler drafting game. I liked alternating playing this and Sushi Go! Both games give me a sense of a quick fun filler with the drafting mechanic. However,for some reason, it was really hard for me to get this one to the table so I ended up trading it away. Maybe I will pick it up again with the new artwork...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
So short and light that it barely qualifies as a game. Decisions are obvious, and the winner is largely determined by lucky draws. Nevertheless, you do have to think about not handing your opponent useful cards, and the game lasts only five minutes, so as a portable filler it works fine. It's just way too light for me.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The game boils down to UNO, where everyone has their own stack rather than a central discard stack, and the contents of your personal stack end up scoring you points.  If the final card on my train is a green 4, my next card either has to be green or 4, or I have to place a crappy wild card at the end of my train that's not worth many points.

The only part that makes this a bit of a game is that you get to pick a card from a hand of three, passing the remaining two to the next player.  They will then draw that hand back up to three, pick one, and pass the remaining two, and so on.  So, you'll be both looking for a card that's playable on your train, while also trying to keep none of the cards playable for the next player.

The problem is that most of the time, it just boils down to whether or not there's even a playable card for you.  Half the time, there isn't, so you just play one of the cards as a crappy wild that hurts the other players the most.

I could be talked into playing on occasion since the game is so quick, but overall, I don't see much of a game here.

Light drafting game where players take turns to draw a card, add it to their mini-hand, then play one card to extend their train.  After a few rounds, sum the cargo, with a bonus going to the longest run of a colour.  Incredibly fluffy, nice production, but ultimately quite dull.  Very fast, but of course the "Express" is a big hint here.  Not as interactive as Sushi Go, where everyone plays at the same time, and not as much fun as Spacebars, where the hand is passed around the table.  Not a keeper.

Hihetetlen kivitelezés, én ilyen jó minőségű alkatrészeket még nem láttam. 
A játék maga tényleg kb. 10 perc. Célkártya nélkül nincs sok benne, az eredeti szabályban lévő egy célkártyával már valamivel jobb. Mi inkább mindenkinek adtunk egy titkosat és kitettünk egy közöset is. Így már valamivel érdekesebb volt a játék, bár a kártyadraftolás szerintem túlzottan megköti a kezünket. Egy kicsivel több döntést igényelnék én, még egy ilyen microjátéktól is.

The most important thing to me is that I understand fully what I'm doing with just the briefest of explanations. I certainly have no problem with playing this again. Oct 2014

Those of you who went to GeekWay this year received this game as a door prize. We dug it out and gave it a six player go. A single hand is dealt, the start player takes it and draws a new card and adds it. Then selects a card and plays it onto their tree. The hand is passed and the next player does the same. Once everyone has played six times the game is over and the person with the best tree house wins.

* Kickstarted! *

Quick but challenging card game in which you draw one, pick one, and then pass the hand to the next player until the requisite number of rounds are done. The game ends up balanced because of the limit, since there are multiple ways to even up the score. Good for a light introduction, quick middle, or end of the night quickie.

PLUS: quick, easy to learn, evenly balanced scoring, good balance between luck and strategy
MINUS: doesn't encourage more than a few games in one play

Claims the title of quickest drafting game ever. Draft a few cards (six in our four player game if I remember correctly) from the same hand that gets replenished with a single card for each draft, count the value of the cards, score additional points for special conditions, finish after 5-10 minutes. Eye-catching artwork in a game reduced one degree too much.

RATING: 6
A light Crazy Eights-style drafting game (a new card must match the prior card in color and/or number) where the goal is to have the highest-value train by numbers on the cards and/or the longest color run. A quirk relative to other drafting games is that it's a single hand being passed around sequentially and continuously replenished rather than multiple shrinking hands passed simultaneously. The replenishment is a virtual necessity given the Crazy Eights mechanic; diminishing hands would quickly make it impossible to do standard connections. The single hand isn't necessary mechanically, but is a needed constraint given the microgame-ish component levels (there just aren't enough cards to be dealing out full hands to everyone in large games).

As it is, the single hand is slower than is necessary for a drafting game, but (1) it's still a fast game and (2) it's enough time to grab a bite of pizza and wipe your hands between turns. Not bad at all for a filler.

A solid 8 rating.  Possibly higher.  This game falls into the same category as Love Letter in game length and playtime.  In my opinion the only reason it's not as popular as Love Letter is it offers a more in the way of strategy and and interaction.  Love Letter is almost a brainless game.  Don't get me wrong, it's a lot of fun and the speed it plays is what mitigates it's other shortcomings.  Yardmaster express is to gamers what Love Letter is to non-gamers.  A short, fun game with a few more meaningful mechanics thrown in.

This game is almost too much of a mini-game to me. At the time this game was released, mini-games were (and possibly still are) huge. Everyone wants to make the next big, tiny game. The problem is that this game tries to shorten a game that is already a mini-game: Yardmaster. There's just not enough here for me to enjoy it.

I've had the joy of playing David's various prototype iterations during its development.  Such a great little game - thrilled to see it hitting Kickstarter and even though I now have my own PnP, I'm really looking forward to having the real deal.  Great decisions, super easy to teach and jump in to for new players, plays quickly (usually works best to play a few full rounds), and very approachable theme make this a great little card game for just about anyone.  This will certainly be one of my go-to games to give as a gift and I could easily recommend this to gamers and non-gamers alike.

Ultra-Light quick card 'game'.  Must be played with Caboose expansion, recommend 3+players (but only use purple for 4+), and use Sushi Go draft rules (hand out the total number of cards per player, everyone simultaneously play one and hand off the remainder of the packet to the next player).  

Playing by the included standard rules is almost not a game at all (no decisions, autoplay).  Good for very young children though.

Extremely simple game that basically helps you learn colors and how to tell what numbers. Sadly, I'm afraid the game wasn't meant to be a kids game, and as the filler it is advertised to be it fails miserably, leaving practically no choices whatsoever, and certainly no interesting choices in a player's turn.

I really was hoping to like it as I like the theme, but this is just dominoes with pretty pictures, with you only being allowed to lay 6 tiles.

I picked these up as part of an ACT group ten pack pledge for ten Australian dollars (including postage). I was expecting little beyond a fun little filler that would work for my lunchtime gaming group.

Alas, the base game itself is a little too simplistic. It does, however, work pretty well for the Little Fish and is one that keeps their attention as they both like trains.

The Yardmaster Express: Caboose Expansion is, however, a rather good expansion which makes the game a reasonable ten minute diversion for adults. In all honesty I would not play the base game without the expansion with anyone over, say, eight or nine years old.

All-in-all, not a bad buy. Not a world beater but a reasonable little filler that should see a bit of use over the next few years

Very simple intro to drafting games. Far too simple if played as the designer intended. I deal out all the cards and draft properly; which also has the advantage of simultaneous play. I also use two objectives which creates a bit of strategy. 

With out-of-the-box rules it works well as a game for very young children. With house rules it is a nice light, super-fast filler.

I have the Vincent Dutrait illustrated version from Iello which adds at least 2 points to the rating. Beautiful.

The rule that you play with only one hand, that gets passed on to each player each turn, dictates that luck rules the roost, with no hand management that might have provided a source of interest. The only decision - what to play, what to pass on - is too straightforward. At least the time length of 5 to 10 minutes is appropriate, but even in games of that length, I'd prefer something of more interest or with cheer/groan factor to get the game night starting or ending with some fun. The cabooses expansion is a must-play as it at least provides one element that might boost the decision making.

For what this, a very light drafting game, it is a lot of fun. It is quick and fairly simple but the decisions are meaningful enough to make it interesting. Adding in the caboose expansion adds quite a bit to it as well. This is perfect when you have 10 - 20 minutes to kill and want to get a few games in.

RATING: 5
Yardmaster Express is a closed-draft card game in which players are trying to add train car cards with certain colors and numbers to the end of their train.  Instead of everyone having a hand of cards that all get passed around the table simultaneously, only one player has a hand of cards and all other players must wait for their turn.  Cards added to a train must match either the color or number on the previously-played card.  Players score for the numerical value on their cards, as well as bonus points for having the most in a row of the same color, and meeting the scoring condition of the caboose bonus card (if you're playing with that variant).  I didn't enjoy this one--there just weren't very many ways to try to score points, and it seems like a lot of the decision making came down to trying to screw over the next person down the line.  Also, making people wait their turn into a closed-draft game is not an innovation.

This was a real dud for us.  It plays quickly, but doesn't keep folks as involved in the action as, say, Sushi Go.  Also, this game is subject to an incredible amount of luck based on the card draw. Usually the choice of what to do is pretty obvious and the winner is simply the person that got the best draws.  The game is simply too short to mitigate this in any appreciable way.  Which would be fine, I suppose, if the game at least held my interest.

This plays faster than Yardmaster, because you just draft with a single hand of cards, and there is a little more game because each player gets their own goal they are going for. That being said, nobody was particularly impressed with this one either. I have the same questionable feelings about this. I don't know if I could even say which of the two I prefer more. I want to play both of these with my more heavy-euro group and see how they feel about them.

players draft cards to add train cars to their engine each turn.  To add a car, the cars you are joining must match in color or in number.  If they do not, you use a wild card for your current turn.  Quick matching/drafting game with only a few chances at strategy. Draw and draft luck is key.

Very fast, ultra-light-weight, rather luck-based game. Think Uno with theme and real tactical choice. Can play the basic game with kids age 7+, and there's enough here to hold adult attention for the 5-10 minutes the game takes.

While simpler that the full game, Express' to the point game play is far more desirable. It's quick. It's enjoyable. I miss understood the variant rules and I think I'm okay with that! Preferred play: each player starts with 1 card in hand, plays 1 card on his turn, draws, and passes 3 of the 4 cards to the next player. This gives you some control over your next play and sometimes requires a decision over what could benefit the next player. Also: play with cabooses!

Aka Yardmaster Express.  An ultra light drafting game.  Not deep at all, but that's not its purpose.  Made better by mixing multiple goal cards to make the drafting decisions a little bit more difficult.

Very, very random. Still, it's only a five minute time investment, so why not? Good as an opening filler when you're trying to burn up a few minutes.

Take cards from the player on your right. Draw a new card. Play a matching number or colour. Try and hit the target bonus condition just that bit better than your opponents by risking three or four values, or ignore the bonus altogether and try and build all in the same colour. It's fast. It has a lot of luck. Then it's over.

I pretty much immediatly described this game as gamer UNO. It is very lite, very quick, and very luck dependent. However, unlike UNO the game does offer a few choices (like go for bigger points or play a less valuable card to have a better chance of playing a caboose card). For me UNO has always been more of an activity than a game. It is something to do while enjoying the company of people, and this fits the same boat. Those looking for a deep game experience will not find it here. This could serve as a gateway to gateway games for those who are really unsure about this hobby, but it also makes for a great night ender when you still want to hang out with your gamer friends but not play much else.

It's a 5 minute drafting game that basically plays itself, yet seems better than most drafting games I've played. Oh and it's not a microgame - too many cards. 

The good things: 
- if you don't look at people in the face, at least make it short and simple. 
- good components. It's a good graphic design that's easy to discern across the table, is beautiful and made from a nice material. 

Bad thing: If you make a game this light, why not include interaction? Not a fan of making gamers type games supposedly acceptable for casual gamers. It's kinda boring. At a 5 minute MPS game that plays itself it competes with a hugely strong alternative which is: not playing anything, have a break, come back later. 

It is beautiful looking though - but should have been printed on beer coasters, then you'd definitely need to own. I guess my end evaluation is:  I will play it as a 5 minute break, instead of cigarettes (don't smoke), just because I always like to look at nice graphics and pictures. It's like picking an old comic I've read dozen of times. 
[i]The copy I've played with came with Caboose Expansion. It seems kinda necessery. [/i]

Rating down to 1.0 because: why does this exist? I could spend more productive 5 min looking at the ceiling.

This is a nice filler, but with 2 players is a bit too random so far...you can plan a bit, but you end up still being luck of the draw primarily.  Thinking this would be so different with 4 player as all cards would be new to you, so really have to think on the fly, but maybe more interesting.

Very brisk and simple game to teach to all the family.

Try without the Caboose bonuses to start, then ease them in after a couple of plays.

Great way to end or start a session.

Simple card game about playing train car cards into a row. At first I thought there would be some cool decisions but it actually feels rather flat and not nearly as clever as I'd thought it might be. My 9yo daughter wasn't much impressed by it either.

I just opened this game during our second blizzard in New England in one week. The kids and I were a bit stir crazy, so a new game was an excellent diversion. I had a great time playing the base game with no cabooses with my 4 and 6 year-old children. The 6 year-old can do the point addition at the end, and the 4 year-old understands how to lay down new cards and even some of the strategy. What an excellent addition to our family games, and as the kids get older, the caboose cards will keep it playable for years.

RATING: 6.5
A very simple game of building your own train by matching numbers or colors displayed on the cards. The real strategy comes into play as all players at the table share a single hand of cards. Each player starts by drawing a card (giving them 3 cards in hand), places 1 of those cards in their train, and then passes the remaining cards to the next player. Players should be mindful of the cards you are passing, you want to help yourself by placing beneficial cards in your own train, but you don't want to leave the next player with anything too great. The player with the most points after a predetermined number of rounds wins. I highly recommend that players use the Caboose Expansion (adds a variant scoring option). This game plays best with 3 or more players.

Yardmaster Express is a really simple light filler. You draw a card, play a card to your train and pass. Rinse and repeat until you have five or six cards in your train (can't remember which). Cards can only be played next to a matching color or number, although if you're stuck you can flip the card over and it's a wild match. You total the numbers in your train at the end. Oh and you start the game with a bonus goal which gives you some more points.

There's not a lot here, but then again it only takes maybe five minutes to play. For the length it's okay. I wouldn't really seek it out, but if I was killing time waiting for another game to finish, I'd play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Yardmaster Express is almost too simple. It does usually provide a couple of interesting decisions per game, though, and that's about all that could be expected in a game that takes about 6 minutes to play.

The cards are small, but all the components (including the magnetic-latch box and the completely unnecessary start-player indicator) are very nice quality. The small box size and limited required table space mean this game travels really well.

RATING: 4
I think the word boring quickly comes to mind. Tried a few times to play it with different folks. It just never clicked. The current pass-n-play method really doesn't generate any excitement. We tried card drafting ala 7 wonders and felt that the game remained stale. Some of the caboose end game scenarios just aren't worth it. 2-2-2-2-2 to finish the train car nets you something like 6 points while you could have just formed a 4-4-4-4-4 and gain 4 extra points instead. Doesn't quite make sense. To the trade pile it goes.

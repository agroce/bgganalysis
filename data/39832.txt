I played this at BGG.con with three other players. A dynamic area-control game set in the Persian Gulf region. I feel that area-control games are overdone, personally. As a result, I'm somewhat hard to please in this area -- especially with a new title. This one, however, was very nice. I liked it in spite of finishing a distant third of four players.

It offers up just what you'd expect, a game very much along the lines of China or other tight area control games. But what is a surprise is the depth of play! It's small, tight and beautiful, but it's also certainly dry as toast. I like the various ways to advance your particular city-state by either adding pieces are taking them away. Position is also important and also keeping track of what opponents are looking for in treasure. I like this game.

RATING: 6.8
Simple rules for a clever and crafty game.

A bit dry for our tastes but one to pull out from time to time. I particularly like the straightforward scoring and interesting ascendancy mechanic that makes it important to get a bit of a feel for groupthink.

If I have one criticism it is the starting setup phase which is confusing for first time players, who have no frame of reference about where is a good place to go. It would be nice to have a reference for a balanced setup for 3 and 4 players.

A light area control game that has gamers scrambling for certain provinces followed by a reshuffle of tokens to those areas that was not recently contested. 

Most amount wins with simple tie breaking mechanics.

The old adage of not judging a present by its size is very true with this game.  Packaged in a small box, the game packs a ton of interest and fun.  Game play is area majority, but with a nifty twist on placement and movement.  The shifting importance of regions ensures that you cannot just sit in one location for a next win, you have to move.  Add to that the scoring mechanism via sets and you have a rock solid interesting game.  Much under appreciated and rated and a definitely game to get for any fan of area majority games.

An elegant low medium weight lightly abstracted area majority and set collecting game that plays quickly, (a notch above a filler) with interesting and engaging decisions. 

There is a spatial element to it and what at first seems like a tactical slugfest later reveals itself as a strategical chess game. With experience the analysis paralysis is diminished.

It slightly reminds me of Eight Minute Empire which came out later; although with more depth and substance.

Recommended, if just for it's quick play with substance.

Provisional rating, need to play this more. Almost a filler, there's definitely a lot I like about this game - area majority without a load of extras which is quite refreshing. Felt rather chaotic with 4 but that might just have been unfamiliarity of the game by the players leading to rather 'random' play. Need to play it more to see if that feeling goes away.

This is a good abstract area control game where you have to gain majorities in areas that give you some goods. The more of a particular good you have the more the set is worth so there is also an element of set collecting.

An interesting little game of area control, that is secretly also like market speculation.  As players move into city-states, those areas rise in power and have the potential to score at the end of the round.  Removing a trader from an area makes it decrease in power.  Players are then trying to collect award tiles in 4 categories during each scoring round, and specialization is key (having a lot in one category is worth big points).

I like the strategy involved here - my partner likened it to Chess and I think that's an apt description, at least for the 2-player game.  My complaints with the game are that you sometimes don't have a move that is worth anything (particularly at the end of the game) and that moving a trader only increases ascendancy.  To fit the idea and theme of the game you would think that moving would not only increase ascendancy (for where you move to) but also decrease ascendancy elsewhere (for where you move from).

Not a favorite, but this was worth it as a Tanga purchase.

A fast, simple, and a very elegant area control game with a bit of a counter intuitive thinking punch inside.

Players place, move and remove pawns in regions of Sumeria, trying to accumulate commodities for victory points.  Clever little area majority super filler, where players placing or removing pawns in a region make that region more (or less) lucrative, influencing the payout of commodities.  Payouts are based on area majorities of pawns in areas.  Played over six rounds of three placements each.  Light, but not easy to 'read' - works well, plays quickly and scratches a d ecent itch.  Good game.

Spent too much time fighting over influencing the third ascendant city to realize that Mary had 4 each of 2 different tiles.  She was so far ahead that the rest of the game was pretty much moot.

Neat mechanics, but it makes you wish you had more turns.
Also, going third in a 3-player game blows because you don't end up being able to make the last move.

Low/medium-weight area majority control type game, good components, just one or two notches above a filler, very elegant, satisfying, and can be played in less than an hour.  Bit dry/abstract with thin theme and somewhat prone to AP (dependent on players), but otherwise a good medium weight game with simple rules.  Has a [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/393321]variant[/url] that makes it a great two player game as well.

I enjoyed Sumeria. The game is very simple, the manipulation of regions into ascendancy was nicely done, the change over from round to round was good. My only problem was the randomness of scoring. Once one player had got a good lead, there was no way to bring him back. This lack of control bothered me a little, but may just reflect poor placement of my traders anyway. The game can suffer Analysis Paralysis. The board and chits are nice, the generic poppels for turn and start order seem a little cost-cutter. Couldn't space be found in the punch boards for better markers?

Very fun game in a small box.  While very different than, say,  Yspahan, it somehow scratches the same itch for me.   Simple area-control mechanism but the shifting advantages of controlling particular city-states add to the challenge of this straight-forward game.  Simple rules, nice components, and ever-changing strategies.  I look forward to playing again.  I prefer the 3 player game to the 4 player game (though both are fun) because it is less chaotic.

Even though Sumeria sets you up as a trader in ancient times it's a fairly abstract game. There isn't any sort of actual trading in this game. With that out of the way, it's a sneaky area majority game in a very small package (which is quite commendable in itself).

Players move their traders around in order to raise or lower the importance of the regions on the board. Every couple of turns the top three regions are scored according to majorities of traders there. Despite very simple rules (there are only three actions: add a trader, remove a trader, move a trader) Sumeria creates some nice decision points: Adding many traders early will help with the majority scoring but will reduce flexibility in further turns. Putting many of your traders in one region will ensure the majority but will reduce incentives for other players to invest there and makes it harder to improve its prestige going forward. Traders in the villages at the outskirts of a region are the least valuable for scoring purposes but can be quite important for keeping your trade corps quick on their feet. And more.

There are basically just two niggles that keep me from scoring Sumeria much better than I currently do. In a four-player game in particular board state can change dramatically from one turn to the next. As a player early in turn order it's probably more than is good for the game. Which directly brings us to the second issue: turn order. The start player for each round is in a highly disadvantaged position due to the aforementioned problem. The way the start player is assigned, however, feels rather arbitrary (the player to the left of the player with the worst position in the last scoring). Maybe using some other means than just going clockwise around the table would have been better here even though it would take away some of the game's simplicity.

Wonderfully game - play is entirely deterministic with no luck element but result is chaotic with on standing shifts in importance of different regions.  Control of the right regions at the end of the round is the key to success...but predicting which they will be is hard.  

Could suffer from analysis paralysis...  Secret in a multi player game is soft alliances and not looking too strong in any one region (as if you are very strong everyone else will act to reduce the regions importance).

This is a terrific little game. It is clearly an abstract with a pasted on theme, but you do get to learn the name of some Egyptian cities. There's a lot going on here, tactical and strategic, moving your merchant meeples from city to city, jockeying for position, so as to collect as many symbols for VP. It is perfect information, and how the meeples migrate around the board, it feels like Chinese Checkers. Quick, meaty fun, that doesn't feel anything like a filler, that clocks in under 45 minutes.

RATING: 6.8
An area influence/set collection game. Each round, you have three actions, and then colored tokens are awarded to the players with the most influence in the top 3 cities. Afterwards, those 3 cities are bumped to the bottom of the queue, so it will almost definitely be a different group of 3 cities that will pay out tokens. Adding a marker to a city (either directly or moving a marker to the city from an adjacent location) will bump the city up a spot in the queue; removing a marker from the board will bump the corresponding city down one spot in the queue.

There is a lot of back-and-forth in the game which can sometimes be frustrating, but the game is interesting; if you aren't going to do well in the current round, you can try to position yourself to be in better standing the next round.

Now got my copy - had another very enjoyable game at the Expo - this time with 3.  Plays slightly better with 4 I think, but 3 is also good.

The area majority game is starting to feel fresh again after a few years in the doldrums. This is a simple incarnation with movement allowed to the first free space along a 'road' between the locations. Only three regions score each turn and sometime your pieces are so far away that all you can do that round is build for the future. This isn't a world-changer, but a reasonable game with no issues.

A straight forward game with plenty of strategic decision to make.

I like the mechanics and the scope for different moves each player can make, I don't like the theme (or lack thereof) and I think it takes just slightly too long to play - although a few more plays might sort that out.

A decent abstract game which just doesn't quite excite me enough, still worth a try though.

I loved the game from the start (introduced at Spiel 2009, Essen). It is one of those "very simple rules, but very hard to master"-games. There is only one bad thing to say about the game and that is: the theme is unimportant. But the mechanism is just beautiful, which for me are much more important.
To begin with I rated this game a "9", but after several plays, I have rated it "10". I just love the challenge and the complexity of the game.

Edit: Sadly some players makes it into a analysis paralysis type of game. So I don't get to play it as often as I would like.

I like this small ingenious game. It's abstract, the theme doesn't really matter, still it doesn't bother me at all. Player order every round is pretty much crucial, with 3 players no one is biased towards this. Maybe with 4 players this can feel a bit unfair as there are only 6 rounds.

Seems like it would make a great quick 2 player area control game (with 3-4 player expandability). Plays in under 45 minutes and has little luck. Elegantly simple. Won UK Game 2009 public award and came in 2nd after Snow Tails (per Ender's EXCELLENT review).

Ender says (and so it would appear that) it's an outstanding 2 player game: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/435808/so-youre-wondering-about-the-two-player-version-of 

Seems like a great little game if it can be acquired for a good price (notwithstanding that some aren't excited about it; like Tom Vasel)

Has been compared to China. 
Can involve SOME brain burning.
Some have said that it's a bit dry and can be prone to AP. (See enders rating of 7.5 in the comments section).

RATING: 5.5
This is a weird one! The first couple of rounds, I really thought I was going to hate this game. Limited movement, AP, and slower game play was killing me. However, after a few rounds, I started to see some strategy and really started to enjoy it. Yes, it is a bit dry, the play time is lengthy for this type of game, and it is a bit abstract. However, I couldn't help but be really drawn into it. I will have to play again to finalize my rating. Certainly not a favorite, but really worth a try. Really different than anything else I've played so far.

RATING: 6
Game in a Nutshell:  Themed abstract of trying to score majority in the top 3 of 8 regions to get colored chips that convert to VP at game’s end. Adding or subtracting your pieces to a region makes it move up or down respectively in rank.

Played as:  3,4 player

Pros:  Very tight, no bloat. Easier rules than most "gateway" games. It’s a surprisingly simple premise that’s put together in a way that can cause some pretty significant brain-burn. With only 3 moves before each of the six scoring rounds, every turn feels brutally important. I find the interaction to be very interesting as each player has so many things to weigh... manipulating their regions to the top, or is it better to score the second because the current chips will score better for you, should you be more focused on bumping your opponent out of position, have you secured your majority in the region you want, can you set up your opponent to further your agenda, how are you affecting your turn order in the next round, etc. etc. etc. And you only have three simple moves to balance all this!

Cons:  It’s extremely hard for even a fast player not to suffer from analysis paralysis due to the puzzle-y nature of this game.  Combine that with a somewhat chaotic progression of play and it only compounds things as it becomes almost impossible to plan for your turn until it comes.  What I like least though is the complete detachment from its theme. None of the mechanics tie into anything real world that I can tell.  Even the rulebook intro failed to make a solid attempt at explaining it; probably because they know they can’t. Overall it just makes for a pretty dry experience. 

Other:  I far preferred the game with three than four players in order to rein in the chaos.  Maybe I’ve made too much of the chaos... since it’s an open information game, 95+% of the chaos comes from how the players play their turns. If you can play off what you think your opponents will do, then you’ll probably be alright. Figuring that out though is the trick and all I’m saying is that’s a lot easier with three than four players. Would be a great game for Yucata.de.

Best Use:  A three player brain-burning game you could teach anyone.

First impression (4 players): The game has rather nice tactical gameplay I oftend tend to like but it is too long. Because of how it is structured it needs to be but the gameplay is too repetitive and boring to actually be played as long. It doesn't help that it looks boring too. 

Bonus points for designer for creating area majority game where area of majorities change during gameplay in an predictable enough manner to make it exciting.

RATING: 4.5
Yet another twist on area control. Can I work up enough enthusiasm to put it ahead of El Grande, Web of Power, etc?

Deeper than expected. In some turns, competition for turn order can be more important than scoring, simply to set-up the next turn.
Very slow with AP-affected players, and there is much opportunity for kingmaking.
Not bad at all, but less compelling than Bridges of Shangri-La or Patrician.

An area majority game that lends itself to the ability to react rather than to plan too far ahead. Not a game that suits my preferred play style, and I'd imagine it could become a little AP prone, but a good game with very simple rules. I'd happily play it, but wouldn't buy it.

RATING: 6
Abstract multiplayer with pure knowledge and few placement restrictions. Which means king-making and a result that's largely out of your control, at the mercy of other players. Just not my thing. The concept offers promise to begin with ... the top 3 regions in the favour list will score the players with the most tokens in those regions scoring chits. Adding or moving a token to a region moves it up the favour list, but removing a token just as easily moves it down the list. let the back-and-forth see-saw commence. If you're first in turn order, you've little chance of dictating which regions will be in the top places come the final round because the final placements by the other players will sway it. So just suck up what comes, be grateful, and try and arrange things so you're not last in order next time. There's some AP involved to get the best out of your 3 actions each round, which seems strange after citing lack of control as an issue, but there you go. It provides some interest but in the end it's a non-fun game.

It is very elegant, but a bit random, since the ranking of the cities changes sooo much.

RATING: 6
Can be very confusing to new players and there are some strange side-effects to the starting player rules which can help the player at the back but really hurt the player to their right. The tit-for-tat move city up/move city down process also feels a bit futile towards the end.

Not bad two player, but again can fall into a process of moving a city up and then moving it back down again. Given the disconnection of theme and mechanics I wonder if people would have a better idea of what to expect if this was a pure abstract as, in my experience, abstracts seem to be more easily forgiven if the first play doesn't make as much sense.

This is a preliminary rating, after only playing once. This is the little game that could. It looks ugly and boring, but is actually only one of those two.

I did not enjoy Sumeria, the theme is awfully generic and the game is pretty much an abstract area control game with bizarre and frustrating rules for starting player which are almost random and can be very annoying and there the control over what is going on in the game is too limited with four players, because you can never really predict what other people will be doing. Too dry and too clunky for me.

It has been a while since I've had such a negative reaction to a game, and I thought I'd like this one. I generally like area control, set collecting, and tactical play... but this game is just too chaotic with four people. You can't focus on objectives because they are constantly shifting. You can position yourself well in a region, but then two other players can change the rewards you get from the two you were positioned for to one you don't need. You have little control over this, especially if you are the first player in a round, and going last has a major advantage and impact on the play. Add to this the nearly random way that the start player is assigned (If you are in last place, you could very well end up with the weak first player position- and the person who is winning can very easily end up in the strong last player position), and you have a very frustrating, nearly broken experience.

One play.  This game reminded me of Clans, for no real reason except that the "feel" of it.  It feels slightly uncontrolled, yet with enough control that you do have some say, and the decisions each turn are interesting.  However, at final scoring it did feel like some players had just been "luckier" than others, in getting larger sets of their secondary colour to score a few more points than their rival.

Sumeria -- Played once; three-player.

I'm not generally a fan of area control.  Nor am I a fan of abstract strategy.  This game combines the two quite elegantly.  Still, this is fundamentally the type of game I just can't grasp.

We screwed up the turn order for the first two thirds of the game, so even when I should have gone last, I didn't.  By the time we realized our error, we had reached the point where our tokens were already on the board, so going last couldn't save me.

It's sort of like King of Siam, stripped of theme (even more!). The regions are placed in sequence, and player actions can alter that sequence (e.g., moving a person to a region moves it up, moving a way drops it down one step, etc.). Player actions include moving pieces, placing pieces (from stock), removing pieces. Movement is along roads, to the next empty spot. The point of all this? The first 3 regions will award token(s) to the person (or persons) most dominant in that region. Dominance is based on numbers of tokens, and specific locations of those tokens (towns, villages, cities).

The tokens come in 3 or 4 types, with the same number total. At the end of the game, you get points per color of token (arithmetic progression). Most VP wins.

It's not bad, but nothing particularly compelling.

dry but fast and oddly engaging--this will defnintely see more play and an adjustment in rating I'm sure.  We had a load of fun with 3, viciously competitive players with the end result of....

3-way tie

Rating drop: 4 players can mean game is decided before the final turn, and the rules for changing start player are broken.  When first player and last player are both without influence in the winning zone, the tie-breaker goes to the second-place area, but between the same two players--so then regardless of how much influence the other players have, if the last player has the least or none, then the first player remains the first player, and at a distinct disadvantage AGAIN.  Sorry but that's just seems stupid.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Note: I was a playtester,

An area influence / set-collecting game where players place & move traders around the settlements in regions of ancient Sumeria. The movement rules incorporate an interesting stock market element, where moving into a region causes that region to increase in prestige (swapping ranking with the region above). Each round involves 3 turns of movement, after which the three most prestigious regions award tokens for 1st/2nd influence, then the scoring regions get reset to be the least prestigious before starting the next round. The tokens drawn before each round are the only random element in the game.

After six rounds, VP are awarded based on how many of each type of token you have collected.

Having only one trader per settlement means there is continual competition for influence, but it also means that you need to vacate settlements if you hope to attract new traders to increase the prestige of the region.

The movement rules are wonderfully simple, yet create real dilemmas over creating & breaking connected chains of settlements. There’s a similar dilemma over getting all your traders onto the board quickly (to exert influence) or keeping some back for later so they can be parachuted in with greater flexibility.

RATING: 6
Simple but deceptively strategic area control game. The board is divided into eight different areas each containing a city and some smaller towns and villages. Each turn a player can place a trader onto a settlement, remove one, or move move along a route from one to another. After three turn areas are scored and the players with the majority of pieces in the top three areas claim scoring tiles, which are collected into sets for final scoring. The game's main source of strategy pertains to the ever changing importance of the areas, with players having to plan well to ensure that they have majorities at the right time. The game is surprisingly tense but possibly doesn't have the variety of other more accomplished games in this genre ('El Grande', 'China', 'San Marco' etc) to prove particularly memorable.

This is an interesting area control game.  You seed the field initially and then promote/demote areas by adding/removing/moving workers to the areas.

A very tactical area control game where you jockey back and forth in various provinces, getting the ones you have a majority in towards the top of the scoring ladder, and hopefully sending the ones your opponent leads in to the bottom.

Neat round mechanism shuffles the scoring ladder, so that those provinces at the top automatically become the worst, so that you can't continually exploit your current majorities, and you'll need to come up with new ones.

With 4 players, this is the most chaotic game I've ever played. The situation can change so radically between your moves that any sort of long-term planning is largely futile. And yet, with finesse, and a little bit of luck, you can do pretty well. And it plays very quickly. Also, though I haven't tried it, I have a feeling it turns into a chess match with 2 players.

RATING: 6
'Sumeria' is a game about establishing trade routes to the ancient cities of Sumer in order to increase (or decrease) the prestige of those each player wants to promote in order to maximise the acquisition of merchantable goods that are won according to the chits drawn for the top three cities. Players are trying to not only get the most chits (counters) but also the largest group of the same merchant goods. Opponents obviously try to do the same for their 'preferences' and also looking to prevent others in the process.
Gary Dudleston identified the best tactic - that of placing as many of your trader pieces near to borders - so that ease of movement over the entire region is easier as the spaces get filled. In later turns, players can also remove traders and move them along trade routes to the next nearest available village town or city unoccupied space. Predominating in one or two regions will not work long-term, as I found out, so there may be some turns where no new merchant goods are acquired if you cannot influence the top three cities.

I think this is quite a good stratergy game, but other gamers in my group find it a bit boring. I guess it'll be one that I bring out occasionally to fill a quick 30 mins or so.

We first played this at the UK Games Expo 2009 in Birmingham at the Reiver Games Stand. It's a very simple game ruleswise, but playing it is a real brain masher. All-in-all a great game.

A simple area control game. I found it fairly bland and would not be overly keen to play it again

A bit too chaotic, or perhaps I'm not bright enough to grasp the strategy. I'd be willing to play it again.

Un buen juego de mayorías con un tema algo pegado, que requiere cierta atención y una dosis de planificación a largo plazo. Ideal a cuatro jugadores.

No está mal del todo, pero demasiado abstracto para mis gustos.

"Never sell or trade games shelf" - Excellent little brain burner. Get the two player variant!

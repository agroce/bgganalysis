Not sure this is much of an improvement over the original.  Much the same game, but a little more complicated.  And the art on the cards and tiles doesn't fit well with the theme.  Good production quality other than the art.

Fun new take on the old classic that adds variability to how the monsters are controlled and new ways to get to the 'islands'. Generally the new rules/pieces reduce predictability.

Survive! in space. It has several minor improvements with how aliens (formerly whales, sharks, serpents) can be captured with laser guns on the center space station and then placed later... how they can transform through tile plays... how they can spawn new aliens... how they are fought away instead of to death. And, the fighters make for an interesting size 1 boat that moves differently and can capture aliens. It's good, but not good enough for to trade Survive! for this. I'll stick with the original.

It really is Survive in space. Sea monsters replaced with space monsters, and the addition of fighter jets and turrets and the ability to shoot said monsters, but otherwise identical in feel.

Like escaping from a sinking island isn't exciting enough. There are people who think a game is boring if it doesn't have orcs or zombies or aliens. (I think they're called "10 year olds".) I guess this game is for them and not me. But I think taking an existing game with a somewhat more grounded theme and changing it into fantasy feels cynical and doesn't do anyone any favours. This isn't a better game than Survive, and there are better sci-fi games out there, so this doesn't need to exist.

Theme at its best is not only evocative and interesting. At its best, theme is also a set of mnemonics that help you internalise the rules so the rules melt away and you can enjoy the game in its theme. Spawns kill people alone but don't hurt people in ships, and warriors destroy ships but leave the passengers alone. Or is it the other way around? Who's to say? Nothing about those names tell you anything. But replace them with "sharks" and "whales" and you don't need to be told twice.

Survive is arguably a better game (and factually is definitely no worse), but if you're of a type who thinks every board game ever made would have been better if its theme was sci-fi or fantasy, then sure, get this instead.

Feels very similar to the original game, even keeping the colors of the three ranks of monsters. But "capturing" aliens with fighter ships and gun turrets is an elegant change from the tile actions that originally allowed sea creatures to dive from one part of the board to another.

Very enjoyable sequel to the classic aggressive family game.  This features a couple of twists on the original design, including fighters and turrets which allow you to nail monsters and re-deploy them wherever you want on your turn.  The core is the same but the sci-fi theme and new wrinkles make this a somewhat different game.

The art on this is absolutely wrong. The box is a complete turn off (especially the title font) and the aliens are awful as the silhouette wood cutouts. The parts of the ship look overly similar also. The gameplay is absolutely fine though. I like the gameplay as much or better than Survive Escape From Atlantis. Atlantis just looks 100 times better.

Conceptually I really like this game and you need to take it with a grain of salt is there is a fair amount of luck with it.  It's light-hearted fun with the most satisfyingly functional components imaginable.

Until you play it a bit the game feels a bit clunky for what it is and that may come off from how the manual was written, I feel this game could have definitely benefited from a reference sheet.  Time will tell but I think it will get better with more plays, if anything, compared to what most people say it's not as cut-throat as I was hoping!

RATING: 8.5
Ugyanolyanra értékeltem, mint a szigetes változatot. Elég sok mindenben eltér pedig tőle, és egész sokat bonyolít a játékmeneten. Ez kettős érzéssel tölt el, ezért az azonos pontszám. Egyrészt az újítások jók, tényleg új lehetőségeket adnak a játékhoz. Viszont nem vagyok benne biztos, hogy jó ezt a játékot bonyolítani, mert azért emiatt a szabálymagyarázat is a másfélszeresére nő legalább. Nálam lesz helye mindkettőnek a polcon. Kazuároknak mehet a szigetes, gémereknek az űrös.

I had hoped this would be a hit with my son but after a few games he seemed to lose interest and it never hit the table any more.

I ended up giving it away.

A very light, short game that I feel is a fun, hilarious introductory game for people into gaming. No crazy strategy or tactics needed. That being said, there isn't alot of depth, but it is pretty fun adapting to the attacks made by others. I think this version of space attack improves on the previous installments.

Fun and competitive. It involves a little bit of bluffing and almost a memory mini game as you fight to keep track of which of your crew are worth saving. Just thinky enough.

My only real complaint is that killing aliens is a glorious waste of time and makes me lose the game through the instant gratification trap. (It's not a real complaint.)

Great spin on a very good game. The new tiles, the fighters and the lasers are great. But frankly, the old theme is just better IMO. Maybe that's nostalgia talking but that's how I feel. I even still use the olds terms, water, shark, whale, boat, etc. I can't help myself.

After wanting to check out this game for a while, I finally got it.  I wasn't disappointed.  Fans of the original Survive will have no problems playing this.  We played this game with two players, using all four colors (as suggested in the rules) and it was a blast.  Lots of 'gotcha' moments, and very balanced.

Bonus:  The wooden alien meeples are cut in the shapes of the pixel monsters in the 'Space Invaders' videogame.  This really added to the theme.

Similar to the original with a few twists thrown in. It was pretty fun although the tiles are not nearly as clear as the original game. I'm looking forward to trying out some of the scenarios. If I didn't own survive, I would probably buy this one over it.

RATING: N/A
This is essentially just a re-themed copy of the Atlantis game. Monster tokens are not great, and there is much checking thro' rules to decipher all the different actions indicated on the reverse of tiles. The ease thro which players can take control of monsters (rather than just moving them on a dice roll) makes for an overly chaotic game. All of this make the remake less of a game than the original.

A few extra mechanics on top of the original Survive! have possibly added to the gameplay, but the basics remain intact enough for established strategies to work: the one big difference being getting floaters out to different corners which was a nice addition. The alien meeples are a bit shapeless and neither matched their artwork nor added to the visual aesthetic. No need to 'upgrade'.

Mechanically there are some differences from the Atlantis version, but honestly I don't think they add enough to the game to really matter. What does matter is the theme is a LOT less intuitive.

It's easy to remember what whales, sharks and sea serpents do. It's much harder to distinguish between the three classes of alien (even though they are color-coded). Also, it's much more difficult to distinguish between the "terrain" types in this version.

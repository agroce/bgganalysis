GAME: Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin
RANK: 299

RATING: N/A
very first impressions: well, the box is ugly and a corner split seconds out of shrink wrap ... I'm half afraid to play because I'm half afraid of wanting more cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
03-20-14: I have several friends who own and really like this game, so I want to like it. But after multiple game plays... I just don't enjoy it. It's slow. It's boring. It takes a while to improve your starting deck, then when you do you have to hope you are lucky enough to draw the right combination of cards to defeat anything worth fighting in the dungeon. There are way too many turns where all you can do is discard useless cards from your hand, then wait 5 minutes or 10 minutes or longer for it to come back around to you, just so you can do nothing, again. 

There is not really any player interaction at all. For what it is, this game just takes way too long and doesn't give you a lot of choices or much in the way of strategy. I will say it does play better with fewer players; anything over three makes the game length and downtime too much for this game to be fun.  But if we are going to play a deck builder I'd rather just play Dominion.

UPDATE 03-12-20: After not playing this game for over a year, I finally gave it another chance since it is a friend's favorite game. I had a much better time of it so I'm bumping it up from a 3 to a 4.5. I still think it is flawed as a multiplayer game. If I were grading this as solely a 1-2 player game I would bump it up to the 6-7 range, but I think I'm okay with this rating for now if you play with 4 or more. There's just too much sitting around waiting for other players to take their turn, is too luck dependent, and you really don't care what anyone else is doing because unless they are taking a card that you want, what they do never affects you (and you can't do anything about it anyway).

An excellent deckbuilder that beats out Dominion in fun-factor.  Seems to have much better replayability without all the expansions, has a much more interesting theme, and has more (and more interesting) decisions to make on your turn.  It plays longer than Dominion, but is a more satisfying game.

While there aren't a ton of changes moving from Thunderstone to Thunderstone: Advance, the changes feel like a significant improvement.  I still like the Thunderstone hero cards more, but the monsters are more interesting in Advance, Curses/Diseases are less painful, and having a less terrible starting deck is a major boon.

RATING: 8.5
Single play only.

The rules haven't changed much from the original game, though the familiars are a nice way to make each play a little different, so I can only really compare how fun the cards themselves are.  The village cards are probably comparable to the original, though the new Regulars (replacing the Militia) get you into the dungeon slightly faster.  The monster cards in the game I played are far more interesting than their counterparts in TS 1.0.  Obviously can't fairly evaluate the whole game based on the village and dungeon I saw in one play, but I was impressed with what I saw.

It was immediately noticeable that this version has much better component quality, including plastic XP chips instead of the inexplicable XP cards, than the original Thunderstone.

RATING: 9.5
I used to love Thunderstone a lot. It is my favorite deckbuilder. Then I got Thunderstone Advance, and now I really love it, and don't care much for the old one. The biggest reason is that it was extremely rare in the original, that I would go to the town, or the dungeon, and not know exactly what was going to happen. In Thunderstone Advance things are a lot more uncertain, with opportunities to draw more cards, or effects varying by top card of the player or dungeon deck. This makes the game have an element of risk in it that it sorely needed. Also the advent of the Prepare action made it much easier to not get frustrated from poor card draw.

Wow was I surprised that this was the same Thunderstone that I have come to love. AEG has givin Thunderstone a total makeover. Even the new board is worth paying the $40 for. The backs of the cards are the same so you can use prior expansions, but I wouldn't recommend it. There are sites that tell you what you should and shouldn't do for integrating old sets to Advance.

Not perfect, but awesome fun. Solo game works great as well, although it's a bit luck based given the appearance of the monsters (easier to win if the level 1 guys come out first). This is the set to get if you're a new player, don't bother with the starter set. This is the equivalent of getting some good pre-constructed decks for MtG, whereas the starter set is similar to getting the very basic Core Set intro pack.

Initial Impression: I've only played the solitaire variant so far. Setup time seems a bit longer than traditional deckbuilders but the board helps to keep everything organized. The artwork is fine but not exceptional. I was VERY impressed with the box insert though as AEG really planned everything well. The game itself seems fairly thematic for a card game. The mechanism that stood out to me the most was the option to upgrade heroes using XPs. I'm hoping to play this with someone else soon as I think there's alot to explore.

Thunderstone is a deckbuilding game, but what puts it above Dominion is the fact it seems to have more theme and purpose.  You are battling monsters as well as buying cards to get that mechanic towards victory points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game just makes deck-building much more enjoyable by adding a strong theme. The cards are split into 5 broad categories:
* Heroes - Characters with different traits; used primarily to defeat monsters
* Weapons - Equip your heroes with weapons to make the stronger and/or more resistant to monster effects
* Spells/Items/Villagers - Various cards that give you benefit when visiting the village or when adventuring the dungeon
* Monsters - You need to defeat them to get points and experience to level your heroes
* Curses - Bad cards that hinder your progress

You want a small deck with a good mix of strong heroes with hard-hitting weapons and helping stuff. But the more monsters you defeat, the more they clog your deck.
The better you performed on previous turns, the harder it gets to get more points (the slower your deck gets).

All in all, Thunderstone is a super deck-builder that builds on the solid ground of Dominion but adds thematic flavour and some new mechanisms that really improve on his abstract ancestor.

RATING: 5
as a new boardgame player started not to like the deck building mechanic. until it is utilized in some kind of meaningfull resource management concept.

problems of this title:

long set up time
theme is weird you buy things from another dimension or worlds{a mage and next to it a plasma gun}
ap can really drag this not recommend for more than 3 players
unlucky draw of the high level monsters at the beggining can make it depressing.

its just dominion with a lot of unneeded souce around it.
high hopes for legendary now.

RATING: N/A
Note: I worked as a developer on this game.

I loved Thunderstone, but it was a game that came with many flaws.  Every one of those flaws seems like it was addressed in TS Advance.

What I loved about Dominion was building the deck.  What I found, however, was that once the deck is built, there is very little creativity when it comes to playing out the hand.  TS pushed the "play of the hand" concept a little further but had some clunkiness in the implementation.  I think TS Advance really hits that perfect balance.  Building your deck is important, but so is how you play it.

A new player can have a great time playing in the wilderness setting, and be making strategic but not overwhelming decisions that can put them ahead of their opponents.  A true expert has some very hard decisions to make on familiar use, order of dungeon effects, avatar selection based on card pool, drawing into effects, etc. that completely don't get in the way at all if you are not at that level yet.

So, yes, I will happily play a game of TS Advance with you, anytime.  I feel fortunate to have been involved in a project that turned out a final product of this quality.  Easy 10.

The seems very good. There is just one thing that makes me not rate it higher. The game seems to start really slow, where you need to develop your troops and from the middle of the game it goes quite fast with everyone attacking.

My intention to get Thunderstone was to get a deckbuilder that tells a story, like LE: Alien.
But I was afraid that it will be too short. Your deck finally reaches a level of effectivity and the game is over. Not here. The game lasts long enough that you get the chance to enjoy your deck.

It is a good game although I somehow expected a little more.
Gameplay-wise it's just a Dominion with only one possibility each turn (buy or fight). But somehow I like it more. We'll see if that will last.

Very nice reorganization of Thunderstone.  The rules tweaks, many of which were created as variant ideas by BGG'ers, make for a smoother, more logical game.  The rewritten rulebook is easier for first-time players to understand.  Highly recommend ToR as a jumping-in point for new players.  For experienced players I think ToR is easily skipped.  The setup board is nice and I like the thematic scenarios, but it contains very little that is new to the game and almost all of the rules changes can be applied to the game you already have.

New graphics are probably an improvement on the original, but still on the small side so you're unable to see them clearly enough across the table to avoid having to pick cards up to examine, which slows the game down. Experience speeds things up a bit, but not enough to up my rating.

They definitely did a good job with this reboot, cleaning up a whole bunch of stuff and generally making the game more nuanced and interesting with much better balance (yay! Regulars don't suck! Less vulnerability to extreme deck-pruning!). Things being as they are, the new rulebook will probably be much more daunting to new players than it needs to be, just because of the level of system grit to this point, but the overall situation is much better.

The new graphic design isn't much more than obviously different. I don't know that it's an improvement, it's not worse, it's just different. Fonts and icons are still sadly to small and indistinct, but they are more consistent at least.

There are a non-trivial number of cards in the new set that you just aren't going to buy, ever probably. That's not great - the balance still isn't right. But a handful of weak cards is, IMO, far better than a couple broken cards that dominate the game, as was the case in the original base set and the first expansion or two (Trainer, Fireball, Thyrian, and Outlander were all game-breakers; if they're in, you have to play them or you lose. Feast also in almost all combinations). The new balance is more satisfying, but even now they're still not quite there. In fairness, they're making much far progress than Dominion ever did in producing playable, interesting game sets, but it's still a long way from being as well-balanced as Ascension.

RATING: 6
If Thunderstone had come out before Dominion, I think I would have said, "Wow, that's really cool!".

However, as someone who loves Dominion, I think Thunderstone needlessly complicates the elegant deck-building mechanic in order to afford the dungeon theme.  For those that love such themes, maybe this makes Thunderstone a better game for you.  But for me, it just adds a bunch of rulesiness for no benefit, as I really couldn't care less about the dungeon theme.

Overall, if you like the deck-building genre and don't mind the extra rule complications in order to make it into a hack-monsters-in-a-dungeon theme, it's probably really great.  For me, the game is fine, but so long as Dominion is an option, I can't see wanting to play Thunderstone.

I was excited to play this and I was very disappointed when i did play it. I never felt like I was deck building. I can add cards to my deck but I have to get lucky and draw the right sequence of cards to go into the dungeon to fight, and the the enemy card goes into my deck as a pointless card. I really like Dominion and the card combo's I can get and Thunderstone didn't have card combo's to play off. Sure I could equip a weapon on a character and that's it. Thunderstone takes awhile to setup as well. Overall I was not impressed and could not wait for some games to end.

Just picked this up courtesy of my FLGS (Rainy Day Games - you're amazing!) - had been playing on Facebook, went in to get Dragonspire, and the kind and knowledgeable folks behind the counter pushed me toward this. Just played a game with the wife - everything you could want in a medium-crunch game. Lots of fluff, subtle strategy, and you're never at a loss for choices. Great game!

I actually really prefer the original Thunderstone over this current version.  There are several mechanics they re-did that I'm not a huge fan of.  Not a bad game, and I'm glad there's still an in-print version of Thunderstone, but it's not my preferred one.

Hmmmm. I love thunderstone but I can't see why this should be better than the classic thunderstone. The card design is a bit better and the board is a nice plus. But it is nt easy to mix the old thunderstone and the thunderstone advanced cards - and thats a really bad thing!

I'm a huge fan of Thunderstone, and when I won this copy of the new release I was pretty excited.  While my rating for now is after one play, I want to mention a few things about the game that made me feel disappointed.

1: The buildup of a deck seems far too easy to manage.  It seems like money is considerably easier to come by now, but I don't feel like the prices of items have increased considerably to make it feel like you have to work for it.  On my first turn I had 8 dollars, and that was enough to buy anything on the table.

2: "Passive" items.  Specifically, familiars and Avatars.  these two things provide nothing more than one extra piece of data to check.  It's useful, but it doesn't really provide any particularly interesting choices since its always available.  Even worse, you have no choice as to what familiar you get.  You can't pick one to work with your strategy, you just take one and deal with it.

3: Despite definitely trying to make more out of XP, both players in the game ended up with an enormous pile of it.  perhaps we weren't buying enough heros, but it seemed like somehow it just stacked up and we never had a chance to do anything with it.

With all that said, It's still got the solid mechanics of Thunderstone, and it has plenty of great monsters to fight.  It also does a great job with certain clarifications, the best being "Battle" and "Aftermath" events.  I'm also a fan of the super-tough Thunderstone Keepers, who make ending the game slightly harder for those bonus points.

Dominion was a great idea (deck building) but has an almost non-existent theme.  The deck building mechanism is just a central to this game, but you actually feel like you are going into a dungeon to kill bad guys.  Wonderful blend of theme and mechanism.

RATING: 9
Favorite Production Changes:
1. Standardization of card text. In the base game, the same ability can be worded many different ways across different cards, which makes for difficult parsing. I see very few inconsistencies in the cards in this set (Dancing Sword is an exception).

2. Rules. Though there are various specific rules (e.g. how to use trophies) that are scattered throughout the rulebook, in general the rulebook is well done, and flows smoothly.

3. Randomizer Summaries. Putting the village effects on the village randomizers is useful; including a summary of hero progression and monster groups on their respective randomizers is wonderful. It saves us from having to look through all the component cards, and it helps to re-inforce the theme, that each hero has a specialty, and each monster group a pattern of attack.

4. Game Board. I didn't think that I'd like the board, but I was wrong. Having a place for each card stack (except player decks) keeps everything tidy. I also like the sections of the village; prior to this release, we arranged our village cards thematically, but still in a 4x2 grid, making it difficult to decide which spell would spill over into the weapons/items row, or which item would be bumped up to the villager/spell row. Now the board manages the empty space for us, keeping each card type in its own section, and as such I find it quicker to hunt for a particular type of card.

Least Favorite Production Changes:
1. Artwork. The artwork is mostly well done (Criochan is an exception), but not thematically similar enough to the artwork in previous sets. The cards in the first few sets looked BAD-ASS; the heroes in ToR look like fluffy bunnies by comparison, especially since each is accompanied by a familiar (some of whom occupy as much space on the card as does the hero). And the problem of confusion from cards like Skullbreaker and Plaguesmiter has been amplified with Bandia's Wisdom, which looks indistinguishable from a hero with a familiar (that might be the point, but I'm still not a fan). Contrast Trainer to Veteran Trainer. This is actually becoming a problem: I draw a hand of cards, and am unenthusiastic about them, because they are all so plain looking by contrast. Theme is suffering.

2. Pink backgrounds. Why the pink backgrounds on weapons and items? Firstly, it makes the weapons look really lame, even when they have cool effects (like Dancing Sword). Contrast the similarities between Longspear, Pike, Longsword, and Dancing Sword (at a glance, Longspear and Pike are indistinguishable), to the unique look among Short Sword, Claymore, Greed Blade, and Illusory Blade (the latter four are all just swords, but each has distinct, attractive artwork). It slows down consideration of my hand, because I can no longer quickly recognize the different cards. Secondly, it suggests a kinship between weapons and items that doesn't exist. Weapons typically must be paired with a hero to be useful, so I can see the need to quickly identify them in my hand; items are more like spells and villagers, in that they are useful regardless of a hero being present.

3. Icons. Cost and Gold have different icons, as they should, because they serve different purposes: one for spending money, one for earning money. But Weight and Strength now have the same icon, even though they serve different purposes, as do earning XP and spending XP. This means I can't quickly thumb through my cards looking for one symbol to mean one thing. I'll put in this category the loss of the Level icon. Before, there was a side-indexed level number, and a border color to represent the hero's level; now this info is buried in a tiny font below the card title, making it very difficult to see at a glance what my hero's level is (and impossible to tell when looking across the table at my opponent's hero). I now find myself inferring the level from the XP to upgrade: 3=2, 2=1, and blank=3. And now that monsters don't have an icon on the sidebar, it's not as easy to quickly sort out monsters from the other cards, despite the (subtle) border color.

Other Changes:

Set-up/Take-down: Set up time has been slightly increased. We now must take a bit more care when selecting the monster groups and village cards; we have one additional deck to place (Familiars), one additional decision to make (Avatar), but have dividers such that our starting decks are now pre-constructed, something that never occurred to me before. Merging of the Guardian with the Thunderstone saves a step. Take-down is basically the same. The rules suggest that destroyed cards should be placed upside-down at the bottom of their respective card stacks as they are destroyed, to help with take-down time, but this just slows down the game, so we still end with a massive redistribution of cards from the destroyed pile. Take-down now also includes constructing the starting decks.

Basic Cards: I'm not seeing much of a change here. The Thunderstone shards are awesome, and end up influencing how eager I am to risk a trip to the dungeon. I appreciate that the Regulars are easier to level up than the Militia are. But the "Draw 1" of a polearm-equipped Regular, though enough to entice me to enter the dungeon more often, is not enough to make me defeat more monsters. I'm still looking for ways to purge my deck of Regulars and Longspears. I like the uncertainty of relying on dungeon draws to defeat a monster, but when I've left my Regulars and Longspears in my deck for too long, it tempts me toward recklessness. We're finding that more battles result if loss, which makes the game less satisfying.

Familiars: I like the idea, especially toward the end of the game when XP is piling up without a purpose. In general, the familiars are weak; but they can sometimes turn the tide. The real trick is remembering to use them (and the avatar).

Avatars: A very cool idea, that helps to immediately differentiate players from each other (assuming they didn't select the same avatars). However, the Ranger avatar is overpowered. It would take a very particular setup to make another avatar shine in comparison.

Curses: I like the option to destroy the curse, at some additional cost to myself. However, the effect of leaving the curses in my deck is the same as playing with the original, non-special disease deck from the base game, which isn't that harmful. Which means curses are less painful than even regular diseases, which are only minor annoyances as they are. I prefer the special disease deck, with the chance of a -2 Attack card, or -2 VP. Special disease have more of a stigma than do curses.

Thunderstone Bearer: Thematically, I like it. I dislike in the original sets where the Thunderstone can end up guarded by a dinky Griknack Goblin. However, the Thunderstone Bearer's "must be defeated to leave the hall" isn't stiff enough. When a guardian breached, it just hung around in Rank 0, continuing to taunt us, sometimes with a global effect. When the Thunderstone Bearer breaches, the game ends. The Thunderstone Bearer is often difficult to beat; if I can't beat the bearer on my turn, it's much wiser to just breach him and end the game than risk letting my opponent get him. Thus we end up avoiding the big bad more often than not, which is anti-climactic.

Races: So far I've only seen reference to Dwarves, but I like it. I seem to recall that back in the days of basic D&D, "Elf" was a class, which always seemed strange to me. Eventually, "Elf" became a race, which could then also be of various classes. I look forward to seeing what else becomes of this new attribute. However, I'm at a loss for a word to identify the first part of a card's name, e.g. the "Caliginite" in "Caliginite Lurker". I used to call this the 'race'; now I'm thinking 'tribe' is a better word.

Rangers vs. Archers. I like the name change. The dungeon-management abilities are something unique to their class, which is great. For too long the Archers were just lesser fighters, attempting to reach deeper into the dungeon, but doing so with less attack value than a good fighter. I dislike the negative gold, though. It's a cool concept, but thematically, I'd associate lack of gold with the clerics (vow of poverty?), or the expense of keeping fighters in the party. Functionally, rangers are not yet powerful enough to warrant this nerf.

Prepare: I haven't been using this new action much, but I like having the option.

Battle vs. Aftermath. This is a great change. Monsters with Battle effects are tough! I love tough monsters. Bring 'em on!

Difficulty: Other than the tough monsters and weak village cards, the game has become easier, which is a negative for me. The starting deck is slightly better; curses are weaker than regular diseases; we're now boosted by Avatars and Familiars; and there's no longer a Guardian protecting the hall.

Variety: As another user pointed out, the monster levels and board restrictions reduce the number of possible random card combinations. This wouldn't matter as much if the village cards were better. After four games, I'm not yet tired of the heroes, but I already want to mix in cards from other sets to refresh the village.

Heroes: A good mixture of heroes. I thought some of the hero names were unpronounceable in earlier sets? Caliginite, Veilminder, and Criochan take the cake. I'm continually impressed at how each expansion delivers distinct heroes. With the exception of Criochan, each of the heroes in this set behaves unlike any heroes in previous sets, and each seems to have its own carry-the-day use.

Favorite Heroes:
1. Drua. Wow; she is a deck-purification machine! She does a credit to her class.
2. Caliginite. Like Blind, he likes being in the dark. He also has the most thematically appropriate artwork of the heroes in this set.
3. Veilminder. Not terribly effective, but I like his niche, especially with such nasty Battle/Aftermath effects floating around.
5. Whetmage. Like most mages, kind of useless at lower levels, but bad-ass at level 3. What a yuck name, though.
5. Thundermage. Okay, so I like mages. Her stats are almost identical to Elf, but with a more realistic cost, given the light she contributes. I like her level 3 power; in most cases, it just gives some added choice about who to attack, but it could lead to some victories over severely tough monsters who have drifted toward the front of the dungeon.

Village: I can't speak as highly of the village cards. In general, they are weak. There are a few that stand out, but in general I am better off buying mostly heroes; I have often regretted my village buys, as cards end up being not as powerful/versatile as I had imagined. Partly this is just theme, as it's no fun to have the weenie-looking Longsword in my hand, even with its powerful +3 bonus. Another good example is Lantern vs. Moonstone: they're nearly identical, but Moonstone is superior, with a dungeon effect for a mere 1 gold more in cost. But the Lantern looks gorgeous and evocative; the Moonstone looks like a pastel sketch. But beyond theme, the village just seems less interesting than the other two base sets; it's more on par with the village cards from WotE and TWS. The villagers in particular continue the tradition set by WotE of being the worst cards in the village; I'm glad they are banished to their own section of the board, where I don't need to even consider them.

Favorite Village Cards:
1. Dancing Sword. Dancing Sword is basically a Drunari Vagabond in terms of raw attack and potential for more.
2. Veteran Trainer. Operates quite differently from its counterpart in the original base set. An improvement over the original is that its destroy ability is thematically similar to its ongoing ability, whereas the original card suddenly cared about gold rather than XP.
3. Summon Storm. Light + Magic Attack (sans hero) + a mini Prepare action. I likey.
4. Falcon Arbalest. I still haven't bought one of these, but I like the idea, that the hero uses both hands to hold it, and therefore sacrifices their own attack. Equipping Regulars with these bows seems like it could be a quick way to ramp up my attack strength.
5. King Caelan's Writ. The power in this card is that it places the newly purchased hero on top of my deck. Thus the risky part is buying King Caelan's Writ in advance of needing it; but when I draw it, and see a tasty level 2 hero revealed on a deck, I can buy that hero, then draw him next turn for immediate leveling to 3. Now that is power leveling.

Monsters: I've played with few monsters more than once, but I'm thankful that this set comes with 9 monster groups, contrasted to the 8 in each of the other base sets. Monster variety is important, to keep the game fresh, and make each dungeon uniquely challenging.

Favorite Monsters:
1. Djinni•Efreet
2. Dragon•Fire
3. Burnmarked

Definitely an enjoyable deck builder and with the simple board and village/dungeon set up you can sneak this one on to the table pretending it's a "board game" and people are enjoying it before they discover you lied and it's a deck builder that they gave you a board to put the cards on.

The most immersive deckbuilder I have played. Players try to assemble a party of heroes and other assorted cards to delve into a dungeon and acquire VPs for killing monsters, but they need to be successful or the monster will run away and another will appear, until the Thunderstone bearer appears. Great variety in cards, and can be played either by drafting or with the scenarios that are provided in various sets, some of which are an absolute pain in the ass to progress through.

Definitely a lot chancy-er than the original iterations of thunderstone, though I haven't decided wether that is a good or a bad thing. With a bunch of minor tweaks, standardizations, and an overall new focus, it's hard to judge this game by it's predecessor. If you can ignore the similarities and approach it as a new game though, it's definitely one of the deckbuilders I would prefer. Thematically superior to Dominion, Strategically superior to Ascension, and 1/3 to 1/4 the time investment of Mage Knight, I think it'll continue to be one of my go-to deckbuilder games for a long time.

It's a pretty fun game overall, excellent atmosphere and art. i traded it off though because i didn't like the fact that you really have to make your deck thin and the game also punishes you for defeating monsters (the extra gold they give doesnt' matter since you don't want to be buying much stuff for your deck anyway since it's all about levelling up what you already have)

A backwards compatible reboot of Thunderstone, with several tweaks. The game play is almost identical, but the layout and iconography on the cards is much better, with more vibrant art. The new option, Prepare, is a nice addition, and overall, this a great revision of Thunderstone.  The double sided dungeon/wilderness board, and improved rulebook are great additions too.  Well done.  My main beef with the game is it takes way too long for a deck builder.

My wife and I are great Dominion fans, and I had been looking for something similar yet different. Thunderstone Advance takes a little getting used to, but once it clicked it became our 2nd favorite game. I have no previous Thunderstone experience (or cards), and can see where this game will have much greater variety when the next expansion comes out. Overall, highly recommended, but it has some flaws in pacing and a lack of a clear objective that can muddle things a bit until the last third of the game.

Streamlined a game my friends were crazy about and turned it into a game that I now love.  Wasn't a fan of the original TS games; felt they were dull, confusing, and lacking clear game rules.  Too many times a person in our game group would stop the game to spend twenty minutes discussing the wording of a card.  The end fight was never incredibly epic; someone would either luck into the thunderstone or the game would end with no one capturing it.  And light penalties drove me nuts.

AEG seems to be a fairly unique company.  They knew they had a great game in TS and they realized there were many people, like myself, that were not in love with it.  So they recreated their game.  I think the changes they made were for the better.  Setting up the dungeon hall with R 1,2 and 3 monsters makes it easier to get straight into the fun of attacking monsters.  Few have touched on this but the new heroes are fucking awesome.  They do things that are just flat out fun.  I find myself looking at our box and thinking, man, when are we gonna get to play that game again, which is a COMPLETE 180 from how I felt about the previous sets.  But don't just take my word for it, grab ToR and play a few games for yourself!

My favorite deckbuilder so far. Thunderstone mainly plays like Dominion, but it includes a theme in the game and resolves it fairly well, I think. Here, you build your deck with the purpose of winning points also, but the points are won in the shape of monsters that you have to beat in the dungeon. How cool is that? The game also presents choices to the player: do I buy in the village, or try to go to the dungeon and defeat that monster? Artwork is awesome, too and I personally LOVE the texture of the cards. Recommended! (BTW, never played the first Thunderstone).

A fantastic deckbuilding game.  

Tremendous replay value in this box alone. Every random village I've set up has had a number of viable strategies for deck focus and it's always rewarding to explore the worth of new cards.

The game plays in around an hour, time which flies by. 

Difficulty can vary depending on the set up, but by and large the game is a good challenge. The option to play on the easier 'Wilderness' side of the board is welcome when you fancy a slightly easier game.

The mechanics of light, leveling up heroes, equipping weapons etc are brilliant and wonderfully thematic.

Component quality is excellent. The board does its job perfectly, the cards are of a good stock and the little plastic thunderstone shards used as exp. are a lovely touch.

I find myself playing this game more and more as its always different and it's nice to play a full game, with interesting decisions and progression, in an hour.

I play primarily solo and the official solo mode works brilliantly.  I recommend combining with the 4-4-4 variant in the rulebook, to ensure high value monsters don't escape too early when you have no chance of stopping them.

Strongly recommended.

Love this game (I'm a sucker for cards) and I own all expansions.  Don't play epic.  Play home brew solitaire game where monsters don't just wander away when they exit the dungeon but raid your village and slowly eliminate your resources.  Once they take your village (empty it of cards), they begin taking cards from your deck.  Win by defeating the T Bearer before your deck is stripped clean.  I'm not a fan of Victory Points.  I want to feel like something is on the line.  Wrote rules out for my solo game in Variants forum.
Game is 6/7 with basic solo mode.

Fun game that I was thinking might replace dominion.  They are very similar, but the theme didn't excite me or make me feel as though it added much to the game... Going in the dungeon was cool and equipping my heroes made sense, but I felt as though dominions cards offered more interesting interactivity for engine building.  And the theme of dominion doesn't bother me in the first place, so, it's not a replacement for me.  Plus, the theme is off putting for new gamers (a lot of people new to the hobby aren't in love with fantasy themes).  Plus the box art scared my 4yr old son.

Eh, I'm not a deck builder fan for the most part anyway so any improvements over Dominion are lost on me. Thunderstone is good for what it is, but I'm not really interested in spending an evening playing these types of games. I liken it to chewing gum -- you're moving your mouth a lot and getting little bites of flavor each time but it's not a satisfying meal. We played 5P at first which was to much for my patience. I'd frequently have my turn figured out long, long before it came around to me and then I'd execute my turn in a few seconds and go back to waiting. One thing to chew gum but quite another to chew it very slowly. After two people left we tried again with 3P which is my preferred player count since the proceedings go much faster.

Played a handful of times so far.  To me, its Fantasy Dominion....which is not a bad thing.  Has a lot of variety and some fun combos you can come up with.

Enjoyed it but was pretty burnt out by the time it went back on the shelf.

Oh my Gods this is so slow......

They have taken all that is fun about Thunderstone and stripped it out!

This is so tediously slow as there is very little you can do to strip the starting cards (and accumulated monsters) out of your deck that on several occasions we have all just given up and packed this away. 
Far to often you are faced with a hand that you can do NOTHING with due to it being cluttered with starting cards or attacks of only 1 or 2 and so end up passing your turn and removing a single card from the game. 

Rinse-Repeat about 50+ times and soon you will be asleep around the table.

The board is a nice touch however if you have previously played thunderstone you don't need it. 

AEG are printing cards too fast for this and continually 'update' the versions thunderstone>dragonspire>advanced to sell the same game in a different wrapper to players without addressing the gameplay flaws. I am now fed up having purchased the same game for the third time, this time with all the fun distilled right out of it!

Rating is with an epic monsters variant (all monsters of the same level shuffled together).

One of Thunderstone Advance's great qualities is its versatility: I have played and enjoyed this game as a two-player game, a five-player game, and as a cooperative game. I've played it with custom campaign rules, themed setups, or just plain random setups. Probably the only thing I haven't been able to crack yet is the immensely unforgiving solo game. But regardless of the circumstances, Thunderstone Advance always provides a thoroughly fun experience. I particularly like the feeling of drafting the perfect collection of heroes and items, leveling up heroes, and the puzzle-like element of figuring how to defeat the monsters in the dungeon.

Occasionally, the luck factor does get annoying, such as when you draw monster-filled hands for several turns in a row. Also, the theme is your standard high fantasy fare, and I would have appreciated some more effort in making it distinctive. The Numenera expansion addresses this a bit. But neither complaint changes the fact that each game is always a blast to play, and is just brimming with customization potential.

RATING: 4
Dominion with a theme, a long duration, and lots of bloat and summing up of attack values. Played twice. Could be convinced to play one more time in the future.

[b]1st play: 3 stars[/b] Solo to learn rules. Game might be better with more.

[b]2nd play: 2 stars.[/b] This will probably be my last play. I have a number of problems with this game, which makes me bummed out, because some of the core concepts are good.

First: this is a lot like Dominion. To win you need cards with VPs; those cards are also what slow down your deck. The problems with Thunderstone are:

- It's long. Really long. Dominion takes less than 30 minutes a play. From my experience, and from reading online, games in Thunderstone are 60 minutes or more. There simply isn't that much more for me to enjoy here.

- The VP cards bog the game down. In Dominion, there are a number of ways to deal with VPs: draw and discard; discard and draw; many more ways to trash (and improve), etc. Thunderstone just loads up your deck with bloat and makes it harder and harder to act. Especially in a 2p game.

- The counting. There is no equivalent to this in Dominion. You are constantly adding up, modifying down, and adding battle effects before resolving cards. My head literally hurt from 90 minutes of this.

- The art. The artwork uses a dark, muted style that makes it hard to differentiate cards at a quick glance.

I used to love Dominion and burned out on it. I was hoping Thunderstone would reinvigorate the mechanics of the game, since the two are so similar. Except for leveling up heroes (fun, but not wildly more fun), Thunderstone doesn't add anything really positive for me except theme, and the payoff of theme doesn't offset the slog of mechanics.

Pros
-Objective based deck building game (slightly more interesting than just collect VP, even though that's what you're still doing)

-Lots of cards = lots of variety. Variants (in rulebook) also help
-Mostly backwards compatible with classic Thunderstone. Lots of expansions

Cons
-Repetitive gameplay
-Long game for the amount that gets done
-Lacks direct player interaction
-Uneven distribution of enemies (official variant helps a little)
-Uneven game pace due to above

While it plays very similar to Dominion, it has some unique features to set it apart.  Thunderstone has added a dungeon crawling aspect to the game, along with hero cards that can be leveled-up.

Elsőre kicsit vontatott volt, de szerintem lesz ez még jobb is. Ha tényleg lemenne 45-60 perc alatt, és ez alatt egy kalandozós, tematikus dominion feelinget adna, az nagyon jó lenne. Elsőre nagyon nehezen öltük le a szörnyikéket, és ezért el is húzódott, illetve kicsit a feeling rovására is ment.

Sajnos ennek ilyen a játékideje. Nem tudom miért írják rá a 45 percet, ha 2 óra a valós. Azért ez majdnem két kategóriával odébb van. Sajnos így kicsit vontatott nekem. Kár, mert a grafika és a hangulat nagyon tetszene, de bele kéne férnie 60 percbe.

RATING: 5
Advance is Thunderstone tidied up a little. Overall the changes seem to be quite beneficial: There is a little less stalling, more dungeoneering and quite generally not as much downtime. On the other hand, it feels to me like the easier and more level challenges in the dungeon hurt the game's narrative a little. All in all, if you like Thunderstone you will probably like this as well, if you don't then there is little hope that this will fix it for you.

RATING: 7
Best version of Thunderstone dogged by ropey production values such as slime covered cards, bent cards, colour stained cards and a general smell of printing fluid (an instant high).

Some good progress over old Thunderstone in terms of gameplay, but I felt they missed a trick in not introducing some kind of timer (as there is in the solo version) which would stop (mostly the random) setups lasting far far too long.

This is beginning to feel a bit dated now and there are better card games out there (e.g Netrunner, LoTR LCG) which have higher productions values and are better games.

I have all of the Advance expansions and had fun playing it over the years, but it is showing it's age and has been surpassed by modern deck builders.

Clank! also comes to mind like a way more fun implementation of the deck building mechanism.

An improvement of Thundestone but not as much as i was hoping. I can see the improvement of the cards and the mechanics but its not really an expansion but a remake of an average game. Not a great game but surely better than the original.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
A painfully lengthy setup does not afford unique games. Because higher level heroes are a limited resource and are worth victory points, it is quickly optimal to purchase all of the heroes put out at each game, meaning players cannot pursue divergent strategies. Because trashing and preparing (stacking the deck with cards in hand) are built into the rules, there is minimal deck management and no game is going to give a set of cards that encourages greater management of the deck than others beyond the usual "pair equipment with hero" or "draw bunches of heroes for your bard."
Dungeon delving comes with its own set of problems. In most instances, there is minimal randomness to combat, making dungeon delving a dull process of min/maxing. Trying to count up the different values for each monster's battle effect and darkness level every turn gets old really fast too. Upon successful killing of a monster, a player receives experience and takes the monster card into their deck. Because of the random nature of the shifting dungeon, it is possible for one player to come out as the only one with any experience points.
Every addition to the formula for deckbuilding ultimately only made the game worse. Pity.

(4 plays, underestimate)

Why is this longer than regular Thunderstone? I think it's the new Thunderstone Bearer rules.

I've played a handful of deckbuilders, and this is easily my favorite. The board, with its village area and progressively darker dungeon layers, creates a sense of space that's as immersive as the more literal dungeon crawlers that use miniatures. Since there's no direct conflict, it almost feels like a co-op because the ultimate goal of taking out the boss is the same. Building a party, equipping them, then heading into battle against foes is satisfying. My only complaint is that party building can drag.

Advance fixes the majority of the problems with the original game, but at the end of the day it is still Thunderstone.  The best way to describe this is if Dominion and Diablo II had a love child, you'd get this game.  It is no longer just fantasy Dominion, it is it's own game now, building on the framework provided by Dominion without being a clone.  

You get 500 cards, however the way the game is set up you see a good chunk of those cards every play through, so while there are tons of cards you only have a handful of spells, and weapons, so in any given game you will see the same spells and weapons over and over.  This will be addressed as they add more expansions to the Advance series, but right now it kind of stinks being limited.  I would not add mix the other sets with this one, the rules do not mesh perfectly and the cards look completely different.  While I was skeptical at first, I prefer the new card look and layout over the old one, but I still don't like the weight looking like iron rations.  If you like Thunderstone this is a must buy.  If you like deck builders and fantasy themes this is a must buy.  If you were thinking of buying Thunderstone and don't know which one to get, this is the must buy.

The length and lack of interest from friends ultimately led me to sell this, I played solo a bunch but you can actually solve the solo game and it was no longer fun

My first game of Thunderstone war more enjoyable than Dominion. However it solves not the problems of Deckbuilding-Games: constantly shuffling and repetitive actions: Draw 6 cards - have I enough attack value to enter dungeon? - no - let's see what I can buy in the village. Random setups can end up in many useless cards, so that you actually buy onle two or three different cards. This is not providing enough tactical choice. Maybe a second play is better.

Thunderstone wasn't broke. They shouldn't have "fixed" it. I consider the rule wherein you can keep some of your hand and throw the rest away sacrilege. The extra stuff like familiars and avatars doesn't appeal to me at all. They merely dilute the deck building focus. But I guess you don't have to play with that stuff. In the end, it's Thunderstone--it's a good game.

Play tracking note: I find myself playing Advance from time to time, sometimes mixed with standard. All plays will be recorded as Thunderstone base set.

Improves your starting deck and gives some extra variety. the Board and XP tokens are a big bonus but the artwork for me was better in the original. I use the board and tokens for original thunderstone as well.

RATING: 8
A good step forward in the evolution of Thunderstone. The original game had a lot of potential, but missed the mark in some key areas. In spite of that it was still a decent game. This makes the Thunderstone system more elegant, and clarifies some of issues with the original. After that it goes on to add things to up the complexity back to where it was in the original. However, these new additions appear to elegant enough as well, so the overall net gain is an improvement.

I am really impressed by the changes that have been wrought in this game; it's been transformed from a torpid waste of time to a tense and decision-filled fantasy deck-builder. Rarely has an edition of a game so thoroughly fixed the problems of its predecessor the way that ToR has.

RATING: 7.4
Not a huge fan of the deck building games, but this one is good.  I enjoy not building my deck to be able to purchase more points (dominion), but to be able to better fight through the dungeons and earn victory points for the monsters I slay.  It seems a bit more satisfying and you have more control over your deck, with the regroup phase...I can't remember what the phase is called, but you have the option of taking cards from your hand and placing them back on top of your deck saving them for a better combination.

RATING: 7.5
After having the game for nearly two years now, I have downgraded its rating from 8.5 to 7.5 when considering the base game only. I rate it slightly higher when expansions are included. (When a game is played with an expansion, I rate it under the expansion itself.)

It is still a good game, however, I find it's length (including setup and tear-down) to be a little longer than I would like for this game.

An excellent and thematic deck-building game.  I love that you can hire heroes and level them up over time and equip them with powerful weapons.  I love fighting monsters and deciding how to deal with their nasty effects, and I love that they both give you victory points and provide some benefit while in your hand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I like the theme and direction Thunderstone took over Dominion's literally "theme-less" presentation, but many mechanics and little things bring this game down. Having to put monsters into your deck that give paltry benefits(aside from VP at the end ) can make for terrible hands in future turns. Yes I know you can "prepare your hand" for the next turn, but I honestly think a better mechanic could've been used. It felt flat to me and didn't make "thematic" sense. I think the game could've benefited if it didn't copy/re-implement the Dominion formula of 1 buy, 1 action, etc. and went with something different/original/unique, but hey different strokes.

The game also takes way too long for what it is. a 3 player game can take near 2 hours. Albeit the solo game, becomes this rush for VP barely giving you any time to visit the village for those better items, spells and weapons. I've only played the standard and 4-4-4 mode(which SHOULD be the standard...sucks having a guardian or level 3 monster in the hall first turn). I never tried the "Epic Thunderstone" variant, which I hear is better. I sometimes wish I still owned the game, seeing as how its going for stupid prices now, but maybe I was wrong on it.

The expansions to the game add a nice slew of cards, but little else. This isn't a bad thing but more ways to buy and go to the dungeon at the same time/turn are always lacking(even more if you randomize your village. Into the Abyss is probably the best adding level 4 heroes (only for Into the Abyss and Worlds Collide sadly). 

The game has potential to be great. A few rules and mechanic changes can make it great, but doubtful since AEG has canned the franchise. Probably to make more themed Love Letters and Smash Up expansions.

I haven't played this recently, but from what I remember it was a decent game. I dislike how the monsters you beat clog up your deck and make it weaker (I like engine-building in games and this mechanic makes me feel like the game throws some sand between the gears to let others catch up). That's my biggest complaint, other than that it's pretty solid.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
People say that Thunderstone is the game that destroys Dominion, and I disagree.  Although there are several aspects of Thunderstone that are done much better (like the artwork and the variability of playable strategy), the game lacks the player interactiveness and fast-paced-flow present in Dominion.

Still, it is a good game.  To be fair, I haven't played this game a whole lot, and I am certainly open to revising this opinion with more game time that I'm looking forward to having.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
FIRST IMPRESSION:

I've just finished one playthough, so what follows is my first impression of this game.

There's a lot to like here, mostly surrounding the improvements to the core game mechanics.  The Thunderstone Bearer is an excellent game end change.  I agree with the designers, that conceptually, it makes a lot more sense than a stone floating through the dungeon to position one.  The game board is much, MUCH appreciated, as are the built in mechanisms for easing the havoc that randomization can incur.  This is the first time I've felt comfortable setting up the game with randomizer cards.

The new card design is also excellent.  And, I like having the prepare phase a lot, though arguably, this rule could just as easily be tacked on to previous versions.

The best improvement, in my opinion, is the streamlined changes to rules text.  Separating battle abilities into separate "battle", "aftermath", "raid" and "trophy" categories is a huge improvement.  There are still a few cards that I feel aren't quite clear and could use a bit of work, but largely, Thunderstone Advance feels much more carefully crafted than previous iterations.  And finally, FINALLY, there is a section in the rulebook that provides additional rules information for each card.  This section is not as extensive as I might have hoped, but that fact that it exists at all is a very welcome change.

There was one disappointing element.  Playtime seems unchanged.  The box claims a game should take 45 minutes, and AEG made a lot of rumbling in blog posts about shorting playtime with mechanical changes.  Howerver, a two player game still takes 60-75 minutes, just as before.  When I initially looked at the heroes, I noticed immediately that their inflated attack power values seemed higher than previous editions' heroes, and assumed that this would speed things up.  But, the enemies we ended up with in our first game also had higher defense values than I remember seeing previously as well.  There was not a single enemy below 5 defense and the ones that were below 7 had abilities that would raise their defense when attacked.  Naturally, the first ten to twenty turns were largely village expeditions, just as before.  AEG claimed that we'd be able to get into the dungeon with our six regulars and two polearms, but that was definitely not the case for us.  In case you're curious, we had level 1 skeletons, level 2 bird people and level 3 djinni.

I would recommend Thunderstone Advance to anyone who thinks a deckbuilder dungeon crawl would be fun.  I think such a person would enjoy Thunderstone Advance.  This is certainly the tightest and most fun this experience has ever been.  Although some rough edge still remains, Towers of Ruin is a very fun game, which I can enthusiastically recommend, and which I feel was a good investment for its price.

-------------------------------------------------------
PRE-PURCHASE THOUGHTS:

After Heart of Doom, I was convinced I was not going to purchase any more Thunderstone.  Then, after they announced this game, I was taken aback.  I thought that it was a bit offensive for AEG to release so much Thunderstone product before finally making fundamental revisions.  However, the previews have come in week after week, and Thunderstone Advance looks too good to pass up.  I'll be purchasing it for sure.

I will only play this game with two players. It just takes way too long with more than two and there is way to much sitting around staring at the wall while other people figure there crap out. More players also makes it harder to form a decent strategy from buying cards. Other than that the "Advance" game is an incremental improvement on the previous Thunderstone games but the base set is lacking in interesting cards for the town. The two expansions do a lot to make the game more interesting.

Bottom Line: Interesting but flawed deck building games. I would probably get rid of it but my wife really likes it.

RATING: 8
This game succeeds on two fronts:

1) It's a great game that I can play solo when I get a deckbuilding itch, given that Dominion being (best as a 3 player) isn't always easy to get to the table.

2) It slots reasonably well into the dungeon exploring theme, although it's not thematically as strong as something like LotR: TCG, but I had to give up on that due to the overbearing flaw of loosing before the game even starts if the monster deck and/or your player deck come out in a bad order.

This game basically plays like Dominion in the village phase in that you go into the village and buy cards to improve your deck, however the difference is if you decide to go into the dungeon instead of the village on your turn, then you use your deck to kill one of the 3/4 face up monsters from the monster deck.

Like Dominion it suffers from the problem of your deck getting flooded with victory point cards (defeated monsters), which is a managable feature in Dominion and more so in this game with most of them having gold value, and some having other utilities too.

Right now I love this game, in the future I can see long term replayability being an issue even with expansions but few games get that many plays in order to find out!

Amazingly fun deck building game.  More complex mechanics than Dominion, but the complexity comes with tighter theme integration for a really fun, deep game. This release adds some nice clarity, subtlety, and depth above and beyond the initial Thunderstone sets.

I enjoyed playing friends' copies of Thunderstone and its expansions, and this seemed like a good place to buy into it for myself. I'm certainly not disappointed. The theme works well with the levels of monsters, even if some tough opponents can come up early. In general, the adventurers seem able to punch back a bit harder too, with that bit of luck. The packaging and presentation is great too, except for the surprisingly dull board.

Gave my copy to my 13-year old nephew, who enjoys it more than I did. The best way to play it, we found, was as a solitaire where we worked together and argued over one hand—the cooperative mode is so-so, and as a competitive game, it feels weirdly anticlimactic for a dungeon crawler with a supposed "big" boss at the end. But the ticking clock of the solo mode makes for a fun puzzle—the last time I saw my nephew, we played the same set-up 4 times until we finally beat it. Which was a lot of fun.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (June 2013)

I really thought I would like this game. The components are superior to the previous Thunderstone, the art is great and in general, the game has high production values. Also the new starting hand is very powerful in itself and you have more options in the village, now you can prepare. However I don’t like it. I HEAVILY dislike the luck inherent in this game. It has a lot of luck in the dungeon (wilderness) decks, the familiars, and now the curses. Bottom line, it has a lot more luck than the original Thunderstone. I prefer a leveled field so the player who got the best strategy/combo wins. 

I was going to rate it a 3.0 because it took a long time to play, however that was due to a rules mistake (my friend notified me about this while I was writing this :D) so it is a 5.0 now. Still the game can take a while to play.

Another dislike is the involved and long setup, some friends complain about the long setup time of Dominion, this is three times as long, as you have to get the cards AND prepare the hero deck and worst of all prepare and shuffle a lot the dungeon deck. No good.

For me, Thunderstone Advance is a mediocre boring game, Dominion is miles ahead of this one (and still king of the deck builders for me). The only advantage Thunderstone has is the theme, still that is not enough to make me play it. I still prefer the original Thunderstone than Thunderstone Advance. Many friends like this game so try it before you buy it.

Under the hood this is Thunderstone, and Thunderstone is a solid game, not quite one of my favorites but worth playing sometimes.

The graphic design updates are good; cards are easier to read.  I'm not sure how I feel about fixing the town distribution - part of the fun of original Thunderstone was that "oh crap" feeling when only a single weapon came out.

The familiars are OK.  I do like the Darkness keyword - my first game was with the Caliginite hero, and I found it interesting how he keys off darkness and actually makes light sources a liability.

Dominion with theme. That settled the purchase for me. I am looking forward to bring this one out to my friends who didn't seem to like dominion too much but still liked the deck building mechanism.

Its Thunderstone which is a fantastic game.

Unfortunately I was very disappointed with this one the cards supplied are sub par given the high standards that have been set in previous expansions and core game.  The artwork is woeful and the re-arrangement of icons isn't better just different making mixing the sets awkward. 

No more Thunderstone for me unless they start providing decent content not just more to manage when my turn comes around.  It also doesn't mean re-realeasing what has already gone before it which seams to be what is going to happen with later advance edition games.

2016-02-20 - 7 - Good and thematic deckbuilder, although it is similar to Dominion to smoe degree. I'm not that big of a fan of this genre, but I like to play it from time to time. On the last game we had monsters without trophy effects - probably the game can be more interesting with another set of cards. 
I need to try the Epic variant and predefined "campaign". The rating might rise.
I own Worlds Collide expansion.

2016-04-04 - 7->6 - Deckbuilders are not my genre and I prefer them sometimes as the mechanism, not the game itself, although I can play it from time to time.

Currently one of my favorite deck builders.  Lots of options, tons of replayability.  I played two solo games with the same cards, and the order of cards appearing in the dungeon and my hand made for two very different games.  

The new board and rules for creating the dungeon will prevent some very weird combinations (too many spells, not enough weapons, etc...)  New option of a wilderness board with lower light penalties and four dungeon layers make for quicker games.  Really well done reboot of Thunderstone, which is a good game to begin with.

I did NOT like the original Thunderstone at all after a single play of it.  Perhaps I didn't give it much of a chance, perhaps I really just hate it.  Either way, I really DO like TA.  I feel like it is more streamlined and gives the player more options than the original.  Maybe I'm wrong, but hey, I enjoy it and now I own it.  haha

Update 05-28-2013 - I'm sorry to say that deck builders are falling out of favor with me.  I want pieces and strategical decisions to make and keep track of.  I still think this is a solid game though and will play, though I rarely suggest it anymore at this point.  Down to a 7.

"Fixes" Thunderstone in every possible way. The redesigned artwork and layout is fantastic and the small rules changes make the game last just long enough rather than outstaying it welcome by 15 minutes or so. Flavor text is an extra special bonus as it makes the game even more thematic.

My first game with 5 took way too long for what it is, and it didn't even involve much rules explanation. I might be convinced to try again with less players, but it's even worse multiplayer solitaire than Dominion, which it is no match for.

Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin, which is fully compatible with all previous Thunderstone offerings, is the next stop in your adventure. In Thunderstone Advance you build your party of heroes to defeat the dreaded Thunderstone Bearers in their dungeons or wilderness. The player who defeats the most valuable monsters will win the day, but beware – those monsters have all-new tricks up their sleeves, and victory will not come easy.Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin includes new rules, all new cards in new card frames, and a new village and dungeon board.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Feels more streamlined compared to the original Thunderstone. Still has the same issues of random village cards not matching up well with monster deck or hero decks. Such is life and it is still an interesting game. Games still feel they take a bit longer than they should though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
For experienced players ToR is pretty much more of the same with a few additional rules added in. The additional rules are a great addition to the TS universe (Prepare action, Familiars, Avatars, and TS Bearers). The clarity that has been brought to the game will be welcome by new players, as well as the ease with which you can go to the Dungeon with your initial hand. The new card design, and clean up affects, will also greatly reduce the learning curve with the game.

The new cards bring some great additions to the TS universe as well. More bards please!

The big complaint I have with this set is the artwork. It is absolutely the worst TS has ever looked. Seriously. This is a tent pole property for AEG by now, and they need to start paying illustrators more so that they can better talent in for the game. More Jason Engle please, seriously.

Un dominion Like en plus complexe puisqu'il ne suffit pas d'acheter des points de victoire, il faut acheter des armes, des objets, etc.. pour équiper nos héros (que l'on peut d'ailleurs monter de niveau grace à l'XP)... tout cela pour battre des monstres qui eux rapportent XP + VP.

Par contre une partie peut souvent durer 2 heures, chose impossible à Dominion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Feels similar to Dominion. A tad heavier than Dominion (Dungeon vs Village vs etc., on each turn; more "currencies" (Light, Attack, Strength,…)). BUT I feel less variety, as the card effects are often only quantitatively different (higher Strength, etc.)

The setup is a little long. The card dividers are less legible than Dominion's box insert, where labels are visible at all times.

The rules are not so streamlined: there is a special rule for (not) moving the Thunderstone bearer, a special rule for (not) destroying cards whose ability was used,…

Gaining so few victory points each time does not feel as good as gaining the larger victory point chunks from Dominion.

My first impression is that the deck has less flavor than in Dominion, maybe because the cards have similar effects (in some setups only?), and maybe because one has to balance Gold/Attack, which gives less character to the deck.

I still enjoy the special feeling of deck building, where the deck is only judged progressively, by going step by step, where an image of the deck progressively forms in our head.

Like in Dominion VPs (in this game monsters) clog up your deck, but here several of them have effects afterwards. This game has a lot of text and it is easy to forget you have something when trying to play quickly. Besides Sternkinn the cards seem much more balanced than I initially thought (Whetmage I feel is underrated), though not anywhere the level of Dominion. Has almost a dungeon crawl feel (unlike Dominion, where I have an engine building feel). 
Prepare and Rest are great but it's more out of necessity than out of a cool option since you can get bogged down with monsters. Some of the rules seemed unintuitive (like how Whetmage lets you level up a hero in the dungeon, but you still have to pay XP, or how destroy is before cards are played but discard is after).

Unfortunately, this game is a lot more clunky than Dominion, especially in the early game when no one can kill anything. Secondly, despite technically having way more set up combinations than Dominion, a change of a card stack in Thunderstone usually does not hugely affect how I play, unless it is part of a couple of really powerful combos. However, despite these flaws in mechanics Thunderstone still delivers in its great art, good solo play, good theme implementation, and its overall experience.

Bumped down to a 7 because while the game system is an 8 for me, I feel ToR unlike Caverns of Bane has too many cards that I will almost never buy.

Feels like it goes on about 25-30% too long, virtually every time.  But a nice production, and the early parts of leveling up your heroes and buying cool weapons is fun.  There seem to be too many cards (mainly Villagers) that just don't do much, though there may well be subtleties that I'm missing.  I think I like this game mostly for its appeal to the boy.

RATING: 8
Deck building game where you are acquiring adventurers, weapons, spells, etc to then go to the Dungeon and defeat monsters for points.  Very run game with a lot of interesting choices and big improvement on Dominion.  

A better game than original Thunderstone.  You have the ability to Prepare and there is a concept of battle and aftermath which is less confusing than the original game. You are much less likely to stall and there is a big monster at the end which is a more satisfying end than the Thunderstone card.   

I like this game more than original Thunderstone except for the artwork.  You can combine these cards with original Thunderstone but treat all original battle text as aftermath.

like the board , and everything really. Just epic is better with all the card so will be mixing it all together. with the prior sets.

A very solid dungeon crawling DBG. The advanced series makes lots of minor but very effective improvements over the original Thunderstone system. The core of the game remains the same though, so it's not like you have to relearn the entire game. It is perfectly compatible with older set, though I like to keep my Advanced sets together. That being said, I still feel like some of the gameplay mechanics just aren't used very much. In many games, the villager piles end up going untouched by my group. This is solved by a few useful villagers introduced in newer sets, but I still feel it's a problem.

We got this because I love fantasy themes, we both love deck-builders, and I was hoping this would be a more thematic Dominion-style game. One of the problems I had with Dominion was that it was all about the mechanisms and optimization for points.

Thunderstone Advance was more thematic, and we did like the fantasy theming. The problems outweighed the positives for us in the end, though.

We both felt the game went much too long at two players. (I don't know if it moves more quickly with more players.) We also were both frustrated with some elements of the rules because they weren't clear enough.

My husband didn't like the all-the-cards-are-available-at-once layout. He tends to prefer the Ascension-style purchase row because it helps narrow the options. (This didn't bother me.)

In the end, we have a lot of deck-builders, and this one wasn't good enough to make the cut.

Uno de mis juegos favoritos debido al tema y las mecánicas, pues se mezclan muy bien. Vas creando tu equpo para matar a los monstruos y eso hace que tenga sentido equipar armas, usar hechizos y sobretodo subir de nivel a tus heroes. Ahora siempre lo jugamos en modo épico y creo que es mi favorito porque la diversidad de cartas hace que los equipos y estrategias de los jugadores sean muy, muy diferentes.

Un contra es que el set up y la guardada del modo épico son un poco tardados.

9 - Excellent game. Always want to play it.

Hard to rate.  Good game, lacking in variety of cards in just this set.  Probably would be better with more, but not willing to 'dive in' and spend more on a game I would rate as a 'maybe'.  Also, it is really too long for what it is - most of our games run around twice as long as our typical dominion games. After playing both game recently (9/2014), I won't pick up any more of this and will stick with what I have for both games.

I'm still confused by this game. I have a feeling we've been playing it wrong, since it couldn't possibly have been as pointless as it felt. It was just overly long with very little strategic depth. I love Dominion and the synergies in it, but Thunderstone just felt like it was Dominion with more theme and less game.

My favorite deckbuilder so far (I have also played Dominion and Nightfall).  It has also been a hit with my gaming group.  I also have the CoB and RoC expansions.  I like playing with all the monsters mixed together, and then stacking the monster deck by level.  With 2 player, I like to do 6-8-8.

What I like:
- There is a large variety in card abilities, especially once you add in the expansions. This gives you a wide range of strategies to try out each game.
- Monsters also have good and bad abilities, and could give some benefit once it's in your hand, instead of just being a useless deck hog.
- You can vary the monster distribution to adjust difficulty

What I don't like:
- It's harder to fine tune your deck with more players because the heroes and other cards run out faster
- Downtime is longer with more players.  I like this best with 2 or 3 players
- Time pressure in solo/coop mode also means you can't fine tune your deck as much

I like this, but every time I play it, someone at our table experiences crazy analytic paralysis. The game eventually speeds up, but a turn can take 10 seconds or 5 minutes based on a players' awareness.

Like Thunderstone but tweaked a little.  I like it a lot after the first few plays.  Despite the changes that conceptually should speed it up, the more even strength of monsters has made our games longer than regular Thunderstone.  Still fun, but could play more often if it was a bit quicker.  I do think the old and new cards mix together very well and the change in card format doesn't bother me at all when mixed, really.  I like to play with cards from all my sets and the Thunderstone Randomizer for Android.

This game provides a consistently great experience.  It's deeper and more fiddly than Dominion, but it has a terrific sense of theme and well integrated mechanisms.  On the down side, the game can sometimes be a bit too long, and I worry that there is a slight "rich get richer" phenomenon.  I will always play this if someone's up for it!  I'd rate it closer to 9 except for its length, though playtime would decrease if I played it more consistently.

Played this a ton solo the week I got it (like 10 plays the first day).  The theme is right on, the deckbuilding is fun, the monster slaying is fun, the leveling up heroes is fun, the items, weapons, and spells are cool.  There are plenty of ways to customize the game and ramp up or down the difficulty.  The solo game presents some interesting strategic decisions, whether playing randomized or with scenarios.  I haven't purchased an expansion set yet, but I love that the option is there when I feel like adding something new to the mix.  Plus, I can pick up all the old cards as well if I'm so inclined.  I also love that this reliably clocks in from setup to tear down at 40-45 minutes.  My only real gripe with the game is that I got one of the over-inked first print runs, which leaves the cards sticky, smelly, waxy, greasy...just an overall weird sensation.  I would bust this out and play it right now though, so it deserves its nice ranking.

Ascension ist ein Deckbuilder, der relativ schnell nach Dominio veröffentlich wurde. In der "Advance"-Version, wurde das Spiel im Detail weiter verbesser und ist damit einer der besten Deckbuilder überhaupt. Die Spieler verkörpern klassische Fantasyhelden, die in einen Dungeon ziehen, um böse Monster zu verkloppen. Doch dafür benötigen sie Ausrüstung, Zaubersprüche und natürlich tapfere Recken. Diese werden aus der zentralen Auslage (Dorf) rekrutiert. Die Kämpfe machen einen besonderen Reiz in Thunderstone aus, das Element des "Lichts" im Dungeon ist eine coole Idee. Am besten spielt sich Thunderstone Advance übrigens, wenn man alle Dorfkarten zu einem riesigen Pool mischt und dann auslegt. Das erhöt die Spannung ungemein!

Great game and still even after all this time one of my favourite deckbuilders. However, I think it starts to show its age a bit. The setup time is a bit too long for my taste and some of the rules are quite fiddly. When it comes to speed of play, newer competitors do it better. From a game mechanisms standpoint, it's still going strong and don't even get me started on strength of theme on this one. Easily one of the most thematic deckbuilders out there.
Having owned its predecessor and all expansions at one time, the Advance version made all of it obsolete the second it was released.

UPDATE: Played the official Epic Variant. It is epic indeed and improves the base game!

I don't know if all new rules bring advantages to the gameplay. I do like the new regular and the combo with the polearm in d beginning. But I hate the new design. How can they use a pink background for items and weapons? And the level of the heros is really hard to see (tiny character beyond the hero name). I like the artwork of the old thunderstone much more.

This game has replaced, on my shelf, all other traditional deck-builders on the heavier scale, and strictly because of it's Epic variant. I have created a custom setup for Epic Thunderstone which I consider the ONLY way to play.

Really enjoying this solo so far, and my daughter enjoyed a two-player game of it as well. Easy to pick up if you're familiar with Dominion, but feels less abstract and more thematic.

RATING: 6
Deck building game. Fantasy themed whereby you build a deck of heroes and equipment before entering the dungeon to vanquish a monster (which gives victory and/ or experience points). I much prefer Dominion over this. 

PROS
-This game is all about the theme, which is done very well.

CONS
-Total lack of interaction.
-Repetitive fast.
-Not many tough decisions, path seems clear most of the time.

I can definitely see the improvement over the base sets of Thunderstone.  More to-the-point cards that at the same time are just more interesting and combo-friendly.  The game also starts at a much-needed faster pace.

But it doesn't make Thunderstone not Thunderstone.  So if you didn't like the original for minor reasons, you might like the Advance version, but it's not going to fix it entirely.

[B]TTS Play:[/B] Quite interesting. I felt a quick build up in power with some item/weapon buys, but then kept getting hands nerfed due to no hero draws.  It turned out to be a decent showing, given my lack of familiarity with the monsters - 43 v. 59 in the end.  The curse cards are brutal and the way defeated monsters clog your hand is a bit unnerving.  I can see how this was a thing back in the advent of deckbuilding games, but the NLB iterations on the mechanic are most likely better.  An iOS version of this akin to the Ascension app would be played a ton.

I think if your gaming circle is a little burnt out on Dominion this is a good deck building game to go to next.

This edition has a nice double-sided board to set up your cards.  The box has these nice dividers and foam inserts - would be nice if Dominion did the same thing as standard.

There is a learning curve and I would suggest following the tutorial and first scenarios just to get the rules clear in your mind.

Cards are pretty clear and have good art.  Can't figure out what sleeves they need though!

RATING: 9.5
So, this is one of my all time favourite games. I started playing this genre with Dominion but TA adds considerably to this with the ability to fight monsters, equip heroes with weapons and use spells. It is therefore slightly more complicated, but still not a difficult game. Compared to the older/original version, this is definately the one to get. It has improved card art work, a board and an improved game mechanic, where you can prepare your hand for a stronger set of cards for your next turn. Neat!

I have not got the most recent expansions yet but these are next on my purchase list. What I would really love though is an app for this, there is one for the original game, which is ok, but needs the polish and class of the new Thunderstone Advance version.

The same experience as the original, but this time with a TOTALLY AWESOME BOARD!!! Which ramps up the cost but does nothing to enhance the game-play unfortunately. Different monsters, different heroes, same game. Adding a base power (avatar) to differentiate players from the start is nice, but nothing game-changing. Still, if you're going to deck-build in a game, as with the original, doing it with a mission of monster bashing at least gives you some purpose, and this edition at least does nothing to break the game. It's just a big variant for those who love the game so much they must have them all, and for those who missed out on the original.

Really fun game!  I think it simulates preparing to enter a dungeon and fight monsters (then doing it) quite well for deck-building game.  There's enough variety in the cards that you can decide which direction/strategy you'd like when assembling your deck which also adds to replayability.  This is my favorite deck-builder.

RATING: 7
Quality game. Well thought-out reinvention of Thunderstone. Game plays longer than other deck-builders, though.

I feel this plays much better with the expansions.

Some positive notes:
-the game board is great for organization and for teaching.
-the village cards layout format is great.
-the dungeon deck is smartly redesigned with monster levels.
-the game has familiars, a curse deck with various cards, has more flavor text on the cards and in the rules.
-the initial box is made to hold more expansions.

I'm in the minority, but I prefer the old Thunderstone and expansions, warts and all. I wasn't taken in by the feel of TS Advance as I was with orig TS. I also wish there was more of Jason Engle's art in TSA than there is. 

Original Thunderstone to me feels like the Diablo video game series; Thunderstone Advance feels like The Elder Scrolls video game series.

Unfortunately, it plays too long for what it does. As of this writing, I'd rather play Ascension, Pathfinder ACG, or Legendary.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Overall, this is better than Thunderstone. I like the new curses, and the new monster ranks and light requirements. The board and graphics are nice. However, the monster abilities are too complicated, the terminology is a bit confusing, and there are quite a few ambiguities. The suggested first-game setup is bad, with confusing items and a hero type (elf) that is very dangerous to naive users.

If you liked Thunderstone, I would guess you'll like this. If you didn't like it, I doubt this will do any better.

The 2.6 weight seems reasonable. Our 3p learning game took 2 hours, which is way longer than a game like this should take.

I haven't played Thunderstone in a while, have all the old expansions, but havent had time to try it all, but after trying this I have lowered all my ratings thunderstone with "1". Why? Well, it had a basic flaw with balance between heroes, willagecards and dungeon monsters. Sometimes you get it going with a great balance between monster and your decks attack strength, and sometimes it's just impossible to create the deck you need to defeat the monsters. They have tried to counter this problem a little with the new action: planning, but that's not enough. Maybe the game is better if you play epic variants with all cards available. or you need to skip total random and go for combinations that work.

I had written some comments about wetmage being overpowered and royal summons being too expensive, but I soon got a message from Mark Wootton (one of the designers of the game) correcting all my misconceptions of the rules. So they are now ok. Thank you Mark! 

But that actually takes me to one thing I forgot to complain about before :-) the rules. Even if Advance have better rules than the basegame it still is very difficult to find bit's and pieces every time a question occurs, and as Mark pointed out, I missed a lot :-) even after him pointing out some rule I had to do a search in the PDF to find the rules he referred to. 

When it works it's a good game though.

The game itself has some very interesting mechanisms: upgrading warriors in the game, equipping weapons, etc. 

The game itself was less interesting than I would have liked, however. By halfway through the game, if you draw a hand without two warriors in it, you aren't able to fight any of the monsters out, but you often no longer need to purchase any additional cards.

Additionally, there are numerous cards with unclear language that left us arguing and referring back to the manual due to different interpretations of the wording. 

Overall, it felt like a 45 minute game that lasted over 90 only to seem heavier than it actually is.

Improved rule-set and great cards makes for a much better Thunderstone experience. Much better than the original series. It made a good game great. It is compatible with the old cards still with the use of a short faq. It's not ideal, but don't be afraid to mix in your old cards for more flavor and challenges. 

While not quite a 10 it is very enjoyable and can be challenging with the right setups. It is a solid 9 for me. Been loving the solo for now. Hope to try multi-player and co-op soon with two and see how that goes.

This is the first set where I don't feel like there are some lousy cards that are obvious bad buys in your setup.

This game is starting to get addicting and that's just the solo aspect. 

Thunderstone Advanced is the best jumping onto point in the series. 

Thunderstone is best played with Thunder master web app or unplugged version for intelligent setups.

edit: all future recorded plays include all existing sets as part of those plays. In other words all Thunderstone plays will be recorded under Thunderstone Advanced.

edit: co-op has turned out better than expected and my wife enjoys the game. She usually hates deck building but likes playing this one with me.

edit: Sadly this game is permanently out of print as is the previous version. I was lucky enough to be able to go all in on this one. Maybe AEG will be convinced to continue this franchise again someday.

Thunderstone: Advance is a stand-alone update of the original game, Thunderstone. The core game of the update is not that much different from the original, but it is better in terms of gameplay. Rules variants and changes to the initial hand make for a less bumpy ride due to unlucky draws. It's also a little easier getting off the ground at the start compared to the original game. The update still plays fast.

But, I don't feel like I'm really in control of enough decisions. Typically, if my hand doesn't have enough gold (

OK... I just spent an hour writing this review only to lose 80% of it due to a bad edit.

Conclusion: too abstract, poorly tacked theme, not enough decisions, number crunching. Pretty meh experience. I just can't get into this game. Love the art, but I just don't like all this shuffling and number comparing tedium. Waste of my money.

Think like a reimagining of Dominion with some extra rules keeping games from simply being a mad rush to get enough money to buy colonies.

Never quite took to this. It was always a wildcard purchase, and there's a lot to like, but there's too many deck building elements that make me uneasy - too many dead hands, too much shuffling, lots of counting, long set up and my games just took too long.

You know, it has finally dawned on me. After two base sets, and four expansions I've figured out that I don't like Thunderstone. I keep thinking that repeated plays (about 50 at this point) would help me understand the game and clear up all the hiccups. But it doesn't. The game is is still awkward and frustrating to play. Only a couple hero and item combinations are viable in any given game and some heroes and items [i]never[/i] get purchased because they're terrible. Killing monsters dilutes your deck and makes it more difficult to kill future monsters, necessitating more trips to town to pad your deck with actually useful cards. Thunderstone is a really great idea, but it's just not fun and it way overstays it's welcome, especially if you get a setup without really powerful combinations. Advance improves the system and makes it a little better, but I think the fundamental design of the game is simply broken.

There are definitely some minor improvements over the original Thunderstone. The new card design makes things clearer and easier to teach to new players. Also, the new prepare action players can take settles a lot of my issues with the dungeon getting bogged down.

These are all nice additions, however, the half that are mostly cosmetic weren't entirely necessary and the other half can be implemented into the original edition with almost zero effort. So yes, I enjoy Thunderstone more now, but i'm not sure I needed to buy a new game to realize it.

Another game only played solo.

Generic fantasy can be rather boring, but Thunderstone gets it right by giving you heroes with character arcs and tales of heroic dungeoneers diving deep into the ground to fight the corrupting influence of the Thunderstones (something I wish we had an actual card for) and their bearers.  And occasionally hanging out in the village to pal around and brag about our exploits (in my mind, in a manner befitting Gaston).

I love deck builders, so the base mechanism is gold for me.  But adding in the decision of whether to go the dungeon and fight for victory points or sit back and develop your deck for future fights in the village is deliciously tense.  I can't count the number of times I will look at a hand a see I am only 1 or 2 attack points from taking something out in the dungeon with 1 card draw.  Do I go for it, or bank it?  This is an especially crucial decision in the solo game, as, after the first 2-3 turns, if you don't fight a monster in the dungeon it will escape and terrorize you at the end of the game as victory points you need to overcome in order to win.

Probably my favorite aspect of deck builders is building combos.  This game has plenty of combo potential, and the base game scenarios have some really fun ones for you to exploit.  Nothing quite captures the feeling of looking at your hand, thinking you won't be able to do much this turn, only to realize you can kill the most powerful monster in the dungeon with some creative power usage.

Wow. This is amazing fun. I appreciate Dominion and it's mechanic - a fantsastic innovation - but it never grabbed me like it has so many others. This game, though, has me thinking abou it hours after I play. While it has the same mechanics as Dominion, it seems, for me, to tell a better story. I think I'm becoming a more thematic gamer!

Update: Can't totally explain it but this game really intrigues me. Climbing to the top.

To me, this is Thunderstone finally getting it right, or at least much closer to the mark. 

One of my biggest issues with Thunderstone's previous incarnations was how the game always seemed to bog down and everyone could spend several consecutive turns not able to do anything productive. The new prepare rule really helps smooth over some of those lulls. Sure, you are still not really doing anything on your turn, but you are setting up your next turn to (potentially) be successful, which feels so much more productive than simply resting yet again and hoping you can do something next turn.

The regulars are also a huge improvement over the militia and really seem to speed up the formerly dragging opening rounds. I don't feel the need to get them out of my deck immediately, and with them only costing 2 XP to level up, I've actually found myself occasionally going that route instead of simply resting them out of my hands.

Another thing that has smoothed out the gameplay for me are the variants for dungeon setup in the back of the rulebook. Starting with easy monsters and gradually getting to the harder ones just makes sense, and stops a lot of the early game-bogging-down dungeon disasters.

The new rules adjustments clean up the game nicely; a lot of the rules fiddiliness of earlier iterations is gone.

This is probably my deck builder of choice. I like the theme better than Dominion, Arctic Scavengers or even Marvel Legendary. I REALLY enjoy playing with the Epic variant rules (the only way I play in fact). It's a good solid deck builder. That having been said, it seems to require a bit more thought than others as it almost always takes us longer than advertised to complete the game. Not sure what we're doing wrong.

EDIT: I still kind of like this game, but...I find that it overstays its welcome, and I've definitely cooled on deck builders lately. I didn't give the KS of the new addition much of a thought in fact.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Hands down, this is the best game from the deckbuilding genre that I've played so far. It's similar to other deckbuilders in a sense that players gradually work their way up to buying more and more powerful stuff, but there are now two currencies (gold and attack) to deal with. Tying all this together is the dungeon-delving theme, which works wonders in providing a more flavourful narrative.

I also love the Prepare and Rest mechanisms – no other deckbuilder gives such a direct option of managing the hand and deck, and allows players to work even with a crap hand. As proof of its high replay value, I've gotten over 20+ games in so far with a different set of heroes, monsters and village cards each time. Even the solo option is quite good, although the game works best with 3P. 

There are a few criticisms though – the biggest is the mathy affair of battles. The game can definitely stall as players mentally factor in Dungeon and Battle effects, weapons, darkness penalties and so on. Another annoyance is the issue of the runaway winner. The winner of the first battle is able to level up heroes quicker, and the gap gradually amplifies if the others lag behind in attacking monsters. Lastly, the set-up and tearing down is tedious, even with assistance.

As a side note, it was a pleasant experience dealing with AEG's customer service. My set was missing a card, and a few others came slightly damaged. AEG replaced them quickly and with zero hassle.

[i]Update (Sept 2015):[/i] The above comment was written exactly 3 years ago, and I've finally decided to trade Thunderstone away. The decision mostly came down to the lack of a group willing to play this. While I still find it good, I am now far less hyperbolic about its upsides and more critical of its downsides. I've dropped its rating as a result, but am keeping it at a solid 8 to reflect the fun times I've had with this series.

Thunderstone Advance is a great game. As a deck builder it offers a lot more depth than games like Dominion. The cards are interesting and after a playing the game a couple of times there becomes a clear deck building phase and a questing phase (at least in our group). Despite all of this the game does have a few problems. There could be more interactions between players and games with more than three people can take quite a while. But if your looking for a new deck builder that offers a bit more depth than games like Dominion you will like Thunderstone.

Thunderstone új köntösben. Jobb ikonozás, hibajavítások, familiárisok bevezetése, tábla, gyönyörű kivitel. Már a régi Thunderstone is sokkal jobban bejött, mint a Dominion így ráugrottam az új kiadásra. Nem csalódtam. Szerintem az egyik legjobb pakliépítős játék. Hibájának talán a hosszú elő és elpakolási időt, illetve a kezdő játékosokonak való betanítási időt tudom említeni. Igazából 4-5-en nem rutinos játékosokkal már túl hosszú lehet.

i was going to trade this away, and decided to see if my son would like it.  He loved it and keeps saying, "you were going to trade this away???"

I personally don't like deck builders a lot, and if I play one, I prefer the ones that utilize deck trimming as a major game strategy.  So, I would still actually like to get rid of this and would rather get my son into Mage Wars (which I did just trade away, as i don't think that one will get enough playing time that it needs to make it competitive and fun). 

So, looks like this one is a keeper, and i might pick up some expansions, as long as my son likes it!

Update 9/5/2014 - looks like this is going on the trading block.  We do like this game, but it takes too long!  Can play it using solo rules where the monsters come off the board, maybe we'll try that to speed things up and see if that is a better game.

Owing to easier setup and more elegant rules, Dominion is the better game with wider appeal. But Thunderstone feels meatier: whereas I want to play Dominion more than once, I'm satisfied after just one game of Thunderstone. I'm just not sure that's a good thing. Besides, Thunderstone is even more of a solitaire game than Dominion.

I love the new starting decks and rules tweaks to vanilla Thunderstone.  They make everything feel more fresh, challenging, and most importantly, you always seem to have something to do whereas as much as I liked Thunderstone there were certain turns where you really didn't have a good option.

The Regulars and Thunderstone Shards remain usable from beginning to end of game unlike the Militia and Rations from Thunderstone.  Upgrading Regulars for 2XP instead of 3 was also a great decision.  Preparing hands takes a little bit of the random nature out of the game that can sometimes make it stagnant.  Being able to get rid of any curse without the need for a priest helps clear junk from your hand without wasting a turn resting.  The list goes on and on, I don't have an issue with any of the new rules tweaks or cards, home run AEG!

Deck-building games like this absolutely need expansions to stay fresh for me.  Since the above glowing review I've lost 90% of my enthusiasm for this game simply because with repeat plays I've seen the same cards over and over again.  Everything I said is still accurate, it is still a fun and well-designed game with great improvements over vanilla Thunderstone, but without an expansion this game will slowly start to collect dust on my shelf which isn't a criticism of the game itself, just a shortcoming of the game type for me.  Perhaps there is a critical mass where enough cards are in the pool that each repeat play will feel fresh, I still enjoy repeat plays of Dominion with the sheer breadth of options available after all.

This is also one of my wife's favorite games in our collection.

For me it was a little hyped and i felt a bit of a led down

Decent game though and a major improvement over Dominion by adding more flavor to it.

Perhaps my opinion will change over time, when i play it some more.

I couldn't go back to Dominion after I played this the first time. The theme is a typical fantasy theme, but it really comes through.

It's just tons of fun and my fav deck builder. The expansions are all very good as well; adding to the staying power.

Thunderstone Advance is a great game, by far my favorite deck-builder (gods how I hate Dominion). It makes you start play immediately, not having to pass turn upon turn just buying cards until you have a deck that actually make stuff happen in play (that's Dominion fyi).
This is a good starting set, but in being very generic it has its greatest merit and greatest flaw. The flaw being: you immediately feel like buying expansions. Numenera is much more interesting as far as the cards included in the set go. I bought Towers of Ruin as my first set and now that I also have Numenera, I feel like I shouldn't have, and should have stuck with Numenera instead. I only play ToR because it fits thematically better with the other two expansions I have, Root of Corruption and Caverns of Bane, whereas Numenera is best played by itself.

A revamp and a restart of sorts for the Thunderstone series. Fully compatible with everything that comes before it.
While it fixes some issues with ending the game and beefs up the starting deck, it breaks some of the older heroes and items. It also changed the randomizers and how monsters are chosen for the dungeon, so I'm going to pass on the game from here on in.

It was Robert of Black Belt Gaming that first truly brought this to my attention.
I really like the variety of possibilities the game offers.
At this point it's my favorite game (Jan. 2016) and has been for a while. Gaming is so very subjective, but for my part I "feel" the theme of this game and that means a lot because that's rare for me.
Good about the game: Massive replayability and awesome fan-made variants.
Not good about the game: Some cards aren't intended for solo play and I rarely realize that until I am well into a game.

RATING: 3
Rating lowered slightly for being such a small difference in rules compared to original Thunderstone. An entirely new box for a slight improvement in clarity and a lengthier playtime seems like BS. 

Thunderstone was bad, but it didn't annoy me. This game does. Stopped playing 2/3rds through 1st play. 

I'm still trying to figure out where the "advanced" portion comes in.

RATING: 7
Good mix of Dominion-style (fixed village content) deck builder and fantasy dungeon crawl. You build up your party, you get to level up your heroes, you acquire needed equipment and then you go out and beat up monsters. Or get beaten up by them. Good selection of cards in the game, a solid insert and all needed "fluff" like dividers and randomizers. Setup takes a moment due to the randomization, but if you want something to setup quickly, just prebuild a setup and keep it together in one of the insert slots, so you can start with a known scenario. Game play maybe a bit longish for it's complexity and a bit shortish for the leveling up (when you finally get level 3 heroes, often the game ends soon after). But overall a very enjoyable game. Plays very well as a solo experience, too, because you can tune its level to your mood.

A better Dominion. The cards, the upgrades/xp, the whole dungeon/wilderness are more interesting and so is the gameplay. only downside is the longer playing time but I'll take that if I can get this more interesting setup. There is a bit more luck in this game than dominion though - especially when the big VP creatures happen to come out on your or your opponents turn can really determine the game.

a thunderstone a facebook verzió miatt tetszett meg az alapverzió, de mégsem eléggé, hogy megvegyem. az átdolgozott verzió már jobban tetszett és nem csalódtam, a sok modult pedig bár nem próbáltam, nagyon jónak tartom, nem csak párszorhasználatos lesz a játék!

Just not for me. I do enjoy Dominion, but not excessively.

This one was just too slow for what it gives in return. Every game started out interesting but just ended up with all of us waiting to draw the right hand, so we could go to the dungeon. Nicely thematic, though.

Might try the epic variant before i sell it off.

A great fantasy deckbuilder.  Solo play is touch, but playing with friends has a lot of tactical play...hard to know just who is winning sometimes.

Made better with Epic Thunderstone variant though - truly like embarking on a fantasy adventure, as you use all the cards, not just a subset.  Since you do get lots, this does make sense for that reason too.

Was an 8, now going down to the ever enlarging group of 7s. Played recently and it just wasn't competitive. I destroyed everyone by getting a lucky combo, not because I implemented a great strategy.

I feel that's how most wins happen in this game, though not all.

Really like the addition of the board, makes it more thematic somehow. Ditto for the scenarios, familiars, thunderstone bearers and avatars (although charging another £10 for the latter is bloody annoying, that's a third of the cost of the original game!). 
Having sold the previous incarnation I'm much happier with this one.

RATING: 9.5
I like a lot of the changes they made here.  I play epic style and I like how they ramped up the amount of experience you can gain with the thunderstone shards and some familiar powers.  The added experience coupled with the prepare action makes the game less likely to stall.  The card art is fine and the board adds a lot and works well with the epic variant.  

I considered only using the Advance cards, but after sorting all the cards there was no way that I thought I would have enough variety, since I am used to playing with all the older expansions.  So, I threw everything together and it works fine.

Edit: Now with several expansion I only use advance heroes with their new levels.  I still mix the old hero, weapon and village cards in.

RATING: 7
We'll try this and see how it works.

It's looking good after one game.  We got into the dungeon much quicker and success isn't always guaranteed any more.  XP also tended to build up causing us to rethink acquiring and upgrading heroes.

Our Thunderstone collection has moved into two of the larger boxes with a bit of room left over.

The real question is "why the heck should we buy the whole thing over again?"  It's better, but is it that much better?

Grail game.  Thunderstorms 2.0. This is the version to get. I much prefer the adventure feel of coordinating your hand of heroes, items and weapons and of course torch light to delve into the dungeon. The board adds a nice aid for village randomized setup. I love the trash and prepare actions to thin a card at will and the option to pass on a lame draw by recycling the good parts of your hand to the top of your deck. Totally dig the hero leveling mechanism that simultaneously thins your deck and adds the adventure feel of more powerful heroes--brilliant. And of course the game end condition of defeating a big baddy is exactly as it should be.

waited a long time for this. Could well be trading Dominion and Ascension if all turns out well... provisional score:  can't wait/10

update - can't be arsed to set it up: think I've had my fill of deck-builders and probably prefer ascension's simplicity.

update 7.6.2014
Did set it up and had a play. Glad I had the patience as it's a wonderful game, with highlights being the character levelling:"ooh, +5 attack now... nice!" and dungeon management: "Please be an attack card, please be..." Looks like a solid solo experience is in there, too.

Awesome deckbuilder. Often refered as a Dominion Copy with an adventure theme, and it´s probably truth, but the feel to play this game feels very different.

Cons: AEG keeps making new editions of the system wich is annoying.

Two of my best friends are Thunderstone fans, but I just cannot get into the basic game. I find the game overly long, and with way too much downtime. It's also prone to card displays that are quite simply dull, or downright incompatible between what's available in the Village, and what monsters are in the Dungeon. Even the iconography bothers me as you cannot tell what icons, and numbers are on your opponents cards as they sit there adding up their attack or money values, over, and over, and over again.

Still, the basic concepts are interesting. The artwork is very good. Leveling up characters is fun (however, seeing other players buy them before you're able to level up is not). So I like the idea of the game, but in practice it drives me a bit batty.

Luckily I think most of my issues are solved by the Epic rules. I may rate Epic Thunderstone with my variants a 7, while the regular game deserves a 4.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I really like this game. Very replayable with Epic rules. I like the system very much. Very enjoyable in solo-mode too. I don't play games solo but this is the one game I could think of playing solo. On the downside, the way the board is designed makes it a bit hard for players around the table to get access to the cards and their abilities. I guess once players get used to the game this issue disappears with time. Note that I give this a high rating IF PLAYED by my own house rules.

I really like this game. In this deckbuilding game, you really have to optimize your deck, much more than in Dominion, because you don't have a lot of combos like in Dominion. In this game you, have so many more choices than just playing a card, buying a card. 

Plus I feel like, I have more to do with my deck. In Domimion, you're just buying card. In Thunderstone, you have to defeat the monsters(not just buying them, like DC or Ascension)

Prettier Thunderstone.  That's really all I got.  I'm tempted to penalize it a quarter point just for dumbing down the light rules.  If you can't multiply 2x3 in your head and add it to 4, you probably shouldn't be playing boardgames like the ones we generally talk about on this site.

Note that some would argue this is uglier Thunderstone, so the art is purely subjective.  I thought it was a VERY mild improvement.  YMMV.

I was interested in Thunderstone for a while, and I almost joined in on the game when Advance was released, but I remained on the fence.  I didn't have any experience with deck-building games, and everyone kept comparing it with Dominion.  Well, I finally had the opportunity to give Dominion a try.  It was fun, and while I don't have any intentions of buying Dominion, I purchased Thunderstone: Advance and have been enjoying it immensely.  It has a lot more of what I'm looking for than Dominion does (ie. monsters, experience, dungeon-crawling, longer gameplay).

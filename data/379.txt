not a BAD game but not a GOOD game. I still consider myself as having it in my collection, but truth be told, the last time I saw it, one of my cats had peed on it and it smelled very much like cat urine.

So rather than offer my own review, I'll use hers: "This looks like a great place for me to urinate."

Hmm. Train Rummy, with a few special cards. Kind of confusing at first, but then a few strategies having to do with locos and card denial start coming through. I wish we'd played with the partnership rules, which would've allowed some interesting loco play. I'd play again but I'm not rushing towards it.

Good game with some interesting dynamics. You play hands until you reach a certain score (a la Gin Rummy). In each hand you form trains based on like color train cars. There are disaster cards that can be played and cards that help you avoid disasters (a la Milles Bornes). It can be a little complicated when you first start out, but once you get the rules down it plays quickly.

Around the house we enjoy occasional rummy games.  Express is good and I enjoy it.  It's a rummy game with some Mille Bornes disaster cards thrown in.  We usually have plenty of protection cards to make disaster cards kind of meaningless.  Of the rummy games I've tried I like Al Capone the best (of the mystery rummy series)  In express you can't dig through the discard pile like you can in Al Capone, and Express has more rules to learn.  I've never played Express in partners.  Over all it's a simple, almost traditional card game that you can play with non gamers.  Artwork is very simple but good and the cards are sturdy.

Easy and plays fast.

The basic game (no wild cards, way cards, etc.) is easy to learn and very fun. The hand-size and going out restrictions make for interesting play. We have also played with the full rules, 2 players, and this adds a lot to the game - just a  fun game.

(Acquired December 2006 -- a surprise gift from a fellow gamer)

May 2009 -- We have finally looked at this game (just never found a good time, until this year). We generally do not play partnership games, but play most games with six players, so it's not a real good fit for our usual sessions. However, everyone thought it might be worth trying someday.

Update February 2012 -- Our family group has decided to try playing different game genres, including team and partnership games, so I expect we will get this one out and try it.

First played June 20th, 2007.  This is a quick learn (5min), however for what it was, it took too long in a 4 player game (90min).  You will need to play it once before you know what strategy to do.  I don't know if I'd recommend this as a game play.  It seems to be more of a filler game and it takes too long for that.

Simple card game with lots of tough choices that produce a fun degree of anxiety. Only an adequate 6 as a 2 player game, the partnership elements raise it to a 7. In the 2 player game the Wreck card and the inability to 'protect' a discard detract relative to the multiplayer versions.

Update: The Wreck card should be discarded.

Has some "take that" cards where you can interfere with your opponents, along with safety cards that block along with scoring points.

RATING: 4
Clever mechanics, but it feels like you're fighting against the game, not against your players.

The very tight hand limits combined with the nasty take-that cards make this a luck fest. Yes, you can save up cards; each meld includes an arbitrary face-down card, which you can change during your turn. This is especially clever, but still, a player who is lucky enough to go out first tends to win.

Perhaps this is better as a partnership game?

A train card game based on rummy.  I certainly see why I got it.  Now if I can only find time to play :)  [N/A]
----------------------------------------------
Well, I finally was able to play it.  I can't say that I was particularly enthused.  Sure, it's a rummy game...with tweaks.  There are some ideas that I like.  One of these is the use of locomotive cards to keep things in your possession, but not in your hand.  Of course, I like the melding from rummy.  I'm not sure if I like the Way cards or not.  It will take a few more plays to decide that.

My biggest complaint relates to the wild cards.  It seems that most of the hands ended with players drawing wild cards.  I suppose that is ok as far as the game goes, but it is too easy to simply set things up so that wilds will help you go out.  I'm not sure that should be the dominant strategy.  (It does seem to work in High Bid, though.)  I'll need to play more games to solidify my opinion on that matter.  [07/08/2012]

[Mayfair 91 edition] {Train; rummy-variant, partnership; optimal 2/3 teams} [Individual play 4, partnership 6.5] I bought it due to Tony's recommendation. It is a nice tactical rummy game.  The function cards are nicely designed - they provide many tactical choices and fun.  Without partnership, it's just an average rummy variant. With partnership, the game becomes more tactical and fun. Exchanging information with Loco is an ingenious design; it allows player to communicate information and formulate ambush plans.

I rate it lower than Mystery Rummy series just because the theme and illustration are not as attractive for me and the rule is fiddlier.  However, it is as good as those games, as a rummy-variant.

A train card game that is simple and fun. There is a small backstab factor and some strategy. It normally gets passed up for other games though.

Have only played as a 2-player game. Probably plays better as a 4-pl. partnership game.

I have worn out a deck of these cards. A fun rummy-like card game.

Played a few times when it first came out, requires a large surface.  Simple rules train game.

Another of my train card games.  I like this one better than my gaming group, I think the mechanic is nifty and the goal leads to tight strategy and just a bit of luck.  You can't just sit and play things out.

My wife and I love to play this game when we only have time for a quick filler.  Probably play it 2 or 3 times a week.  Every week.  Trains and rummy... what's not to like?!

Feels like a good game met up with Milles Borne and picked up some bad ideas :P  Some decent gameplay, but kind of bland and has annoying & unnecessary 'screw you' cards.

This is a variation on Rummy, and though it has some interesting ideas in it, the reasons I don't like Rummy much (low control and focus on discards) are still present in this one.  There's also the addition of screwage cards which don't do the game any favors.  It's not all bad, though -- the locomotive mechanic, where you use a card face-down to finish your meld is a truly inspired addition which opens up opportunity for some clever play.  The doubling of the Express also adds an element of strategy, even if the graphic design and usability of those cards leaves much to be desired.

All in all, I'm not likely to suggest this game for play, but I readily acknowledge that I'm not really the target audience.  The game is clearly intended for Rummy lovers, and I'm not sure how they would feel about this one.  I could see an argument for this being one of the best examples of the genre and worthy of frequent play, but I could also see that it could be dismissed as an unnecessary complication to an already great game.

A set collecting card game. I like the trains.

RATING: 5.5
Somewhat painful. Very basic graphics design with obtuse rules that seem overly complex for the take-that nature of the game. Basic set collection with some added bits from other popular card games.

Lots of special cards make this game harder to teach to new players, though it's pretty easy.

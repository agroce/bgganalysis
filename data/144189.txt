RATING: 9
"You get out what you put in, and you put in a ton." I spent upwards of 15 hours studying the rules and doing the walk-through to get to the point where I could sit down and get the absolute vast majority of rules correct. After 9 plays in 5 months (and 15+ in 2015 alone), I really appreciate and fundamentally love the game. The decisions you make near the end of the game are some of your most critical (truly the Pareto Principle), it uses lots of mechanics I like, it has lots of connected aspects. Because it's like having four different sets of rules (one for each faction), there are numerous things to sit and juggle in the giant problem space to keep me interested. The thematic integration (from my research and speaking with veterans) is fantastic, even if some liberties were taken in the interest of the game space. 

That is to say, there aren't some downsides; games take a *long* time to play compared to the rest of my collection (and I really want to get a game table because of that so I can leave it setup and just pause it, although Vassal is an acceptable alternative if necessary). Second, especially in the short game, I find that it's coming down to who can game the final coup card best.

Neither of these downsides prevent me from advocating for the game or playing it though. Solid effort, glad I picked up a copy.

Update1: Even 6 months after getting a copy and 11 games later, I'm confident it's one of my few 9s. Very few games do I just sit and think about in my spare time. This has been one of the surprises of our gaming group; if people can just get through the rules and the first game, they come back for more...

Update2: Still awesome, really a fantastic design, even if it is sort of cumbersome. I've taught a number of people and the personal best is about an hour of explaining things, maybe 90min. One of the very few games I'll even PBEM over Vassal or play solo.

Update3: One thought that has been bouncing around in my head for the last 5 or 6 games is how much this is less of a single player game vs a team game that degrades into a single player game. I think the general pathway to success is to act as a cooperative team (within some limits) and then over the course of the game, that cooperation degrades. If both sides do that, it follows a model of Eklund's games where it becomes more and more unstable as the game wears on. If one side *doesn't* though, it seems that the other side gets it's act together much better and wins. In short, I think the self-interest is not purely in self so much as ensuring your teammate does well enough to provide you cover.

I don´t owned.
This was my first experience with the COIN system.
Apparently the Mighty and venerable USA wargame publisher GMT surrendered to the charms of the euro style and colored cubes :)
Frankly I would preferred a more martial appearance with counters/tiles & Nato symbols BUT ..... times are changing :(
Concerning gameplay I feel the card play/manegament for four players clumsy and muddle. Each player (at same time) must read both cards and events and decide a lot of considerations (events, operations, map situation, etc) taking to much time. 
Despite of being a four-player system it works surprising well in simulating the quagmire of Vietnam.
The vietcong faction can be a little weird, but works.
One small scenario can be played in 2-4 hours.

There is a phrase in advertising: if you don't "get it," you ain't the audience. I am most definitely not the audience for COIN.

I tried it. I won it. I didn't love it. I didn't even enjoy it. I thought the gamey "King of the Hill" stuff meant I don't like playing it with players, so I tried it solitaire. It just comes down to this: I don't have fun playing COIN. It's not this game. It's COIN. And believe me, I have tried harder to love this game than any other game that I don't love.

I love Mark Herman's games, but this one doesn't have what I love about so many of his other designs: the inability to know how much force your opponent can bring to bear at any time. That much I can put my finger on. The rest? I can't. The system has a slow and deliberate pace I don't enjoy. OK, I can put my finger on that.  The rest? Not so much. It makes sense when you read the rules and then when you play the game, it feels like it's a big abstract puzzle. It probably goes back to I'm not the audience.

But it sure is a purty game and the rule book is amazing. The player aids are top notch. The playbook is great. And people love this game and it really really really bugs me that I don't.

RATING: 4
First impression: Feels like an overcomplex eurogame. Bots are tedious to play. The rules are written in a way that really challenges your cognitive abilities - 11 pages from hell. The mounted board, cards and playing pieces are beautiful. Setup is lengthy. You drown in decisions to make. Victory conditions make resulting tactics endless, but boiling down to just always go against the leading player. This one is twisting and turning your brain to the maximum. Exhausting to play. El Grande must have been the inspiration for the underlying design. Soloplay drives you to the brink of madness in figuring out what to do next.

UPDATE: Watched Derek Case (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmA7iEUYO6s) review...i may be back to fight that battle of the damned another day...but now i need to take a deep breath and play through some other games.

I finally got to actually play a COIN game at Kublacon (even though I own all of them). This is easily one of the best games I have ever played, and is the best wargame I have ever played. The gameplay is so historically founded, has interesting effects, and encourages complex alliances. The only problem is the game is so complicated it is hard to imagine a situation where it would get played again before the next Kublacon.

Incredible game. It is my first Vietnam War game and I feel I don't need to try any other.

I think it's really cool how the designer was able to model the dynamics of the forces involved. I specially like how the US actions are modeled incentivising the player not to commit too many troops. I think that's just brilliant.

I'm still trying to figure out how to best play with each faction. In other words, still taking a beating from myself.

At its core, Fire in the Lake is an well-crafted mixture of a Card-driven wargame and an area control eurogame. With only 12 pages of rules, this is a wargame that my Euro-only gaming buddies are not so much afraid to experiment with. 

Given our Latin American background, Andean Abyss is a more popular title in our group, but this one is starting to grow on my buddies' hearts and minds...

Terrifically difficult to rate this after a single play, but I'll give it a shot. Didn't read the rules, was taught on the spot. Also my first COIN game. Played the US here. Great theme. Great card theme too, although the extent to which they don't really come into play (or do I guess depending on random pulls) was relatively disappointing. Really liked having the bot/AI thing just to guide my own basic decisions until I found my sea legs. Everyone seems very on-rails in terms of, "your one true scoring path is this, so clear your way toward it." Very interested in replaying. Suspect I'll be disappointed with others if this is the peak of the system, as many think it is?

This is my third exposure to a COIN game.

At first, I was nervous that every COIN game would feel same-ish. After all, they all use the same system, and my other experiences with similar system games (i.e, block wargames) has left a bland taste in my mouth...

The interactions between factions in each game are proving to be so unique that each game is completely distinct.

Fire in the Lake involves a much closer interaction between two "teams" of factions. That is, the ARVN and the US have a less Icy relationship than the comparable Coalition and Government of A Distant Plain. Likewise, the NVA and VC are buddy-buddy, while the Taliban and Warlords aren't really allies at all.

This lends itself to an awesome two-player dynamic, which the other COIN games don't really have. In practice, this means it will hit my table a lot more often than A Distant Plain.

As far as mechanical differences, Fire in the Lake introduces Pivotal Event cards, which add an element of planning ahead that you can't really have in the previous games, setting yourself up to make use of a Pivotal Event is a large part of the game.

Finally, there are three types of "troop" in the game which makes this more about open warfare, and less about insurgent combat than the other games. This brings a dynamic that forces the US into fights that they don't necessarily want to be pursuing, unlike ADP where they can try to ignore a reeling Taliban.

All in all, this game is awesome, this series is awesome, and it's all I want to play for a while!

I'm finding this this game more interesting than Andean Abyss, with problems that plagued the former not as pronounced. So the game is still potentially quite long and you still go around attacking the leaders but it doesn't seem to be as easy. Still not a game I would want to own or suggest but I'm willing to play it.

Update: after several games I think it comes down to guessing when a scoring card will come up and making a push for the win. I don't enjoy playing this.

An complete over-rated game from the masterful designer of Labyrinth :

While the thematic is very much present and attractive, this new game of Volko Ruhnke emphasizes the problems encountered with this games series. While cllearly original and historically accurate, the game suffers a lot from his game mechanics :

- between each coup card, an average 12 event cards are played. For each two players can play so between two coups cards, you only play six times in average. When you play, 50 % of the time, you will only play a limited op (i.e. an action in only one space of the map) and play a complete ops ( in any numbers of spaces on the map) BUT when time is coming for you to play, most of the time, it will corresponds to an event card related to your side : the direct impact is that from 1 third to 50% of your plays will be dedicated to play the event to prevent his nasty effects or to take proffit of it. 
So ultimately you will play three complete ops or limited ops. So your ability to weight on the map is really limited. But is this a problem ? Actually YES. I play Andean Abyss, Distant plains and finally Fire in The Lake more than three times at least for the two first games and with that hindsight, it appears that complete op needs to much play time to play for one player while the other three have to wait. On the other hand, the limited op is so limited that it let the impression to have actually done near nothing.  
Finally, in each game, every player we spend a HUGE amount of time waiting for the other players and often to have a quick play while arbitraging an event or playing a limited op (which is longer to play). 
This problem is common to all games in COIN series, and if we compare the COIN game mechanics to other asymetric games (relatively speaking for example, Chaos in the Old World which is a jewel of gameplay and balance among asymetric multi-players games), the COIN systems is cumbersome and not very ergonomic : In the Fire in the Lake, this fact is particularly true, a lot rules are unclear in the player aids and needs constant returns to the rulebook and even after that, debates can't be undoubtfully closed... 
More : the presentation of different possible operation are very confusing since the very beginning of the serie because most of the possible operation have a "swiss knife" side : for example Rally for insurgents, Train for US or government offers to operate in different ways that are each exclusive of the other. Why don't the developers of the games make them appear as clear different operations instead of maintaining such confusion ???
The problem is all the more serious as the asymetric feature of the game needs everybody to play each camp to get a good view of how to play better. So if you really are in love with the thematic, you will to spend 20 hours of games before getting a chance to have a beginning of mastery of the strategics in the game. And you will spend at least 50 % of this time waiting for other players. And guess what ? You will have to find other (foo..) guys willing to pay waiting like you to get a chance that they get the same mastery in order to have a balanced game not dominated by a more experimented player.
So sorry, but Volko Runhke do design a great game : Labyrinth and i think this great success blinded people in believing Volko will prove successful in designing great games with the COIN serie whereas, for me, it's absolutely not the case. The COIN game system is simply bogged down and needs a serious lifting to become enjoyable. 
To be historically accurate is good thing but it isn't sufficient to provide even a very average game. In a time where a lot of excellent game exists (try Angola !), it isn't sufficient and i won't be surprised when the "Volko love bubble" will have disappeared that this game will be forgotten in the limbos of old games waiting on a dusty shelf.

See my comments for Andean Abyss...

The Coin series all follow the same type of mechanics and have a very similar feel. In the evolution of things, Fire in the Lake has had some advances, but the chaotic atmosphere in the gameplay still leads me to rate them about the same. As a Euro gamer, these types of games leave me yearning for something different. I enjoy them, but as an experience and not as a Chess game.

That said, it is an experience unlike any other game offers.

This game is incredible and it is my first COIN game. I have played through the playbook tutorial and a solo game of 4 players (no bots).  I can't wait to try this with four live players.  The interaction between the sides creates so much tension, especially between the US-ARVN and NVA-VC.

The game has so much replayability due to the very large card deck and only a fraction of them being used for each game scenario.

9/4/14 - 4 player game - Learning short scenario game.  Love the game with four even though it took about 4.5 hours (includes teaching).  Lowered rating by .5 due to long play time.  I think play time will go down with a few more plays.  NVA won the game.

9/11/2014 - 4 player game; short scenario.  Fast game with ARVN winning on the second coup card.  Playing time was quite short so I am raising the rating back up.  Every game will vary in length.

9/18/2014 - 3 player game (US & ARVN together).  VC won the game.

9/19/2014 - GrandCon 2014; 4 player game; short scenario.  ARVN won. Two new players.

9/20/2014 - GrandCon 2014; 4 player game; short scenario.  US won.  Two new players game played along with teaching 3 hrs 15 min.  Game ended in final coup card.

10/9/2014 - 4 Player game; short scenario with 1 new player and 3 veterans.  US won with a close second to NVA.  End triggered by last coup card with victory conditions not being met.

10/14/2014 - Started an online (Vassal) short length game with 4 players.

11/8/2014 - Started an online (Vassal) Medium Length game with 4 players.

4/2/2015 - After 10 plays I still believe that this is a game that will take many plays to be truly good.

RATING: 5.5
I played as the US and was overwhelmed with the possibilites. I was amazed how dependent I was on other players to reach my own goals and vice versa. This turned this game into a political game, where I needed to keep everyone in check via my military and try to get them on my side diplomatically. I'll let you do this, if you let me do this. If you do this here, I'll etc.. With the possibility of betrayal, punishment, revenge,...

It gets some negative points:

 - for being opaque. I needed to ask the other players repeatedly because I forgot their special powers and those are very important. Since each faction is different there is a lot to memorize
 - for its random events, that have drastic effects and screw your plans
 - for its reliance on balance-by-players. If someone wants to screw you, well, you're screwed. Even if you played well so far.
 - for its need of a dedicated group that plays the game regularly
 - for its huge kingmaker problems

I played it only once and it fell flat, because of its opaqueness. The play experience after the first play was just mediocre.

My first COIN game and probably going to end up being my favorite for all its complexities.  However, after 2 plays, I still feel overwhelmed by the knobs that can be pulled.  

Like all COIN games, players take one of four factions that are in a pseudo-alliance with one other faction (U.S. + S. Vietnam, VC + N. Vietnam) but there can be only one winner, so players have to help their alliance while helping themselves more.  

For all its complexity, teaching it is fairly easy.  Mechanically there's not too much to figure out, but figuring out how to fit the pieces together?  I'm not sure how many games that'll take.

Juego de simulación histórica, ambientado en la guerra de vietnam. Hay cuatro bandos (Usa, comunista, vietcong y vietnam del sur). Es un juego completamente asimétrico, hasta el punto de que las acciones de juego son diferentes para cada bando.
Está interesante el método de escoger acciones. Hay dos tipos de acción: principal (que puede estar limitada) y operación especial.
El orden de juego viene determinado por una carta de evento. En cada turno sólo van a poder jugar dos jugadores.
Está bien, pero las reglas parecen un poco rebuscadas, en aras del rigor histórico, para lo que ofrece.
Desde luego, es exclusivo para jugones. Ni se le ocurra a nadie intentar explicar este juego a alguien no acostumbrado, porque no llegará a jugarlo.

It does kind of annoy me that the game here expects the ARVN (say) to treat the US as their enemy to the exact same degree as they do the NVA (or VC). Games are routinely won and lost by one player thinking they are "allied" with their thematically (and mechanically) allied player to a greater degree than their opponents; the "sucker" will usually give the game to their historical partner - often to the US, since the ARVN has to play a pretty one-dimensional, boring game to win (focus entirely on jacking up patronage and ignore the war) and players want more action. The VC and NVA have somewhat less mechanical overlap than the ARVN/US, so it's not quite as bad there but it's still a thing. It's just weird and anti-intuitive, and makes zero sense in the historical context. Anyway, ARVN players: you have to concentrate on jacking up your Patronage to have a chance. You'll probably lose anyway, but at least make the US work for it.
---
Now that I've played a few times and discussed the game with other players, I'd like to just add a few comments on the game's relative "historicity". All COIN games are pretty abstract and euro-y, so you shouldn't really expect a nuanced historical study of the conflict or much of an interesting authorial viewpoint. The history on offer here is very much broad strokes and decision-making is strictly tactical, with no strategic layer to speak of (and what strategic level decisions the player makes - primarily how to deal with capabilities - are often misleading about what was possible in historical context). Furthermore, like Labyrinth and Twilight Struggle, what history there is, is right-wing and based more on militarist fantasies than reality. Not offensively so (well, except for that My Lai background text) ... but it's close-ish.

Like Labyrinth, you can still enjoy the game even if you disagree with the designers' politics. But I do worry that wargamers get too much of their history from games, and if you don't come in to Fire in the Lake with some context of your own you can get a pretty distorted view of the Vietnam conflict, IMO.
---
Played once. Seems like the best COIN so far - a low bar admittedly - if for no other reason than: a) it has no boring Green faction that some sucker has to play, and b) the events are interesting. But good grief, this is a frustrating series of games. There is still so much stuff that has me asking, "really? that's the way you want to go with this?". The victory condition levels seem to be set fairly high, especially for the VC and NVA, so it's got the usual 4-way king-of-the-hill free-for-all going on (the VC seem particularly hosed in this respect since it's so easy for the NVA to get at them), but this is COIN, at this point you should know that going in. One faction (the VC) is still somewhat less interesting than the rest, although they can at least still be proactive. US firepower is very generously represented, let's say. The US and ARVN seem to be in the narrative drivers' seats here and to be the privileged viewpoint; they have cool toys and lots of chrome and options while the VC is pretty much an off-the-shelf insurgent faction. It seems like the designers weren't able to escape their fear of offending anyone.

Still, general complaints about COIN aside, our game went pretty well. Events can be swingy though. The NVA has this problem that they are an insurgent-ish faction with no way to raise money other than to wait for an interphase. In our game the NVA got hit with Rolling Thunder on turn 1 (most of their cash was wiped out, and their trail level greatly reduced) and so they were really behind the 8-ball for most of the game (the US gets ahistorically unlimited funds for military operations, but the game doesn't give the NVA their historically generous supplies of equipment and money from China and the USSR). This flags another thing about the more recent COIN games which is both a strength and a weakness: the card ordering and events, especially capabilities, can make a major difference in balance and how the game plays. Good for replayability, and it can make the game more interesting. Also in theory the game is self-balancing. But it can make certain factions much more or less fun to play on any given day.

I dunno. There is a lot about the COIN games that are really appealing, mainly the diverse factions and interesting situations and the fun flow of event cards. These are the things that keep me coming back to try more even when early games (Andean Abyss, Cuba Libre) were so clearly unsatisfactory. There is so little good in the niche of 4-6 hour, 4-player wargames that aren't 20+ years old. So given the thin competition, COIN is nice to have, although really only A Distant Plain and now Fire in the Lake are any good. Nonetheless, there is plenty to dislike here if you are at all inclined to do so.
---
Actually this looks pretty promising as a decent implementation of the COIN system (although as I've noted before, it's a system that has a lot of constraints and I'm not sure the ceiling is all that high - Andean Abyss and Cuba Libre were both fairly bad and at conveyed little depth on their topics). But good lord, are they serious in their description of My Lai? The text in the playbook is almost criminally misleading. (Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_lai). It does not inspire confidence, to say the least.

I really like how FitL uses the COIN system after playing a couple of solo games but need to play against other players to confirm my feelings.  I have some issue with allies finding ways to affect control or support/opposition if their ally is close to victory and towards the end. Seems a bit gamey (but it is a game in the end). I'm also a little concerned that because the game tends to be close, having initial eligibility on the last card before the final coup card  could make a significant difference for one side pulling out a victory (although the impact of going last is certainly lessened by the effects of the monsoon).  But overall i would say that you have to be doing well to be in a good position to win the the game so one can argue that FitL rewards skill and solid play more than pure end game luck on the draw.

On an overall note about the COIN series, i like the system based on my play of this game and Cuba Libre.   One can easily see the simulation of complex factors and how the design is telling a story (though i struggle a little bit imagining the reality based on abstracted wooden components compared to chits for some reason).   I've noticed though that these games feel sort of odd as they are obviously designed with a euro playing audience in mind, but the length of game play, the density and specificity of the rules creates differences and exceptions for each faction that makes it a bit tricky to teach to most euro gamers that typically avoid wargames for these reasons.  But if players can get through those initial hurdles and become comfortable with the rules i think the system is generally rewarding with how the cards come out providing tons of variability and replay value from game to game.

My only COIN game. Face to face play was a riot, a blur of cards and actions, information overload and the sense you aren't seeing the best options.

This is a social game, and a cut-throat one. The shaky alliances and begrudging assistance to your so-called ally are as key as the board state.

The knife-edge balance relies upon well matched players. A game with a weak link will not be anywhere near as good.

Still working on this one. After about dozen of plays I'm still not convinced. In group of experienced players, VC and NVA have small chances to win. Main problem is getting resources by NVA only via Coup round, which forces COIN factions to press on it and after Coup round, get onto VC.

Deck structure favors replayability, but may lead to unfortunate deck construction (half 1964 deck is out of play in main scenario), which may seriously hinders particular faction.

:tobacco::):):):D The COIN series is definitely a love-it-or-hate-it proposition for a lot of folks; those who love the series overall will find plenty to appreciate with Fire in the Lake. Those who found previous games in the series to be a problematic muddle are unlikely to be turned around by this one.

So when I recommend this game, and I do, with few reservations, bear in mind that I enjoy the series as a whole -- I think I personally slightly prefer Andean Abyss to Fire in the Lake, actually, but it's a close-run thing, and it might just be an artifact of actually having a slight strategic grip on good play in Andean Abyss whereas Fire in the Lake is such an experiential overload the first time you play, with pieces flying everywhere and events rising up to put a serious hurt on you, that I don't really feel like I know where to begin.

There [i]are[/i] real points of departure from the previous entries in the series -- most notably the dynamic that yokes the four sides into two tight alliances; NVA and VC may have some divergent goals and some subtle ways to hinder one another but they can't actually turn on each other, and likewise with the US and ARVN -- but these points of departure are tidbits of difference for the delectation of those who are already fans rather than wholesale re-thinks of the entire system.

And from my perspective (to repeat: fan), that's just fine. The best thing about a game system is the ability to slip comfortably from one iteration to the next without totally starting the learning process from square one. And if you genuinely like the experience, the subtle shifts in the rules end up having intellectually pleasing knock-on effects.

There have been some complaints about the historicity or lack thereof of the series in general and FitL in particular, as well as a somewhat related complaint about the appropriateness of the COIN series' by-now-standard four-player framework on what really was more of a two-sided conflict. For my part, I found the feel of the thing to be quite appropriate to the subject matter; I as the ARVN player succumbed to the temptation of funneling aid to cronies, while the US player found himself mired in the desire to rack up body counts and neglected the more important task of winning hearts and minds, and any game that not only affords you the chance of repeating the mistakes of the past but gives you a real sense of why those mistakes were alluring to those who made them has to be doing something right in the verisimilitude department.

The COIN series is not without its gamey aspects, but for my money, any strategic-level multi-player historical conflict simulation game that clocks in at around the four hour mark (for the medium-length scenario, in this case) and still gives you any feel whatsoever for the larger historic picture is solid design.

The COIN mechanics are a clever vehicle that allow subtle differences between the topic of each game to be highlighted.

I just picked this game up. I wasn't planning on getting it since my most preferred theme was Liberty or Death. But then I learned how to play that and became really excited over the play mechanics after reading the instructions but not having played at all. Then I bought A Distant Plain because I thought it would add a different dynamic to the COIN system because of the different factions.

Then I played...

And while it is super tough trying to keep all of the rules while playing your first run, especially as playing all the factions, I truly fell in love with the COIN system. It is work, yes. But it is so addicting. 

Then I debated whether I should get a third COIN game. I considered Cuba Libre, Falling Sky, and Fire in the Lake. All are out of print except for Falling Sky. Then my brother went to our local game store and saw Fire in the Lake on the shelf. I thought I might never get another opportunity to pick it up this decade, if ever so I purchased it.

The main reason why I love these COIN games so much is because they don't present tactical simulations of military might. Those mechanics do not appeal to me unless the game presents a very small scale tactical situation like the DVG Leader games do. Otherwise, I'm much more interested in the  large scale strategy involved. The COIN offers a complete abstraction of all of these aspects. But the abstraction is not arbitrary. It is perfectly logical. So great decisions are rewarded and are such they can be derived logically. The COIN games involve military strategy, political strategy, and economic strategy. And that is right up my alley. I love that. And the winning conditions appear just and not arbitrary. And they also represent a war of attrition in all three of those aspects. That appeals to me the most.

The games are hella long, kinda like litigation. But that's kind of par for the course in a game that rewards subtle planning and execution.

RATING: N/A
Despite simplified card play (they just come straight off the top of the deck and you see each 'next card', as opposed to having some 'hand' and figuring out what to play) there is still plenty going on here-lots of moving parts in BGG-speak.

Have set it up and ALMOST run thru the trainer game twice-I did a lot better the 2nd time-in terms of understanding the whys and wherefores.

Also-all 4 factions have a fairly extensive flow-chart/enemy NPC so plenty of options for solo, 2P, etc.

Enjoy the many decisions each player must make each turn as the situation changes quickly. Think it key to learn what each player is trying to do, thus the VC and USA fight for support/opposition from the population.  ARVN/NVA try to get control of each province or city.  Great cards, reading the historic events.  The above being said the game doesn't flow like a standard war game and some of our hex based friends had trouble with the ever changing priorities.

A couple plays in so far, one two-handed game, and one short 4p game, not entirely sure what to make of it, so rating is tentative.

I like the history, and the mechanics are interesting. That said it's not particularly dynamic, and it feels like the timing of the event and coup cards drive too much of the game, leaving little actual decision making for the players. The result is a game that feels both dry and luck driven. The ARVN patronage was especially swingy.

My opinions might be jaded by a combination of playing the short game and some wonky coup draws, so I want to try it a couple more times before giving up on it. I definitely won't be doing the short game again. It might even be better as a solo game or a team game.

Update: Upon further reflection, the playing time is just way too long, especially relative to the number of actual decision points that are being made. If I'm going to play a long game, I'm always going to pick something else over this.

One of the hallmarks of the COIN series so far is that it while the system is simple and since players do not have a hand of cards, you'd think the choices would be simple to make, but it is not the case. The chaos brought about from playing against 3 other players who have very different victory conditions and options than you make for a very dynamic series of game, but unfortunately one which is sometimes hard to grasp fully the first few games. You find yourself staring at the board too often, with no clear strategy or idea of what you should do. Couple this with the distinct feeling that any progress you might have made on your turn is usually destroyed in a few cards make this feels futile by time and that is, at least to me, the greatness of the game. You cannot simply plow forward and hope for a victory. You need to be creative and accept that you will lose some of the progress you've made. You need to attack on multiple front, leaving your opponents no choice but to attack you at A, while not being able to stop you at B. You come to very much understand the frustrations that must be felt on a daily basis by the commander and thinkers of the different factions as they try and advance their cause. As I said, lots of fun. Frustrating fun, but fun nonetheless and this game, at least so far, is no different. 

 Fire in the Lake is no different. Enough little differences to make it a (future) welcome addition to the growing series, along with a short scenario that with practice can be done in an evening and one that I can see myself playing many times in the future. I really think that, apart from some minor adjustments, Mr Ruhnke has hit it out of the park once more. Recommended, as soon as GMT puts it out.

RATING: 8.5
How much you enjoy this game depends on how much you appreciate subtlety in play.  This game isn't won on grand gestures and telegraphing your plans - it's the little things that truly matter and if you're not paying attention to what the other people at the table are doing, you will find yourself overwhelmed if you don't respond appropriately.

Regardless of how you feel about historical accuracy, Volume IV of the COIN series tries a few bold ideas, including giving one of the insurgent faction troops of their own.  Those familiar with previous volumes will find an easy familiarity with several new surprises.  There's a great write-up in the Playbook that details the new stuff, so I won't regurgitate it here.  Ultimately what you end up with is a game has a lot of intricate things going on in the background.  Mechanically, it's not terribly complex, but in order to truly understand the impact of your choices and actions, you'll need to play this a good few times before the real meat of the game comes up to the surface.

Exploration (or lack) of history aside, FitL is a fantastic game that brings the series a large step forward.  If you've played any of the first three and didn't like 'em, nothing here will change your mind, but if you're a fan or looking to get into the series, this is the one to be playing.

This is an involved, well researched war game.  The COIN system is amazing.  My only complaint with Fire in the Lake is that it is so complex that I'd tend to play others in the series (which are already complex) instead, just to avoid playing six hours with constant review of the rulebook.

My rating of the game comes from three factors.
1) Design: Neutral, the game takes the COIN system to a new level with 2 sets of semi-cooperative players competing against each other.  Honestly, I'm undecided on this.  It makes a LOT of sense in the context of the game and the war but my gamer group does not play well with each other.

2) Historical accuracy:  Strong negative, if you REALLY wanted to accurately portray the relationships in the Vietnam War, you'd have one US player, one NVA player, a VC player that leaves halfway through the game and gives his pieces to the NVA player, and 6 ARVN players who can only win by ensuring that the US DOESN'T win.  The ARVN factions would be able to paralyze each other and constantly launch coups.  It would be fascinating to read a short AAR but not practical or fun to play.

3) Actual play: Positive, this game is considerable more playable and fun than it should be and that is the primary consideration.

My first "10" rating on BGG and for obvious reasons.  As a playtester for this game, it "rocks."  There will be plenty of game in this box and then some for the solitaire or multiplayer, and especially good for 2-player.  Definitely will be the "crown jewel" of the COIN series, as well as the best game based on the Vietnam conflict ever.  A "must have" for those interested in the Vietnam conflict, or otherwise.

The deepest and most mechanically complex of the COINs...and worth every ounce of effort to learn it. The Operations are more complicated to carry out, but battle resolution is easier than the ancient COINs. 

April 2017: I now love COIN games. With more experience with the series, I find the ancient subjects less interesting than the modern ones, and the subject of the Vietnam war has become more interesting to me because of how rich this game is.

April 2016: I like COIN games. Within that framework, this is the least interesting COIN game to me because of my lack of interest in Vietnam, but arguably the richest game in the series.

A heavily abstracted Vietnam War Euro-war game- with an incredible visual impact once set up. Flow charts, flow charts, and more flow charts to take up most of your game time, to pour over. Components are excellent. For this particular war, this game hits it at the right strategic/operational level, not getting bogged down in the tactical side & but involving the political situations in order for players to make the right decisions. Although a big war/history buff, I'm not sure I'm interested enough in the Vietnam War to warrant investing time into this wonderful beast of a game.

I have mixed feelings on COIN games and this is no exception. I can't say I've noticed that much of an improvement of this game over any other in the series, and COIN games are definitely "unique", but the topic interests enough that I enjoy it when I play it.

As for now, I'm not impressed. I still don't get completely the interplay between the different actions.

RATING: 8
The thickest (so far) of the COIN games and absolutely evocative of the Vietnam War.  The divergent goals of the "team" players works together spectacularly.  Devastating American Airstrikes, awesome work by Irregulars, and changing South Vietnamese Governments keep the game super exciting and lots of fun.  

Possibly the best COIN game, but it is more complicated and takes more time than the others.  The complicated nature means there are more rules holes to fall into than the other games and so while this is the most epic, it is not perfect.

The best coin game I have played so far.
No money related factions, which is a plus (I do not like those and we already have seen them three times (Andean Abyss, Cuba Libre and A Distant Plain)).
Having three factions with troops where one must train its guerillas to get troops is a good idea and adds to the game.
I got this used even though it looks new, I pity the poor guy who sold it to me since it is so good.
Thumbs up to GMT and the original designer for this wonderful game. :)

Have now played it solitaire and have a couple PBEMs going.  Great adaption of the COIN system.  Love the hybrid conventional/insurgent capabilities for NVA, as well as quasi-insurgent forces of US and ARVN.  I think this one will really stand the test of time.  In particular like how the NVA shift to conventional warfare can change the DNA of the game.
---------------
After 18 months, this game has stood the test of time with me.  Have added at least a half dozen PBEMs, and a handful of face-to-face games.  A superb game, with the standard tense interplay of the COIN system.  Added historical flavor from the event cards being broken into periods, so you can get a different flavor of the war in various periods.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
far too abstract to be a simulation, esp. considering that having four factions results in irrational play from a historical perspective (e.g. ARVN is 'winning' on the last card before a coup, so the US ignores the NVA army camped in Da Nang and airlifts two people out of a some province to lose COIN control and drop the ARVN VP).

to quote Judd Vance: "... historically and game-wise, I think it fails badly as a 4-player game, becoming a forced game of King of the Hill that feels like a theme pasted on to a mechanic feeling like shoving the proverbial round peg through a square hole."

this is the only COIN game I have played, but I find the actions you can take very dry (i.e. 'waruro').  there also is clearly the need to make a conflict 4-sided, whether it fits the history or not.  it is also fairly long with a good portion of downtime for what you get.

for a good Vietnam game, I'll stick with Hearts and Minds, and for a good four player game, I can think of a good dozen I would rather play.

final hit:  I've now played this game with 7 different people, and only one of them liked it.  even if I didn't have any issues with the game, the only way I would be playing it is solitaire.  if you are a solitaire gamer, the fact that there are solo rules to handle all of the various factions is a huge plus, but I don't keep games that I will only ever play solitaire.

great production values, esp. the box art.  how well the game looks is almost enough to make me want to keep it to try again.  almost.

RATING: 9
One of my favorite COIN games, possibly a bit behind Falling Sky which is more refined, but FitL is also a very different beast from that game. 

Here you get the full scope of the Vietnam war with the elegance of a eurogame and the strategical depth of a wargame. The factions are perfectly tuned to both complement and compete with each other, while still being highly asymmetrical both in playstyle and victory conditions.  

As with all COIN games, the learning curve is steep in the beginning, but if you're familiar with the core mechanics of the series it won't take long before you get into the flow of things. 

Perhaps not the ideal game for first-time COIN players though, as the massive scale and number of special rules will blur what's so great about the system.

I've played a few games solitaire in Vassal and three games in person (one game that was 1vs1 NVA/VC vs US/ARVN, two 4 players). The game has its moments but takes a Very. Long. Time. The large board and high piece counts relative to the other COINs mean that a player can take a couple minutes to decide how to use an event, and then, if they choose ops, several minutes trying to figure out the best way to use Op+Special.

I'll continue to play it off and on as a solitaire game, but doubt I'll be able to get it to the table again at over 6 hours for a *short* game.

Did i mention that this is a straight euro, and that i can't stand no euros no more..?

Also why is this bashing the leader equilibrium mechanic so fucking prevalent these days..? Oh Bob is winning.. let's all hit on Bob.. Oh Gerry is winning let's all hit on Gerry.. Oh game is over.. former second place wins.
You could save yourself a couple of hours of your life and just play a third of the game.. won't change the outcome at all.

Just can't warm up to the coin-series. After all the cubes feel cubish and not like troops.. the deterministic "battle" doesn't help.
Slap some minis on that board & add a couple of dice rolls for attacks & i'd be playing this a lot.
It seems pretty well balanced & to be a work of love.. COIN is garnering quite some followers.

The COIN system is grounded on the game Chaos in the old world, so if you've got the same beef as me, you might wanna try CitoW.

From what very little experience I had with this, is was definitely a little heavier than I was expecting, theme notwithstanding. You have to have a lot of ducks in a row before actions are carried out, so one has to be cognizant of exactly what they plan to do in the long-term. Other than that, fantastic game! I was only able to play this for about 30 minutes, due to a conflicting engagement, so I can't really comment further about it.

 The games in the COIN series are the most asymeterical that I have ever played. All the factions play so differently it's almost like playing different games altogether.  The theme comes across very well for each player and keeps everybody 100% invested in what's going on.  These games are highly regarded for the solitaire experience that they provide, but I prefer to play them at max player count-the games shine when there is a lot of player interaction. While the rules and mechanics themselves are fairly straightforward, the true challenge is to understand all the complexities for the faction that you are playing-and the strategies are complex. Multiple plays are required to really see all the options and how they interact with each other. 
  This is a long and complex game that just offers so much...
I highly recommend it.

Yes it's abstract. Yes U.S. airpower is ridiculously overpowered. But I think this captures the Vietnam experience at the strategic level better than any game so far, especially if you have 4 players. The RVN government really didn't have our best interests in mind and this captures that balance perfectly.

Finally, a game that treats the Vietnam conflict in terms of insurgency, rather than as a conventional war.

This is one of Volko's finest, and Mark's expertise in modern conflicts helps to make this an excellent simulation.

Also, Orejan's flowcharts make this is one of the best solitaire games that I have ever played.

A COIN game of the war in Vietnam. A formidable challenge, by all accounts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My oversimplified short version; Its a thematic, long (potentially very long) and very convoluted semi-coop version of El Grande.  That is really selling it short, but I did say simplified and really I feel like it could easily replace EG for me and I could almost trade it off since this is more interesting, especially the somewhat semi-coop nature of it. (but note I said almost, see flaws...) 

So the much longer version; On the one hand, it could be looked at as an area control game with a very strong theme like Twilight Struggle (to me TS is not a true war game, and this is slightly more of a wargame than TS is if comparing the two. However let’s also remember that wargames are largely area control by nature…) and with the simplified units that are represented with cubes and cylinders this is the “look” it takes on (I wish units were chits with values and not simplified but alas).  Otoh, I think it does end up feeling like a wargame, you do actually move troops around (unlike TS), and all of the actions taken fit the war well and of course the cards inject some history and theme as well, so I think “looks” are deceiving here, and it feels and is more of a wargame than I expected anyway. 

So with that out of the way (I always wanted to play a coin and always wondered about that above aspect of them) something I really liked here was the semi-coop yet asymmetrical nature (though all faction's actions are fairly similar and even win conditions are somewhat similar just opposite of another faction, winning with each faction will require somewhat different play I’m thinking) of this particular game which fits the war really well. You likely should and can choose to help your ally in order to keep your "side" ahead of the other 2 factions, to a point, and even make some open table  deals with them, and to me, this is probably a good idea for the first half to 2/3 of the game. Then in the final stretch its every faction for themselves and you’ll do things (you should anyway...) to slow down the 'ally' if they are making too much ground. This is probably one of the aspects I enjoyed the most anyway.  

I had some pretty big hesitations before playing as can be seen at the bottom of my comments which I am going to elaborate on after playing but in short, most of these do exist and each person will need to decide whether or not they are features or bugs for them. I did enjoy the game with some caveats and as I thought I would be I'm still on the fence here about these and also other things on the game. 

So on the perceived negatives others have noted about COIN and do they apply here:  

LEADER BASHING - This is probably the big one, and it is there right in your face with no where to hide, you have to accept this right off the hop or just forget playing. While reading the rules I kept thinking why not institute some hidden goals so leader can't be easily calculated, then at the very end of rules there was actually a small variant along these lines included and I thought hey great. Except once I read it, it was quickly apparent it did not go far enough. Should it really bother someone, some hidden goals could pretty easily be made up I think to really help curb the leader bashing, but otherwise, just accept its part and parcel and act accordingly, don't jump out to any quick leads thereby putting big target on head, and whoever does yep someone or everyone will have to beat them down to keep them from winning, that is the game, you have to play it or not.  

LUCK (tweakable) - unfortunately I experienced this in my very first game, but note it did not keep me from winning, but I did whine I lot more than I liked about it. The trouble here too is with a bigger deck this is even more of an issue without some kind of seeding structure (see my tidbits near bottom of comments on my approach to this, the period seeding does NOT help here). In my game I was the USA and of the 36 cards I was 3rd or 4th on 30 of them, 1st maybe twice and 2nd on around 4. It was frustrating, always getting to choose last and to add to this the person I was often partnered with for actions loved leaving the other player the worst possibly sloppy seconds option [i]a limited OP[/i] (somewhat good play on his part yes), which meant combined I hardly got to do anything all game, and other players had way more options and much better options than I did just because of how cards were shuffled. While playing I thought this might be intentional seeing how the USA fared in the war, but alas the card scans in the picture section show each faction is first on ~25% of the cards, so yes luck will play a big factor here in a 130 card deck especially when only using 24 or 36 (which means if it bothers you, you need to play the longggggggggg game, yikes, or houserule it) Then there is the strength of the particular events that come up and the timing of such...

RANDOM APPEARANCE OF VP CARD (maybe worst offender imho, also tweakable however) - Part of the luck factor and again WAS a factor in my very first game. The thing is here due to the dynamic nature of a changing leader (Whack-a-mole is how a friend described all coin games), whoever happens to be leading when the coup is flipped wins, which is not a satisfying way to win to me. In our game the NVA was winning right as we got to the final 12 cards where coup to end game was "any card" which was good play on his part. So on the positive it was tense no doubt about it, on the negative the card never came, ARVN and I beat on him and then I pulled some moves to put myself in front, praying for the coup card to come next. This again was good tension, and sure we did well to make this happen but its just based on luck the card never came and to end a 4 or 5 hour game as I say not satisfying, I won, but only because the coup never came when NVA wanted/hoped. I did manage to keep the lead for about 8 cards waiting for the damn coup, which ended up being the very last card wouldn't you know, but I really didn't think I could and I think the players dropped the ball really. Sure too, you could try to say NVA jumped out too early, but really that is BS since coup could have been that first of 12 and if didn't would have kicked himself for waiting, anyway I think you see the crux of this, its luck based and coup timing can definitely decide who wins rather than being based on what the player did.  

DOWNTIME - Did not find this to be an issue any more than any other 4 player game especially a wargame, turns mostly go at an average clip once familiar with the options sometimes there is some analysis & calculating to do which can slow your turn but its not the norm I found. 

KINGMAKING (likely not tweakable) - Yep, sadly this is here too and once again happened in my first game. Remember that NVA lead I was talking about right before the last 12 cards? Well I chose to play my Pivotal Event right at that time which does a bunch of nasty stuff to the NVA, thinking I am taking one for the team here since if I don't do this, coup could come at any moment and they win, game over. The VC's Pivotal could cancel mine, but I discussed this and though it was a risk figured it was a no brainer since at this point its every faction for themselves and we were down to about 13 or 14 cards so in another card or two it could all be over with NVA winning. Yet the VC chose to cancel my card anyway, even though I was about 6 VP away from my win condition and NVA was 1 over theirs. It made no sense to me, he thought it would hurt him even though [i]he was out of the running almost completely [/i]but there you have it, if coup card came up in those next 4 cards or so it was pure king-making and again a horrible way for a 4 or 5 hour game to end, and if he DID let my card go through, and I won (which I did) potentially we would have pointed to that as being a key decision in the win, so almost a no win situation for him (literally too). I am thinking/hoping this won't happen too often, but the way things are designed it could in a few ways as since its a beat on leader game, when someone near the end is not in contention they are choosing who to help/hurt much of the time with their actions. Its just the nature of the beast here and if two people are tied or very close, well you see the issue.    

LENGTH - First off this game includes 3 options which is nice feature, short, med & long. Long game is way too long considering all the above if you ask me, 8 or 9 hours maybe 6 or 7 after a bunch of games. Med I think is where this will do best around 3.5 to 5 depending on group. Short should be 2 hours and a nice option to have, so with all these options length is not really an issue

--

Some other comments here, I find this very tit for tat not in a good way, you do some stuff, they do some stuff, and then everything done gets “undone”, rinse and repeat. Lots of little things to track especially in coup. Some tension and touch decision making for sure, like the USA air strikes are powerful but they often directly lower their VP's too, so do you toast someone and the trail but take the nasty VP Hit? Again with the USA you score VP's for active troops NOT on the map (great thematic touch) yet that is exactly where you need them to do well so its always tough to decide how many and when to take keep/take these off. Easy to learn overall I thought, only 11 pages of rules so hard to learn has been overstated but note watch some videos they really help for sure. I see some saying a few games to figure out strategy, and it is a little opaque but this will really be personal of course. I found it tricky figuring out what to do and how to do it for the first half of first game only, after that the what & how became pretty clear and got it done for the win against experienced players (who did admit after 5 games they were still a little unsure however) so amount of depth here could also be somewhat overstated (to me its missing some from a regular CDW as learning and knowing the cards is quite important in them where here you are never playing with all of them and most likely a small number only and you are never going to know which are coming so planning for them is just not viable at all). No question there is some though, goals are relatively straight forward but of course approaches probably not as much and the nice thing too is there are 4 factions to try out so some to explore for each, and note your approach will always have to be tailored to how people are playing their particular faction that particular day. Beat on leader don’t become the leader and wait til near coup or end of game to make a run for it, yes but this is either impossible to calculate (random coup appearance) or way too risky in end game case since if cards don’t come out in your favour you will be fairly limited in your actions, and without a hand of cards like in a regular CDW its harder to plan all this. 

I wondered about the victory conditions, not the thresholds but what happens if they are crossed by more than one player. In our game, the NVA and USA were tied at one point, 1 vp more than needed by both. I asked who would win in tie (can’t remember) and also if USA is 2 vps more vs NVA 1 vp more, will USA win and I guess they do. The thing is the NVA VPs are MUCH harder to get, which is why their threshold is so low at 19, vs. 51 (IIRC) for the USA as their VPs are easier to get. So logic was telling me, if NVA was 1 vp more than 19, USA should likely be 2 more to win or just to tie. Anyway that was my thinking at the time, I was USA but as the NVA I would have been a little perturbed I think.   

Game seems swayed towards the tactical side vs strategic, without a hand of cards to plan with, often times you are just reacting to what is happening on the board.  You can plan don’t get me wrong, and you absolutely will have to I think as some of the more important things you will do will take several turns, I’m just thinking the scale is tipped too much towards the tactical side for my liking (seems like 70/30 tactical, where as many CDW’s are 70/30 strategic which I thoroughly enjoy. Note I could be off here, and it could be closer to 50/50 which is what I'm hoping anyway)  

4 player was good and I can see now almost surely the best number due to interactions and competition. I don't see why 3 player won't be decent, 2 do get to cooperate against one but OTOH one player has full cooperation of 2 factions to oppose them. I now wonder if 2 player will even be that great; On the one hand a couple of the bigger issues either disappear or diminish yes (not the luck though and I have heard its worse with 2), there may be even more planning since you are playing 2 factions and the war is perfectly setup to play 2 sides only; but OTOH the whole semi-coop nature is gone, there is much less competition and maybe the big one for me here is its just going to be too tit for tat in a 1960 kind of way, I blow up the trail opponent rebuilds the trail, I beef up Saigon opponent attacks Saigon etc etc and the card shuffle may end up being more important than anything else, really need to try it anyway to see.  

So in sum I am largely on the fence about it as after rambling on about the potential flaws there were many good aspects too and the game did have me thinking about it afterwards which is always a good sign. Other than said flaws it is a very well thought out and put together package too which my rating while giving some benefit of the doubt reflects, it is the 4th coin iteration after all and I do want to try out each faction, and generally want to try out another approach or two and see if there is enough to explore here to warrant a space on my crammed full shelves. I also think the luck, which other than kingmaking troubles me most, is easily tweakable and this is probably the one thing that could push me off fence to owning, since wins should feel more satisfactory with luck lowered (but I do worry about the kingmaking still as it could ruin endgames to me anyway). Should end up between 6 and 8 for me unless flaws just keep rearing their heads then maybe a 5.   

[u]UPDATE[/u] - 7 -> 6 - Made the mistake of playing a 2 player game by the rules as written, and the luck was just too much to bear really at least to me. It seems most others don't have much of an issue with it but for a game this long its just too high to me, and a few simple design choices could have easily rendered this a non-issue. I ended up picking this up but might actually sell it off. 

[u][i]Tidbits[/i][/u] – to reduce some of the luck and swingyness, and also avoid card counting in this solution/variant, separate each factions prime cards and shuffle them. If playing with 24 cards, use 5 cards from each, then shuffle all leftover cards together and add 4 random ones to the prior 20 (or do 16 + 8) and shuffle all 24. 36 is 7 cards from each + 8 random.  So a tad more setup but much more balanced and you still have different cards each game but now you won’t see mostly NVA cards and barely any ARVN, or vice versa etc.  I think this variant is especially important for the short game, but would improve all time scales really. For the random coups, I am thinking on shuffling them into the bottom 4 - 6 cards of each 12, so still some tension and surprise there but not as crazy or random as 1 in 12.  

-------------------

Watched the preview, seems fairly abstract and not very wargame-like really (more area control with a war theme like TS), the politics involved would seem to elevate it above just a pure AC game but to me not enough to be an actual wargame. Still, supposed to be the best suited for 2 player but I have many reservations like length and luck as well. Likely in 7 neighborhood for me, really want to play this one asap as with the other COIN games the theme is a big draw for me

Edit - I went and read many of the comments on the other COIN games and I am really with a lot of pause on this one. Potential chaos and luck, beat on leader and kingmaking, downtime and long, random appearance of VP cards awarding the "lucky" person (HATE this), separately I disdain these, combined means all out avoid. Anyway maybe these are less of a factor here I have to try it for myself I just won't buy it first for sure at the going price. It seems a shame if these are dominant as the COIN games conceptually and thematically are very interesting, but execution is everything

- Watched the video again, I'm getting more sucked in to this, but this is also because I am thinking that many of the bigger issues above will not be present in the 2 player game, which is the game I'm actually the most interested in. It would be nice if it played well with 4 player, like you had a good amount of control whether you win or not and it wasn't so easy to be punished for being the leader (or if it was at least harder to tell who was winning, which is how many other games handle this leader bashing) but I'm going to keep my expectations low for that and hope that it might make a great 2 player

[playtest] My first foray into the COIN series. Engaging. Frightening. Maddening!

[Tentative rating of 8 until I get more plays in.]

Update: I've played two short games and one medium length game as the NVA. Increasing rating to 10 because it is that much fun and the player base is just that cool. (They seem to be a new demographic, distinct from both wargamers and euro gamers.) This is the sort of game you plan your year around.

A masterpiece of wargame design.

Six plays in, and I like this more and more. The layers of interaction between the players (once everyone knows what they're doing) is wonderful.
.......
My second COIN game after Cuba Libre, and much more to think about here. The asymmetric system has been very well adapted to the Vietnam war, and while it doesn't offer the same level of simulation detail as a more traditional wargame treatment like VG's 1980's game, it captures the conflicting ambitions of (alleged) friends and foes alike.

I like the way the VC/NVA and US/ARVN are notional allies at least, but as soon as one faction gets close to winning old friendships are forgotten and the gloves come off!

Even the short scenario runs pretty long, but if you and three friends have half a day or more to set aside, a collection of 60's rock and a sense of humour (this is not a game for the easily offended), then it's an involving if at times exhausting (you often have a lot of options to choose from) ride.

FitL feels more like a traditional wargame than any previous COIN. Unlike earlier iterations, which featured yellow and green factions who didn't necessarily want to win the "war" but rather had a personal set of goals, everyone in FitL is seeking to win the physical and political struggle on some level: the US wants support, bases, and troops home; the NVA wants population control and bases; the ARVN wants COIN controlled population and patronage; the VC wants opposition and bases.  

Because of this, it is my least favorite COIN entry. I prefer more modern treatments, with muddied goals across the socio-economic-politico spectrum rather than a "hot" war focus. That being said, I think this very focus and shedding of non-military-centric factions will make FitL a huge hit amongst standard wargamers.

RATING: 9
Good simulation that captures the 4 sides very well. For example, the US will be frustrated by ARVN's selfish actions. All of the factions have mutliple options and strategies to try. This could be a problem for new players as they may 'lock' up with decision paralysis! But once you grok the COIN system, play should be smooth.  

Solo Bot system. One play as the US/ARVN and found the game challanging. and addicting.

An engrossing experience, with plenty of nuance that will probably become clearer with repeated play. I'm a fan of the system, which really brings out the merry madness that results from a smash-up of conflicting player agendas.

After a week messing around with the tutorials and then then trying out the non-player flow charts I was finally able to get another human to the table.  We went head to head controlling two factions each and the game really started coming alive.

Thematically, Fire seems spot on. Each faction feels different and works in a way you'd expect. The fact that the U.S. scores higher the fewer troops they commit to the map is brilliant. Also intriguing is the mechanic where the U.S. supplies the aid to the ARVN and also depletes their resources (only the NVA, VC, and ARVN have resource markers on the track).

The cards are fantastic and there are plenty of tough decisions.  Many cards are not used in each scenario, so there should be a great deal of replayability.

I've played Cuba Libre and I imagine if you've played any title in the COIN series, much of what's here will feel familiar. That said, Fire in the Lake seems to have  more moving parts, more depth.

Finally, this is an absolutely gorgeous game. The map, it's colors, the wood, everything.  It just feels and looks big and beautiful.

I am becoming enamored with the COIN system, and I expect my already high rating for this game will climb as I get it to the table more.  I would be surprised if this doesn't find it's way into my all-time top 10.

My first Coin game. This game probably would of been difficult to comprehend without a good teacher if you're unfamiliar with Coin. Much of the lingo is obtuse, but if you can figure out meanings you're in for a treat of a game. Four players seem to be required, which may be difficult to find especially for a non user friendly niche game. Absolutely loved it though. Great area control, alliance game.

One of the best games I have ever played! Like many of us on BGG, I also play a good amount of Euros/family games, and I think Fire in the Lake is a brilliant blend of wargame and family game. There is a lot of area control like a euro, but a good deal of historicity like a wargame. The victory conditions are very well conceived, in my opinion. The US, for example, must get the people to accept the South Vietnamese government, (hearts and minds), while having as few solders in country as possible. Clever. Also, the US thought we could win by attrition, and in FitL we get to see the never ending hordes of NVA troops. Also clever. All of this gameplay and interesting execution of historical vision is accomplished with an amazingly easy set of rules. Each player only needs to remember 6 or 7 options. I liken this to the "jobs" in Puerto Rico, for example. So remember the "jobs" for your faction, keep your victory conditions in mind...and have a blast! A keeper.

COIN series on Vietnam War - finally I find the series fit for its purpose and with a theme I am interested in feverishly in recent months. The basic structure is there for the four sides to compete in - you move your troops, irregulars, police around to control key cities and LOCs (to inhibit VC and NVA staging their infiltration and assaults from Laos, Cambodia and the north. Each side has their own set of COIN operations plus Special Activities and they play to maximize the advantage, going along with the events. One odd thing is that it seems there is no tracking on U.S. "political will" back home per se directly. I guess some of that should have been factored into the "Support" and "Aid" level on the COIN operations. As of now, Fire in the Lake seems to be about winning by areas control and the support of the local (Vietnamese) populace, rather than the opinion of the world (i.e. U.S. citizens).   

Fire in the Lake is a very strategic treatment, and in a much abstract way, of the entire Vietnam War.  Each player commands a faction with their own specific agenda. I like the accessibility of the game but I feel there is a need to go back to my Vassal Victory in Vietnam for more in-depth examination of the strengths and weaknesses of the armies and modern strategy and tactics. Fire in the Lake is a bit too abstract to my taste while moving cubes and "tubes" on the board - faceless, unidentifiable units. As a game, it is impressively fun. Winning the game by timing the high tide of your side to the upcoming event cards is outstandingly satisfying.  Among the COIN games, Fire in the Lake is the best to utilize the system with a strong sense of historical authenticity.

An incredibly well-designed and thought provoking COIN game that is unique insofar as it abstracts the Vietnam War but loses nothing in giving you a detailed gaming experience.

My rating is both an initial impressions (or first actual play through after doing the tutorial) and considers that if I had more experience in this style of game, I would appreciate it more. First of all, as someone who's parents were refugees from Vietnam I really appreciated how the Vietnamese were portrayed in this game. Too often the Vietnam War has a way too US-centric view; there were tens of thousands of US troops that died which caused an outrage, but what about the roughly a million Vietnamese who perished, and the millions more who faced the longstanding legacy of the war? Considering that there are 4 factions and the US plays no larger role in the game as any of the other ones, I think this game is focused as it should be: mainly on the Vietnamese. I also like at least thematically how the South Vietnamese government, being often corrupt, often loses support from its own people to further its gains. There is a lot of thematic things in this game (e.g. US losing support the more troop casualties there are and the more troops they send) that for a real history buff would really make this game immersive.

However, I dislike this corrupt government simulation in actual game play, as it makes it so that in extreme cases the US not only wants to not support the South Vietnamese, but wants to actively hurt them. Especially i a 2 player game it is really weird trying to do the best to make your other side not win. Furthermore, the historic aspects of the game also causes this game to be rather fiddly in memorization of what each action does, the restrictions of when you can do each one, and having to remember to move the correct markers on the track. Also, I feel like there is a lot of opacity in this game; for example killing enemy guerillas take multiple steps and requires cubes be close by, but you also have to consider what actions your opponent could take that could mess with your plans while you do so.

Finally, in the long run this game just felt like work. I had to watch an hour long video tutorial, then play a game tutorial that lasted 3 hours due to having to play very slowly to confirm why everything happened. Then I played my first game, and still had to look up each individual action as I executed them, and with no idea if my moves would actually hurt me in the long term. The investment I would need to play this game and not feel exhausted afterwards would probably be on the order of 20 hours. If I had rated this game based on my enjoyment as I usually do instead of my appreciation for it, this game would be around a 4.

RATING: 7
I like the COIN system, but this one is a bit too complex for me. Too many things can happen on the map and analysis paralysis is the guest. Finally the short scenario takes a long time because of this and is not so short. Cuba Libre had not enough things going on the map, but this one has too many. My favorite COIN game stays definitively the first, Andea Abyss, which is for me one of the best wargames of the 5 last years.

My first COIN series game.  I have been sceptical about the series (which looked a bit too Euro for my tastes).

But I am interested in the Vietnam war.  I found the Victory Games magnum opus (Vietnam) too much.  I have long been impressed with Mark Herman's ability to capture the political and resource management dimensions of conflict in straightforward, elegant game mechanics.

Combining those factors persuaded me to give the COIN idea a run with this.  So far, I like what I see.  Enough game (think deep Euro) and enough content that makes it "feel" like the Vietnam war, rather than just a generic red vs blue vs yellow vs olive drab.  Works very well on VASSAL too.

Wow! My second COIN game (after Cuba Libre). I P500'd it a while ago and got stung with UK import taxes and handling fees and was sworn off the P500 experience. This has got nothing to do with it sitting on my shelf for ages unplayed, that was completely the result of me being an absolute muppet and is something I aim to make up for. 

Like Cuba Libre I absolutely loved it. I am only playing it solo without the faction bots (learning those is too much like learning the game all over again for me!) but I just really enjoy playing it solo and watching how all the factions interact and bugger each other up. For me, at the moment, it is an experience unlike any other in gaming and I can't wait for Vol V Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection to arrive retail in the UK. 

It did take me a while to cope with the larger Fire In The Lake map, I was so used to the compactness of Cuba Libre, but I have found the larger map gives an equally rich and varied experience and more depth to the game as you are focussing on conflict across a greater variety of regions.

I am extremely interested in the upcoming COIN releases, especially Colonial Twilight and Pendragon they can't come fast enough! I have looked at Andean Abyss and I am interested in that as well but for some reason A Distant Plain doesn't appeal to me at all. I just don't sit comfortable for some reason imagining playing that game, I know it doesn't make any sense as they are all modelling conflict.

As an extra bit of thematic themeness I highly recommend playing Fire In The lake listening to these two albums; Sound of Siam - Leftfield Luk Thung, Jazz & Molam in Thailand 1964-1975 and The Sound of Siam volume 2 - Molam & Luk Thung Isan from North-East Thailand 1970 - 1982 both from Soundway Records. Not exactly from the country or exact years in question but they created a fantastic atmosphere!

First game with 3P, a learning game was great. Struggled at first and then things started to make sense. All I want to do is to play it again. Second game was similar, but we will try learning more before playing a bot again as the US bot seemed pretty weak as we understood it (VC was fine). After more plays, I will rate it a 9 to start with. Tons of hard choices, real decisions, not fluff. The game requires repeated plays to get even a grasp on what are good strategies for the various factions.  I look forward to trying this with 4 humans, not just 2 or 3.

After more plays I would count myself as slightly disappointed.  The 2 and 3 player games are just fine, but not great. After about 10 plays, the bots are just too random to be interesting. They don't play well and always come in last.  No matter the faction.  Final rating will depend on how it plays with 4 human players.

TLDR - Solid game, deep, brain-using

After what seemed like an eternity of waiting, this finally arrived. Just going through the tutorial right now, but I can say....this thing is freaking beautiful! Unsurprisingly, Mark Herman appears to have taken this system to its furthest extent. (so far) There is enough here to make my head hurt...and I can't wait to get into it. Easily my most anticipated game of 2014. GMT really treated this one right...it's eye popping.

Edit: Still have only played solo, and have played all but the long campaign (which I will tackle in the next few weeks at some point), using bots and also just playing everyone solo, and I will rate this a 10. I am fascinated by this game and the involved interactions with all the factions, their victory conditions, and how the different force types and operations and activities impact everything. It's my game of the year, and one of my favorite recent games, and I simply cannot wait to play a four player game with real people. I can't see any way I would not give it a 10. Thanks Mark Herman And Volko Ruhnke.

Intense, deadly COIN addition.  I have no idea how to stop US juggernaut yet, but maybe it was the combo of cards they got but we got hammered with little chance to respond.  Feels like more going on in this one.  Certainly more units moving around and battles everywhere.  Want to try learning how to play North Vietnam and VC.

Discussion is if there is anything you do that makes a difference.  I think so, but not quite sure yet.  Does it all run on the events?

Feb '18:  Played a short game (well, by cards: took us more than 4 hours) to play a 2-player.  Quite exciting, actually.  Tough choices.  The game flt a bit more dynamic, although the VC suffered a lot from my air strikes,  I played both the US and ARVN, my opponent the NVA and VC.  We decided the winner was the one whose second place faction was the best score.  I got -1 and -8, he got -11 and -14, so I won pretty big.  His NVA just could not seem to get started.

Massive. Probably my go-to Vietnam operational to date. I keep this over Hearts & Minds because I really like the COIN system and, for the kind of historical theatre, I think this is where it really shines the most (complex interdigitation between politic, war, resources, area control - that is many different buttons to trigger).

Components wise, the game is just gorgeous. The rulebooks do a lot to take you by hands and guide you into the system, with very few errata. Plus, it scales wonderfully from solo to 4 thanks to a clever (even if a bit cumbersome) bot system. 

What else to say... a 10/10.

Very interesting win conditions. You are on a team with another player but have different win conditions. Your side of the conflict must win for you to win, but your teammate must also lose. 

You want your side to be strong, but you do not want your teammate to be too strong. 

This is a long and involved game, however, and one that is not friendly to more casual players. Because of this I will likely not play it very often. Rated lower simply for that fact.

Fantastic game! Manages to capture the subtle balance and interplay between the four interests and, via the mechanics and victory conditions, shift your thinking to a quite uncharacteristic (for me) mindset.

As with most games of this type, the diversity of possible options on each turn, and the initial 'opacity' of sensible strategy dictates a slow learning curve. I almost feel that I can see the light at the end of the tunnel where mechanics become sublimated to strategy.

The flow charts and figuring out what the bots should be doing is pretty crazy.  all of this complexity probably creates a better AI, but it is a lot of work to process and understand and even after hours of working through the solitaire rules I am not sure I had them right.

Haven't played with human opponents yet but I think this game will be fairly decent.

RATING: 9
Being familiar with another COIN game (Cuba Libre), I think I roughly knew what to expect from FitL. While it shares the feeling of a puzzeling machine hidden inside a black box, the game is at least one step up in complexity compared to Cuba Libre. It's a lot harder to keep the overview. So many pieces, the map is larger with many more areas, there are lines of communication and tunnels, all factions have guerilla troops, and there are more rules to adhere. 

Alltogether, I came to admire the COIN system a lot. The way the factions interact is exciting and creates theme. It's great that the game is playable with any number of players between 1 and 4. But it's not only that FitL works as a game, it's also the very first time that a war game really managed to raise my interest in the conflict, probably because it's not a combat simulation, but a game about the conflict as a whole. Not a simulation, mind you, but it does draw an impressive picture.  

Astonishing amount of cards; very high production values. 

Waht I don't like: GMT should have provided graphical set up instructions. Also, some instructions are not explicit, like "Do A and/or B or C" --> does it mean "[A and/or B] or [C]", or maybe "[A] and/or [B or C]"...?

Finally a word on the cover. I'm not sure if I like the connotation of war romanticism. The picture as a picture is great as is the graphic style, but given the brutality of the war, a more drastic picture would have been very appropriate.


MY GAME COMMENTS IN GERMAN, TAKEN FROM WWW.UNKNOWNS.DE

2014-11-21: Fire in the Lake hat seine ansteckende Wirkung auf mich voll entfaltet. Ist ja bekanntlich immer so, oder? Kaum beginnt der Urlaub -- zack!, sofort krank. :S Ich bin ganz klar (Achtung, das Wortspiel gleich ist echt unzumutbar)... COINfiziert.

Ohne Witz. In meinem Spieler-Dasein wurde mit FitL ein neues Kapitel aufgeschlagen. Ich habe bisher Wargames eher aus Spaß am Krieg spielen gespielt, und habe mich nicht großartig für die geschichtlichen Ereignisse interessiert. Mit und durch Fire in the Lake hat sich das schlagartig geändert. Ich habe das Playbook fast komplett durchgelesen, und eine sechsstündige Dokumentation über den Konflikt angeschaut. Das Tutorial habe ich einmal alleine durchgespielt, und soeben eine erste Probepartie 1 gegen 1. Ich bin so gefesselt, dass ich bei Gelegenheit sicher mehr dazu schreiben werde. Das Wecken von Interesse am Thema ist eine ganz große Stärke des Systems, was für mich daran liegt, dass der Konflikt umfassender, beleuchtet wird. Nicht simuliert, wohlgemerkt, aber die Spielerfahrung ist wirklich "inspirierend" in dem Sinne, dass sie Interesse an Geschichte weckt.

Eindrücke: Im Vergleich zu Cuba Libre eine Stufe komplexer und schwerer überschaubar. Eine große Blackbox mit vielen Schaltern dran. Man muss ein bisschen herumprobieren um zu verstehen, was passiert, wenn man welchen Schalter drückt. Interessant und durchaus auch ärgerlich ist der Versuch des Designers, US-amerikanische Kriegsverbrechen in Vietnam klein zu reden ("Pazifizierung", sowie die Anmerkung im Playbook zu Karte 119, zu Letzterem gab es auch schon eine hässliche und natürlich gesperrte Diskussion auf dem Geek dazu). Will ich noch nicht abschließend bewerten.

2014-12-08: Inzwischen habe ich vier Partein auf dem Buckel, und wisst Ihr was? So langsam werde ich grantig. Ich kann nicht sicher sagen, ob es an meiner anscheinend leicht beschränkten Denkfähigkeit liegt, oder vielleicht auch daran, dass ich immer noch 1 gegen 1 gespielt habe und also jeder Spieler 2 Fraktionen steuert, was verwirrt -- oder ob dem Spiel einfach nur eine bessere Aktionsübersicht fehlt? Ich habe jetzt insgesamt sicher shcon 25 Stunden reine Spielzeit investiert, und muss trotzdem bei jedem einzelnen Zug nochmal nachprüfen, ob der in der beabsichtigten Form wirklich erlaubt ist. Problem: Die Aktionen selbst sind zwar relativ überschaubar, nur unterscheiden sie sich in ihrer Handhabung je nach Fraktion immer in kleines bisschen. FitL ist nach wie vor immernoch das heißte Eisen in meinem Feuer, aber so langsam kommt doch ein wenig Frustration auf.
Sehr hilfreich sind die "Arthur's Aid" sheets (file section auf boardgamegeek sowie bei GMT). Deren Hilfe ändert aber nichts daran, dass ich permanent meine Züge und die des Mitspielers auf Legalität checken muss, und dem Mitspieler geht es andersherum ebeneso, denn ein Fehler passiert schnell. Um es nochmals zu betonen: An sich ist das Spiel nicht schwer, aber die Details machen es schwer erlernbar. Ich freue mich trotzdem auf die nächste Partie. Hoffentlich kriegen wir das kurze Szenario auch mal in weniger als 6 Stunden hin.

2015-01-22: Ich finde es nach wie vor sehr schwer, bei diesem Spiel den Überblick zu wahren, wobei "wahren" ja impliziert, dass man den Überblick zu irgendeinem Zeitpunkt gehabt hätte. Das ist nicht unbedingt der Fall. Allerdings war es gestern erstmals so, dass einer der Mitspieler in meinen Runden überhaupt einmal einen Schlüssel zum Sieg gefunden hatte, wenn der sich auch aus purer Not heraus eher unerwartet ergeben hatte.

The most mature iteration of the COIN system I've played so far in terms of mechanics (note that I've not yet played any of the games published after this), and overall a fascinating experience. I have some reservations about this system (see my comment on Cuba Libre, also 'in' my collection under 'Prev. Owned') but it certainly has a lot of promise. In essence, COIN has introduced a number of euro game principles into the war game genre (multi-player play as standard, deterministic mechanisms, streamlining and abstraction of unnecessary 'fluff' like unit names and sizes) and combined them with CDG innovations (basically using events to incorporate the particularities and idiosyncrasies of a conflict, without adding a ton of extra rules).
FitL tries to model Vietnam as a four-faction conflict, which is perhaps doubtful from the historical point of view, yet was probably the best choice from the gameplay perspective. One alternative way to play is suggested by Mark Herman, that is to play the two communist factions as a single side (in essence making it a 3-player game), which may well make it more historically accurate.

RATING: 10
My first COIN title.

I love how it puts the player's tough choices into the context of political and historical events.  While the system adapts those of earlier games in the series, in practice it really feels like the Vietnam War playing out on a scale of months and years.

I've been impressed all along at the way these games handle very controversial and complicated issues in a mature and even-handed manner. The notes and event text in the playbook suggest a design that treats all sides in this conflict (and even the different political actors within each side) like human beings without demonizing or cartooning them.

Very thematic and engrossing game with a myriad of decision trees to consider with every decision the players make. So why am I rating it a seven? For me, it is the time requirement. Yes, there are smaller scenarios available but if you really want to experience the whole war, you have a lot more available time on your hands than I have.

I was really hoping FitL would supplant Cuba Libre as my COIN game of choice but the time requirements to play FitL means that Cuba Libre will still be hitting my table a lot more often.

My fourth COIN game, and the most complex. It has VC instead of the usual mob faction and playing it takes some thought. The NVA are also unusual as they breed many regular troops, but can lose them pretty rapdily as well. The US and RVNA are similar to the Coalation and Govt factions is A Distant Plain, so they were easier. I would not start with the long scenario, as described in teh example of plain as it drags rather. I played the long, medium and short scenarios, but I will need to return for another play through.

Right now, the best game in the series and one of the best games on the subject matter. Lifts the COIN series to new heights with more innovative mechanics such as the Pivotal Event cards and the Coup (replacing Propaganda) in the main series. Though a natural 4-player game, it brings back the "uneasy alliance" rivalry which was visited first by A Distant Plain in regards to the Coalition and Government but spreads it out to all factions with the NVA paired with the VietCong and the US-led Alliance with the ARVN, thus making it a worthy two-player game as well. Also interesting is that you have an insurgency (the NVA) with Cubes while the CoIn forces have "guerrillas" in the form of Irregulars/Special Forces. With over 2000 P500 orders, one of the most anticipated games in the hobby, and being the focus of a collaboration of two of the most prolific designers in the industry, one can see why.

I didn't feel that the game was showing me the problems faced in running this war.
The impact of events might well be reflected in te rules an the cards but it didn't convey any understanding to me.
So I won but I don't know why. I mean I know I won because I achieved the VP target but why that was enough at that point in the games seemed arbitrary.
It felt more like a game, a euro even, than a wargame.

My intro to the Coin series. It feels really different than any other wargame I've ever played. Not that I'm new to assymetric play, but the way the game handles the political subtleties of each faction while still managing to give each player different strategies is a heck of a great achievement for any designer.

The system seems to be really solid.

Played solo twice.  US won first game, narrowly beating out the NVA after a well time Easter Offensive blitz.  ARVN won second game after a long stint in the lead.  The US crushed the VC so badly after the penultimate coup that they really didn't have much to do in the final 3rd of the game.  US also kept the Trail at 1 or lower, making NVA's game difficult.  These two games were played in "chronological order" of the event cards, so that i got through 64, 65 and much of 68.  I am going to box it for a while, but will mix all cards for the next game.  I am anxious ot play with some vets of this series, but would like to grok the strategy more fully before goofing up in front of strangers. 

Year later: have played twice with four players, still and excellent game.  Tends to get chaotic with so many heads in the game, but it has remained a favorite.

It seems that the COIN system was created for this game. Not only is it a fantastic and under explored theme, but well represented by Volko's amazing game system. Most Vietnam games don't get great treatment using standard war-gaming hex-and counter systems.
When you add the fact that it is Multiplayer and yet there are 4 possible solitaire player options the games playability is incredible.
Capabilities and the expanded decks insure you will never have the same game twice. Tons of background, flavor and great 'Nam experience.

Best of the COIN series. Really enjoy the theme and the refinement done to the system. This game is tense for each faction, subtle in strategy and game play and you will never feel that you have enough moves to do any the critical actions that you need. 

Both sides have some conventional forces now though it doesn't look easy to play the North Vietnam Army due to the devastating American Airpower. 

The U.S. has been winning all games so far (due to ability to swing VPs dramatically in the Coup phase) and it's clear that the ARVN has to be more hostile towards its "Ally" for any other player to have a chance.

Played one 4 player game. There is so much minutia in this game that its really hard to get a feel for the entire conflict, or as Marco Arnaudo puts it, it's difficult to see the forest for the trees.  One particularly annoying thing was that when the game is going to end on the next card, if a player is going to get a turn after his "ally," he can undermine the ally to grab points or take away points from him to what I think is an unreasonable extent. 

Anyway, the components are pretty nice.

Game is a lot different than other entries into the COIN series. Pivotal events have a big impact on the game. The design does a good job of modeling the more conventional aspects of this war.

The Vietnam war in the COIN system (my first entry into the COIN series). It is quite rich and full of historical flavor, 4 factions. The core turn structure with event cards and the choice in player order printed on the card to do the event or do faction-specific operations is quite nifty and pleasing. Good looking components, good physical quality (and great cover art). Very carefully written rules give me the rare pleasing positive vibe of quality which I get reading rules by Chad Jensen (Combat Commander, Fighting Formations). The excellent manual also includes tutorial game walk-throughs, historical/development notes, event card detailed explanations + tactical tips + historical notes, etc. Works solitaire (human vs bots), 2 player (2 factions vs 2 factions), 3 and 4 player, even interesting to solo all 4 sides noncompetitively. Large number of event cards, so that even the longest scenario only uses a subset of them. The variety of options on your turn can be bewilderingly complex with many strategic and tactical factors to consider. COIN author Volko Ruhnke is active in the BGG forum, answering questions and taking suggestions for rule text improvements/clarifications as is coauthor Mark Herman and bot author Örjan Ariander. All this is great.

Downside? The bot/AI player rules add significant time and complexity and is notably more confusing/subtle to grok than the game rules themselves. Each faction has its own set of operations and actions so there is a lot of detail to remember, even though it's almost all well & clearly explained. Game length: your first solo learning "short scenario" game may last 5 or 6 hours. (But fear not, experience makes you faster!)

So far I've played soloing all sides, solitaire (one side vs 3 bots), and 2-player (US/ARVN vs VC/NVA) and enjoyed them all.

If you are willing to make the investment of time and effort, it is quite a pleasing game, plus an interesting take on the Vietnam war as a 4-faction affair.

This just didn't work for me, though I was tired and hadn't read the rules myself, which hardly does the game justice. I don't think I enjoy this kind of thing with four players - if it's going to be an intense conflict, make it a 2player, or keep it where I can grasp it (like War of the Roses).

I bought the game on a whim because of its reputation. But I found it was just too deep for my taste, and I turned around and sold it.

This is another addition to the COIN series.  By far the best historical setting for me.  It is also the most complicated game of the series.  I am still on the fence with the whole idea of playing 'King of the Hill' as a Geekbuddy put it in his review.

Also, with so much to look at and analyze sometimes I get lost while trying to formulate a plan.

My first COIN game. This one shapes up to be tricky to explain to new players -- the actions are easy, but it requires independent learners to keep studying the player aid (which is nicely laid out but could have used [i]some[/i] graphics or visual aids, and better colors, damn you GMT) during downtime to understand the possibilities with Ops and the intricate asymmetric player powers.

Seems like a treat for 4 players. The theme is gripping, the asymmetry simulates the guerilla warfare well, and the action system is nifty. Lots of considerations with each card -- punt on this card and do the next one? Or figure out which of the 3 options to take? In addition to not getting swayed by the Events and focusing on Ops unless it's really that good, there's also the tough consideration on what options to leave the opponents that follow.

Had one decision where (as Vietcong) I planned it out and punted, feeling confident my North Vietnamese partner would back me up and not let the event fall into wrong hands and... nope! NVA wants to get first dibs on the next card and could care less about NVA + VC guys getting slaughtered right now. That's the moment when my admiration of the game deepened.

RATING: 8
Uses the [b]COIN[/b] system of euro-style, asymmetric warfare wargames. One of the few games that accurately portrays the political tensions between the VC and the NVA. These tensions, often violent and repressive, originate from the North–South cultural divide and have persisted for centuries. Some historians even suspect the NVA orchestrated the Tet Offensive to remove the VC as a political threat, who were militarily destroyed by the failed offensive. Not only are the NVA and VC attempting to expel foreign occupants, but are also vying for hegemony over the country. Whomever wins will be in a position to form the new Vietnamese government after Saigon falls. 

The US forces are very powerful, but they're unwilling to commit more than a few troops. The lynchpin of NVA and VC victory is the corruption of ARVN forces, constantly stealing patronage from the US–supplied aid. If ARVN steals patronage, they sabotage their own survival, yet if they don't steal they won't remain in power and can't win the game. South Vietnam can't afford to turtle in cities and ignore the countryside; they must constantly search and destroy VC guerrillas, otherwise the population will turn against them.

It's best to have a mix of unit types (e.g. ARVN Troops, Police, and Irregulars) because some of the operations require the presence of two specific unit types.

[1 play] We played the short scenario. 4 players. Six hours with roughly an hour of prep and rules. Beautiful game with great art and bits.

Definitely at the extreme upper end of my gaming tolerance for complexity and downtime. We did get faster as we progressed in our understanding of the rules and procedures.

I felt the Vietnam War a little bit. Perhaps the cards would have meant a little more if I knew the history better. Some of the actions and cards seemed significantly stronger than others. Not necessarily a deal breaker, but it would surely help to understand strategy if a player developed a good knowledge of each of the cards in the game.

Did I have fun? Yes. Was the magic equation satisfied (complexity x downtime / enjoyment x opportunities for clever and meaningful decisions)? Not entirely. But that could simply be that the COIN games are just too long and complex to hit me in my gaming wheelhouse. This might be one I would enjoy playing in the nursing home someday, when I have all the time in the world.

In the past I would have never guessed there would be such an excellent wargame designed without having normal wargame counters and a CRT. FitL is Stradivarius among wargames Mark & Volko did a great job, the game components were top notch. It will make you put your thinking cap on trying figure out what action would be best. If you didn't grow up when the Vietnam War (I was a teenager at the time)by playing the game you would learn a lot about the war. I would not recommend the game as an introductory game. 

I feel the rulebook was confusing in places and could have been written a bit clearer. It might of helped too if some of the rules could have been repeated or reinforced. For example repeating which enemy pieces can be removed in an air strike. Some of the event cards were confusing till I was able to get a clarification.

Thanks for adding the bots so one can play FitL solitaire easier. I tip my hat to Oerjan for doing a difficult job in coming up with the bots, he did a excellent job.

I wanted to like this one. But it is simply too big and slow. And thats comming from a pretty hardcore wargamer!

In between my plays of this, I had a few games of Hearts and Minds, a completely different approach to the war, I know, not super elegant either, but simple and too the point and creating some real nail biting decision making. And it FELT like vietnam. With all it's rules and realism, the COIN series still feels very abstract. Which is weird, because it's still so complicated. It's like they tried to make a euro, but with an oldschool Avalon Hill/SPI/MMP mindset (which is maybe not unlikely). The result is a game that plays like it's 15 different euros compressed into one.

FitL feels overwrought. I may just not have put enough time into it. But after a looong couple of plays, everybody was still pretty confused as to what was going on. Sure, we started to see how everything kind of fit together. But for all the different, asymmetrical faction possibilities, we all still felt limited in our actions, like the cards often dictated what to do. The constant events taking place made every round feel like an exception to the rule.

There's a good game buried in there some where, but someone have to cut away 3/4 of the mechanic clutter to expose it. I mean c'mon, the rules for placing cubes on the roads on the lines between the areas? That is just so fiddly and unnecessary. Surely the significance of infrastructure control could be represented in a much simpler manner?

Gradual complexification of the system has made this a bit of a headache to play solo, especially with respect to first 2 instalments in the series. Besides, and this is certainly a silly remark, I'm so used to think of 'nam as a more traditional "war", rather than a convoluted series of counterinsurgent operations and guerrilla warfare, that the area control character of the game, with the degree of abstraction it entails, does not seem to quite cut it for me. The first COIN games also suffers from this issue in my view, but not quite as much as this one. 

Still a fantastic game!

My one play of this so far felt kinda dry, but I'd like to play again before judging it because: 

* It seems like the asymmetrical and strategic play should be right up my alley

* It is so different from stuff I am used to playing that it was hard to connect to the game

* Most of the game was spent looking at bland player aids, which probably had an impact on enjoyment. Once I internalize the actions more there'll be less of that

So far, I'd rather play Twilight Struggle, but am willing to play more to find out if this is an enjoyable and unique multiplayer game

Also, I don't know much about the Vietnam War. But from what I do know, my play of this was impressively thematic.

RATING: 3
Rating based on my own personal preference after one play. The game seems to be complicated just for the sake of being complicated. Even though this comes across as a highly strategic game, there can be a great deal of randomness and swinginess due to the event cards and turn order. One player kept getting stuck in last place on turn order so not only did he have to wait a huge amount of time between turns, he kept getting stuck with poor choices because the earlier players can take better actions.

Not for me, too long and complicated.

RATING: N/A
No rating again for this one (see my Cuba Libre comments) as we didn't even finish the game (although playing the full war scenario was probably a bad idea).  As usual, it feels artificially balanced by the card system and likely to degenerate into "let's all stop one another winning then whoever gets lucky with the last card wins".  Again I'm not convinced that the system idea, while innovative, is actually being applied very well yet, although the designers have made some significant changes so it may be moving in the right direction.

Love this game, it was my first COIN game. What a beautiful looking game that brings this conflict to life in a way I had never experienced. I hope to play this game once a year even if only solo for decades to come. Tried to do a video series on how to play solo, may polish up and put it out there one day. Read a whole series of books around this criminal war thanks to this game. The US PBS series on utube it well worth watching.

I can see the beauty of this design, both the graphics and the game play, but this was not for me.  It felt like too much back and forth with nothing accomplished, and it was too easy for players to bring down the leader when a coup card (which can trigger the win) was coming up next.  The list of possible options on your turn mostly came down to the same thing over and over, since there was just the one thing which would lead to points.  This was a learning game, though, so I'm willing to give this one another try.

After various attempts to understand the rules of the COIN series, I played two games via email and got past the basics of understanding what you "can" do, still trying to figure out "why" and "where" - ie develop and implement a strategy.

I think I like the system now that I feel like I got up and over the steep learning curve.

At least I liked it enough to preorder all the upcoming COIN titles and buy the old ones off ebay.  Can't wait for the american revolution game (liberty or death).

RATING: 8
This is the first game in the COIN system that I've had the good fortune to play.  This system is a great way of modeling conflicts which are not well-served by traditional two-player wargame designs.  The cooperative nature of working with your  ally is shielded by the fact that you have complementary, but fundamentally different goals.  This allows a whole new kind of game that models politics as an integrated part of war strategy, a view that is much more cohesive and relevant to modern warfare.  

The major downside of the game is its mechanical complexity.  Each individual action is straightforward, but there's several different mechanics for each player, and each player's actions are unique.  It's not always easy to figure out how to do something as simple as move cubes around the board.  Going beyond that and formulating a good strategy is even more difficult for the first-time player.

At the end of the day, this is a complex game, about a complex conflict.  It's a good game, and a wonderful model.

Rating based on solo play - long campaign - against 3 robots as US (AVRN victory).

I am sure I mucked up some of the rules - but very much like the introduction of COIN guerrillas and insurgent troops.

Final thing - definitely felt like it followed the actual war - thought I could achieve victory with minimal us troops.  The the casualties mount and find myself committing more and more to the effort.

Heaviest one of the COIN series so far, and quite a slog to go through (much like the actual war it depicts). More interesting theme and narrative than "A Distant Plain" or "Andean Abyss", but less accessible than "Cuba Libre".

Was thinking of a concise way to summarise Fire in the Lake, another commenter describes it perfectly; overwrought. There's tough decisions, there's no decisions, there's easy decisions, but for what? There is nothing particularly decisive or crippling in whatever is done, with the exception of the events, The game just plods along to a conclusion where whomever got bashed the least wins. Definitely prefer the less convoluted Cuba Libre.

Interesting after one play. Played US and it felt boring gaining points from not using your pieces though, not a good game mechanic IMO. I won but got bored (removed as much as I could in coup 1 and won coup 2). 
Want to play again but definitely not as US.

The same exact thing happened game 2. US withdraw maximum coup 1 and then we didn't even bother to play any further. ARVN was not willing to remove all cubes from Saigon and ARVN resources were through the roof. Now way to stop US if he could keep Saigon at full support. 
Lowering from 7.5 to 5.5. Could play again but I think the game design is off.

Massive, brilliant: GMT gives you a lot of game for your money, and they set a high bar for quality with this one.  The AI is clever (if difficult to implement at times), and the core COIN mechanic is fun and surprisingly easy to learn.  I predict that it won't be an easy game to bring to the table, though....

Played at LT 2014. COIN games are just not my thing. Played the South Vietnamese army. Ended the game within 45 minutes by inviting the Vietcong to take Saigon and the Americans did everything to stop it. These games are just not well balanced. If you shift the equilibrium ever so slightly from the historic truth, everything goes nuclear. I was glad to get out early. The production is superb, however.

Mixed feelings about this game.  While it was nice that Fire in the Lake introduced some new mechanics for the factions since some were getting stale, I found this to be the clunkiest of the COIN series.  The strategies for all 4 groups are less intuitive than in the other COIN games, especially the NVA.  The victory conditions did not feel right, especially with NVA competing against the VC, and US and ARVN competing.  I'm also getting tired of some of the core COIN mechanics like LOC, police and troops, and the core actions.  This was my favorite series, but I'm lukewarm on this title.

On the positive side, the rulebook and playbook are great as is the historical theme in the cards.  I'm hoping that the change to different eras will breathe new life into the COIN series, because they are starting to feel too much the same and I no longer feel I need to own them all.

RATING: 10
COIN treatment of a culminating "Cold" War battle is a lovingly crafted, epic wargame set in Vietnam. Gameplay creates a unique story, an alternative history of stuff that actually went down. Before seeing it in action, I hated the idea of missing Hand Management, but the Card Drafting mechanic of COIN is simply brilliant. COIN is the best effort of multiplayer wargame with Variable Player Powers and unique victory conditions I have seen. Some factions are natural allies, some not so much, but their goals aren't necessarily diametrically opposite. Every decision in the chaotic insurgency/counterinsurgency situation takes all the brainpower a player has in this easy to learn but difficult to win epic system.

El sabor agrio de la guerra de Vietnam, las tropas americanas  como una plaga, tratando de comerse el territorio enemigo, hacerlos retroceder, pendientes de la opinión pública, los recursos y las bajas. 

No hay un hogar desde el que operar, ni límites ni fronteras, en todas partes se levantan los insurgentes como una mancha imposible de borrar que crece y crece y te invita a volver a casa.

Update: Only for four players.

RATING: 6
Pretty neat, lots of nice historical flavour via the cards and faction interactions. Getting a handle on who you should be hitting and how much takes some experience; your nominal "allies" are also fellow competitors. I don't recommend the bots; they are exploitable and/or dumb in certain situations. It's also a shame is that the short game (3-4h) is probably the weakest offering, lacking the "pivotal events" that give a bit of punch and narration to each side, and a bit of long-term planning. But the medium-length game is 8 hours, and the campaign even longer, so they're unlikely to get much play.

A lot of it comes down to the initiative order and powerful effects of the event cards. Get the wrong events, or several bad initiative orderings, and you'll suddenly be in the back seat.

Learning the game involves a lot of front-loading; there are a lot of special powers for each faction, and given the whack-a-mole tactical nature of the gameplay, you need to properly understand it all to play well.

A solid COIN series game.

I prefer Distant Plain to this, since this game looks somewhat regular warfare than COIN operations.

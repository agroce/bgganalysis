It's an interesting game really. The way the numbers works is a bit convoluted (if logical), so beginners don't get it too well. Still, it's an interesting strategy and somewhat variant on 6 Nimmt.

A gamers version of 6 Nimmt.
It has a more strategic side that you don't have in 6 Nimmt.
Also you play in a normal round the clock style.
Has the feeling that you get pushed into a corner in every game. Hard decisions on what tactics you want to apply.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Intelligent and fun - it was surprising how this game works and works so well! - it's all about applying pressure in front of teh number you just played at the expense of releiving pressure behind the number you just played! - very interesting and plenty of tough choices in a quick and intelligent card game!

On its merits a better game than 6 Nimmt! though it shares a common heritage but it lacks the 'fun' element of 6 Nimmt! that gets it to the table more often as your brain may hurt when playing this.

RATING: 5
A vague family resemblance to 6 Nimmt!, but nontheless a distinct game with more control. Still not one to play with lots of players, though, as it's a bit calculational and can bog down quite a bit with too many players (6, maybe 5).

Was given this by accident. They meant to purchase 6 nimmitz (6 takes). Have only played using the rules in the box once. You can use the cards in this box to play 6 nimmitz, and thats what I have been doing. This is a deeper game that 6 nimmitz, but does not seem to be as "Fun". I rate this an 8 if you download the 6 nimmitz rules and use the deck to play both games.

2-6

Doel:

Zo weinig mogelijk koeienkoppen verzamelen, want elke koeienkop = 1 minpunt.

Voorbereiding:

Geef iedere speler 10 handkaarten.
Neem 4 kaarten en leg ze open op tafel. Deze kaarten vormen elk het begin van een rij die maximaal 5 kaarten mag bevatten.

Speelverloop:

1/ Alle spelers leggen gedekt een kaart op tafel.  
2/ Alle spelers draaien simultaan hun kaart open.
3/ Wie de laagste kaart heeft gespeeld, komt eerst aan beurt. Daarna de op één na laagste kaart, enz.
4/ De kaarten moeten in een rij steeds een oplopende volgorde hebben.
5/ Een kaart moet altijd in de rij worden gelegd waarvan de laatste kaart het kleinste verschil heeft met de nieuwe kaart.
6/ Wanneer men een zesde kaart zou moeten leggen, dan neemt die speler alle 5 kaarten in die rij. Zijn zesde kaart vormt het begin van de nieuwe rij.
7/ De kaarten die hij heeft genomen, legt hij opzij. Dit zijn minpunten op het einde van het spel.
8/ Wanneer je een kaart speelt die zo laag is dat ze in geen enkele rij past, dan moet je alle kaarten van een willekeurige rij nemen. Jouw lage kaart vormt de eerste kaart van die nieuwe rij.

Je speelt x aantal ronden tot 1 speler minstens 66 minpunten heeft verzameld. De speler die op dat moment het minste minpunten heeft, wint.

RATING: 5
A remote cousin of 6 Nimmt!, this version has players taking turns playing one to three cards onto fifteen piles of cards. If you play the 5th card, you take the pile. The object is to load up on green ox-heads, while avoiding red ox-heads. Very different in feel from the frenetic 6 Nimmt!, which I must admit I enjoy a lot more. The game plays very quickly, however, and does lump a tough decision or two on you every turn!

Sequel to 6nimit! slows the game down considerably, as people now take time to do their turns.  doesn't seem as fun as cat 5 was for the group, so mediocre rating.

2014-11-03 : I fail to see why this game is popular - there's no strategy and just one or two tactical tricks that once you know them, you just employ .. or not - and hope for the best.
2015-12-13 : Another play and I'm lowering my score from 4 to 2 - this is a total disaster of a game
2016-11-27 : It got put on the table again and in order to amuse myself I decided to not think about it at all, order my cards from high to low and simply always play the highest card. I scored 6 that round. Thinking I could do better I pretended to be a computer running the 3-step tactical program on how to play this game and simply always play the card the "program" told me to play. I finished 2nd in a 5-round 5-player game, way ahead of players who took their time studying the table and their hand. What a failure of a game.

Using the German game "Hornochsen".  It's a little different from "6 Nimmt".  Fun, but not as much as "6 Nimmt" is.  Played my first game of it today (4-2-2011).  I lost 22 (Mr. Billington's score) to -22 (my score).  Looking forward to playing it again.  Like a cross between "King-in-the-Corner" and "6 Nimmt".  Played it twice with Mr. Billington on 4-9-2011 and won both times.  But he wasn't back to feeling well yet, so I think he'll play alot better when he's totally well again.  Looking forward to it.

RATING: 8
Nice painful decision-maiking game.  Every card you play could end up biting you back in the end.  Plays quick, and there is much groaning involved as the set you hoped make it around does not, and now you have to play a card on one of the last 2 stacks, both loaded with angry bulls.  (The way the number of cards are scaled to make it work with any number of players makes my mathemetician self very happy.)

Compared to its sibling Category 5, Hornochsen is the much deeper game. At the same time, it reduces the take that factor by a considerable amount, taking some of the fun with it. Objectively, Hornochsen is the better game, but subjectively, Category 5 is simple, light-hearted fun while Hornochsen borders on work.

Great update of 6 Nimmt!  I really don't much care for its predecessor, but I quite like this one.  Plenty more decisions.  
WARNING:  Do not teach this to newbies with 5 or 6 players.  The number of stacks (15) coupled with the hand size tends to overwhelm.  A 6P game where only I had played before *dragged* for far too long.  A couple players could not get "learning game" through their heads and agonized over decisions.  So much so that another player took to random plays just to speed things along.  In the end, they agreed the game would probably have been better with less, at least to learn.  You have been warned.

Many players compare this game with "6 nimmt" aka Category 5 and they prefer one or the other, that's OK. However the advantage of this one is, that you can play both games.

[Initial Impression: 5]
Another of the "some cards are good and some are bad" variety, so it feels very similar to many other filler card games.  Cards are laid out in a numbered series, and players take turns placing 1 to 3 cards on the next-lowest numbered pile.  Add the fifth card to a series and you collect all 5 cards.  There's definitely some strategy in trying to determine how best to keep yourself from taking those evil red-horned negative cards (the bad cards are really bad, the good cards only a little helpful), but you can still get royally screwed by the card draw.

An interesting game that suffers from the inevitable comparison to 6 nimmt!  The decisions are definitely a little trickier in this game, and I like that you only play one round.  It's also funny how quickly the situation can change, and how easy it is to end up with negative points.

That said, if people take too long on their turn, that can significantly detract from the enjoyment of what should be a relatively quick filler.  If approached as a slightly different variation on 6 nimmt! I think that this is a good substitute if you're looking for a slightly meatier experience.

[LUP 17-Feb-2007] Note to self this is [i]Take 5[/i], which I have played once which is why it came up in my Played and not rated or commented lists for a while.  Whenever it did I went WTF?  I have never heard of this game and had to click on the link to find out what it was.  On the one play it was quite good, but I think I prefer [i]6 Nimmt![/i].

Hornochesen! The German version of Take 5!  I have used this deck to play a 98 card version of Slide 5 (aka 6 Nimmt!) until I got a proper 104 "Take 6!" (Chinese version of 6 Nimmt!) deck.  The cards are easier to read than the Slide 5 cards.

See this review (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/506550/the-overlooked-redheaded-sibling-of-6-nimmt) and BGG comments regarding how this stacks up to 6 nimmt.

The reviewer wrote: 
Reviewers find the game compares poorly to 6 Nimmt. First, it plays fewer people, maxing out at 6 (what a virtue 6 Nimmt has to play 10). Second, play is slower and deliberate. They took away simultaneous actions, which a lot of people are fans of. There will be AP. 

Another review said: the optimal number of players is probably no more than 5, otherwise the downtime could get ugly.

I prefer to play this using the Take 6 rules.  
With 2 players the game is avg, but with more players it's a lot more fun.
With one deck you can play multiple variations of the game e.g. 
Cat 5, Take 5, 11 Nimmt, but just adding a few tokens instead of the bullhead cards, or removing the bonus cards.
Such a great game to play with kids, and a great time filler.

RATING: 6
The Gamer's 6 Nimmt!, or the big brother of it. Adds some complexity and deeper strategy. While those are entertaining at times, 6 Nimmt! is just a cleaner more balanced design. Which is why this is rated slightly lower. This one is not as good for non-gamers and family, but if you love 6 Nimmt! This one should be in your collection as well.

A truly horrible game, in a good kind of way. And/or 'oh, you had a strategy, I didn't bother'. It takes a few plays to start seeing setup possibilities rather than playing semi-randomly. All the same, sometimes you get cards you can do things with, sometimes its difficult. And you don't know what cards are missing. Or what other people will do ... so it is somewhat of a crapshoot. It gives the brain cells a run for the money though.

RATING: 5
Definitely a step-up from 6 nimmt ! This game is a bit more complex and the fact that it comes with plus AND minus points should be enough to tell you that this is not as easy a game to learn and play as 6 nimmt. However, that probably only applies if you are playing with 2 or 3 players, because just like 6 nimmt!, if you player with too many players, all derails into chaos (not a bad thing necessarily) but it might make the game a completely different experience than it should be. For a 'card game' if found this too complex and puzzle-like.

An interesting rendition of Category 5, but not as good as the original. It's more tactical, true, but not so accessible anymore - I highly doubt it could replace Category 5 as a simple, enjoyable and funny card game that plays well with virtually anyone.

Still, I enjoyed the few games I've played and I hope to play a few more, but this won't be a hit at my house I'm afraid.

I tend to like more control in games, but for some reason the absurd chaos of 6 Nimmt is just entertaining.  I like the basic concepts of that game, so the idea of creating a new version of it with a heightened level of information and control sounded like a great thing. 

What is gone is the roller coaster "ooh" and "ah" as you watch it play out. Now what is left is a mathy equation. Yet, how your hand is played out is still determined by the luck of the draw and the chaos of others.

Slightly slow for what is a card game as it requires some thought and planning.

If it played more quickly, it'd be a great game.

Update: The more I play this, the more I like it and I definitely try and get new players to play it at least twice in a row (which is usually pretty easy to do). I'm not entirely convinced that skill is more of a factor than luck but regardless, this is a really satisfying game for the 30 minutes or so it takes.

Wolfgang Kramer; In Take 6 all players put down one card per turn and all cards are revealed at the same time, so there is a lot of "guessing your opponent". Hornochsen is a turn based game, so that each player plays on her turn, without interference of the other players. Also the fact that the player can choose to put down from one to three cards make it much more strategical than Take 6. Take 5; but not the Take 5 that is also known as 6 Nimmt!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a GREAT example of a game mechanism that works better the more chaos you have in the game.  6 Nimmt! is a great game of card management and chaos, and people tend to like it, no matter if they're hardcore gamers or weekend converts.  Hornochsen, on the other hand, seems to suck the life out of the game in an attempt to add more strategy to the design.  That people seem much more likely to play the former over the latter attests to the importance of chaos in some games.

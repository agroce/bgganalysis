After playing it in Essen with the final components, it's just getting more And more awesome. Very good quality (the components looked like unpunched few minutes ago after 4x9 hours of gaming) And the dice are awesome. Loved the reaction of the gamers, families and children. Hope you will have as much fun with this game as I have!

The game comes in a big box compared to the few components comprising its inventory. Though they are of fine materials and the dice are awesome! The rules are clear, easy to digest and players can start rolling after reading a few pages. It is a mini fast paced game using innovative mechanics of play. It has a little bit of almost everything consisting a pirate's life on the High Seas: Luck, randomness, sacrifice, backstabbing, arrogance, co-op, greed, adventure and most of all fun! The game includes 4 scenarios for variety. Although the Skull Crew succeeds by completing each adventure, the winner is the player with the most gold in his pocket. Apart from the players, the pirate ship has in each scenario a separate game-crew ready to come to your aid if in need. For such a small game it has all that is needed to keep you vigilant and amused by its adventures.

Premise is great. The pieces as well. But something just didn't click wit me. Maybe some more variety could help the game. Or some additional layer of decisions. Or just something to spice it up a little.

Because in this shape and form it's forgettable in every possible meaning of this world.

really nice dice game. The one thing that is struggling, 
is the fact that the part where you play versus other 
players feels a bit weak, but beside that nice coop game.

Yahtzee in pirate-style together against black dices. Qwirkle Cubes is much more funny.

Great mix of cooperation, self interest and push your luck. Hilarious with the right mix of players. Box four times larger than it needs to be, tsk tsk.

After a video review: A semi-coop dice game, that does not work well as semi coop. But has some potential for solitaire play, or Coop only with variants I imagine.

It feels a bit like Dungeon Roll, where the "bad guys" rolls their dice, and the good guys must roll and match the bad side's dice to defeat them. Seems like a very simple game, could be easily playable by younger people or non gamers.

Pirate + dice = It was on my radar before Essen. Didn't pre-order because i want to check it out at spiel. Played with few nice fellow at PPL booth and really love how this game ctach the theme with mechanics. We need to cooparate but in the same time be sure i can put as many coins to my own pocket :) love to try other scenarios with my game group!

Wspieram.to edition with QWorkshop awesome dice! Really nice game for whole family. Rules are very simple, but there can be a lot of brain burning during gameplay! Dice = randomness, but you can control it in many ways (rum, pirates skills).

Tried a prototype at Essen 2014. Achieves its goal perfectly: a bit of backstabbing, interesting decisions, some luck, some luck, easy rules, 15-20 minutes....look forward to seeing the final version!

Very, very nice artwork and components. But the semi-cooperativess of the game didn't work well in my opinion. The game pushes you too hard to be cooperative that you rarely have a nice "selfish" choices. I think I will try to play this fully coop and report back.

Very simple dice game, yet very funny and engaging. Great as a filler, or as a party game, works well for 2-4 players. It's good to have a copy of it:).

Caja enorme para lo que viene, solo aire, un timo. Para colmo el juego es bastante simple y algo aburrido.
No lo recomiendo.

Really cool and innovative mechanism. Beautiful material. LOTS OF COOL DICE! Cannot understand why there is only 4 boards with adventuresets and the back of them is blank though. This game plays half cooperative. If you loose, everybody looses. If the quest is won, there is usually only one winner. Description comes in english, polish, german. There is hardly any in-game text.

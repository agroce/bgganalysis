May go down with time, as I'm not sure my standard game night crew would care for it, but right now I'm a big fan. Love the theme and I kept thinking back to the old "ST:TNG Trading Card Game" and how this was so much better.

More reading on each card than I'd like -- but I really don't think the rules are nearly as bad as some comments made them out to be.

All the mechanics are solid to me, even the oft-debated Search.

Definitely looking to buy the first STDBG:TNG to supplement the Explore scenario deck.

---

The co-op Borg scenario was very fun. Albeit, we spent more time discussing when the game wanted us to work together or work separately than anything else. Honestly, we'll probably play this mode more than anything.

Suffers the same problems as Star Trek Deck Building Game: The Next Generation. 

This should be a great deck building game but numerous flaws and lazy artwork hold it back. The first hour of the game is a grind-fest as players try and struggle to improve their hands. After that a player will win a new flag ship and then that player will win. The problem being there is still probably a good hour or more left until that player grinds down the victory.

The artwork and general quality of the game is very poor and generally lazy. Instead of creating dedicated artwork they've merely screen grabbed images from the TV Show from what appears to be a warn out VHS copy judging by the quality.

There is something to recommend for fans of the show but they would need to be die hard fans to look past the many flaws.

I really prefer this version of the Star Trek DBG over the original version. The Starbase cards seem more balanced with no overpowered outliers sitting out there for your opponents to purchase. Even better, the Space deck is much more balanced. It seems like all stats are evenly spread out as requirements for the Missions. Ships that you acquire as Flagships will not automatically ensure a victory now. I will try the new Borg co-op scenario next.

It's tough because I love the Star Trek universe, and I really enjoy deck building games. The Borg scenario is awesome, and I love what the designers were trying to do; however, the game tries to do way too much. It could have been a lot simpler and maintain the same gameplay. It had a lot of potential but in my opinion it falls flat. 
I do, however, think that hardcore fans of the series would love to have this in their collection.

It's okay for a deck builder. It has a fun co-op scenario against the Borg that's nice. The box is HUGE and additional dividers (not provided) are necessary to keep the cards apart. I bought it for around $9 on a Christmas sale, so we're getting our money's worth.

Only played the coöp scenario. The game was mostly about searching until you found one of the four cards that would turn the scenario into a cakewalk. That can be cute the first couple of plays (figuring it out and then the next time implementing it better), but it gets dull quickly after that.

Star Trek themed deck building game. When I first played this, it was ok. Over time I like it less and less with So many amazing deck building games have come out that this one does not keep my attention.
The only reason I'm keeping it, is to solo play the Borg invasion. I have no desire to buy the other Star Trek Deck Building games. This one game is enough.

There are othe deck building games I would rather play than this one.
Out of my collection.

The Star Trek deck building games are not bad, and actually can be credited with expanding the design parameters of deck builders.

This series may not be ground-breaking, but like any decent game these do give you a variety of interesting choices each turn without feeling like you're too reliant on luck to garner a win.

Effort was made to give the many unique cards thematic abilities, even if the overall game fails to immerse you in a story (which is the thematic holy grail of board games). The card images are good quailty stills from the shows and a reasonable few illustrations.

This version of the game thankfully eschewed a couple of unnecessarily fiddly mechanics that are present in The Original Series (2012) version. I would still play both, but this has a more efficient design.

After several plays of the Borg encounter, we've decided the game is definitely fun.  It wouldn't get as high a score if I weren't a big Trek fan, since the strategic decision-making is definitely overpowered by the large role that chance plays, but it's just deep enough to be interesting.

While the game is no shorter for the expansion, and certainly this is based on several plays of the expansion on it's own not incorporated with the original game, it's actually quite different in fee. and approach. There are cards that I miss from the base game but that I do not want to diminish the value of the new content. I really like the new cards in their entirety and certainly this game feel more focused on maneuvers which I thought was a weaker link in the original. The biggest change is the space deck which feels more varied, fair, and forgiving, making the game more fun overall.

If you liked the original then there is more to like here.

Worthy addition to the 1st game as you get not only more cards, but new content in form of scenarios, mission types and more variety of (smaller) ships. Plays up to 9 (!) players, when you earn both sets; stand alone box (4 players), but when I would have to choose, I would prefer the first game for a 5 player game and getting the base version of the enterprise characters (not to forget the enterprise itself :-) ).

Much better than most people give it credit for. The Original Series is perhaps a better game, but this is an easier entry point. I like how you're able to change ships as the game goes along, and the three different modes of play are all pretty fun. The Borg scenario is definitely the best, but I'm happy to play all of them.

I can't tell what this game was supposed to be, but it just seems horribly unbalanced, and borderline unplayable. I can't decide which version of the game is less fun. Perhaps the game store who swindled me into getting this "Next Phase" edition without having the original is partially to blame, but I am certainly not going to give this franchise MORE money for the other box when I can be pretty certain it will be just as awful. 

And I really like Star Trek too... so disappointing. :(

RATING: 6
Messy rules, messy card powers and unattractive cheap-looking cards diminishes what could be otherwise be an interesting thematic experience. Standard deck-building affair, with your buyable cards being Dominion-like gold cards + a Legendary-like 9 card draft. Cards also provide stats in speed, attack, diplomacy and defense, making for choices on how to best to use them when faced with cards from the challenge decks. I've only played the Borg co-op version, and that proved a tough ride for newbies - but that's better than providing too-easy first-up games anyway. Will explore further, but hoping for better and smoother plays.

RATING: 6
"Deck management that feels different from other deckbuilders. It's a race, and your deck is just a means to the end. Also, it doesn't ramp up massively  Includes 1 competitive, 1 co-op, and 1 team scenario. I was disappointed by the co-op mode."

What I like:
- Star Trek theme
- Race aspect plus combat give it a different feel
- Co-op mode has ways to really cooperate
- A few rules seem needlessly complex
- 

What I don't like:
- Co-op Borg scenario is all about fighting--no exploration
- No official solo option (the BGG variant is "OK")
- Using d20 to track damage is a bit awkward

I'm surprised that the most popular scenario among BGG users is the Borg/co-op. I haven't played "Exploration", but it seems like it has more variety and interesting actions. However, a co-op scenario fits the universe far better than having federation captains competing. 

Higher randomness than many deck games, both in the space deck and starbase card flips. No dice, however, which is nice. I would love to see a Voyager version, but that is unlikely to happen.

I would put the weight around 2.7, a bit higher than BGG voters.

I want to like this game....I really do. I like DBGs, I like Star Trek (not Next Gen, but whatever).  The ships do make this marginally better than the OS (kills me to say that....).  But it just isn't a good game.  The missions are just set up poorly, the various "currencies" are confusing...having to randomly fight each other just SUCKS.  This could have been so good....with more effort into the game play.  Oh, the rule book...NOT helpful! (JW)

Meh.  The best parts of this game are copied verbatim from Dominion.  The worst parts are fiddly, counter-intuitive and dry.
For example, you can "upgrade" your starship to a shuttlecraft to gain speed and defense!  Because it's superior to your starting starship it's a no-brainer but hardly thematic to have your entire crew packed into a shuttle for exploration.  There should be some trade-off (e.g., faster but limited size and defense) to make these decisions tougher.
Also, you spend a number of turns unable to accomplish missions, worse than the early game in Thunderstone.
I'll give this one another try but if some hidden gems don't leap out at me I'll be ditching it at first opportunity.
Edit: Ditched.

BGG Rating 4->5

BGG Rating should be 2 or 3. I give a 4 only because it`s Star Trek.

The game is very long and boring. At the begining of rhe game most of the star deck cards are to strong, so you must buy better cards.

The cards are very standard. If you play some deck building games you know the cards. The only new thing here is.., Star Trek.

The photos from the series are nice, but I don`t realy feel Star Trek like i feel it in Star Trek Fleet Captains. In this game the chatacters from the series are +x to some ability. Ok, some have some effect, but it still is very mechanic. Ok, there`s more theme than in Star Trek Expeditions.

If you don`t like Star Trek, than the game will be too long and too boring. Even if ypu a Star Trek fan the game could be interesting when you don`t play another deck building games. But i think it still would be not a very good game.

You can make hundred other games like this. Take dominion (but only cards that are not very interesting) with missions. Give a new theme and you have a game.

EDIT: The Borg scenario is different and much better. The theme is very strong. The Borg getting better the more you fight with them. 

But there`re 2 problems. When the Borg Queen comes to fast, you`re not ready. She is shuffled in the space deck. But then when you`re ready and she don`t come the game is little bit boring. You complete every card in the space deck without problems. You know you could also beat the Queen, but she don`t come. 

The second problem is you will play every game in the same way. So this scenario has no replaybility. You always need strong characters and cards that let you trash cards. 

Edit2: Romulan scenario. When you play 2p it`s similar to the exploration scenario. Maybe a little bit better (space deck has a main theme). 

Downtime and snowball effect.

Un genre de Thunderstone amélioré. Les règles sont un peu pénibles, la première partie a été beaucoup trop longue, mais les 2e et 3e ont été excellentes. Avec la sortie du jeu avec les personnages de la série originale, j'aimerais mieux avoir la nouvelle version.

RATING: 7
My husband, a huge TNG fan, bought this on a whim without knowing anything about it and it turned out to be one of our favorite purchases. I'm not especially big on deck-building games, but I like the way this one works because you not only have the time to build a great deck, but you also have to put it to use. You need the right characters, set-ups, and maneuvers to complete missions and win combats for your VPs. Also, because there are so many variants in the same box, it has great replayability. I've never even gotten past the base Explorations game. The game is flawed in a few ways, though; the instructions are poorly written and some of the cards are nearly incomprehensible. But with the right amount of interpretation, it's not an insurmountable hurdle. It's a lot of fun, especially with a Trekkie, to create your crew, decide which stats to emphasize, and have a few adventures.

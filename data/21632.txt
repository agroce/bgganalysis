Not bad, but not great either. I feel as if the end is quite contrived. I bought this having seen Mr. Lehmann designed it, but this isn't one of his better titles to be honest (an opinion only). I love Race for the Galaxy, but this simply isn't of the same pedigree.

A very clean and intelligent design, this game makes a lot of sense. It's a fairly dry experience with little interaction between players. There's a lot of downtime with larger player counts. The game really comes alive in the endgame which is fantastically tense, giving all players one last chance to take the crown. Even players who have not done so well throughout could get lucky (although unlikely).

RATING: 6
Progressive Yahtzee, that is how I would best describe To Court the King. As in Yahtzee you are trying to roll certain combinations with dice but the trick is that you start with 3 dice only while triggering the game end requires you to roll seven of a kind. So, you will be building a dice pool for yourself, and this is the fun part of the game because it gives you a feel of achievement and getting somewhere. Of course, you will be given other means to manipulate the result of your rolls as well. In principle the game is a race for seven of a kind but thankfully you do not need to be the first to roll it in order to win, although it will give you a slight advantage. This makes the end more interesting as players are given one more chance to claim the win, which makes the game feel less luck dependent. 

As I love rolling dice and I like Yahtzee, despite its apparent shallowness To Court the King appeals to my palate. This is not a great game but it is a fun one from the lighter end of the spectrum.

I like this game!  The powers provide for interesting choices re dice manipulation.  In addition, choosing when/in which order to use the powers is very important.  Easy to grasp, easy to play.  Some downtime, but not enough to trouble me.  May wish to avoid playing this with those prone to AP as that can lengthen the game by a bit.

I really liked this game when I started playing despite initial expectations of "It's just Yahtzee with silly powers" vibe. The powers are actually very tactical and interesting!

The problem comes halfway through when the stacks of powers everyone has accumulated can cause people to take ages to complete their turn manipulating things. It's a light game that should be quick, but the downtime can potentially drag. And the win condition is a lightning round of Yahtzee with all your accumulated powers. Eh. Still a dice game. Good for what it is, but just decent for me.

RATING: 5
lucky but fairly fun.  the downsides are the unclear cards, which are a factor for new players, and the downtime between turns.  unlike can't stop, other player's turns just aren't very interesting so i think it caps out at 3 players.  the turn order thing, presumably done to address early player advantage, is the only big kludge.

RATING: 7
Interesting enough, but it's too much like multiplayer solitaire.  There is a bit of interaction, taking cards before others can get them, but AP can really slow this one down.  I would rather play this than Yahtzee, but I would rather play Roll Through the Ages or Kingsburg than this one.

I don't mind rolling dice. Plus, the idea of getting special powers sounded way too cool to be true. Sadly, the fact is that this game can actually drag a very long time due to the fact that the choices you have can be way too much to handle. Not due to the fact that the choices are hard to grasp, mind you, but due to the fact that there are just too many of them. And in a game where you must maximize efficiency, this aspect can be a real downer.

A fun little filler game that will satisfy your need to throw dice around the table.  Each turn you will be attempting to create yahtzee like die results using the powers of special cards you collect (and you collect those cards by rolling those yahtzee die results).

Each turn ends up feeling like a little puzzle for you to solve.

Not a terribly deep game but charming none-the-less.

Very good dice management game from Tom Lehman, years before Troyes. It has a bit more interaction than roll through the ages, which it resembles dice-wise, since the players also compete directly to eachother for buying the cards before they run out. Very nice indeed!

Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling. The last turn is fun but the rest... The cards are too similar to each other - really it doesn't matter much if you get a 3 or 4 pips on a die, as you will probably re-roll it anyway. The result is that before the last turn most of the players have exactly the same chance of winning the game, and the last turn randomly decides who wins.

[i]Posted: 1/12/08, Rated: 7[/i]

How do you add more depth to a game like [i][gameid=2243]?[/i]  Change the rolling mechanism and add special roles.  Just to be safe, throw in a rotating starting player element, and you have plenty of Eurogame trappings.  The end result might not be kingly, but it is fit for a lesser noble.  Let's call it "baron-ly."

Reduced to its simplest form, [i]To Court the King[/i] uses dice values to approximate [i][gameid=1115][/i] hands, hence the near universal opinion that it is similar to [i][gameid=2243][/i].  When it's your turn, you roll the dice, and you must keep at least one of them.  Not all the dice of a single value, as in [i][gameid=15818][/i], but just one die.  Then, reroll the rest until you've either accomplished the goal you've set, or you haven't but you're out of "free dice" to roll.

In either event, you will receive a role placard, from a selection of 8,192 roles.  Okay, there really aren't that many roles from which to choose.  There are only twenty of them, and they are not created equally.  Some roles allow you to roll more dice, while others allow you to "shape" your results by changing the values of your last roll.  There is a small learning curve to finding the ones which are more worthwhile.  Here's a tip: the game might as well have been called [i]To Court the General[/i].  These roles are present in limited quantities: the ones you like might not be available when its finally your turn.  The rotating turn order does reward the last person with two consecutive turns, but sometimes that's a small consolation.  The first person to roll 7 of a kind can take the King card and the Queen card.  Doing so triggers the end game.

Like many games, [i]To Court the King[/i] is best taught while playing.  However, the numerous possible interactions of the roles can appear fidgety to new players, which is a turn-off.  Once they understand it, the game is fun and moves quickly.  It is a very social experience as you cheer for your opponents or even make suggestions about which roles they should take.  If someone told me about a fun, light, strategic dice game, I would have thought them a charlatan.  However, [i]To Court the King[/i] does have some noble qualities after all.

Is it light and full of luck? Most definitely, but that doesn't necessarily make for a bad game. This game is silly, but I have a lot of fun playing it and won't likely ever say no to a game of it.

Two playings with three.  It is a nice enhancement to that traditional dice game, however I think it adds too much complexity for most non-gamers and loses much accessibility.  Still, I think I'd rather play this for the same reasons.  At first glance the General seems quite overpowering, to the point where the game could have been called "To Court the General".

RATING: 7
If given the choice between dice or cards, I'll choose dice every time. In fact I actually kind of enjoy Yahtzee as a social game. However I was always concerned about this game because it sounded like the complexity of the powers would just get overwhelming and make it a slog instead of light fun. Boy was I surprised. The powers are fairly straightforward, and since you only take on one new role per turn you can slowly acclimate to each one. This game was surprisingly fast, and gave us several of those excited shouts when someone would luck into a big combo. It did feel like more of a race, as the player who captured the king had such a strong advantage in the final roll-off. However, knowing the potential is there for the person with the queen to fail multiple rolls, and someone sneaking up from behind with a surprise victory, is just enough to keep me excited right up to the final die roll. I think I might add this game back onto my wishlist. While not a great game, it is a good dice game that is short and has just enough decisions to keep me entertained.

Surprisingly enough, if you take Yahtzee, and make it a little more complicated, it actually becomes a little more fun.  What an odd game.  Definitely not a casual game; odd in the sense that it is aimed at serious gamers, yet like Yahtzee contains a heaping amount of luck.  It's fun, but you really need the right crowd for it.

Subsequent plays have revealed that, like Yahtzee, there really is a simple strategy to it ("go for the extra dice or the astronomer").  Some cards are just needlessly complex and hinder the game play and hinder the speed of play.

Two plays (4-p, 3-p).

Was a bit slow with 4, especially considering we were constantly looking at the reference cards...expect speed to improve with more plays. Also (as usual), screwed up a few rules - the final "King" round was totally wonk.

Second time around (3-p) was better - I had played it before, so was able to explain things better. The turn order marker handling caused some issues, but after a few plays, I can see it becoming second nature. Fun!

RATING: 9
Fun game, but hard to teach casual players, because they have to learn the cryptic pictographs (the player aids help but it's tiring to constantly check).  But the game has the highs and lows and the mix of luck and tactics that make for an entertaining experience.

With four players it's a little long, but I at least don't have any problem staying engaged while I wait for my turn. Three is best. Don't play with five.

Update: After having played Favour of the Pharaoh, its sequel, I have to say I like To Court The King more. It feels like a better progression, with highs and lows, while FotP is just kind of... there. You play for a while and then it's over. But I would say that most hobbyists would probably prefer the new version.

Update 2: My family has come up with a variant to combat perceived imbalance with the general. (I don't agree it's imbalanced, it's powerful but hard to acquire, but it's true that someone unable to get the general will feel like they may as well just quit against someone who does.) It works really, really well! Here it is:

[b]General[/b]: Same ability as the Queen. Allows you to bring in a single die, of any value.

[b]Queen[/b]: Same ability as the Farmer. Allows you to start your turn with an extra die.

[b]King[/b]: When you acquire the King, in addition to getting the Queen, you also acquire a Fool. Just like normal, if you already have a Fool and get a new one, instead your Fool becomes a Charlatan. (So, if you already have a Fool and get the King, you get two dice, one from the Queen and one from the Charlatan -- just like the General.)

For a dice game, it gave you some choice to build yourself up to be able to snag the King.  But, it also lacked any sort of excitement that I had come to expect from a dice game.

RATING: 3
Didn't enjoy this much, some characters seem much better than the others (the ones that give you more dice), then it's the rich get richer ... so it is a race to get those, and it's the other powers that seem more interesting. So either play to win or play to do cool manipulation with your dice. Theme is totally tacked on, game play is less than gripping, and downtime is a problem too which gets worse as you add players. Looks nice which lifts it from a '2' to a '3'.

RATING: 7.7
A neat little dice game.  

This game moves quickly and uses dice to build toward becoming the most powerful king.  It involves using various combinations or dice to get certain rolling abilities/powers. Example-Get this combination and you can have a card/character that will allow a reroll of one die to give you an edge for another harder to get combination, and so on.  

The game takes some skill in the sense only certain characters give certain skills/abilites/rerolls but it also involves just a touch of luck.  I like it for a quick filler, or to teach someone not used to gaming, or simply a warm up or cool down game.  

It is well produced for what it is.

The only game I bought of the crop of Essen 2006 so far; I made more than 10 games and I'm not tired of it yet. Nevertheless, I'm considering to apply the variant suggested here for the general (which is too strong) for the next games. With experienced players in fact, the game become much  more a race to get the general rather than the king...

Just don't like this one.  Not sure why, just don't.  Perhaps it's because anyone who has played before has a HUGE advantage over anyone else.

May 2011: upped from a 4 to a 6.  Much better experience this time around, although I suspect that's due to the company and the smaller # of players.   This game is certainly better with fewer.   Room for upward improvement in rating too, would play again.

Dice fest with style. Very good graphics, sturdy cards for a game that feels well balanced. Maybe games tend to be a little longer thant you'd expect and, of course, luck plays a major role. Good as a filler, in case you have 45 free minutes and 2-3 friends available.
As a personal note, girls like it a lot. Don't know why...

Good game, but come prepared!  Make cheat sheets for everyone to scratch off what's been taken and what the cards do.

Can feel "solved" after repeated plays; playing with veterans at a brisk tempo is still fun.

Update 12/03/08:  This game is just too long.  Either you're playing it for the first time, and people need to look up what they're going for constantly...or you're playing for the tenth time, and everyone's decisions feel scripted and is just waiting for their turn.

Pros: Surprisingly fun for a very simple game. Clever dice manipulation, and a lot of tension as you try to "shoot for the moon" with unlikely dice combos.

Cons: Really long for what it is (our first 2p game on BSW took over an hour); lots of downtime, esp. in 2p with each player taking two turns in a row; easy to get hit by some AP, especially when you don't know the cards and are reminding yourself of the abilities each time.

Overall: A solid 7. If it were shorter, I'd like it more. When I know the cards better, I'll also like it better. BSW seems the way to go -- rolling dice physically would be rough.

I thought I'd really like this one, but it just didn't work for me.  It seems way too easy to obtain cards, and doesn't have the push your luck element that I like to see in dice games.  It seemed like it was just roll the dice, and take whichever card matches what you roll.  The manipulation of dice using the cards you've obtained was somewhat neat, but was almost more tedious than anything.  I'd rather just play Pickimino, or even Yahtzee for that matter.

RATING: 6
This is a decent push-your-luck dice game with an interesting twist provided by draftable characters who can be used to modify dice rolls or add extra dice to one's pool.  However, choosing which character to draft each turn is fairly obvious and stringing together the various character abilities can feel akin to playing with a mental abacus.  In addition, player interaction is limited to drafting a character before someone else does.  Fortunately, this game does not overstay its welcome and ends within a reasonable time frame.  Despite the tacked-on theme, I like the imitation Old Master art.  At the end of the day, not a bad game, but not much to get excited about either.

I had just picked up King of Tokyo as my personal "Yahtzee style" game for my collection, only to sit down and play To Court the King. This took me by surpise... it's tons of dice rolling, but the recruitment of characters and ability to add and tweak dice created a very fun game.

I like this much better than, say, Roll Through the Ages. I'd play this again in a heartbeat. Whether or not it ends up being the better game than King of Tokyo, we shall see.

Update; after playing this online a couple of times, it's OK, but I think there's better Yahtzee-style games out there. The endgame bugs me, with the final "roll off" to see who's got the biggest and longest die set.

I enjoyed this a lot. It is random though. It takes a little to long for it to come back to your turn. Also, I have 20/20 vision and still had to get very close to the cards to read the cost to take the card. The dice diagrams are ludicrously small and for no reason.

Outstanding dice game.  I really enjoy the planning of which power cards to use in which order to get the desired result.  Yes, it's probably true that the outcome is mostly luck, because the planning isn't all that difficult and because it's awfully hard to *observe* the difference between an optimal plan that has a 70% chance of success and a sub-optimal plan that has a 68% chance of success.  But I enjoy the planning, and the drama as the game progresses, enough that that the luck doesn't bother me in the slightest.

I am no fan of Yahtzee but one couple in our group loves it.  I was hoping this would be a good compromise and it has worked well!  I enjoy the added strategy of figuring out how best to manipulate the dice while they still get to roll a handful of them.  Sounds like when we "figure out" the best contingency of courtiers, it may turn into a race game.  But since this will be an occasional filler, I think it will have more longevity with our group.

RATING: 3
Yep, Yahtzee with special power cards but not nearly as interesting as it sounds on paper.  The main problem is that the interactions between the cards and dice (and therefore the possible strategies) are too complex for what is basically a dice-chuckin' game and it's exacerbated by tiny iconography that is at first blush quite cryptic.  It's still far better than most current Euros and there's the seed of an interesting game concepts, but ultimately there just isn't enough interesting material or substance here to warrant learning how it all works together to get at what little deeper game there is.  The real nail in the coffin is that the game is terminally boring- most of the game you'll sit and watch someone roll dice and then proceed to do computational somersaults while they try to figure out how to use their cards to get the die roll for what they want.  Someone really needs to phone the Euro designers and tell them that having one less of a card than there are players and causing them to compete to get them first is NOT player interaction- the highlight of interaction in this game amounts to getting the last Bauer before the other guy.  Big frackin' deal.  I'd be willing to give it another go, but as it stands it's just another passenger on the sinking ship of the Euro games boat.

I love rolling dice! That said even though this involves lots of luck a lot of it is quite controllable depending on how you choose your cards. There can be a some downtime while you are waiting for people to figure out how they want to proceed with their rolling. Also, it is pretty much a solitaire exercise as there is little you can do to influence the other players except to take characters that they may need.

RATING: 7
This is Zilch crossed with Yahtzee plus special abilities. I really enjoyed my first game and would like to play it again to see if my enjoyment will stick. I need to assess whethter my reservations about being slightly too long for a filler or about the end game not living up to the main play are well founded. If they are my rating will drop. Otherwise this may become another favourite game. The components and art (apart from a time warped hunter) are top notch. The potential to develop well matched combinations of cards is very good and would give strong replayability but the level of luck in the end game is a bit out of proportion to the planning that goes into reaching the end game.
Second game. Both resulted in me taking the king and getting beaten by one player-Kevin. 

2 more games and I am yet to see the player with the King win.

5th game - King finally won. This game is tooo long for what it is with 5. Down time makes it probably best with around 3.

Another Gathering hit that I thought was just ok. It's essentially Pickomino on steroids. Instead of trying to simply get available numbers (Pickomino), you try to get available cards. Cards have prereqs like "all odd", "sum to 30 ", "full house", etc. The cards also bestow special abilities that can be used in addition to the standard rerolls. Some abilities let you modify the rolls in some way, some actually give you more dice (many with specific come-out values). Personally, I find Pickomino already stretching the limits for downtime between turns of a dice rolling game. This easily triples it, but with admittedly more interesting turns. But given that the abilities are indicated by such small icons, you really can't follow along with what someone else is doing without being intimately familiar with all the characters at a glance. And not following along makes the downtime that much more non-interesting. May be best as a two-player (guessing--haven't actually tried).

You have to play this with smaller groups.  Three seems right.  Too large of a group causes too much down-time.  One of the cards seems broken too (General).  Getting two extra dice is a big advantage in this game.  We house rule that a General card is available for every player.  

But, my interest in this one is completely lost since it seems like characters for more dice is almost always better than characters that change dice.  

My sons still like it, so it'll hang around until they let me get rid of it. I traded it away once when we purchased Kingsburg.  However, the kids missed it too much so I reacquired it for Christmas 2009,

May 2010 - Home variant makes this game a lot more fun.  Place as many Generals available as their are players.

"Los dados activos son los que acabas de tirar y a√∫n no has apartado. Por eso cuando a√±ades un dado con un n√∫mero por ejemplo con el Ovispo Obispo que a√±ade un 6, lo a√±ades a los dados activos y puedes apartarlo (con lo que deja de estar activo) o si no, c√≥mo a√∫n no lo has apartado, lo vuelves a tirar o lo modificas con cualquiera de las otras cartas. El concepto es importante, porque las cartas s√≥lo afectan a los dados activos. Una vez apartado un dado ya no puedes modificarlo de ninguna forma.

El buf√≥n lo que te permite es volver a tirar uno de tus dados activos. Es decir, si el resultado no te gusta, te permite coger un dado activo y volverlo a tirar. Por tanto, no te d√° un dado m√°s. De hecho en la mayor√≠a de mis partidas nunca lo cojo. La √∫nica forma de que te de un dado m√°s es convertirlo en Charlat√°n y para eso lo tienes que hacer m√°s en no una tirada, sino en dos. Es raro que en la primera tirada no puedas coger algo mejor que el buf√≥n, pero est√° ah√≠ por si acaso.

Las √∫nicas cart√°s que te permiten tirar m√°s dados son el Granjero (Baumeister) o el Cabellero (Ritter). Luego est√° el Charlat√°n, que como ya os digo normalmente es raro cogerlo. Luego est√°n las cartas que a√±aden un dado con una puntuaci√≥n determinada al n√∫mero de dados activos (ahora s√≥lo recuerdo el Obispo y la Reina pero hay una para cada cara del dado). A prop√≥sito, en BSW te permite utilizar est√°s cartas para aumentar el n√∫mero de dados de la primera tirada pero Tom Lehmann (el autor del juego) ya aclar√≥ en un hilo de la BGG que esto no es posible, los dados activos se a√±aden a una tirada ya existente." keroak

First play was a mixed bag.  Part of me really enjoyed the special abilities of the characters which allow you to modify the dice rolls and the number of dice rolled.  However, I found that the end the game really came down to whether you had the ability to roll enough dice to have even a CHANCE to win the game.  Don't like that aspect of this game.  It doesn't seem fair that there may be some players who don't even get a chance to finish the game.

RATING: 7.5
The best way I can describe this is as a "ladder dice game."  Players start with just 3 dice, but by rolling Yahtzee-like sets, they can acquire cards allowing them to add and manipulate dice in future turns.  The ultimate goal is to have 7 dice in play, all with the same value.  This triggers a final round where everyone tries to make the best roll possible.

While this takes a little bit of explanation in teaching, once play begins it's surprising how easily everyone catches on.  Yes, lots of luck is involved, but clever planning is a major factor in doing well.  And while the theme is thin, the cards are sturdy, richly illustrated, and the dice even looks nice.  All of which is wrapped up in a size-appropriate box!

I quite enjoyed this, and am confident we'll play it on a semi-regular basis.  A minor quibble is that the number of players can really increase the length of the game, so this may be ideal with 2 or 3 players for what it is.  Will it get repetitive and dull with time?  That remains to be seen.

Neat concept, but seems imbalanced - cards which give extra dice (particularly "bring a [#] into play" rather than extras from the get-go) seem to dominate (practically, not mathematically) over cards which let you manipulate dice. (Except for the Astronomer, perhaps.) The strategy seems to consist of "try and accumulate as many dice as possible, grabbing manipulation cards when you can't manage anything better", which is much less interesting than it could have been. 

I've tried a variant which slows down dice-adders (anything providing a die can't be used the first turn you have it), and that made for a slightly more varied / interesting game.

Oh, and if you're not OK spending 5+ minutes after each turn watching other people roll dice, avoid larger games - they drag. If you're explicitly looking for a game where players can run off to chat / accomplish some small task while it's not their turn, though, this is perfect for you. Not so much my thing, though.

It's a Kingsburg lite. You roll a handfull number of dice, and the result is used to buy character card, which can be used to manipulate the dice. Your target is to get the king. The rolling and manipulating dice mechanism is quite original in my thought.

RATING: 10
A fun and well thought out game that eases you into the characters' abilities one card at a time. This makes the game easy to explain and play can begin almost immediately. There is no reason to go through every card with a new player since only a handful of cards are available at a given time. In addition, the summary cards provide an excellent reference.

It's fun to progress by attempting to win better characters that you'll ultimately use in the final round. Since the end game allows all players to challenge each other using all of their characters, this makes the final round exciting and brings it all together into a satisfying conclusion.

A clever Yahtzee style game that reduces the luck slightly and adds a bit of strategy.  There are some faults (General is way overpowered - especially 2 player) but overall, this is a fun, quick game.  Great for dice lovers.

It is a sort of push your luck game combined with a build a production machine sort of game.  It's pretty unique and plays fairly quickly.  I wouldn't want to play it with more than two players though, as there isn't much to do on your opponents turns.

I actually don't know if I prefer Yahtzee or this one.  
If I want a good game with dice that lasts 1+ hours, I'll take Can't Stop any time.
Player interaction is almost non-existant (Can't Stop is definitely more interactive). To sum up, I'd say that this game is 75% luck, 20% tactics, and 5% strategy.
(Played 1 time in 5, game took 2 hours. I may want to try it again in 3, maybe.)

Let this game reach 300 votes, and I bet the rating will go down into the 5.7 - 5.9 range.

I would like to get this to the table more often, but I have difficulty explaining this to new players.  I always have to refresh my own recollection as to what the abilities on the cards are, and it is difficult to see all the ways to combo things without seeing it in play first.  I don't have enough data to really determine anything, but some of the cards (that give extra dice) just feel like they are more powerful and helpful to winning.

Yahtzee: The Gathering.  Light and fun but not earthshattering.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This dice-rolling game is likely a decent gateway game for people who enjoy games such as Yahtzee.

Though this is a pretty light game, it has several "gamer's game" concepts. Basically, you try to put together a dice engine to get more and more dice and higher and higher rolls. It's a short mental leap to the idea of getting more workers in a worker placement game, or more and better production buildings in an economic engine game, or influencing higher roles in a role selection game.

All in all, this quick and easy game has its place and doesn't overstay its welcome. Good for an occasional or filler play.

Rating based on one play only.
A curious little mix of dice-rolling luck-fest with power-up skill selection. Though to be honest, you don't often get a choice of skill given you'll just take the best your dice roll allows. Deciding what dice to keep though holds some interest since this will often be a choice between shooting for what you want and maximising opportunities to get anything.
But in the end, still just a "stupid dice rolling game". Despite having a weaker set of cards & fewer dice, I won my first game purely because I got very lucky on the final roll-off.

RATING: 4
I love the art on the cards and I love the concept of the game.  My problem is that the game feels like it should be a light game because you're rolling dice, only it is obviously designed for gamers.  There are a lot of options which would overwhelm a non-gamer.  Because of these options, there is too much down time in between turns with anything more than 3 players.  I personally think the game works best with 2 players.  The turn order rule is also very annoying because it jolts the flow of the game.  If the power of going first needs to be mitigated then a better way should be found.  For instance, each player could start with a different card based upon their turn order.

Anyhow, this is a pretty cool idea but I think the execution of it needed a little more time.  The symbols on the cards to represent what the card does are also too small and obscure.  The artist was being asthetic but not thinking about aiding the game play.

Anyhow, after all this trash talking, I still think the game will be enjoyable to many people on the BGG so take these comments with a grain of salt (except the part about not playing it with a large group).  I am also had a great time with the game designer playing werewolf on the last night of the Gathering.  I convinced myself that the werewolf had to be Bill Cleary and Tom played me like a fiddle.  Arrrggggghhhhh!!!!

RATING: 5
Man, this should be cool.  But you so totally have to power through collecting extra dice as fast as you can so you don't get a chance to use the cool powers on some of the guys.  So that makes it extra luck based.  It would be cooler if everybody had two powers maybe.  Where one is a die producer and one is a manipulation power.  Or maybe nobody produces dice but everyone has powers.  And you can tap two of anybody to produce a die.  Extra dice aren't cool.  Crazy power combos are cool.

I played To Court the King once at a Coolstuff game night. It seemed interesting enough for an exercise in rolling dice well and occassionally having to make a decision. Unfortunately, that is not the sort of game I am really interested in, so I have not bothered to ever play it again. Besides, Kingsburg does this type of game MUCH better, and I am not really all that fond of Kingsburg.

RATING: 7
Players are advancing in influence in a royal court.  Players roll dice, trying to hit certain combinations, allowing them to claim a character that enhances their die rolling abilities.  On a turn players roll their dice, and must freeze at least one to keep rolling.  At the end of the turn, all dice are assessed to see in an advance can be purchased (two pair gets the astronomer, for example).  Advances are divided into three broad areas - extra dice to begin the turn with, extra dice that can be bought in during a turn, and the  ability to manipulate the values on dice.  The game ends when somebody has claimed the king, with the winner being the best final die roll result (usually 8 or 9 of a kind).  Fantastic die rolling game, great with two players, decays rapidly with more and more players (bogs down).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting variation of Yatzee with perhaps a more dynamic ending (instead of totaling the points, you see you can roll the larger X of a kind). The powers of the different roles take some use to see what combination works best but i can see some different strategies emerging from repeated play.
Of course, if dice hate you, stay away... it *is* a dice game.

Euro-Yahtzee.  I despise Yahtzee, but I'll play this.  It's nice and fast, and it accelerates towards the end as you accumulate more and more character powers, but is nearly a solitaire game.

If you don't like dice rolling games, and love card games, then check out Dominion which is basically "To Court The King, The Card Game."

Good enough that I went out and bought a copy after playing it. We call it EuroSnoot Yatzee when we play and so far everyone I've played this great little dice with game has enjoyed the hell out of it.

The only real flaws in this sweet and fast little game are the color choices on the cards. Each card has visual aids that depict what benefit it gives the owner and the colors are so muted similar in hue that it's difficult to glance quickly and determine their benefit. It's a minor issue though as you learn the cards, but it's a bit clunky for newer players.

In my view this game definitely bridges the gap between us Game Geeks and those who are willing to play a game every so often.

I have never once played Yahtzee and said to myself, "you know, this game would be perfect if only it had a whole bunch of convoluted rules and took much, much longer."  I've only played with five - it took too long to be throwaway filler, everybody spent most of their time studying their cheatsheets, and it appeared to have a runaway leader problem.  Honestly, I'd rather just play regular Yahtzee.

Ugh. Blech. This was way too convoluted for its own good. The number of modifiers to your dice grows dramatically as the game goes on, so there's lots of AP figuring out how to best use them all, but these aren't very interesting decisions, just intricate. In the end, it's Yahtzee on 'roids.  Learning all the different nobles' powers is too much of an investment for what this game offers.

A dice roller and fun with it. Lots of characters build up your actions during the game. Only drawback, the graphics are tiny and the player aid takes some working through.

RATING: 6
Although the game is rate for up to 5 players, I wouldn't recommend it for more than 3.  There is no interaction between the players other than rushing for the good characters which really are the ones who add dice.  Not pointless but precious little in terms of challenge.

[floatright][size=5]2014-06-18[/size][/floatright]To Court the King is a fast dice game for 2 to 5 players.

[u]What is this?[/u]
Players roll dice trying to match the cards' requirements (for example: [i]n[/i] of a kind, [i]n[/i] pairs, a total of [i]n[/i] or more pips, straights) in order to acquire them. Cards give more dice or powers that let you manipulate your rolls' results (change a die's value, shift pips among dice), giving you more control on your rolls. The goal is to acquire the King (for which you'll need seven of a kind) and then to roll the best [i]n[/i] of a kind in the final round.

[u]Strategy and comments[/u]
It takes a few slower games to learn how to best use the cards' powers, then the play becomes smoother and the game plays quite fast.
Generally, I don't like much luck-heavy games, but there are a couple of interesting concepts here: while at the beginning extra dice is king, after a certain threshold manipulators become more important. There are very powerful combos (I won a few games thanks to Lord+Lady or Wizard+Alchemist, for example) and a couple of agonising dilemmas (what is it better to take now, General or King?).
The variable player order (ABCD-DABC-CDAB-BCDA) helps balancing the game, but slightly increases the downtime.

Worth trying. The card art is brilliant, the portraits really look like paintings.

Whilst i like dice games, they all suffer from the same problem;  if you roll bad at the start you generally lose the game.  the choice elements in the card get rid of this a little, but anyone that has a bad game tends to go off it and wont play you again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Smart, but there's not a ton of meat. In my experience the biggest problem with TCTK is that you're only really making decisions if you're losing. Rushing dice and one manipulator and then making a play for the king seems to win games as consistently as is possible. When you're behind you get to decide "Which weak manipulators should I take?" In the end, it's good for a faaaast dice game.

RATING: 5
Yahtzee on Steroids is quite a fitting description. The level of control that you have over your dice is extraordinarily high in this game. That control has a price, however, and that is a lot of different card powers (which bogs down the game at the beginning) and a fairly solitary dice puzzle when the players actually get to use those powers (which bogs down the game towards the end). Both of these should get better as players become more acquainted with the game but then there is the realization that it's a lot of rules chrome for not that much more gain than any other "regular" Yahtzee variant.

Different-colored dice for the "brought-in" dice is very helpful. 

After 2 plays: Even though this is a lighter game, we spent a fair amount of time looking over the card choices. Same thing would happen if you just play this once in a while. The first game took a long time because of this (we enjoyed it, though). Things went much quicker with the second game (less than 30 minutes). 4th game & beyond all lasted less than 20 minutes each - almost too quick.

A nice aspect of the 2-player game is that we can use the player aid that comes with the game: I think it is very well done and we each use two of them with the two different sides up (so it looks like one larger guide of the costs & abilities). The print is a little small but I can still read it. We marked the Charlatan, Farmer, & General on the aids to quickly identify that these are the only ones that give you extra die/dice for your first roll.

A fun game - have only played 2-player with one adult & one teenager. Generally, we like dice & luck so this is fun for us! A very quick filler once players know the cards.

Acquired 6-16-2007

May 2009 -- This is not a game that is very popular with all the family; only two of us really like it, so we rarely play it.

October 2011 -- This game has been played a few more times. Several of us really enjoy it. The long down-time between player turns (with nothing to do) is a significant detraction, especially with 6 or 7 players, and that keeps it from being played often. It took us several plays to really understand how to use the character cards, but now that we have a better handle on it, the play is a little faster.

Groovy dice game which felt a little bit like Knights, which I also like.  I think 4 is the max for either of those games.  I am not too big a fan of pure dice games but this one has enough to keep it interesting.  Some of the portraits on the cards look like photographs of real people so I am wondering if these are the graphics designer's friends.  Not sure how this would hold up to repeated playing, but I did enjoy it far more than Pickomino.

RATING: 8
Do you kind-a sort-a like the basic idea of Yahtzee, but wish it could be a more thoughtful, strategic game?  Then look no further, dear sir or madam, because To Court the King is the game for you!  It's Yahtzee with a production engine attached.  It's also the best game of its genre.

Rolling desirable combinations allows you to gain tiles that give you special advantages: rolling more dice, manipulating the numbers on the dice, producing an extra die with a certain number showing, etc.  These are your Power Grid plants, your Puerto Rico buildings, your Goa advancements.  Your eventual goal is to roll as many of one number as possible, acquiring the king tile.  The other players will have one chance to steal the king tile by beating your roll.  You'll get one final chance to beat anyone who stole the king, and then the game ends with the win going to the player controlling the king.

The basic rolling method is one we've seen before in games like Pickomino and Easy Come Easy Go.  You must "lock" at least one die every time you roll, and are then free to reroll any dice that have not yet been locked.  The system works well, but Pickomino and Easy Come Easy Go were simple games that almost played themselves.  To Court the King is still pretty light, but it's also subtle in a way that these other games are not.  Subtle enough that non-gamers may struggle managing the basic strategies.  But it's a great light game for gamers.

For best results play with 2 or 3 players.

One play with four and one with five. A nice, thinky dice game, but decisions become quite complicated once players have a lot of cards in their tableau, and so there can be an aggravating amount of downtime. At times it almost feels like a solitaire puzzle game, which is not my favorite sort of thing. Still, though, it's not terrible. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I like it a bit more than I thought I would. We play with two or three so downtime isn't a big problem (and we're a chatty group that helps each other identify options each move). It does lack the urgency of many dice games in that you are likely choosing between greater or lesser degress of success on your turn ... it is difficult to "blow up" while going for broke, unless you fall just short of the one or two cards in the game that seem substantially more valuable than the rest. I'd like the game more if it had a little bit of personality -- maybe if this was the court of King Arthur, with recognizable personalities, instead of generic royal offices. I like the thick cards. Speaking in it's favor is that the game doesn't overstay it's welcome, making it good for lunch time.

I like rolling dice.  I have no problem with Clash of the Gladiators, but I did not feel much thrill from the start.  There are no 'cool moves', just accumulation of dice and modifiers.  The final player in the final roll had a 50-50 chance of winning.  I was glad it was over.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Two plays so far, both painfully long and already feeling repetitive by the end.

The biggest problem is that there are lots of tactics that are obvious once you know the game, but not everybody notices them right away. They're also hard to explain. So experienced players either sit there and watch other people fail, or end up explaining to them what they should be doing. This has the worst alpha player problem I've ever seen in, and it's a NON-cooperative game. Not playing again if I can help it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very similar to Knatsch (Knights) by Michael Schacht - except that in his game can you go after the leader. The game suffers from not-so-great-as-we-are-used-to components and tiny text on the player aids which makes them almost useless. Okay dice game - but I prefer Schacht's version where you can actually see what the cards are doing from across the table.

Played mostly with 2 but occasionaly wth 3.  Significant downtime late in the game.  Only path we ever saw to winning was to pick up the cards that gave more dice.  Some cards were must-haves (over-powered?).  It doesn't help that dice games are not my first choice to begin with.   Played approximately 10 times before selling it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A great light game.  It's like Yahtzee with magical powers, but that description really doesn't do it justice.  There's an interesting puzzle aspect to the game that isn't immediately visible--an experienced player playing with newbies will simply slaughter them unless tips flow freely.  The biggest fault is that there is a strong runaway leader aspect despite being quite random, and the more unlucky rolls you get at the beginning, the more unlucky rolls you'll get for the rest of the game.

There is nothing like throwing a fist full o'dice. If Yahtzee were designed as a Euro game, this is what it'd be.

-Nice components.

RATING: 8
'deck'-building Yahtzee? It sounds crazy, but it's actually quite a bit of fun. Very interactive, with the limited number of each card available. The only (slight) issue I have is the amount of randomness that can happen in the endgame - our last play, I won by sheer blind luck - the game owner *should* have won with the cards he had gained, but his dice roll turned out incredibly unfortunate.

Bummer! I was really rushing through our stores to get one of the first boxes. I DO like the idea of Magic meets Yatzee (or Kniffel, or W√ºrfelpoker).
Yesterday friends came along with it - material is great! - and now I have to say: it sounds better then it plays.
It didn't bother me that for the first game(s) it takes a while to get familiar with cost & action of each character card... but within the game, the dice-game feeling gets more and more lost into pure dice manipulation - and that is not that much fund to play, even less to watch.
Cards allow to add dice, some to add points to dice, other allow rerolls, other allow to change the result of a die, and so on.
And so beginning with early mid game, dice rolling becomes dice turning.

I like this game and will actually suggest that we play it (despite the dice rolling).  A light yahtzee-like game.  The rules are badly arranged (in my first play, we played that you could have more than one character of the same type, which is wrong).  Some characters are fantastic: +2 to any dice, +1 to any dice --> what a great combination!  (Turns any 3 into a 4, 5, or 6 automatically.)

In the end, it's important to have a lot of dice; even if you have the tie-breaking advantage of the Queen, you still can lose if someone else has more dice than you.

While an interesting twist on Yahtzee, I didn't feel that the decisions in this game were interesting enough for the amount of time that this game took.

Marking as 'Previously Owned' as we only played this in many sessions during one day and now have better alternatives like Roll Through the Ages.  Below comments still apply.

We don't actually 'own' this game, but play with a modified rule set.  Basically, we ignore the card limits and go for all-out dice rolling.  On one hand, the game may be too open and luck-based, basically just choosing whatever is the highest bonus to you.  We didn't like the thought of being limited in our choices though.

Playing the way we do, this is a very fun dice game.  It has a lot of luck, but if you're not doing so hot on dice, pick up some altering rolls so you can get some bonuses to your rolls.  On a hot streak?  Go for massive dice and try to brute force your way to a win.  It has a lot of subtle strategy that I enjoy (despite frequently losing!).

As far as short dice games go, this is the cream of the crop.

It moves pretty quickly, there are meaningful decisions, while still not playing exactly the same way all the time. My favorite part is the competition for the 'good' extra die in the middle of the game. Should you go for the extra 4 or the extra 5, when I know that the other one will be all gone by my next turn?

A bit random (of course) but it still was entertaining enough to play a couple times in one night.  As long as you realize you are playing a cracked out version of Yahtzee and not trying to plan for stuff, you should have plenty of fun.

Rather strange to see a Yahtzee variant given the German games treatment. Plenty of complex decisions to make in deciding which combination of rolls to aim for, but ultimately this is a luck based game as one player can get slightly ahead by a good roll and is then difficult to catch as the effect of the cards is cumulative.

loved it when I played 1st or second hated it when I played last and started with bad dice rolls, Its VERY hard to come back from behind as you can never aford to buy the only cards that are available. I do enjoy playing this game - it is luck orientated but as soon as you accept that the game becomes fun.

First played December 27, 2007. Taught in <10min, played in about 45min for 3 players. There is some strategy in this game, however it's mostly the roll of the dice. The object to roll the highest set of numbers after the king is captured. The king is captured when seven of a kind are rolled with the dice. You start out with three dice and roll to collect a character in your adventure. Each time you will get a character, however the better you roll (more sets, runs, or number of pix) the better the character you will recieve in return. Each character has a special ability ranging from reroll a single dice again (Jester) to additional dice, to changing the pix on a/some dice, to making a dice whatever you want it to be. Cards are limited except the Jester. Jester also gets converted on the 2nd Jester roll. King and Queen are singletons. The rest of double in a three player game. I'd strongly recommend giving this a gameplay if you know someone who has it and give consideration in purchase and placement in your rotation of games played on a regular basis if you like it.

Ah, my gaming sweetspot: quick, strategic with low to moderate luck, pretty, and plays as well with two as it does with five.  To Court the King is basically Yahtzee with skill.  You have some pretty important decisions to make turn to turn as you progress up the skill tree and have to adapt your tactics to the dice roll to roll.  I would highly reccommend playing with the General variant by Brian Bankler as it reduces that specific potentially overpowered character card (lsited in the variants section).  I rate this one a ten as there is virtually no reason I can think of to ever turn it down if requested.  Love it.

This game works because it's the right length.  It's a fun little dice-a-thon, with a tiny bit of strategy and light puzzle solving.  If it were longer, I'd have to pass, because there's not really enough game there to justify it.

I'm not sure that the middle tier cards are really worth going after though.  Maybe if you're in an arms race with someone else, and you know that you're going to need more than 7 dice to win.  I like to grab a few extra dice, two manipulators, and then make a stab at the Feldherr (6 of a kind to get, give you +2 dice).  At that point, it's reasonable to get a good 7 or 8 of a kind for the king.

Fun stuff.  My wife likes it.  The couple of gamer friends I've shown it to like it.  For the price, I've certainly done a lot worse.

RATING: 4
Somewhat boring, more than a bit repetitive dice game. Players roll dice, yatzy-style, use the die results to buy personality cards. In future turns, the cards then allow the player to modify his dice roll, add to the number of dice being rolled, etc. Finally, a player has enough dice to be able to buy the king, which triggers the final victory round.

The production is horrible, with card costs and effects being shown using minuscule iconography.

UKuK is long and complex for what it is, and the fantasy theme is completely superfluous, but it is reasonably fun for a game (or two).

Initial Rating: 6.0 (May 2017)

Due to its designer (Thomas Lehmann), I was very keen to play To Court the King. I love Race for the Galaxy and I wanted to see more of his work. After playing the game I can say it is fun to play, but it is rather light, so it isn‚Äôt for us.

The rules are very easy to explain, you can do it under 8 minutes. Playtime is around 60 minutes.

The art is ok, nothing too exciting.

To Court the King has a good theme, but you don‚Äôt feel it through the game.

Best with 3 fast players. It also plays very well with 2 players. I don‚Äôt want to play it with 5 players as the downtime is too much for such a simple game. Once players are familiar with the characters, it will flow a lot faster.

The game¬¥s decisions aren‚Äôt very complex (which dice to re roll, which power to use, which character to get) and the luck factor is high but, sometimes, it can be controlled.

Bottom line, To Court the King is an ok game to play from time to time. The rules are easy to teach so it is a good game for the family or for non-gamers, it plays fast but it is too light for us. I won‚Äôt buy it (nor its re implementation Favor of the Pharaoh). I will play it again to see if the games improves for me.

RATING: 6
A fun twist on Yahtzee, but feels very solitairish, and not in a good way.  Bogs down in the middle and late game, when there are too many player powers and nearly every roll can be finessed into something useful by manipulating the dice.  So I guess in a sense I'm faulting a dice game for not being random enough; I think my real criticism is that it's not random enough at the end for trailing players to overcome the disadvantages the randomness at the beginning imposes on them.

Update 10/2010:  Flows very well with 2.  Still not much to it, but I'm glad I played again.  Once every 12-18 months seems about right for this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
One 5p game only.

Dice game using Yahtzee-like mechanics to collect cards that (in one way or another) improve your 'hand' of dice (more dice, ability to tweak the results rolled) with a final roll off to determine the winner.

Card art is nice (albeit irrelevant), although the icons on the cards that indicate their powers could do with being a lot larger and easier to interpret. 

The key mechanic for me is that once you've rolled your dice, you're only allowed to keep one of them - you have to re-roll the rest, of which you keep one and re-roll the rest, and so on. This has two effects:
 ~ If you roll really great dice in one roll, tough - you can only keep one and have to can the rest.
 ~ Because of the amount of rolling and re-rolling, once the player's hands of dice grow turns can really drag as players re-evaluate their options after each roll (the small and cryptic card icons don't help here, albeit familiarity would ease this).

The first's not an issue once you acclimatise, but the latter killed it for me. With a 5 player game it seemed to take an age for my turn to come around, not something I want in an (allegedly) quick dice filler, especially one that's essentially a 5 player solo game in which you have nothing to do on your opponents' turns.

In a crowded field I think there are similar, better games such as Airships, Roll through the Ages, Ra Dice, Risk Express, and maybe even Yahtzee itself that quicken turns through less re-rolling and/or have player interaction. I'd maybe play this one again, but not with more than 3 players.

Light?  Yes.  Derivative of Yahtzee?  Sure.  But this one will be a great filler game, or a game for older kids (9-12).  The only reason for the 6 is because I will not want to play it all the time, just when there's no time or energy for a meatier game.

RATING: 6
dice game with a few too many rules for what it is
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's a nice medium filler and, even though it's a dice game, has a surprising amount of strategy because of the special powers of the characters.  In fact, the only thing that threw me off a bit was the fact that the start player rotates counter clockwise, so the person who played last in a round, starts the next... effectively giving him 2 turns in a row.

Word of warning though... don't fall behind in the number of dice you get to activate or you'll never have a chance at winning... sometimes a quick push for seven-of-a-kind will win it if everyone else can only roll 6 dice.  So much so that many players feel that 'The General' (who provides two extra dice) is slightly broken.

More fun than I expected, even with 2 players... a definite '8.'

Takes a game like Yahtzee and adds to it a whole layer of strategy and decision making by allowing combos to manipulate the dice results. The theme is certainly pasted (it could probably be re-themed to almost anything) but the gorgeous artwork really creates a nice atmosphere, and I personally like the premise of trying to gain the support of the king for some cause by first convincing lesser members of the court. I think it fits with reality and the creative manipulation of rolls could very well represent your efforts trying to convince others to support your cause.

Still, the gameplay can become quite abstract since there can be a lot of numerical and logical calculations to decide how to best use the dice you roll, and therefore turns can drag a bit, but anyway, players will still be expectant to see if you can finally make a good roll to claim a character card and which card are you going to take, since that can change their possibilities and strategies.

Overall a good mix of strategy, risk-taking and luck, all wrapped up in a interesting theme and high production values.

This game is fabulous.  The dice combinations and realizing the potential of your cards each turn is very exciting.  The game also comes down to one exciting showdown at the end as each player tries to get the best of-a-kind roll.  The only 2 drawbacks to the game are: 1, it can be hard for first or even second time players to realy grasp the game.  Usually you have to play several times before everyone is on the same playing field.  2, there often is someone who can't even compete in the final showdown because they have no chance to win.  You could essentially think of this as player elimination which I don't like.

Fun die game, not a lot of thinking but some cute optimizations need to be performed. It plays faster than I anticipated, which is good because you don't want a light game taking too much time. I could see my rating improve if it continues to be fun and not boring.

Only online play at Yucata.de - While online play might be the perfect way to play this, I learned that I don't care about this game. Throw some dice, hopefully buy one of the cards giving extra dice, otherwise buy something else, repeat and lose or win. Just to stay with the Yucata dice games: I rather play Roll through the Ages, Zooloretto Dice Game or Can't Stop anytime instead. Nonetheless, I will give it a few more tries as it's so easy to play this mindlessly.

The more I think about this game, the more I really like it.  The "Yahtzee on steroids" description is pretty accurate, IMO, and I think there is still a lot of strategy involved, what to take when, what combos to keep, and when to end the game.  Add a reasonable playing time, and this is a lot of fun.

Three seems like the optimal number of players here, though 2 might be good.  Downtime would be a factor when playing with 4 or 5.  Once you become familiar with the cards, this is a surprisingly engaging game.  I think that as I play it more the game will grow in enjoyment.  I generally enjoy dice games, which are almost always push your luck type games.  Here there is a definite potential for strategic planning regarding the cards a player pursues.  At the same time it seems like a player could also fall into a rut of shooting for the same cards over and over again, but I guess that could happen with any game.  I'll be curious to see how my relationship with this game develops.  For now, it's a pleasant surprise!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
The mere fact that I would like to play again to try some different strategies is what keeps this game from being a 4 or a 5. I've played this game twice now and it just has too much downtime for me.  Even worse is that the almost solitaire play seems to encourage people to wander away or lose focus.

It also seems like at the beginning of the hand you need to decide if a) you're just going to go for pairs or b) go for a straight.  If middle of the way through you don't get what you need through bad luck, you have to do damage control.


Maybe it would be better with just three players, hard to tell.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A Yahtzee-style dice game, but with variable card powers. As with most of these games, downtime was horrible, since everyone just watches while one player takes their turn. And with the addition of special powers, this took even longer. Our 5-player game took nearly 2 hours with rules explanation. Waaaaay too long for a dice game.

The roles were an interesting mechanic, but ultimately, it felt like everyone was merely taking the same path. There wasn't enough variability in the roles to make it interesting. And the random dice rolling would ultimately undermine your powers anyway. The artwork was fantastic though.

A somewhat finer edition of Yahtzee. Theme is thin and the downtime huge, the latter being a clear minus in comparison with Yahtzee. Players should include enough dice so that everybody could make their throwing at the same time. As a socialising game this could probably be quite good because gaming wouldn't be just gaming, because you'd have to wait while others are thinking through their options. I prefer Yahtzee.

"Hello, my name is Yahtzee. What's your name?"

"Hello, Yahtzee. My name is Dominion."

The Good: A really good dice game. A breath of fresh air in the dice genre. You roll and try to score a card. However, each card you score gives you special powers: more dice, chances to reroll, etc. The quality of the cards is outstanding. I also like the final round where everyone gets to try and make one final winning roll.

The Bad: Some time must be spent the first game learning what all the cards do. For the more powerful cards, there is one less card than the number of players. If one player falls behind early, that player will end up missing out on all the good cards.

RATING: 6
Too long with more than 2 players.  I enjoy the tactical dice manipulation, but it feels programmed; the choices seem made for you.  You're just going to use your card abilities based on the random dice roll.

Gorgeous bits and art.

I don't think this game has a lot of interesting choices. I think one learns pretty quickly which characters are more helpful, and it is usually not difficult to determine what is the most sensible way to try to work your dice. I imagine it will probably get old quickly, but so far I am quite enjoying the game.

It helps that you can play your dice with a backup plan (i.e. if I can't get the full house, I will still have a 15  to fall back on), which all by itself is enough to make this game infinitely superior to Yahtzee. I think the game length is perfect too. It builds to its crescendo, and then finishes.

Total number of plays = 6. Yahtzee-like dice-rolling game with cards that allow you to add/change die rolls.  I think Pickomino and Sushizock are more fun, easier to teach, and play in the right amount of time. This game is too long for what it is. (Sold my copy.) For a longer game, that has more interesting tension, I would go for Reiner Knizia's Decathlon. (Update: SOLD)

RATING: 7.5
The game gives the appearance of choice, but at the end almost every roll of the dice has one obvious move, and at the end there is almost always one obvious buy.  There are no real choices, and as such this is not really much of a game.

I am disappointed, I like dice games where players have some power over the dice.  Or, as somebody said, where you decide AFTER you roll the dice, rather than before.  It just doesn't work here.

Update:  Having played it on yucata a bunch, I've developed an appreciation for the game.  A substantial upgrade from the "4" is warranted.

Nice art, but aside from being a trumped up version of Yahtzee, nothing to write home about. Fun for quick and easy play and speed, but pathways to victory become apparent; slow and low-risk or fast and high-risk or combinations thereof. Decent players can still pull off completely random wins even with average play, which detracts from the worthiness of victory.

I keep revising my opinion of this game, rating it higher and higher. The trick is the rules aren't clear although they seem clear, leading to a tendency to play the game wrong. If you play it right it is a tense, Yahtzee-ish dice game with a limited role selection mechanic.

I think the strategy is simply to race to get the most dice, since they seem to be better than the manipulation powers. If that's correct, than the game essentially comes down to just luck, as you hope to get the new dice powers as soon as possible.  (By comparison, Yahtzee might actually require more thought!) And the setup time in real life is annoying. 

I seem to like the game, but maybe that means I should be playing more Yahtzee.

RATING: 6
A simple enough filler game that plays in 15 minutes. 

On your turn you roll the dice then choose at least one to bank, you may then re-roll the rest, this continues until all dice are banked at which point you use them to purchase power cards. 
These power cards give a benefit of either an additional die or the power to change the face of un-banked dice.

The aim of the game is to have the best result in the final round of the game (the trigger of which is the purchase of the King card) which is achieved by having more of the same number rolled than any other player, in case of a tie highest face value wins (ie 8 x 5 beats 7 x 6, but 7 x 6 beats 7 x 5).

The big minus on this game that the in-game information on the power cards is very small especially when compared with the art work which although nice to look at has no impact on game play. This is one of the few games I have to play with a magnifying glass and that is a major drawback.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
While this is indeed a game about rolling lots of dice, there are various tactical decisions to make regarding the most probable and beneficial combinations one can make with each throw of the dice.  There's some limit to overall strategy choices given the vagaries of dice and the limited numbers of role cards.  It also seems that one should particularly focus on gaining more dice, given the multiple reroll opportunities involved, only needing a few die manipulation abilities in the long run.  It's a decent light game but doesn't completely fill up the time it takes to play.  Downtime also increases with number of players and can be aggravated by analysis-paralysis (which seems silly for this kind of game).

One play.  4 players.  I'm not really sure I agree with all the Yahtzee comparisons - I think just about any game with dice like this could be compared to Yahtzee.  Anyway, there was a bit too much down time, and a bit too much "what's this do?" and "what will this combination make?" going on to be truly fun.  I think 4 experienced players is the absolute maximum you want in the game, although 3 would be fine at pretty much any level of experience.

It's a great dice game idea but there is some drawback. First, the icons are totally unclear. Their are nice, but you see the number on the dices very badly unless you hold it in your hand. Having a player reference is almost essential. Second, there is so much abilities and so many way to gain characters that you can become overwelmed by what you can do. It's not that a bad thing because it's the element that gives strategy to the game. And it's always fun to have some strategy in a dice game.

Velazquez meets Yahtzee (Rio Grand Games Edition).  A race game of dice rolling and card management.

This game seems to lack a gaming heart - a problem sometimes with dice games - a vacuum exists where decisions become automatic for the experienced player.  However, even with these issues it still serves the purpose - I am loathe to use the f-word - of 30 min filler game suitable for a broad range of skills.  A beginner, with some positive guidance, should not be too disadvantaged.

It is beautifully produced, taking its visual guide from Renaissance art, with good card stock and clever iconography on the cards supported by player aids. Its previous incarnation means a wealth of play testing and any niggles have been ironed out.  However this attention to detail comes at a cost (¬£18.99 in the UK) which ultimately puts it as a treat rather than a must.

I have this relationship with this game that I haven't played it for a while and I remember it was pretty fun then I play it a few times close together then I've had enough and I put it away and don't want to play it again (or whatever the virtual equivalent is for games you play online). It seems funny to say about a dice game but it seems much more important to have more dice and roll them luckily than to have a few dice and have a lot of tricks. So the game always follows a similar arc, someone gets luckier with the dice and ends up with too many for anyone else to take the king off them. Once in a while a game will occur when it is close enough that the extra trick is worth the loss of an extra die. But it seems to be the rarity. I hope the new version has solved this.

Just didn't work for me; dice rolling often doesn't.  But there was something different to this game that I didn't like.  Maybe it was the mental gymnastics of trying to come up with the best combination of uses for the dice you rolled, and keeping track of all the special powers you've accumulated.  I'd likely play it again, but not as a first choice.

Airships has been suggested as a better alternative to To Court the King (http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/401345/first-and-last-impressions). 

It might be worth purchasing Artscow Godfather retheme and trying that first before deciding on TCtK.

For a dice game this provides a tonne of options, so that, theoretically, strategy can play a bigger role. Unfortunately, the strategy is not particularly deep - you either go for dice, for modifiers, or something in the middle. There are few if any tricky decisions, as common sense more or less dictates how players should respond to any given roll of the dice.

This is short enough to be played as a filler, but I'd much rather play the similar length, but infintely deeper game from the same designer, Race for the Galaxy.

RATING: 6
This is a borderline 7 for me: I had enough problems with it that it's not a 7, but I also had fun. I was surprised that out of the four of us playing, the two people I expected to enjoy it most (because they like Yahtzee, which I loathe), didn't like it as much as I'd hoped they would.

The components are nice (though I do wish they provided more dice), and the cards are thick and well-illustrated. The rules and reference sheets are clear and useful, and the actual gameplay during your turn is fun -- I enjoyed trying to figure out what I needed and how to get there.

Where it fell down was in the downtime, and in the fact that apart from keeping an eye on who can roll the most dice (and manipulate them, though that seems like less of a concern) and how soon the king is likely to be claimed, there's not much point in thinking about anything until your turn comes up again. Too close to multiplayer solitaire for my comfort, and the downtime seemed needlessly long.

I'd say that's an unfair complaint to level after the first play, when rules-teaching and general learning tends to slow things down, except that I've also played lots of games (most notably and recently The Speicherstadt) where the first game was a brilliant and involved no downtime. It's a problem here.

Yahtzee lives! It has a a great theme, but it just didn't grab us. Seems remarkably luck based, or requiring of too much math and thought for what it is. Perhaps I just need to be in the right mood. Based on other comments I had high hopes for this one as appealing to the old yahtzee crowd, but they gave up on it too. I feel its spread of characters for players should be greater, or perhaps just the curve of the setup for less than five players needs to be adjusted, it definitely hurts with two players as those middle of the road attainable cards quickly vanish all to your opponent leaving just the II cards and the IV and V almost unattainable ones. Maybe I missed something. I'm open to being corrected.

The game certainly looks great on the table.  

In most games if you have more resources than your opponents you should be able to win easier.  Based on my limited experience I think the characters which provide you with extra dice are the key to the game.  Getting these limited characters first will give you a huge advantage over your opponents.

Every game designer should learn from the mistakes of the Power 9 cards in Magic the Gathering.  If one person gets more resources than their opponents especially at the beginning of the game it becomes unbalanced.  If more cards (or in this case, dice) are available to one player they should be available to all.  This isn't really the case in To Court the King...

I would much rather play something else if dice are involved.

A compact and well-done 'upgrade your chances till the final showdown' type dice game which I like much. With kids [thing=32116][/thing] has proven a better choice, my wife like this one more. If you are not a huge fan of dice games, but don't mind once in a while choose one; you don't need both of them.

This is more strategic than I expected it to be.  Planning for which characters to get, when to get them, and ultimately when to go for the king can leave for a lot of different options.  And since I'm on a heavy dice-rolling kick at the moment, it's great.  And my wife loves it because you can largely focus on your own doings without having to pay extreme attention to everyone else's play.  I have enjoyed and appreciated it more with each play.

Light dice filler. You roll to obtain cards, in order to get more cards and finally get to the King and Queen.

For a dice throwing game it has at least the suggestion of control. Need more plays to evaluate.

One BIG downer: It would be so much more fun / less frustrating to play it those bloody icons weren't so damned small. I actually even might buy an edition where the icons were more or less readable from more than a 2 inch distance.

Actually, might as well get rid of the art, the game's pretty much abstract anyway.

Enjoyable little dice game, although it's best with 3 or 4 players who are moving fairly quickly -- this game starts to get boring quickly if you let it run too long since you're really not doing anything on other players' turns.  Interesting mix of gaining more dice and gaining ways to manipulate your dice.  The concept is easy to explain, but it takes a few plays to start seeing some of the strategies for maximizing your card effects.  Good, puzzley dice filler if you can keep it to about 45 minutes or less.

A fun filler if it's not played too competitively.  Kind of like helping someone solve a crossword puzzle, it's engaging when everyone is allowed to throw in their two cents for each other's turn.  If you can't stand playing this way, the downtime is insufferable and the strategy is shallow.

RATING: 3
Ehh...I expected to like this one. I enjoy the designer's other efforts (especially Race for the Galaxy) and I like dice rolling/allocation games such as Kingsburg and Alien Frontiers. But this game suffers from the tipping point problem: each player is adding a block to his tower each turn until one player hits the goal, beating everyone by one. There's no satisfaction to the game play along the way.

Update: A common complaint of this game is that there are few interesting decisions; you should always take the cards that give you more dice over the manipulation cards. After reading a review of a player who came around on this game after reading a strategy article by the designer, I thought I should give it another go. Two games later, my opinion remains the same. This is a stinker. I don't even think I can claim it is better than Yahtzee.

Played once with five people.  This is essentially a glorified version of Yahtzee; players try to roll a set of dice and attempt to end up with specific sets of numbers (e.g., two pairs, a straight, four of a kind, etc.).  There are about 20 different cards on the table; each card has one of the sets of numbers on it, and when when players get a specific combination they can pick up that card from the table.  Each card has a power, which enables the player to roll more dice, add numbers to dice, or any number of other things.  While this game is indeed more fun than Yahtzee (thanks to the cards which give you powers to modify dice rolls), I found it to be too long and too slow for a dice- (translate: luck-) based game.  Esssentially the game summed up to me rolling the dice a couple of times, pondering what I could get for thsoe dice, and then waiting five or ten minutes while my opponents did the same.  There's certainly some skill involved, but not enough to make the game worth the time (IMHO).

Beautiful, lighter dice manipulation game.  The rules are simple and easy to understand but the cards can cause some brain-burn for people who are not used to the idea of setting up combinations of events.  There is a very probable limit to replay value amongst highly analytical mathematic types.

I plan to use the game as an introduction to thinker or abstract style games because it avoids the general look of an abstract game and has enough luck to shave the edge off of the value behind studying the game.  (And it beats the snot out of Yahtzee.)

Initial thoughts: 7.2
Dropped .5 points: the game is too easy to "solve" and replay value is lower than it appeared.

Competetive puzzle game; Rosie describes it as a mixture of Liar's Dice and Puerto Rico!  Lots of die rolling, but you have lots of options with which to manipulate the dice.  Potentially very quick, but don't play with anyone who suffers from analysis paralysis.  Slightly flawed, in that more dice will usually beat any number of clever manipulation options, but if I'm going to roll dice, this is the way I'd like to do it.

Neato keeno.  Easily accessible and good for new gamers.

If the players are into the game, it works, but if not, it gets a trifle long until the endgame is triggered.

Oh, and this kicks Dominion's ass!

Started out really liking this a lot, but it's appeal faded.  There's just too much down time while everyone watches one player roll and roll again.  Towards the end of the game the stacking of so many powers lets the active player's turn go on and on.

This game packs a surprising punch for its size and falls in that 'I like it' category without ever seeming to get enough plays.

Tries to be like Airships, ends up more like Yahtzee, but possibly broken. I have little clue what to roll for, or even what my reward is for hitting it.

Start the game rolling 3 dice to earn more characters, which give you additional dice to roll or special manipulative powers. First one to roll seven of a kind triggers the end of the game. It's an okay game, there is downtime watching everyone else roll, and there is luck involved. It takes some time to get used to all the special powers of the characters. The first couple of players appear to have an advantage in earning the characters, since there is only a limited number of them.

RATING: 5
I love the idea, but the game has several issues:
-> The characters that give dice are FAR better than the ones that give skills.
-> Between the characters that give skills, there are a couple of them that are also far better, especially the one that requires 2 doubles (very cheap!).
-> The general and the queen are uberpowerful.
-> If you need to pick a Joker after your first roll, 95% that you'll lose.

So, at the end, the strategy is to pick the best characters and these are the same for all players. that means at the end it is just a matter of luck.

Out of turn time is reaaally boring. On Yucata.de it becomes very fast, because you also skip the setup, the rolling, etc., and the mandipulation of dice and the charecter election are "automatic" because of the winning strategy.

It is a game that could have been great, but at the end it is only "curious".

First impression: Basically a Yahtzee on steroids. You're trying to roll to certain objectives to get characters that give you more dice to roll and abilities to change outcome of rolls. It's a dice rolling fest. I wasn't too impressed about it even though I wanted to like it.

Almost no player interaction.  You can literally walk away from the table on someone's turn and come back when it's your own; other than taking role cards you might want, nothing they do will affect you.  And it's possible for a player to fall so far behind that he or she might as well just stop playing.  Once you play it a few times, it goes pretty quick, though.  Interesting to see players try different strategies in picking roles (dice manipulation versus additional dice versus a mixed strategy.)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]Looking back I enjoyed this game less than I originally stated, a year later the only thing that sticks out is how long this simple dice game took to play. On top of that the end of the game ended up being quite anti climactic, not a game I want to play again.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]This was a fun dice rolling game where you got to buy cards [i](using your die rolls)[/i] which let you manipulate dice in some way or give you extra dice to roll. I had a lot of fun playing, but I felt like the game went long with 4 players (my guess is 3 would be the sweet spot) and by the end you have a bunch of cards/abilities to manage. While we didn't have any problems doing that I don't think this would make a great gateway game even though it is quite light.[/i]

[i]In the end I am glad that I played it [i](since I am always looking for new dice games to play)[/i] but it doesn't come close to challenging any of my favorites [i]([thing=147431][/thing], [thing=139899][/thing] or [thing=131260][/thing])[/i] for a spot in my collection.[/i]

What I like:
- Finished surprisingly quickly, even at 5p (40 minutes)
- Reasonably simple and clever dice mechanics
- No direct attacks or screwage

What I don't like:
- Some downtime, especially if people get AP
- I'm not a fan of so many possible modifiers
- Some "rich get richer" snowball effect
- Very limited count of cards, at least with 5p

It kind of feels like a predecessor of Alien Frontiers, with all the possible modifiers and ways to use your dice. It would definitely move faster if everyone had their own set of (10) dice.

I would put the weight at about 1.9.

RATING: 8
Cool Yatzie clone... very cool yatzie clone. From all the yatzie clones I got (4 so far) this one is my favourite. The cards are just awesome, as well in design as in quality and I like their abilities. 
Basically you try to reach first through all the different level of cards until you reach the top cards: King and Queen! On the way up you use your collected cards to manipulate your dice results in different ways. I don't mind dice games as long as the game assumes itself as a dice game, which is the case of this one. I don't like Arkham Horror, since it is essentially a dice game pretending to be a big adventure... I rather play this one.

RATING: 6.5
A nice dice mechanic of  improving your chances of rolling the elusive 7 of a kind. The end game however, the last round where everyone tries to beat the king, seems like a waste, since once near the end, rolling 8 or even 9 of a kind is not that hard and the player who got the king has some significant advantages and would generally have been in the lead already. A decent game nonetheless.

Sophisticated dice game with shades of Yahtzee or Pickomino.  Repeat plays demonstrate why playing with smaller groups is better, as there is little to do between turns.  After several playings the novelty is wearing.

RATING: 7
Yatz-like dice-rolling for a purpose. The lenght is a bit below one hour, depending on the number of players. 
This is of course purely a luck-based game but you can modify your luck with those cards. Every card is helping you roll better for the sake of the endgame. Enggame begins when somebody rolls 7 same-numbered dice and choose to take the king.

The art is dark but won't matter much while playing. A player aid with card explanations seem to be mandatory. Counter-clockwise turn order works really well in these kinds of games.

Edit: With some flaws, this still is a very entertaining game which improves the Yachzeeish dice rolling to the power of three.

Talk about Yathzee on steroids! Or more like Yathzee: the Gathering =) Can possibly turn into an AP-fest if people have trouble sorting out all the possible interactions between the cards. But with the right crowd (no Ap, used to the whole ccg combo thing) it's a great closer.

Creative and interesting. I'm counting off because the components, although beautiful, are obfuscatory.

RATING: 8
I enjoyed this game quite a bit.  It's Yahtzee!, a game I actually enjoy, with some gamer-strategy thrown in.  It doesn't really fit a niche very well.  It's too light to really appeal to gamers, and too heavy (the double-sided cheat card is almost inscrutable) for non-gamers, though the mechanics appear simple at first.  Also, can suffer from a bit of AP as people stare at the dice and try to figure out what combo of abilities will net them which card.  By the way, what does each card do again?  I really enjoy it (I give it an 8!), but it probably won't see the table much, and I can't imagine the sort of group I would regularly play it with (unfulfilled Yahtzee! enthusiasts with PhDs or hopefully soon to acquire PhDs are fairly rare...).  In terms of mixing light elements with some heavier thinking and the odd combo it makes, I'd compare it to Rum & Pirates.  Played once.

It's Dominion had a baby with Yahtzee.  It is slightly luck based, as obviously with dice rolls, but you can change your luck, and that's what I love.  My only concern is that there is a limited number of cards, so that in a 4 player game, each stack only has 3 cards, so one person is going to get screwed.  However, as that has never been me, I can't complain.  Edit: while I still love this game I've played better deck builders that I think balance a little better.  I'm lowering my rating to 7.5.

RATING: 4
First play with 3 newbies which of course had that unsettling downtime common with games using numerous die rolling as the main mechanic. It was accentuated in this session as we struggled to familiarise ourselves with the various Yahtzee combos to claim a characters. Two things I like about Yahtzee compared to TCtK is that die rolling is limited to 3 attempts, but the best thing is the scoring sheet which provides a clear overview of what you still need to push for with high pip rolls and bonuses. This tactical commentary is hindered in TCtK because I was mentally unsure of what I should be rolling for (increase die holding or die manipulation?). Despite some reservations, I'm willing to try again with 2 as this promises to be more interesting in the long run compared to Yahtzee, due to more consideration as to what your opponent is able to do. I like the showdown to win for the King's ear and for once we have die rolling with at least a relatable theme.

As a 2-player game I give this an 8.  And the solo variant here on the Geek makes this a great "sit in front of the TV" game (I'd probably up it to a 9 as a solo game).  It's a simple game to learn and play, but it lends itself to analysis paralysis for new players trying to learn the card powers.  That's why I give it a 6.  It's much shorter and quicker with experienced players.

I just got this for my 48th birthday, and it went over very well, although we did get a little lost as to the timing of certain cards, but it was due to only an initial breezing-over of the rules rather than my thorough reading and mental burning-in.

The turn order mechanism can really wreck anyone not in 1st or last in the opening round. If those people get stuck with the Hofnarr, the rest of the game will likely be spent wishing for it to be over. A decent game with 2 players, but not very fun with more than that due to the above criticism and the serious downtime.
I rate it a 5 with 2 players and a 2 with 3+ so my rating here represents something of a compromise.

Pros:
* Fun to play.
* Compact and portable.

Cons:
* Not terribly tense and tension is one of the best reasons for playing a dice roller.
* Less "To Court The King" and more "Roll for the General".
* Aside from taking a card you think the other person might want, there's no interaction.

Neutral:
* Holds up pretty well to rule tweaks/variants, although I understand the author worked pretty hard to make the game balanced and tweaks are likely to mess with that.
* The author has talked about one or two expansions that never saw the light of day but which would have resolved some of the issues.

2013-01-03 - R: 6

After a particularly intense game of Battleline, we decided we needed more games that could capture that feeling that makes you stomp around the room after you draw a card and it's the one you could have used two turns ago. Every decision is excrutiating. We wanted to find another game like that.

Sadly, this isn't that game. It's fun, but not intense. Quite a few reviews (including comments from the designer) stated that the cards which give you extra dice were the most important and you usually combine those with one or maybe two modifier cards. In a two player game, both players get two turns in a row and in two of our plays, one player got the General followed by the King/Queen. At that point the game's over. There were variants to make the general weaker, but, at least for two players, I don't think they went far enough.

We've played four times so far, including once with a variant (remake?) I'm working on.

I'm going to start this at 6. For a Yahtzee-like game, it plays well and is fun enough. The components and base rules are fairly abstract and I think it's going to lend itself well to tweaking; perhaps one of those tweaks will make it more fun.

= 2013-12-14

It's been about a year since we last played this and since then we've acquired at least two games which scratch the same itches better.

* Alien Frontiers better handles those situations where you want to manipulate your dice rolls.

* Cosmic Cows is more fun for two player Yahtzee and has a bit more player interaction.

Putting this one up for trade. If they ever re-release it, I might pick it up again.

i usually find dice games really boring, but i was pleasantly surprised by this game. i actually enjoyed watching other players take their turns and figure out what characters they were shooting for, so the downtime between my turns wasn't too much of an issue for me. familiarity with the game and the strategies might change that over time, however. my only issue with the game that it seemed like it was too forgiving. i suppose that facet of game-play helps keeps the game interesting for all players, so that probably isn't a bad thing. all in all i found the experience of playing the game enjoyable and i wouldn't mind playing again.

Too much or little of either and you'll be in a difficult position come end game.  Great dice game that I look forward to playing many more times in the future.

I usually don't like games with lots of dice rolling. So it's odd that I'd like a game that is entirely about rolling dice (and lots of them too). Plays like Yatzee with character cards that let you add dice and modify rolls.

After one (two-player) game this feels a bit too open. No real competition for the cards. I think it will be better when the special abilities on the card become more familiar and there are a few more players.

Not a great deal of depth to it, but sometimes I'm really in the mood just to throw some dice and this game will hit the spot during those odd occasions. Yahtzee, Settlers Dice Game, Heckmeck am Bratwurmeck... they're all the same push your luck concept, but this one is a little kinder and gentler with the fool option and numerous other options available each turn - you never seem to be locked out of a decent option if you didn't quite get what you're looking for. Maximum of three players or else it gets a little dull waiting around.

The best example of controled randomness.  You use dice to earn the support of different characters in a run to get the king's favor.  Each character gives you a special ability to manipulate dice.  When someone reachs the monarch's attention, triggers the last round of the game.  The winner is the one that has the most dice with the same number in that last round.

This is a terribly boring game of turn optimization, player's turns take too long as they're working out the best order to apply their powers, nothing about this is fun, it was BAD with two, with more I couldn't even imagine finishing the game.

[1 play] Yahtzee on steriods was an ok description, but having now played it once, I'd say the learning curve (at least learning the detail of character abilities) was a bit more than I had expected.

RATING: 7
On my watchlist: saw some interesting prototype developments of this game on Amigo Spiele's website.

This is yahtzee on steroids. The dice rolling element is familar. Roll three dice and lock one denomination for each roll. The meat of the game is the technology tree. Your rolls determines which characters you can recruit. These give you extra dice, lets you change numbers on dice, etc. The end result is to dice off for the King. The player with the best 'most of a kind' combination wins!

The character cards are nice and thick and the artwork is superb. The game is quite fun but with the 'fixed' tech tree, it often sees players racing to arm up and games can get quite samey with luck of the roll determining the winner. Still, good fun. Try with three to four players for the best experience. Five is too many and makes for an unnecessarily long experience. Also, the game is WAY overpriced for what it is. RRP should be US$19.95 or so. The game at full RRP costs as much as many large box games. Heck, I can get Settlers of Catan for the same price as this game!

The more I play it, the more I like it. However, why the heck didn't they put text on the cards? Referring to the table of contents everytime you wanna roll is annoying. It took 7 or 8 games before I could finally memorize what each character does and costs.

Yucata and now hard copy.

Not bad, but still prefer to play on Yucata, as although seems an easy game, teaching to 'newbies' can be problematic. Especially with all the special powers each character has and the slightly confusing end game scenario.

Also can be a little AP prone when getting near the end game. Always go for the extra dice cards as soon as you can. It's the only way to win.

RATING: 6
Dice. Feels like Euro Yahtzee to me. Rating after one 2p game. Pretty fun dice-rolling filler. Roll dice to accumulate combinations that let you "buy" characters, each of which yields an ability to improve your dice rolling, working your way up to the king to win the game.

Got a copy, played it again, and it felt flatter that time. Could have been my opponents, but if they weren't interested there wasn't much point in me keeping it.

Fun, simple and easy game.  The core rules are broken though, so I make a house rule change.  For every die you bring in after a roll, you MUST lock a die.  Otherwise, the best solution is to always go after cards that give you more dice.

RATING: 6
For a dice game there is a surprising level of control.  There are a number of entertaining ways to "level up" using your powers to get farther ahead.  I feel that experience with this game will allow for more seamless play as there are initially too many different cards that require too many different things that grant too many different powers.  That said it is managable, but I think it is a little overwhelming for people to take in all at once.

There is a joy in manipulating your rolls by your roles, but it comes with the cost of downtime.  As people become more acclimated to the system it should pick up a bit, but really everyone is playing their own game and sometimes it takes too long to wait for your turn.  I wouldn't ever play this with more than three players.

After one play I can't find anything "wrong" or "broken" with the game.  I enjoyed rolling to obtain a Court Member card (each having it's own special ability).  Even felt like I was killing the competition (as did the others) until the final roll.  Turns out that my poor planning cost me the ability to roll what I needed (or at least I couldn't roll it easily or as easily as my competition) and I was in a clutch to pick up a card or two to help me along and so I lost.  I'd like to take it out again to see if I still enjoy it, but so far so good.

Nice Yahtzee variant. You have to play it several times before seeing all the cool interactions possible between the dice manipulators. However, it seems the main path to victory is to simply go for additional dice with little regard to the manipulators.

Best with 2 or 3 players, to reduce down time.

Much better with the (yet unpublished) expansion!

Yahtzee deluxe... hmm, not sure this one is for me. I'd rather choose the original but probably would play if asked since it is sort of okay. At first, all those cards and their abilities are bit much to take in but that passes quickly, with many players it has too much downtime, too. I guess, certain players really dig this, I feel lukewarm about it but it is short enough to not be painful.

This has been compared as a cross between Magic and Yahtzee. I can see why. One of the most enjoyable dice games I know. It does have drawbacks, such a as the long time between turns (don't play this with more than three) and the somewhat steep learning curve for such a simple game. You have to play this once or twice to be comfortable with all the characters. Aside from that, it's as good as dice games get.

To Court the King is Yahtzee with bells and whistles. I immediately took to Roll Through the Ages, another Yahtzee variant, but To Court the King didn't grab me initially. When I played it with my family, they felt it was too long and had too much overhead for what it was. I reluctantly had to agree.

If it weren't a Tom Lehmann game, I'd write it off, but I generally appreciate Tom's designs so I should probably give it another chance; maybe my rating will improve.

A nice filler, but too much down time, which can not even be used to plan ahead - because there is nothing to plan ahead.

[RGG 2006 edition] {Medival; pattern-rolling, dice-collection; optimal 4p} TCtK is a tactical dice-rolling game. TCtK mediates the luck by providing players with decisions to target for which function cards. I think TCtK is more tense and fun with 4-5p, though downtime is long.  The mid game is quite boring and the climax comes during the final dice roll, in which players are exciting to see who will be the winner.

I think the strategy is obvious: equip with capability to have more dice in early stage and with capability to control the dice results in late stage. More dice won't guarantee a win; nor will stronger dice control do. A player shall strike a balance between the two. The cards seem well-balanced and I think more cards are coming as expansions. TCtK tries to solve the sitting problems by varying the start player each round - well, it seems effective but I have to see. Player with the "King" is not always the winner; sometimes, I think being the start player at the last round is bad.

The theme is thin and the artwork is not my taste but the quality of the cards are good (similar to Boomtown) and the dice are pretty.

RATING: 6
A decent game where you attempt to control the outcome of a series of dice roles using your ability to manipulate the results. I wish that the cards were more functional as most of the time players spend their time staring at the reference sheet. Love the artwork.

Now that Kingburg is out, I'll never need to play this one again.

A thinking-man's Yahtzee game?  Well that's oversimplifying it of course but it's not far off.  The abilities of the various cards you earn throughout the game significantly compensate for the luck of the dice making for a game that's much heavier on strategy than a dice game has a right to be.  This is quite fun.

Attractively produced game of ratcheting up your abilities to increase the number of dice you have and your means of modifying your dice rolls to ultimately acheive seven-of-a-kind. First game went OK, but the last couple of turns introduced downtime due partly to the complexity of possible actions, partly to the late hour.

Why did I trade this away????? This is a dice game with interesting choices to make along with the requisite push-your-luck element.  With 2 players, it's a quick race.  It's still fun with more players, but be sure to point out options to the other players to keep the game moving quickly, and then it works with 5 players.  With a few more plays this might be rated a 10.  I recommend playing with the General variant (must set his two dice before setting any others).

I hate Yahtzee. I hate all games that are solely (or mostly) based on luck.
"Um Krone und Kragen" adds just as much tactics and planning to Yahtzee to make it fun. Oftentimes you do not even have to roll a second or third time, but can change the dice as needed after the first roll. This usually leads to huge downtimes when one oponent is trying hard to figure out what to do with his dice and cards - however, I never found this annoying, because it's so much fun to calculate for yourself what your oponents can do with their dice.
Plus, this game has the best components for its price I've ever seen! Good dice and very high quality cards!

New, IN SHRINK!

This is a nice mix of dice-rolling and card play to manipulate the dice.  Unfortunately it's very 1-dimensional.  The game basically boils down to a race and bad luck will absolutely kill you.

This was pretty good when it came out, but it's been far surpassed by newer dice games.

RATING: 6
Dice allocation card game. The heart of the game is the initial rolling of three dice in an attempt to gain different combinations such as pairs, all even numbers, a total of fifteen pips etc. From these combinations different role cards can be obtained and these provide modifiers to the dice e.g. introducing extra dice, allowing re-rolls, changing the total of various dice etc, and as the game progresses more powerful cards are acquired eventually resulting in the King card, which requires seven of a kind to be rolled. This prompts an endgame where everyone attempts to roll the highest 'of a kind' total as possible using the modifiers their cards provide. The endgame itself can be tense but their isn't much excitement during the rounds leading up to it and possibly too much thought has to go into working out the optimum way to assign your dice than the game merits.

Played 5+ times. Great little dice romp.  Each turn you continue rolling and setting aside dice until you have set aside all your dice.  Then you see if you can claim a special power.  Claimed through Yahtzee combo's: pair, full house, straight etc.  The special powers give you more dice or the ability to modify the die or re-roll some dice.  When someone claims the king it starts the end game and who ever can roll the highest hand wins with the king breaking ties.  Lots of fun 2009/03/11

tl;dr: a race to the top

This game isn't completely balanced. There are 2 or 3 players that have chance of winning until one player gets the queen, and then that person is almost certain to win. Other players might not stand a chance. But I'm fine with that, because rolling all these dice and using your abilities just is a fun puzzle, and there is still tension in what players get to the tipping point first, leaving the others behind.
So not the perfect strategic dice game, but I really quite enjoy this for what it is.

This is an engine building game, where the engine is rolling dice. After rolling, you buy a card with your result. Cards give you more dice or let you modify one or more dice. Quick little filler, but in the end, it is still a little luck filled dice game.

I was always a fan of Yahtzee, and I love Easy Come Easy Go - This is like one short step up from those games, with some great art for a bit of flavor.  The only downside is the price, which is frankly way to high for what you're buying, and yet, it's a game I've been playing a fair amount, so I guess it's turned out to be a better deal than many things I've bought...

I have got to say that I expected more from this game. The game is pretty and stuff, but... 
Once the game has progressed so far that everyone has like 5-12 dices, its seem to be quite hard to manage the rules if you don't perfectly understand them. To Court the King doesn't fit for non-gamers but for gamers its probably very fun! I also think that in 2-player game, General is overpowered card because only one can have it and it gives the owner 2 extra dices.

Home-made version and Rio Grande version. Fun dice rolling game for 2 or 3 people. Too much down time when playing it with more people. Kinda Yahtzee on steroids as players roll dice to gain the favors of courtesans who can provide special abilities and more dice to roll. Keep on playing until somebody gains the Queen's favor and then there is a roll off to see who can roll the most of any number. Definitely some skill involved initially, but will quickly turn into a luck fest as the one or two strategies become apparent.

RATING: 6
I love the concept of To Court the King, but in practice, the experience is a bit solitary.  Unlike Yahtzee--where everyone can see what you've rolled instantly--in TCtK the table can't enjoy that BOOM! moment of you've got it or you don't.  Everybody just waits quietly while you tap cards and adjust dice.

Actually a cute and fast-playing 2-player game with a new maths puzzle every turn. I enjoy trying to figure out a path to turn the dice into something useful using the various cards available, a new puzzle every turn.

Don't play with people who overanalyse things.

Wait so how is this not Yahtzee Extreme? OK character cards that do things for you so you have a better chance to score a Yahtzee! :)  Not a terrible game mind you. I do rate this slightly higher than Yahtzee as I think someone could talk me into it again but I'm gonna struggle and suggest other things.

I call this nightmare yahtzee. This one gets increasingly complex as you are granted more and more dice changing abilities so that the game can arrive mercifully to the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Was thinking about picking this one up, then read that the best strategy is always to make sure you go for extra die cards; which, while it doesn't guarantee a win, certainly makes it easier to get to the requisite number of dice to win the game.

Edit: Re-thinking my rating on this one due to a second play.  This was waaay confusing trying to figure out what to go for.  Plus, the endgame is confusing as hell.  Won't play this one again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Yahtzee with special powers where you start with 3 dice and slowly add extra dice and reroll abilities based on what you roll.  Very fun, though downtime can be annoying with larger numbers of players, and I suspect that once you get a few decent reroll powers and extra dice, there's not much more to think about.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I do not like very much dice games so my 8 is a great honor for the game (although I do like dice to play some part in a game). It is a very good game, but new players need to play it once or twice to know a little bit the cards and then after that there is a lot of fun and tension. Great dice game and great components (as long as you do not get the faulty dice - although they are great to have and trick your friends!).

A clever dice-based game by Tom Lehmann. Roll lots of dice and use character abilities to modify and improve your rolls. Build your way up to better and better rolls until you have a shot at winning the game. Quite fun if you like games with abilities and you don't mind dice. This game has a nice strategy-to-luck ratio. There is luck in the dice, but you have some control over how to apply and arrange your dice rolls.

Not a bad game for two players, but the initial impression was that the cards and choices present a fresh set of rules for players and quite unique to the game. The choice of choosing more dice seems to be the superior tactic though manipulators, without the amount of dice at hand, is always at a disadvantage. I believe that repeated plays will probably cause this game to get dull quickly. Not a game that should be played often, but once in a while should be entertaining.

Fun.  You recruit characters by getting certain dice combos: ex.  full house....all odds....four of a kind.  The characters are for you to use on your turn, and the timing you use them turns into a logistics equation as you cultivate a score of them in front of you.  The character powers range from: add extra dice.......to take pips away from one dice and add it to another.  

as soon as someone gets 7 of a kind, it sets the end game in motion, a round where each person must try to get the most of one kind.  

right now, only two plays into it, i can't wait to play again......super fun, great components, and nice choices.  Good for my son's brain and reading skills. He is 9, and beat me once.........with a little help in sticky spots.

Seems to be lacking something. I really wanted to like it, but it seems like there is no reason to try to get any of the powers other than the extra dice ones, and if you do get other ones, AP sets in and the turns take forever.

RATING: 6
Played once, with 3, and it didn't really grab me.  You throw the dice, evaluate the desirability of the characters that the dice would win, evaluate the desirability of the other characters that a re-roll could win against the cost of failure, evaluate the cost/benefit of using the power of characters already won, then probably throw some dice again.  Fine to have decisions to make, but there's nothing much to do on your opponents' turns, and the turns tend to get longer as the game goes on.  Also, I suffer from mild aleaphobia :)

I should like this one more than I do. Just felt that it either needed to have more or less mechanics. I guess I don't like games that sit half-way between a serious dice game and a simple one like Perudo or Can't Stop.

Also, no way to catch up to or slow down runaway leaders which is pretty annoying.

A deceptively fun game! I was very impressed with the artwork, and the cards are so well made that it just fun to look at the cards while you play. Strategies can vary, but not overly complicated once you know what you need. This is a definite must have game for people who enjoy Yahtzee, Poker, or dice rolling games in general. Great party game with friends, even my relatives loved it!

Clever.  Have only played this once, and I enjoyed it.  I have a hard time seeing this as significantly replayable with a strategic eye, as the options are pretty limited and your hand is somewhat forced, particularly in the early game.  But still, if you're looking for a heavier alternative to Yahtzee for Uncle Non-gamer, this is a very good choice.  You'll have decisions to make, and they'll be able to retain the excitement of die-rolling.

Quick little dice game. Roll a bunch of dice to recruit characters, then later use those characters to adjust the dice of future rolls. The common "Yahtzee on steroids" moniker is accurate, I'd say. A few decisions on which characters to aim for, but definitely a light game overall.

First Play - 3 players - Fun, light dice rolling game. Similar to Yahtzee but you get to "court" different characters, each with their own special power to add/change your dice rolls. Once someone gets 7-of-a-kind thhey may court the King (and Queen) and then the end game begins. If anyone did not get an equal amount of turns they get to finish their regular turns and then attempt to sway the King/Queen to them with a better 7 of a kind or with 8+ of a kind. The original king courter gets one more change (if necessary) and that's it. I'm adding ti to my wishlist as I think it is a good intro game for players not use to the "hiring" and "special character abilities" mechanisms found in other games.

Euro version of Yahtzee. Pleasant, but can suffer downtime with too many players at the table. I think 3p is probably the sweet spot with this filler. Also, I'm concerned that the actual decisions involved are minimal, and it seems that repeat plays will evolve almost exactly the same.

In this game, the players are petitioners at the royal court, who try to gain the support of the king. To do so, they must first gain the help of the servants at the court, who can help them gain access to the nobility, who, in turn, can help to reach the king. The game is played in turns. On their turn, a player will gather his dies, roll them, set aside at least one, and roll the remainding dice again, until all dice have been set aside. After that, he gets to select a character that will help him. Each character requires a certain combination of dice (such as two pairs or dice that show at least 30 points). The character will give the player some benefits on later rolls, such as an additional die or the ability to modify the results of a roll. The game ends when a player gains the support of the Queen. Now, all players try to gain a dice result of as many equal dice as possible. The player that gets the biggest combination wins the support of the King and wins the game.

If I recall correctly, this game came out about the same time as Airships, and there was a lot of discussion comparing the two games.  Now that I've played both, I understand why: The games have a similar nature, in that the players start off with a basic set of dice, and they develop a dice engine that allows them to roll more and more of them.  That's important, since the goal of the game is to roll 7-of-a-kind, but being the first to roll that combo isn't necessarily the best thing to do.  The first person to accomplish that goal gets the King AND Queen cards, and then everyone else in the game gets a chance to beat that roll.  Whoever does gets the Queen card, and that's important because the Queen beats ties!  It reminds me a bit of the last-turn mechanism of Jambo, and I think it adds a little something to the game.  As it is, I much prefer this game over Airships, as it seems to have more of a fast-paced fun factor, which Airships seems to lack.

One of the better dice games I've played. There are more decisions than most, and I don't think it's a total luckfest. However, downtime can be pretty severe with AP types (or non-gamers, or anyone who has to refer regularly to the player aid), and it's a bad downtime, since you can't do any player interaction stuff or even any serious planning. It also seems like very tactical, and that there's basically one path to victory, so I think it would get stale quickly if played on a regular basis. Still, I like this as much as I used to like Yahtzee (which has been dropped down a peg by this), and I think people who enjoy dice games should probably dig this one.

Just not enough there for truly interesting choices.  Needed more unique cards and effects for more challenging heuristics.  Great core idea, though, shame it doesn't work for me.

Pretty hard to deviate from the fist full of dice strategy.  Tough to win if you grab more than one dice manipulator unless the leader rolls badly.  Then again, ultra-quick game that shouldn't last more than a 1/2 hour,  and good when you want more a game where you want people of differing skill levels to all have a chance.  

Physical game takes a bit of effort to set up though - different numbers of cards for different numbers of players

Here the game feels unbalanced (some characters in the advanced tiers, such as the bishop, are much easier to get than others in the previous tiers - although I agree it doesn't affect the players compared to each other) and it is most of the time much better to go for extra dice rather than for control. The main drawback, however, is downtime, since there is absolutely nothing you can do while the other players are rolling their dice.

I like it. Mind you it is not the best game ever but I consider it a great, fast, little filler.

I greatly enjoy the mechanics that allows, with a (little) bit of thought, to turn a  really bad roll (say 1,3,4) into something really impressive like (6 sixes). It gives me some twisted satisfaction of beating bad luck :)

The problem is that my friends do not think so highly of it so I have troubles finding players for this one.

Fun game. Sure there are Dice but with all the abilities on the cards you can force your luck quite a bit. I seem to like it better than Kingsburg.

My wifes favorite game.  A little like yahtzee only much better.  There is more player interaction here and the dice manipulation and card selection make for interesting choices.

While I do prefer its refreshed version in the Pharaoh, Court remains a very nice game in and of itself. The ability to accommodate five players is welcome, and its short setup time along with way easier rules keep it relevant in my collection.

Nice light dice rolling game. My family enojys this and so do I. I am not sure that there is much strategy here but it keeps you invested while you are playing. Rating may fall over time, I will revisit.

Update: rating has fallen to 6. Several people complained there was too many dice combos towards the end leading to AP. It still feels a little too random.

Multi-player solitaire with press-your-luck elements. There is interaction and tension from trying to win the character cards before others and kibitzing while they take their turn, but it's not enough. There are many other fillers I would choose to play over this one.

I love the idea of this game, but the execution is uneven.  Essentially this is a very fiddly implementation of a very simple concept.  The virtues and problems of this game are strikingly similar to Knights, so if you already own that game, you don't need this.

Race for the General? Funny that the game has both dice-adders and dice-modifiers, seemingly without realizing the system of selection allows for so many rerolls that extra dice essentially are equivalent to dice modified to whatever number you prefer. (In other words, because you only have to select one out of, say, your seven dice to score, a worker that provides a 1 before you initially roll has 7 opportunities to give you the desired number.) Some modifiers are obviously required, and the best of the bunch seem to be the Astronomer, Lady in Waiting, and Sorcerer given how early in the game you can acquire them, leaving later rolls to collect dice-adders like Pawnbroker, Knight, Bishop, and General.

6 after 3 plays.

Familiarity with the various roles helps with the game. The dice mechanic reduces the amount of luck involved and makes it feel like a deck-building game without the shuffling and with more interaction. Replayability may be on the low side though.

RATING: 6
Only 1 play - needs to see the table again. Playing against experienced players, I got smoked bad, since I had no way of evaluating the abilities of the different characters. Great, familiar mechanics, but may take a play or two to figure out what you should be aiming for each round.

Super Yahtzee! A lot more fun than some would suggest. But I can see my score dropping after too many plays. But it's easy to teach, easy to carry, and something my mom will want to play.

Short(ish) and fun yahtzee descendant... but can sometimes feel bogged down by the sheer number of card-tapping and dice-rolling you'll be doing, especially when compared to newer, more streamlined designs. This is even more pronounced in the ending phase, which I think doesn't really need to exist at all.

I had actually never played Yahtzee before so I wasn't sure what I would think of To Court the King, but I actually enjoyed it quite a bit.  The art is gorgeous and its simple to pick up and play.  Might need to snag a copy.

Though I don't know how frequently it would hit the table since it is basically just a dice game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The dice rolling should've turned me off immediately, but I think the worst part of To Court the King is the absence of any kind of strategy.  Basically you go for the characters that will give you more dice every time, then a couple of die manipulation power after that.  That's it.  Everyone does the same exact thing turns after turns.  Mindnumbingly boring.

This game is strangely addictive.  The ability to build your "arsenal" of extra dice and manipulation in whatever balance you choose - and the dice allow - as you vie for this or that, and ultimately the king, always seems to amount to a pleasurable endeavor.  The game is sufficiently quick that even if you do miraculously miserably, it's over soon enough.

I nice gateway game as it has several elements of Yahtzee, a popular American game, with an RPG type element of skill(ability) progression. Although some nice build were found between the powers, the game still proves to be very luck driven and lackes the skill of deeper games.

After 2+ Plays: A fun idea for a game, but it has three problems.  First, there is too much downtime between turns.  Second, there isn't enough interaction, which also makes the downtime worse because you don't care what your opponents are doing.  Third is the lack of variety between games, because certain paths are just better.

A strategic game with dices. Luck is very important but the choise to use different characters for have more power on the dice create a real good game fast and challenging.

12/9/08 -- I get a big kick out of this game chiefly for two reasons:  

1)  The art is over-the-top in its goodness.
2)  By the end of the game, you can manipulate your dice so much it almost doesn't matter what you roll.  I think this is funny, since its billing as a dice game is somewhat of a misconception.

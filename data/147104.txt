This is another one of those secret identity games where you’re trying to deduce who is who. However, this is more of a deduction game than a hidden identity game I think as there’s no bluffing or lying involved, which separates it from games like Werewolf, Resistance etc. The “easy” version of the game isn’t as cool as the harder, “real” game in which you can be tricked and need to think twice about who’s who. I think it’s clever that there are a lot of various roles included and you as your own role need to find one or two specific other roles. And you can definitely learn a lot by seeing what the other players are doing and what questions they are asking what person.

I love most deduction games, and this is okay, but I really don’t like the way you score points in this game! Once a player makes an early guess the rest will probably follow, leaving the other players to only score 1 point for the round (and in a game where points are scarce over the 3 rounds, this is a huge deal)! There’s also quite a lot of luck involved about which person to pick and ask your question, and you have a distinct advantage if you don’t get asked a lot (just like in games such as Sleuth etc.).

An excellent straight deduction game. Probably best ~6p because in 8p some people only get 1 turn or even less.

I do wish it went 1 more round as the game can tie very easily or if the scoring was done differently. But I understand that the game might be too long which would be bad.

Oh yes, this was fun enough to play it again. I wasn't sure in my first play, as the first round was extremely difficult for everyone, and five out of seven people had an error. Later, our understanding really improved. Better with seven than with six players.

Deduction game loosely based around the theme of the "boy who cried wolf". Plays more people fairly well than most deduction games but there appears to be a higher luck element because of the important of finding the higher ranked identities before others do. Quick and fairly fun.

Nice idea and neat cartoony art. Tokens ought to have been cards and colors aren't well chosen. Unfortunately the game doesn't really work that well. Any player misunderstanding something or being dumb can break the game and some players can just throw the game and break it for the rest. Also, the game counts on players' honesty to function. And the best thing of all is that you're completely screwed playing a wolf if there's no boy and no sheep in the round.

I like logic thinking and deduction.
So it is my favor design. 
I would like to show some human being(lie,honest,trust) with these famous story.
You can play with children for teaching logic thinging or human being, or play with friends just for fun!
I hope you can enjoy it!

Played once. Nice deduction-game, cute-looking and enough to do and think about even on other players' turns.
Since players have different goals (based on their roles), usefulness of information differs for each player and this introduces quite a bit of randomness. But it's a short game and the deduction is still challenging, so I don't mind the randomness too much.

Nice deduction game. The idea that you have 2 identity cards and the higher one determines who you are is great.

Social experience game with an uncharacteristically (for the genre) large amount of deduction thrown in. The scoring scheme does not really work and is made even more useless by the very uneven scoring possibilities of different characters. The game can also be completely ruined by anyone misunderstanding anything or giving incorrect information, either by mistake or deliberately.

This was a surprise hit. Very good fun and I highly recommend playing the advance version. You probably should start by playing one game with the basic rules just to help you realise how much better the advanced rules are. This was a really good game and very enjoyable fun! Thanks Rachel!!!

Solid [thing=41114]Resistance[/thing]-like game, with hidden roles and players trying to pursue different targets. Recommended. Probably a bit easier to teach than [thing=41114][/thing].

Fun party game where you have to find out who's who by deduction, a genre I like. That's why I bought the game :D

One downside: 5 is the best number to play this game :s

A hidden role game that can create really nice puzzles, where real deduction is rewarded. But sometimes a player can just get lucky. 
Great art, and plays up to 8 players. Awesome.

Unfortunately even with the great art design and looks, this game wasn't much fun. I'd play Coup, The Resistance, or any of the Ultimate Werewolf versions before this any day!

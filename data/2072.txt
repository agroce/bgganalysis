Great company level system that suffered from poor aesthetics.  Bad cover, OK map and bad counters can turn off a potential player but this is a very clever design.  Very much worth looking for...it is the system I choose to use for my design on Market Garden.

A great game about division level combat during WW2, with innovative game mechanics (it was 1984).
Rules are simple and well written, with plenty of examples. (They look long but only half of the 64 pages rulebook actually contain the rules, the other pages introduce the scenarios.)

One of my old favorites. The lack of many printed scenarios certainly hurts, but the game is excellent and has a scenario generator, so that helps somewhat. I always though this game should have had expansions with more counters, scenarios and maps, alas what might have been...

The type of tactical game that has units getting disorganized, demoralized, disrupted, fatigued, etc. instead of killed.  I prefer step losses and units getting removed from the map, especially in a game about tanks.

RATING: 4
The chit pull activation breaks the idea of simulation for combined arms warfare since you activate by regiments of infantry or armor, not mixed forces.  Difficult to see how it represented combined arms warfare as the Germans practiced it, which is what it claims it is supposed to do.  The problem is that the German infantry and tank regiments are separate and thus usually don't coordinate actions, but often the soviet formations are mixed tank and infantry and thus inherently using combined arms with most chit pulls.  Very annoying.

RATING: 7
This was an amazing game when it came out and was clearly ahead of its time.  Rare that you played a tactical game at this scale on historical terrain, so that was something of a first.  Company-level games weren't easily found, so that was another.  But most importantly, the system was incredible dynamic and fluid through more than just a chit-pull activation system--the Command and Control aspects really did a great job of modeling the "fire brigade" aspect of 11th Panzer Division against its adversaries.  

This game sorely needs a graphical facelift akin to the Grand Tactical Series that it eventually inspired and a reissue.  I don't know who owns the rights to this game, but it deserves a revision in a new edition and a comeback into MMP's GTS!

It has an nice command systems that recreates both the chaos of combat and the ability of better commanded armies to adjust to chaos with the use of chits and decison points. However it has a flaw in that the forces are organized by their administrative units (German infantry regiment, panzer regiment) and not by the tactical units they fought with...the kampgruppe. As a result coordination between tanks and infantry was more diffilcult than it was historically..

I loved this system, the first one I played where the enemy player would quake when a recon unit rolled into sight, becauseit could spot for the artillery. Uusally in PB and PL they were just cannon fodder, here they get their just due. Great for solitaire play, it'd be a 10 but for the blah counters and lack of more scenarios.

RATING: 10
A great game, way ahead of its time. Brilliant rulebook that gives you numerous examples of play and decent counters and map. The only drawback is the lack of scenarios included. I'd have loved to see this system ported to other fronts and battles, a Bastogne game using this system would be excellent! I know that Devil's Cauldron has used a modified version of this system, but I'd love it if they put it out just for specific local battles. Oh well...

Finally took this out of the box about 18 years after purchase (10 of which it spent in storage).  My interest had been rekindled bt the good reputation the game has, and the fact that it is being used in some newer games.

At this point, the evaluation is preliminary, but I'm a bit underwhelmed. There is a lot of good stuff in there (love the fog of war concepts, the notion of concentrated fire), and the game has an intriguing scale that makes division-sized battles quite manageable.

However, I'm less enamoured of the chitpull system here than I thought I'd be, even though I'm a dyed-in-the wool chitpull fan all the way back to Across 5 Aprils. There just doesn't seem to be much of a feeling of the OODA loop that the best tactical systems out there (such as Tank Leader or TCS) generate at platoon scale. Yet, one would assume that by going up in scale, those effects are regimental/division command level would be [i]more[/i] pronounced, not less.  So this may be a good game and better than the hopeless crop of 1970s games without any command control systems, but perhaps not quite as good as I thought. Will play more to figure this out.  

Finally, as others have pointed out, that the Germans activate by regiments and so separate out infantry and tanks misses one of the key advantages of the German approach during the war.  A major gaffe.

RATING: 8.5
Great game.  Chit pull system with a twist.  First you can purchase extra chits for your regiments so they get extra actions in a turn...Second, you can use command points to trump the chit pull and immediately activate certain particular units.  

Rich combat system too, and rules book has great examples of play.

Chir river battles are interesting, but I wish they would have expanded this with some other battles & maps.

RATING: 8
This is one of my favorite system for the scale (company level) , although it's likely too complex and the situation too dry for non wargamers. Really shows the strength of infantry,as opposed to most other games at this scale where the tanks roll. The counters are of good quality, although 'unsexy', and the map is not a beauty.

Edit: having recently (finally) gotten a copy of Eastern Front Tank Leader, I'd have to say that its system is better than Panzer Command. I still like this one, but compared to the structured commands in EFTL, the system here (based on chit draws, with some command superiority factored in) seems too random. Still better than most games at this level.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Innovative and fun. I love the way the fog of war and importance of command are abstracted--very effective, making for a rewarding gaming experience. If you're addicted to the "old school" Side A move/shoot, Side B move/shoot mechanic, this game will either infuriate you or open up your mind to exciting new possibilities. The semi-unpredictable turn order (chits are drawn to activate units, with limited command points available to influence turn order), allows for interesting solo play. The best effort by Victory Games outside of Ambush!

NOT for trade, don't ask.

Decided to get a copy on eBay.  Sort of like a poor man's version of Panzer Blitz. Map centers on an area near the Chir River including "Sowchos" the Soviet State farm, where lots of tank battles had been fought during the Stalingrad encirclement. 

Comes with a detailed 60 page rule book. Rules for LOS were vague. The single blind rules (defender hidden) with written plotting are recommended for two players. System does work well for solitaire. 

I gave it "6" because it is limited as a system, unlike Panzer Blitz.

RATING: 9
Quite a clean and lovely game system, few rules questions once one gets the hang of the system.  Concentrate Fire is rather fiddly, so prefer to play without it.  MMP's _The Devil's Cauldron_ moves the system to the western front.  OK, the box art is not too lovely.  TDC is a great improvement on that score (map-wise, too)!

RATING: 8.5
Deserves to rate 10 for these reasons: (1) The most elegant system I've ever seen to model differences in troop quality and lower-level command.  The Germans can beat the more numerous Soviets even with inferior tanks because they can float like a butterfly and sting like a bee.  (2) Accurate and quick combat system.  (3) Good line-of-sight rules, which are a typical bugbear of tactical games.  Doesn't get a 10 from me because it's limited to one map and a few scenarios, a couple of which are completely unbalanced.  It's a dirty shame that Victory Games let this system die while West End released three games in the inferior (IMO) Tank Leader series.  I'm glad that Adam Starkweather has revived it for his Market-Garden game.  (BTW, I've never met Mr. Starkweather.)

I remember being immediately impressed with the opening scenario, as it demonstrated how difficult it was for armor to deal with infantry that was dug into defensive terrain.  I appreciate the research that went into it, and I always enjoy playing tactical encounters on historical maps.  On the other hand, the chit system basically precludes combined arms tactics, which means it fails to simulate what it is that made the Germans so successful.

If you need more senario, Use the maps,OofB,senario settings of Stand & Die(GDW) and SS panzer : Blood bath at Kursk(XTR).These two games have the same scale to PC(VG).PC(VG) have senario generation section in the rule,I think.(If you made a new senario,Please upload it.)

This is an excellent tactical armor system that was overlooked (because of bad cover artwork?) by gamers. Company sized units with 500m hexes. It used drawn chits and command points to activate units/formations.  Germans get two activation chits per command thus move/fight twice per turn and the Russians one to simulate German tactical flexibility. Unit cohesion was a big factor in battle.  
Eric Smith (the designer) has also included some great guidelines for solo play (like recreate the No Retreat Directive from Hilter), which IMHO can apply to many two player wargames that have no specific solo rules.
As a neat bonus, a T-80 and Leopard 2 counter were included in the game so that you could see how they stacked up against WW2 era tanks.
Now the system is adapted to the making of "Devil's Cauldron", a clear approval of this great play system.
No. 2 in the biggest mistaken trash list.

An interesting concept that just doesn't work for me. The game totally lacks tension (except maybe in the end-game) and player interaction, and feels more like a puzzle than a game (which may be a plus for certain people). "Tetris" this is not.

Create connected groups of 5 or more symbols: circles, Xs and circles.  Score groups x occurrences in groups.  Symbols and positioning generated by dice and manipulation. Great little closer in the Take It Easy mold.  More tactical with two, but like TiE, can be played with more than four with additional sets.  Unlike TiE the final tiles/rolls are not so luck dependent.  Highly recommended.  Re-rated from 9.  Always expect to enjoy this gem.  (Two sets owned.)

A super fun roll and write game that has spatial elements also. You roll the 4 dice and arrange them into a Tetris like shape which everyone has to write onto their board (Dice have X's, O's and triangles). Get points for groups of like symbols (but at least 5 symbols in the group). This has gone over well with everyone I have played it with. Also works very well as a 10 minute solitaire exercise.

Cute tetris-like, pattern-building, abstract game.  It feels average overall, but it is a light 20-minute filler that works for non-gamers too.  

The goal is to make groups of 5 or more of the same symbol (preferably multiple groups) on a 7x7 grid.  The trick is that your score depends on both the number of distinct (separate) groups that you created for that symbol as well as the total number of times that you successfully used that symbol in groups of 5+.  In general, it seems best to fill the inside part of your grid first and leave the outside open (otherwise you might end up with dead spaces in the middle).

Note:  The rules are intentionally ambiguous regarding whether player boards should be public or private... it's up to the players.

RATING: 7.5
Smashing wee filler which reminds me of Take It Easy as it is 'puzzley' and everyone is affected by the same variable each round but very quickly ends up with very different end results - though otherwise the games are not at all similar.  

While the same game could have been produced with more or less dice and a bigger or smaller board the production version hits just the right length for this weight of game as always seems to tend to finish just before you want it to - nicely judged.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A neat entry into the multi-player solitaire puzzle genre.  You roll some dice with shapes on them, organize the dice into a tetris shape, and then fill in that formation of shapes into your grid.  Keep doing this until someone's grid is full.  At that point, you basically score for large contiguous groups of the same shape.  That's really all there is to it!

Good game if you're into stuff like Take It Easy, Wurfel Bingo, Cities, etc.

Simultaneous action puzzler that also works great as a solo game.  Fill in the 3 symbols on the dice (rolled into groups of four).  Make your groupings too large and you lose the advantage of the multiplier given for multiple groupings.  Make them too small (less than 4 of the same symbol in a group), and that group doesn't score at all.  Fun little filler - recommended!

It's another puzzle type game with a small geometric shape component. Allowing part of the shape to be off the board is good, but the AP can be fairly significant for a game of this type. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game, but Take it Easy, High Score, and Fits are all better games.

Mosaix is a nice little game.  It's much more like Take It Easy than like most dice games.  I enjoy it more than Take It Easy, because here the players have some control over the "tile" that everyone will be playing each round.  You roll the dice, then arrange the symbols into any configuration that you like.  Then everyone records that pattern of symbols, rotated in any of the four directions, on their personal grid.  You're trying, basically, to create as many groups of 5 connected same-type symbols as possible on your grid.

If you have deep thinkers that are going to study their opponents' boards and then choose their dice configuration to hose them, then you might consider a house rule of turning your board face down after each round.  Otherwise, I doubt the game would be enjoyable at that pace.

Mosaix is designed for up to four players, but is easily playable with more.  Purchase of a second copy expands the game to eight players, but all you really need is a pen and paper for the extra players.

RATING: 5
In the Qwixx/Traxx constellation of "make the best of the semi-random input you get while filling out your scoresheet". Which, is it weird that that's a genre? Anyhow, this allows for a little more creative play than those two, but in turn that makes it swingier; you can do clever things that just don't pan out in ways that are a little cold or boring, as opposed to just "not all gambles win".

one of my geekbuddies mentioned this as being one of his favorite games in the past three years. So, when I was making an order, I threw it in. It arrived and it actually it the table quickly. It's an simple family game that in some ways reminds me of FITS. Roll dice and put them in a pattern and place that pattern onto the board. I played it twice and found it some what enjoyable. But, unfortunately I've only played it with my 9 year old. While she understands and can play the game, it seemed that I had a huge advantage playing the game. It would be interesting to see how it plays with my older kids. I've currently rated it a 6.5

Jun10:

There's actually a lot of skill here.  The scoring system works very very well.  You want as many groups of 5+ as you can.  But a group of 4 scores nothing.  And you don't want two of your groups to bleed together.

You end up really puzzling your board together just like a "Mosaix".

You do need to watch out for some AP though.  It would be very possible to get all caught up in what you're doing and take bloody forever.

RATING: 6
The rules are very easy, one player rolls 4 X-O-D sided dice, groups them together forming a pattern and all players have to draw that patern in a free spot of your 7x7 grid, forming as many groups of 5 similar symbols as possible. The number of groups provide the points multiplier for that symbol.

I would say the game keeps you interested during the 20 minutes a game lasts. The best feature is that you have plenty of options and decisions to take. Otherwise, the game is a light filler that will feel like a solo multiplayer. Not challenging enough for gamers and maybe a nice fit for causal players, but sadly, the player count is quite reduced for a filler. There are many better fillers out there.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
First impression (5 players): Game only supports up to 4 players but can be played with piece of paper easily. Actually here less players is better since with more the only big choice in the game, how to organize dice, is under your control only 1/X times per round. I kind of like the idea but it is still pretty boring and eventually pretty much up to luck how those few critical rolls (of other players) match your board. Probably best as a 2-player since there it still makes sense to optimize dice against the other player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.95
Excellent little game with a little meat behind it! Wonderful to play solo or with more players...and so simple! The rules can be learned in 5 minutes and you are playing the game! 

The game feels a bit like FITS in that your player board begins in a different configuration as everyone else's board...similar to FITS when each person draws a card for their beginning piece. Also, as you play Mosaix you are fitting your dice rolls into the grid. Such a great game!

TRY Jan/10: quick light game, but I felt it might have a short replayability life, as once you get how to take advantage of using partial roll results, then you could do really well all the time.  I could be wrong, of course, but that's my gut feeling on this.

A neat little filler that suffers only from being a bit multi-player solitaire (like FITS). You roll four dice with Xs, Os and triangles on them, position them into a Tetris shape and then everyone draws the pattern onto their own grid. The scoring system is interesting as you want to make as many distinct areas of 5 matching symbols as possible. It’s quite difficult to avoid making a giant clump of matching symbols, which doesn’t score as well

Ok roll-and-write, but not great.  The way the active player gets to arrange the dice spatially to dictate how they can be placed on the paper by all players is quite interesting.  We play that you don't look carefully at opponents' papers when doing this or it kind of ruins the fun.  Ultimately, since you have to wait for the player to arrange them and can be annoyed when they arrange them badly for you, this game lacks the quick, pure fun of many of my favorite roll-and-write games like Qwixx, Qwinto, Noch mal!, and Extra!

Fairly straightforward exercise in fitting tetris-type of shapes into a grid. Each player sets four dice with three different symbols (circle, square and triangle) in turn and arranges them in a shape which matches his/her grid the best. Everybody tries to arrange the symbols so that there are sets of symbols where there are at least five symbols connected. In scoring each the number of sets is multiplied with the number os symbols in the sets and whoever has highest total wins. Logical and fast but somewhat mechanical.

Mosaix -- 

Played once; three-player.

Nice and light.   

Mosaix seems reminiscent of [thing=25294]Take it to the Limit[/thing] to me, but without all the set up.  It can drag a bit while players determine how to orient the pattern on their board.  Oddly, I think that speeding things up would decrease the enjoyment. Rushing leads to haphazard patterns which invalidate the game.  Players need to take enough time to not only build potentially useful patterns, but also to feel connected to what they're building.

So while it [i][b]is[/b][/i] a light game, it [i][b]does[/b][/i] require time.

Just try to not overstretch your friends' patience, and you've got a rather relaxed filler.

Interesting game where you take turns rolling dice and orienting them in a way to allow placement into a grid to optimize formation of groups of like symbols. The game ends at the end of the round when a player no longer place to play. For each symbol score VP = (# groups size>4) x (total area covered by those groups). The player with the highest sum wins.

Interesting, but not as much fun as the other Easy Play games -- would much rather play Finito! or Big Points.

RATING: 7
[Schmidt Spiele 2009 edition] {Dice filler; Bingo; scalable} Mosaix is a fun dice game.  This is more like an advanced "Bingo", but this is different enough from "High Score" to make it into my game collection.  This game can be quite brain-teasing and players need to have good pattern recognition skills (esp. they have to rotate the dice patterns in their mind).

A typical game runs around 20 minutes, which makes it a good filler.

Only played solo so far, but the interesting point about the multi-player version is that the active player has to arrange the dice (tetris-shape style) after rolling them - to create a shape that works for himself, but is awkward for his opponents.

Mosaix takes the puzzle game and adds a wonderful new component: luck.  I love the aspect of having a bit of control and then none as turns move around the table.  It's a very thinky game for something so simple.


Sold in my game auction 6/2011.

A very quick, clever and engaging filler that playes in about 15 minutes. Mosaix far exceeded my expectations and is a game I hope to add to my collection at some point.

Mosaix is a nifty spatial filler.  The rules are straightforward and you're done in 20 minutes.

Quick fun game. Using pen and paper, you can play it with more players. One player rolls symbol dice, then all players must write the symbols on their board. Due to this simultaneous action, there is hardly any downtime (except waiting for the slowest player). You score depending on the arrangement of symbols on your board. A little bit of Tetris feeling, similar to Take it Easy.

It's a game of rolling dice to generate a piece and trying to fit it onto your sheet as best possible. To some extent not helping the other people matters too. Quick and light puzzle game without ubongo's time pressure.

I've found this to be uniformly a hit with casual gamers and couples whenever it has come out. In fact, I've bought several extra copies to give out as gifts.

When I saw this game and read the rules I knew I'd hate it. But it's not that bad. The spacial recognition aspect is something that's going to keep me from pulling in the lead on this game ever but I think I'll always fare pretty well.

Played a couple of solo games. Fun little filler. I think this will be multiplayer fun goodness as well.

Two player game is also not shabby, though a lot less interactive than I expected. This is a very solitairesque game. Still, not a bad game at all.

Love this filler. Just don't undergo analysis paralysis

A very quick "filler" game, when you have, like 10 minutes to play a game.

(11/09)  After 1 4p game.  A fun filler that Dale had been singing the praises of in his BGN column that I got to play with him.  7 x 7 grid, d6 with 3 symbols, group them in batches of  or more, scoring.  That's it.

The solitaire game is a nifty little puzzle to solve.  What you do on your move is determined by what you roll, which means that it can get a little random, but the way you arrange your patterns on your board have a lot to do with what's possible on a given turn.  It's not as interesting as, say, Roll Through the Ages as a solitaire game, but it's not bad, either.  The multiplayer game is almost identical, except that the arranging of the dice isn't always in your control.  Luckily, being able to build so that you can toss dice on the outside of the board is useful, as well as unlimited.  Not bad.

someway original, fun to try but too shallow and if u really wanna play to win, u should spend hours seeing other's tables, leading to analysis paralysis

Like having your tonsils out.  Painless with properly administered anesthesia, but once it's done there's no need to do it again.

Nice dice, abstract, crayon game. I like the idea that the roller gets to align the dice to their liking.

A quick filler game of spatial awareness and forward planning. There are dice and yet it doesn't feel luck-based - the rolls affect everybody and you make your own opportunities and set your own risk level through your placement decisions. Lovely dry-wipe boards.

Certainly a very light and fun way to pass time. Well rated as coffee shop game with wife (that gives it a 1/2 point in ratings). Fun pattern recognition game.

Neat Tetris-like filler with some interesting scoring mechanics.  Plays relatively quick, able to accommodate a lot of people with multiple sets and probably good with non-gamers.  However, ultimately it's too similar to the rest of the solitaire, build-your-own-board style of games.

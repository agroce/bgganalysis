Well we had heard positive things and it was nominated for an Origins award so we thought we would try it out while we were at Origins. It played fine enough but I felt there was very little to it. The "big book" was pretty disappointing. It didn't even offer much flavor text. The challenges/curses were all exactly the same - 4 of one color. We didn't find it very engaging.

A cooperative game in a magic universe. Has tendency for alpha gamer (a single person sees a strategy and gives order to everyone) since the hands are open and you only have a few choices each turn. However, upgrading and selecting your power is cool, and you really feel like you are a magician.

Finally broke this out. Played two player, won on the very final turn, so that was nice.

Looking forward to trying this out with more players.

The instructions suffered a bit, mainly because every component has some thematic name that made it a bit tough to follow along.  Once we got past that initial understanding barrier, everything else was pretty straight forward.

A fun deckbuilder, with lots of cooperation and planning.  While using some of the "challenges" from the FAQ and Errata, we found a great balance for 2-player games.

There are more ways to help out the team than pandemic, as there isn't a focus on location or movement, which is a big bonus in my book.  More interaction is better!

On a down note, Frost Mirror seems way too strong.

1st play: Not usually a fan of co-ops but I enjoyed my play of this.  Very puzzle-y and encouraged a lot of discussion and cooperation.  The theme is cool and it was nice to play a co-op that wasn't the Pandemic/Forbidden Island mechanic.  The spells were a little underwhelming for level 3s, but perhaps with more players they would be very useful.  Curious to see how the second play changes our approach to make them more useful.

2nd play: Played this back to back around 4 games today and it continues to be a lot of fun.  Light-hearted and fun, could easily be called Harry Potter the board game.  We managed to build some very cool combos and it went very smoothly with 3 players as well as with 2.  Something different and fun.

Played this 2 player with my wife and we enjoyed ourselves playing the game. Nothing in this game really stood out as being great and I feel like the win condition comes down more to the last monster that comes out than how well you play the game. We did have a fun time and will play it in the future since we know how to play and I really like the artwork but I find the gameplay very average.

Big Book of Madness is a highly cooperative game; you all succeed together or fail together. You need to resource manage individually and as a group as you try to defeat each monster by destroying curses and maintain a balance of madness.

It's truly a game that requires strategic thought, a willingness to cooperate, and balance between attack, healing, and support. As the game progresses it can become stressful as players don't have the necessary resources or the wrong player has all the resources, etc. Definitely not a game for players looking to avoid stress. However, if you like being on the edge of your seat, your heart racing, and mind reeling with different possibilities; then this is the game for you.

Plus, there are multiple levels of difficulty that can add to the game experience.

Interesting little co-op game.  While it looks like it is aimed at younger gamers with the art style and theme, it plays well and generates some good group discussion about how best to utilise one's cards.  It's gone down well with my game group so far.

While I personally didn't read the rules to this (someone else was reading them aloud to learn the game), they seemed like a bit of a mess. The game itself isn't that interesting; there's teamwork in this game but it feels almost tacked on and the game itself just feels flat and unimpressive. Nothing about this makes me want to play it again. What strikes me as odd about this game is that you can lose to every monster prior to the final one then defeat the final one and win, but beating every one except for the final one is a loss. The building of the central book itself was the only thing remotely interesting here.

RATING: 8
A tough but not impossible coop with deck building and hand management, The Big Book of Madness is a fun game with not a lot of components or mechanisms to bog it down. Set up takes just a few minutes and turns typically get resolved quickly ( at least in the 1st few rounds of the game). Essentially you are students at a magical academy who have gone where you shouldn't have (naturally) and opened this terrible book releasing monsters. And now it's your responsibility to get them back into the book. You do this by matching 4 different symbols on curses released from the book with cards in your hand. But you aren't going to have enough to do it on your own. So you must use spells and the support of the other players to break the curses and defeat the monsters. But each round they fight back by causing you to discard cards, loose cards from your deck or receive Madness cards that clog up your deck and could possibly cause you to lose the game. It is a puzzle to solve and a puzzle that becomes more difficult with each round. AP can set in during the later rounds as you try your best to min-max the symbols on your cards to match and dispel the curses. This would rate a 9 if the theme was integrated into it just a little bit more but it does become very abstract as you play.

RATING: 8
This is one of the better "new" co-op games out there.  I would not suggest playing this with only two players just because I have yet to lose with two players.  The more players the more depth to this game.  Highly recommend this one.  Only downside to this is that I wish it had more varying curses in it.  Basic curses all require four of one color to get rid of.  It would have been nice if they switched that up just a little bit.

RATING: 8.4
Really interesting hybrid of deck building with co-op, I love that you have spells you can cast and then you can also purchase better spells. Variable character abilities. The Curse track is really tense, as is the mechanic of gaining Madness cards and possibly losing when you've got a hand of six. Also there is a fair amount of variation just in the box with how you set up the Big Book (different pages and cover monsters), what spells you draw for the market, different characters' abilities, and then of course by shifting the Difficulty or using one of the even tougher modes included. Add to this amazing artwork and you've got one of the best 'magic school' games out there alongside Argent: The Consortium and Seasons. Tons of bang for the price.

This game didn't do much for me. It was simpler than I would have liked and the decisions weren't that interesting. The theme is good, but theme alone won't keep my interest. This would probably be a decent option as a family game for some people, but I think, even in that situation, the game would get stale very quickly.

Very clever coop card game with gorgeous artwork. A few rules should be better explained and mode more clear in the rulebook (eg.difference between support and support pool and its uses). It scales rather well with the different players due to the use of the support pool. Very glad to have bought this game and cannot wait for expansions of new characters and monsters/curses. The game cries out for more.

This is such an amazing co-op game that has players really work together 'solving puzzles', bannishing curses and resealing the big book of madness. Each player acquires their own element cards and magic spells, which allows them to speicialise in unique and powerful ways. This is a thinky and challenging game, but oh so rewarding when you win!

I like the game, but don't care for the backstory very much.  It doesn't make sense to me from a story perspective that it doesn't matter if you let monsters 1-5 go without defeating them, but you have to defeat the last monster in order to win the game.  This would be much more acceptable if the Book of Madness is a test and that the final monster is the final exam and true test, with all other monsters before the final offer ways of boosting your overall grade/score.  Fail the final, you fail the test, even if you happen to defeat all prior monsters.  Pass only the final you get a C, one additional monster and you receive a C+.  Pass the final, and defeat 2 additional monsters, you get a B, 3 you get a B+.  Pass the final, and defeat 4 additional monsters, you get an A, 5 an A+.

I could see how people could be turned off from receiving a grade, but they are supposed to be students of magic anyways and thus my proposed backstory fits a lot better.

I like this game a lot because it really does require cooperation between players if they are to succeed.  While the game supports up to 5 players, I suspect that 3 is the sweet spot for this game.  With 3 not everyone can specialize in one color and nothing else.  It will still require a good amount of cooperation as there will still be a color that won't be mastered by any one player.  2 players plays quite well and offers the greatest amount of deck building.

The game is perfectly suited to being played solo, but requires the person to play more than one character.  I suspect most people that attempt to play this game solo, will do so by playing 2 characters at a time.

There are better co-op deckbuilders out there, but just going by looks this is one of the best looking.  It is a game the kids can play and enjoy.

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: This game is an interesting cooperative puzzle. The theme is mostly portrayed in the fabulous artwork and not the game's mechanisms. The puzzle, how to defeat the curses cast by 6 released monsters, is a tough one to solve and can be tweaked for different difficulty levels. The mechanisms excel at facilitating cooperation between players. If played with open hands, alpha players could run the game so my suggestion would be to play with closed hands but allow for lots of table talk. The deckbuilding aspect of the game is interesting in that you don't necessarily want to thin your deck or cycle through your deck too quickly for fear of accumulating too many madness cards. All in all, this is one of my family's few cooperative games but I can see a place for it in my collection for quite some time.

Maybe too unforgiving to be called a family game. The level of interactivity is sky high due to the unrelenting curses being thrown at your team, but is still alpha-gamer prone. I need some more plays with it for sure, but as far as tough co-op games go I might give Ghost Stories a go before I bring this back to the table. Also earns a ding component wise as the board and cards warp the minute they're freed from the box.

A close one bought this game because it looked nice.  For a game that we knew nothing about, it turned out fine.  It's a simple and friendly game where you have to work in co-op to get through it.  

After a couple of games, I can say that it's fun and it requires some strategies sometimes, though it gets repetitive.  Multiple elements were added to make it a little bit more random/complete, but it does not work.  My second playthrough was already repetitive, even if I used a different character and that I tried to use different abilities.  It's essentially always the same mechanics and there are no battles nor true use of abilities in this game

+ easy setup
+ short games
+ interesting core
+ forces co-op and communication
+- very simple game, yet the rulebook made it hard to understand (at least the French version)
- repetitive
- the game mechanics give you the illusion of customization and the illusion of battles against monsters, when in reality you just need to play the matching cards and nothing more.  Do not expect mage battles

(KIDS) A decent cooperative game that I've only played with two players and I think may be a bit better with more.

I have concerns about that.

Cool theme and great artwork.  Unfortunately the gameplay is dull.  Lots of planning ahead -- too much planning ahead.  Once the monster is revealed there is a ton of discussion around who should reserve which cards and what actions people should take.  I am sure some people enjoy that, but I find tiresome.  If you are a fan of puzzle-style co-ops like Ghost Stories, you may enjoy this game.

To be honest, I am not very good at tactical thinking. Getting to grips with this game required playing solo with one elementalist, but once I got the idea, I really enjoyed the game. Where I thought it was impossibly difficult at first, I now see it as quite fair.

I can imagine the game being a lot harder the more players there are, but it should be nice with two players and it works like a charm when playing solo.

Egyszerű, de nagyszerű. Kevesebben ismerik, de az egyik legnehezebb coop játék számunkra. Legnehezebb fokozaton szinte lehetetlennek tűnik megcsinálni, de biztos van olyan akiknek már összejött. Magyarul is megjelent a napokban a játék. A játékosok összejátszása, közös gondolkodása nélkül nagyon kicsi az esély a győzelemre. Kevés tartozékból áll a játék de a maximálisat hozták ki belőle.

Coop which relies very heavily on cards special abilities. Lots to like here, such as the possibility of acting out of turn, the common card supply, the impending doom of the madness cards.

You're shuffling and destroying curses and supporting each other, and you think you're doing a great job!  You've customized and optimized your deck, gotten a few spells, and you're confident with your early successes. Then comes those multi-element curses...and slowly you see the madness in your deck grow...and then you die on the last round because your optimized deck can't generate a hand of one element of each colour that you need to win.

Fabulous game :D.

Would have preferred more flavour text or story, especially on the curse cards. Enjoyed collaborative aspect of the game as all players were fully engaged at all times.
Liked the strategy of when to upgrade vs doing the curse, or taking a hit from the monster to gear up.

I enjoyed my one play, but it went longer than I'd like, and midgame felt very same-y; I think I'd prefer the Medium-Sized Book of Madness. I also feel like with larger player counts I'd have had way too much downtime.

On the positive side, the art is great, and I found the spell combos really interesting.

Takes a few plays and then it really starts to flow. Plenty of room for player conversation and interaction. Definitely takes a team effort to win this one! JUST DON'T FORGET: when you destroy a curse, you receive a (2) resource card as a reward. There is NO visual reminder and you will get crushed if you forget!

Awesome as a team or solo game. Not quarterback/alpha inducing as card draws keep things random. A play once a month kind of game.

Issues from 5 solo plays, winning 3 losing 2: 
Wins from 1) building diverse mana pool/clearing curses followed by 2) buying best shop spells and 3) eating no more than 1-2 out of 6 monsters. Penultimate monster is good to tank to prep for final boss.
Losses from 1) specialisation in few areas of mana and 2) absence of shop spells.

Further thoughts: clearing madness and adding support cards before last round highly important

Felt in love with this game: great artwork (comic style), cool theme, (for me) perfect combination of deckbuilding and coop, tens and challenging gameplay (we lost all the three games). Highly interactive so there is no downtime and many way to combine options in order to defeat the curses. It has high replayability: want to find a way to beat this game and to try new strategies / way to deal with given constellations. Thank you for this great game (couldn't wait for a german version and couldn't resist the fine promos).

First impression playing 4-player game:

Pretty simple mechanics and easy to pick up for newbs. Seems a very good light-weight gateway game (as long as the cartoony magic + cthulhu-ish monsters aren’t a turn off), though it’s not a short game.

Could potentially have alpha player problems, though we didn’t in our game as everyone’s ideas were given fair contemplation and discussion. I can see for younger players, this would be a great co-op game to develop strategic thinking of how to use unique player characteristics to the team’s advantage.

Would definitely play this again and suggest it.

Nagyon jó, coop játék. Sikerült megint kitörni a pandemic alapmechanizmus bűvköréből és érzetre is egészen mást alkotni. A grafikák lenyűgözőek. 
A legkoopperatívabb játék, amit eddig láttam, mert nagyon sok minednt tehetsz a többi játékosért, a többi játékot körében is akár. Folyamatosan figyelni kell, gyakorlatilag nincs én köröm, te köröd. Ilyet eddig csak realt time játékban láttam. Egyedül az újrajátszhatóságról nem vagyok teljesen meggyőződve, mert ami random a setupban, az nem hiszem hogy túl nagy változatosságot adna, illetve a karakterek képessége elég gyengének tűnt, alig használtuk őket.

I like this game a lot, I tend to like co-op puzzly stuff. This is a good game if you like things like Pandemic where everyone can work together to find the best things for people to do. Tons of variability between the different monsters, player powers, and spells that come out each game. Probably not great if your group has an alpha gamer problem.

I have not played it yet, but it looks to me more of a cardgame, the board is not really that necessary. It could have been published cheaper as a cardgame.
Played a solo game. I quite like it. It is my first deck building game, so it takes a few plays to optimize my play. It amazes me the replayability of the game on different levels, characters, many monsters/order and that big amount of spells.
You can also make a lot of modifications to the set up and rules to easily make variations.

Klimaty Harry'ego Pottera, piękne grafiki, całkiem sporo kombinacji, choć w niektórych rozgrywkach zupełnie nie korzysta się z czarów. Świetna kooperacja, choć może wywoływać efekt gracza alfa. Trochę boli, że wydaje się prawie nie do przejścia, ale jeśli ignoruje się potwory poza ostatnim, może być za prosta. Przydałaby się korekta reguł zmieniająca znaczenie każdego potwora z osobna (może dodatek?), może wprowadzenie punktów zwycięstwa za pokonywane potwory.

Pretty solid. It goes a bit long for the gameplay involved, and seems better with 3+ than with 2 (to make all of the spells truly useful). It could also use more variety in curses... they mostly just add madness.
But the separation of the deckbuilding elements and spell building options is a lot of fun, and the tactical gameplay is great. You have tons of choices on each turn, way more than any other deckbuilder I've played, where I draw my hand and do what is obvious...

The Big Book of Madness is a fun and engaging co-op game for 2 players. The overall design is well developed and tested. We enjoy exploring the various strategies for strengthening our resources, and the varying wizard powers, spells, and curses should keep the game fresh for many plays. Decisions can be difficult; however, we don't find ourselves spending too long on each turn even though we are both prone to analysis paralysis. We often feel triumphant when we find a particularly clever way to reach a seemingly impossible goal. The theme is almost perfectly integrated with the mechanisms, the artwork and component quality are outstanding, and the rules are not too complex for us to remember and follow correctly. We think this game will be a long-term favorite.

This is a weird one. I've only played once, and I'm not sure I'd ever want to play again, as the game was long (longer than 90 min for sure) and I was pretty bored with most of the mechanics of the game - that is up until the last 30 minutes or so, when everything you've sewed bears fruit in a heady mixture of bitter, sour and sweet. The puzzle of actually trying to win the end game as a group after more than an hour of seemingly unimportant, almost arbitrary decisions was the most wonderful headache I've ever had. It was worth it for that, and was a singular game experience that I've not gotten anywhere else, and won't likely forget any time soon.

„A diákoknak tilos kinyitni ezt a könyvet!”
Elkerülhetetlen a párhuzam a játék története és Harry Potter világa között. Kíváncsi varázslótanonc (vagy ősmagyar érzelműeknek táltostanonc) kis diákjaink kinyitották a tiltott könyvet, hogy csak egy kicsit (oh igen, csak egy icuri-picurit) belekukkantsanak. Természetesen a könyv rémségei kiszabadulnak és nekik minden erejükkel összefogva fel kell venni a küzdelmet a válogatott szörnycsapattal és a könyv lapjain található átkokkal, hogy túléljék ezt a kalandot és visszazárják a kötetet.
A fentiekből kiderül, hogy kooperatív, azaz csapatjátékkal van dolgunk, méghozzá nem is a könnyen teljesíthető fajtából (szerencsére a játék előkészítése során 3 nehézségi szint közül a csapat tapasztalatának/kedvének megfelelően tudtok választani).
A játék szabályai egyszerűek (bár mindig van egy-két apróság, amire oda kell figyelni), előkészítése gyors. A választható nehézségi szintek mellett a kihívás a játékban szereplő varázslatok, kártyák és a játékosok által használt karakterek egyedi képességeinek leghatékonyabb alkalmazása.
A 6 fordulóban egy-egy szörny és átkok jelennek meg. Amennyiben időben nem sikerül legyőzni őket, negatív hatásuk érvényesül; ha sikerül, jutalmat kapnak diákjaink. Az utolsó fordulóban mindenképpen győzni kell ahhoz, hogy a csapat megnyerje a játékot.
A játékosok több akció közül választhatnak körükben: varázslataikat használják, átkokat törnek meg, támogatják a többieket, varázslatokat tanulnak meg, később kijátszható lapokat szereznek meg (azok a dobópakliba kerülnek) és őrület lapokat gyógyítanak magukon vagy másokon (másokon csak akkor, ha az egy játékos támogató helyeinek egyikén szerepel).
A rendelkezésedre álló 6 lap felhasználásával mindent nem tudsz végrehajtani, így a csapat érdekét szem előtt tartva kell cselekedned (ráadásul a szinte folyamatosan érkező őrület lapok is csökkentik a köröd végén felhúzható vagy a közösbe tehető lapjaid számát).
Egy-egy átok megtörésekor is kapsz jutalmat később kijátszható lapok formájában.
A variációt a játékban a különböző szörnyek, különböző átkok véletlenszerű kombinációja adja, plusz a játékosok egyedi képességei, valamint a négy elemhez kapcsolódó 3-3 megtanulható varázslat véletlenszerűsége.
A játéktapasztalat azt mutatja, hogy egyes karakterek képességei erősebbek/hasznosabbak és a varázslatok hatékonysága, felhasználhatósága is változó. Egy-egy jobb kombó létrejöttekor szinte élmény a játék, haladsz, mint meleg kés a vajban. Csak ne feledd figyelemmel követni az őrület lapok összmennyiségét, mert gyorsan fogy.
Összességében jó kis játék, kipróbálása ajánlott.

I really wanted to like this game. It's an entertaining theme but the implementation was less exciting. The book itself is a cool design item. But, while some of the spells were cool many had minimal use and were a waste of time and resources--not very well though out in my opinion. The deck building mechanism  and the set of  possible choices is the most simplistic I have seen. While this may appeal to light, family style gamers those who want strategy and tension their choice will quickly become bored. Also, I found that by the second play the game became too easy to beat. This was still true even when I raised the bar.

Good co-op deck builder. Lots of player interaction. Difficulty is a bit swingy due to the random draws of player cards and curses. Still, most randomness can be compensated for by using good play.
One negative is that there is no game play arc. Everything you do is to prepare for the last monster, but you don't really know what that will be until very late in the game.

Harry Potter and the Actual Consequences of Poor Decisions.

Bad things happen, and agency is there but somewhat limited; it can feel like there's no right decision - just a collection of wrongs. Really crying out for the 'cool down' period that makes Pandemic so great, where you can get ready for the next onslaught. Unfortunately, without that it can feel like you're an incompetent wizard who should never have been able to get hold of a book containing actual monsters in the first place.

I really like this game.  We found it quite difficult the first few times we played it.  Once realized that occasionally letting a monster go to spend a turn or two buffing up instead was a good strategy, we've been able to win more consistently.  Unlike a lot of other deckbuilding-type games, there isn't a lot of variety with the types of cards you can get, but it is made up for by the constant ticking clock.  You only have so many turns to prepare for the last monster and then it is over, win or lose.  Very clever mechanics and beautiful art.

Rating after two games with 2 players. I think the game gets harder with more people. We played on easy and normal mode (I and II modes on the board). The first game was a walk in the park, and naturally, after what we heard about the game difficulty, we thought we might have missed a few rules. But we didn't. We gave it another try with a harder level and, even if it was more tense, we easily managed to win. 

I definitely want to try with 3 or 4 players to see how the difficulty scales. Up? I hope so. I'll change my rating if needed then.

Co-op deckbuilder where your goal is to progress through a book of demons/monsters until you make it to the final page in which it's a win/lose situation to defeat the boss.

The theme is interesting but it feels like beating or losing to some of the bosses along the way isn't necessarily that rewarding as when you get to the final boss it's just a win or lose situation.

The madness mechanic is nice as it ties up your hand with cards that you can't really use so you're forced to have to do other things to get rid of them.

RATING: 6.75
Great theme and art. Only played once. I enjoyed determining how to manage my deck, purchase spells, and defeat the monsters. The color matching seemed to lack a little depth, in that every monster simply provides curses that require different color combinations to defeat - this was a bit dry and there could have been more here. With that said it was still fun to figure out the puzzle each monster presents, what cards should be put in support how can the players work together to destroy the most amount of curses in the right order. I'm hoping they tap into the true potential of the game with expansions.

Awesome. Random elements are places before decision points, making the players deal with them instead of gambling about results - this leads to smart moves and interesting, puzzly gameplay. Enough options that no one can be the alpha gamer. Also great theme and looks amazing.

It's fantastic. Art is great, theme's fun, turns are meaty and interesting and the game never sidelines the importance of communication and cooperation. Every player has to pay attention to the whole puzzle in front of them and what every other player can do. Only thing keeping it from going higher is the lack of theme from the monsters. Most of them just splash a little madness at you and otherwise act exactly like any other card. I get WHY they did that, mechanically, but...it does hurt the theme a lot. Also worth noting that while it doesn't bother ME, the game could be ruined pretty quick if anybody got too Alpha Gamer. Still a great game, though, and one that will likely be on my shelf for a good long while to come. 
EDIT: So, I guess I've been playing this wrong. When placing Curse cards, you DO NOT skip the second "3" space in the early round (despite what the rulebook seems to say). That being said, I will still be playing it that way as I think the game has a better difficulty curve that way.

Cooperative game, in which difficulty sharply rises during play. I've only played an easy level so far, in which the beginning was almost too easy, an in the end we didn't expect to meet so many difficulties. The most important thing is to have enough cards when they are needed, because quite often it happens that when others pass you their turns you spend all the cards and then have nothing to do on your turn. Deck building is often quite interesting, however there is not enough time to perfect your deck, because you need to use it at once. Part of the game is dependent on luck - monsters and their effects to the game vary quite a lot.

Kooperatinis žaidimas, kuriame sudėtingumas užauga staiga. Kol kas išbandžiau tik lengvą lygį, tai pradžia buvo beveik per lengva, o į galą nesitikėjome, kad bus taip sunku. Svarbiausia reikiamu metu turėti pakankamai kortelių, nes labai dažnai kai tau kiti perduoda išsileidi, o paskui nėra ką daryti savo ėjimu. Gan įdomi kaladės tobulinimo mechanika. Tiesa, priešingai nei Dominion, nėra pakankamai laiko tą kaladę ištobulinti, nes ją reikia iš karto ir naudoti. Dalį žaidimo lemia ir sėkmė - monstrai ir jų įtaka yra labai skirtinga.

The artwork is really nice in this game. There is a lot of luck to be able to win the game. If you get the right elements in time than the game seems to be very easy, but if you do not get time at the moment you need it a lot of bad things are happening. Until your almost blocked. If you do not mind the luck factor, than it is a very nice game.

The game is interesting and challenging, there the "fun" factor is a bit lacking. I played it with different groups, one really enjoyed it (newer boardgamers) and the other didn't (veterans). 

Although we usually lose our games (5/7), we won 2 games *too* easily. Also the game is not balanced at all : with fewer players, the game becomes incredibily easier.

Gorgeous game. Naïade delivers excellent work like always.
BBoM is a coop deckbuilding game where turns are tight, risks are to be taken and madness is just around the corner.
Plenty challenging even on the easiest setting.

Think it's probably best with three players? Hard to judge with only a single play. There are so many spells that go "any other player" or "all/X other players" that 2p feels slightly like you're shooting your own foot sometimes. On the other hand more players results in less turns to get your stuff rolling.

Ez egészen kellemes meglepetés, egy könnyed kooperatív kártyajáték gyönyörű grafikával, minőségi komponensekkel. Viszonylag sok opció van, tetszik, hogy a körünkben más bekészített lapjait is használhatjuk, illetve másnak is adhatunk akciólehetőséget, ettől elég más érzete van, mint a legtöbb kooperatív játéknak. Mindenféleképpen szívesen játszanék még vele, és bár az új árát túlzásnak érzem, nem egy rossz vétel szerintem.

Az első partit csúnyán elbuktuk, de a másodikban viszonylag simán nyertünk. Nyilván van szerepe a szerencsének, de szerintem tanulható a játék, és elég jól össze lehet kombinálni, hogy mit lenne célszerű végigvinni egy-egy játékos körében.

An interesting cooperative deckbuilder that feels a bit like Magic the Gathering at Hogwarts mixed with some other game that I can't quite place my finger on.

RATING: 7
Bit confusing in the beginning because the rulebook is not optimised. But once you get the hang of how the rounds and turns go it becomes a pretty fun game. 

Stuff we didn't get in the beginning
1) Why does it say "heal yourself" on the reference card when they mean "cure a madness from your hand" ? 
2) When do you move the round marker (Witch hat)? We eventually just did it the moment the book hit the resolve square. 

We won our first game. Being super efficient. Made me wonder if this game is too easy. But I guess it's because we play co-op games very often. I can see how for new players to co-op games this can be much harder.

The Big Book of Madness is a challenging co-operative game in which the players are magic students who must act as a team to turn all the pages of the book, then shut it by defeating the terrible monsters they've just freed.

Each player has their own element deck that they build during the game and use for several purposes, such as learning or casting a spell, adding a new element to their deck, destroy or healing a curse. Spells allow you to support your playmates, improve your deck, draw cards, etc. — but the monsters from the book fight back. Each comes with terrible curses that are triggered every turn unless you dispel them in time. They will make you discard elements, add madness cards to your deck, or lose spells..

After a video review, seems interesting but still very basic. The negotiation element with cooperation seems important, so I'll be curious to try the game out first to see how those social elements ends up working.

Else I could say it's a semi abstract puzzle game.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I found the game quite interesting with four but understand that the difficulty level is not equal across number of players. It is easier at the lower number of players and becomes increasingly more difficult as you rise in player count. The cooperative aspect of the game with the spells are interesting and there is a wide variety of spells/monsters that make each game quite different from the next.

Big Book of Madness I created a whole new award for you so that i could give you that award. I had such high hopes for this game based on the description of gameplay, the described setting, and the artwork. I am such a whore for good artwork, and anything like Harry Potter. When I finally got a chance to play the game it was extremely dull. The choices in the game are minimal, and you are only really managing four things throughout the game. Yeah each character is slightly different, but really those differences to amount to very much. Maybe we were taught the game wrong, but honestly the game is just not that very good.

RATING: 9
Requires a bit of fiddling with the rules to account for the player count. Default variant is too easy for a two player game. Once you hit the sweet spot, incredibly challenging and fun. Unlike traditional deck-builders you don't want to cycle through your deck quickly, as each cycle gets you a madness card. And you really have to co-operate to overcome the curses.

Bei diesem Spiel geht es darum Monster zu besiegen und für jedes hat man nur 5 Züge. Wer an der Reihe ist darf soviele Aktionen machen wie er Handkarten hat, man kann andere unterstützen, Flüche beseitigen, neue Zauber kaufen und und und.
Was mich an dem Spiel wirklich stört ist, dass es ein reines Tüftler-Spiel ist. Wer am Zug ist hat meisst nicht unbedingt die Wahl, denn die Gruppe entscheidet zusammen was gemacht wird und da gibt es meisstens nur einen besten Zug.
Es wäre ein sehr schönes Solospiel, aber für eine Gruppe an Spielern finde ich es sehr langweilig (Alpha-Leader Problem!).
Zugegeben, ich habe es erst einmal gespielt, aber ich fand es echt langweilig. Schade eigentlich, hatte mir viel davon erhofft.

A game that looks kids friendly and lightweight. It is actually fairly involved and takes a fair bit of planning.

I've really been enjoying this game a lot and the artwork and components are beautiful which I've found is common for Iello games. 

My only complaints are that the game is kinda fiddly with the tons of different cards that need to be sorted into different piles during cleanup, and the character powers feel really meh. 

I like the idea of asymmetric player powers but most of the characters have powers that are either very minor in effect or a complete non factor in the game.

There's definitely a need to cooperate in this game especially in the beginning when dealing with curses is difficult for one person, via placing cards off to support areas. Also, almost all the air-related cards are support-based. However, it just goes on for a bit too long for it's length, especially since the game feels more puzzly than thematic.

Special powers are neat but don't feel different enough from each other. More importantly is deck composition.

The madness aspect makes me wonder if it is worth it to cull your 1's from your deck, especially since you also don't get change when using your elements. If that is the case I am disappointed deck thinning isn't that important.

The deck building isn't bad but I think the use of elements makes it feel too much you are just doing stronger stuff rather than doing different stuff. Therefore the "true" deckbuilding seems to be more of the spells you buy. This gives less of a sense of progression since you only buy spells a few times per game, but the spells you do buy can be game changing.

I like that you don't necessarily need to deal with all the monsters, meaning there is added decision of when you should cut your losses and focus more on getting better elements/spells.

I have played this game four or five times. The art is beautiful and the theme seemed interesting. I usually play solo or with my 9-year-old girl. Having enjoyed Mysterium, The Battle of Hogwarts, Ex-Libris and Legendary, as well as Risk, Dominion and Crossover Crisis, I thought this would be a fun addition to our board games library. We found it frustrating and hard. The more we play it, the less we want to play it again. It's not my cup of tea.

Good cooperative game.  Good difficulty level (punishing the first time, then easy on the second try at "easy" difficulty level).  Played with five players, probably better with four players as recommended.  There was a little too much downtime with 5 players.  Played without 5 player variance and 1st player was the alpha leader.  Some AP, some alpha leader problems.  Really like the different roles and the art/theme, spells give it flavor.  Setup/takedown takes longer than I would like.  Victory was a little anti-climactic -- by doing so well through throughout the game the victory is almost expected in the final round.  Comparing it to Samurai Spirit, it is not as elegant in mechanics and speed, more clunky.  On the other hand, more variance and I find myself thinking about using different tactics on future plays (like trying to optimize decks).  Would like to try again with recommended 3 or 4 players.  Would like to see more variance (as in come from behind victory instead of a gradual and predictable march to victory or defeat)

Nice, but the general strategy seems a bit obvious (specialize in an element, ignore most Curses,) and the overall balance feels dubious (as expected from a game that is simple, but tries to have a variety of effects).

Reminds me a bit of Shadowrun: Crossfire with it's puzzly coop card play.  Just a tad bit lighter than S:C so it'll be a little easier to get the table.  You won't be getting slapped around quite as much either.

+Hand management & deck construction is integral to your success
+Clever support system for sharing cards among players
+Teamwork is necessary to win.  Not possible to build one deck that can deal with everything thrown at you.
+Spells available to customize how you approach each game.  
+Straightforward to play.  Few rules exceptions.
+Nice ramp up in difficulty.  At the beginning of the game you will feel like you're doing well, but once mid-game hits, it's on.  

-May run a bit long for its complexity level.  60 mins is the perfect length for this type of game, but this one can hit 90 mins with 4 players really taking the time to coordinate their turns.

Frequency of play: I could see this one getting regular play if you're into lighter coops.  This had enough gameplay for 5-10 games for me.  Long term, I'd much rather play Shadowrun: Crossfire.

Very fun co-op that requires close teamwork to win. The simple element mechanic builds into strategic decisions that force you to think several turns ahead, always keeping an eye on the final fight. Building the Grimoire is fun and keeps things fresh from game to game and I like that the male and female characters aren't just copies of each other.

really did not like this game which is a shame as I generally like co-op games.  This one just caused frustration and feelings of impotence.  We played 5 player and those of us in the end spots never had cards left by the time our turns came around so I spent nearly 2 hours not able to do anything at all.  Not a fun experience

FUN: flows smoothly, is interactive and looks incredible.

Bought from Board of Games Tustin Meetup.

One of my go-to games for now.  With the custom insert I made, setup is quick.  As such, this is one of the faster games we play now.  Every game is different with different characters, spells, and tome pages.  Lots of replayability.  I enjoy the streamlined deckbuilding experience here.

Due to the player turn order, I feel like this really shines at 2 - 3 players.  At 5, turn order never changes, which can be a bit awkward.

RATING: 7.3
I like cooperative games which I can win more than lose. The biggest problem is the 'alpha player' thing. Usually that doesn't happen (or I feel that it doesn't happen) and we all have an equal input. But sometimes there is a (usually new) player who needs to get the rules explained during the game and it happens automatically.

I also think it's a game with a lot of things going on (elements, madness, curses and monsters, hand management, deck building, skill building, healing, support, etc.). That makes it not quite a light game. It turns off some of my friends: they don't want to play it anymore.

[b][COLOR=#009900]Positives[/COLOR][/b]
[b]+[/b]  The highlight of this game is easily its co-operative nature.  Similar to Shadowrun: Crossfire, you cannot win this game if the players do not work together.  Playing solo using two characters was very manageable, and looking for combos between the mages and ways to help the other one are both keys to victory and where the enjoyment of this game shines.

[b]+[/b]  The presentation of this game is very nice.  From my memory, this was the first game I've played which was produced by Iello.  The artwork is excellent, colorful & vibrant.  The cards are all of good quality.  And I love the box size!  I wish more "big box" games came in this sized package.  It's approximately two-thirds the size of a standard Ticket to Ride square box.

[b]+[/b]  I did have fun playing this game.  And I know that's kind of a lame comment, but it is true.  I enjoy deckbuilders in general, and this certainly provides that experience.  And I felt truly excited when I got that win at Level III.  Sometimes just beating a game is satisfaction enough.

[b][COLOR=#CC0000]Negatives[/COLOR][/b]
[b]-[/b]  The game length is too long for what it provides.  My first session with four mages took well over two hours.  I was able to get it down to about 75 minutes with two mages, but that's still quite a long time for a straightforward deckbuilder.

[b]-[/b]  The game takes up quite a bit of space too.  There are cards all over the table.  Even with two mages, I decided to combine several stacks of cards into one to save some space.  I've got other games that I love that have the same "problem" (Core Worlds), so that's not necessarily a deal breaker, but I'd recommend one of those business card holders or something to help with organization.

[b]-[/b]  The biggest issue I have with this game is its ultimate goal.  To win, you only need to beat the final monster.  You'll face five prior to that, but win or lose against those does not matter.  Sure, "bad" things will result from losing, but "bad" really isn't that bad at all.  Most curses are things like, "All players discard one Fire element."  Or "Add one Water element token to all other curses."  But you know what?  If you're ignoring the monsters/curses anyway, who cares?!  Really, the only things you need to worry about before reaching the final monster is taking on too much Madness.  Keep that in check, and you should be fine when you get to the endgame.  You're goal is defeat one monster.  Prepare for it properly, and you should be fine.

[b][COLOR=#0000FF]Neutrals[/COLOR][/b]
[b]~[/b]  Let's talk cards.  How annoying is it to have four different sized cards?  It's brutal if you want to sleeve them!  If you aren't a sleever (which I wasn't a mere two or three months ago), then you've got no problems.  But if you are, that's a variety of purchasing you've got to invest in - sizes and shapes.  And I thought I'd have an issue with those mini Euro sized cards, but sleeving them actually helped, I think.  It makes them more tactile and easier to handle.  So, maybe they made the right call with the various card sizes, maybe not.

[b]~[/b]  At its heart, this game is a very straightforward deckbuilder.  You have a weak set of starting cards that do nothing but provide a combat/currency value.  Throughout the game, you'll want to buy higher valued cards and get rid of the smaller ones.  Pretty simple.  Enjoyable if you are into deckbuilders, but there is nothing exceedingly interesting or revolutionary about it.  There is also a second, albeit more minor, deckbuilding aspect to the game though - spells.  These are always in front of you and can be used once per turn.  And you'll be able to purchase newer, stronger ones over the course of the game as well.  This is where the co-op/combo nature of the game comes into play.  Spells are where the fun is at.  Too bad it couldn't have been incorporated into the main deckbuilding mechanism.

[b]~[/b]  Like most deckbuilders I play, there is no narrative here.  No story.  That doesn't really bother me though.  The game is more about its mechanisms than its overall narrative progression.  And it doesn't help that only the spells have names.  None of the mages or monsters are given any names or flavor text.  I'm not sure why.  It would have added some personality and personal connection to the great artwork.

[b]To summarize[/b]:  This game is really solid.  It's well produced, well designed, and enjoyable to play.  Ultimately, though, I don't think its worthy of being part of my Core collection.  Because it's mainly a straightforward deckbuilder, it really needs to do something interesting and challenging to be a keeper for me.  I've got plenty of basic deckbuilders that take much, much less time to play (Friday, Ascension, Star Realms).  I can see some minor comparisons to Shadowrun: Crossfire with its strong co-operative nature, but that game is so much more.  Every single card purchased matters and will help determine the outcome of the game.  In Core Worlds, the intense puzzle of the AI system is so AP-inducing, every choice you make is a balance of helping and hurting yourself.  And the sheer volume of entertainment and variety in Legendary: Marvel with its endless combinations of heroes, villains, and schemes is staggering.  When I've got games like that on the shelf, Big Book just can't reach those lofty heights.

RATING: 8
This is a great co-op! It's very simple to play, minimal book-keeping, yet has a lot of fun and sufficient depth to vary your builds and strategies. It also encourages working together, so you don't just do a "solitaire co-op" as you whittle away at the monsters you released from the book. 

However, we played our first 5-player 4 player game at Hard level and easily cleared all the monsters without even letting a single curse activate. Three of us didn't even have efficient builds and we still managed to clear the game far too easily.  We may have screwed upa  rule? Hopefully so because the game needs to be more challenging.

Absolutely fantastic artwork, love the theme and the way this game really encourages teamwork (which some co-ops fail to do). Extremely puzzley, for those who like that kind of thing.

A solid collective puzzle-solving game, raised by the stunning Naïade's visuals.
For someone who doesn't like deckbuilding very much, I'm surprised how much I enjoy this. The concept of support cards and borrowing actions to one another makes you really outthink the game.
However, it doesn't have much staying power. The games don't differ much one from another.

Based on one play: I liked it, mostly, but found the chain reaction of spells granting other players out-of-turn actions leads to headachy AP problems. I guess I don't like sitting there laboriously talking through turns with other players--I want them to just play thoughtfully and see what happens. (One reason the only co-op game I really like is Hanabi: you have to stay quiet for that one, and just hope someone takes the hint.) That said: very pretty game, and I liked the Harry Potteresque theme.

Great set of mechanics in a co-op game. It can be a brain burner which I didnt expect. Replayability seems high from having many spells set up randomly and the book itself.

This game took a few tries to really LOVE. Full admission, I bought it mainly for the artwork, as I am susceptible to those follies.

Since then, I have several friends who really enjoy me bringing this challenging game around.

RATING: 8
A pretty clever cooperative game. I really like how the actual book works. I do think certain spell combinations can make or break the game, and you really have to balance what types of mana each player goes for. The game is cool though. I like how you're controlling a pool of mana through deck-building. It kind of feels like Eminent Domain in this way, except that The Big Book of Madness is actually fun. Some of the spells aren't as interesting as I'd like, and it's annoying that the monsters don't have names, but otherwise this is one of Iello's better offerings.

Not really a children's game at all, even though the artwork might suggest it. I would say this is a pretty meaty game.
It has a Harry Potter feel to it as well as good Cthulhu mythos.

In this game you are working cooperatively to defeat the monsters that come up in the book.
There is a set of large book cards that actually open like pages in a book.
Each page is a round of play where you must defeat all obstacles.

But that's not all, this game also is a deck builder too.
You have a hand of cards that you begin the game based on the character you are playing and you also have a special power.
Your hand of cards will include elements of air, water, wind and fire cards.
Damage will come to your deck of cards in the form of madness cards. You will use these element cards to defeat the obstacles.

"Deckbuilding co-op with a nice vaguely Harry-Potter-ish theme. Very pretty, but the theme doesn't really come through much. I love the many mechanisms that allow players to actually directly work together (far more than most co-ops)."

What I like:
- Co-op with lots of mechanisms for players to directly help each other
- Beautiful art and nice components; nice theme
- With 2p, the length seemed fine (75 minute learning game)

What I don't like:
- Since the board folds up small, I wish the box were smaller
- I wish the mana cards were full-sized (the other cards could be smaller)
- Mostly plays like a symbol-matching abstract--no story or flavor
- Tracking turns and actions would be tricky with 3+ players
- The player powers are minor--stronger abilities would be awesome

I would put the weight around 2.5, higher than Pandemic, but not that heavy. Overall, it's about what I expected: Cute, solid, and a bit thinkier than my non-gamer wife would prefer. Good but not great, for me. It's a high 7 (almost a low 8).

Original rating (7.5) based on solo play only (I usually play with two characters). It's immersive and challenging, but you're so besieged that I find it difficult to get to the cool stuff in the game (i.e. the spells). Having played it in a group, its best and worst aspect emerge clearly: the true collaborative effort of playing the game is countered by the frustration of having a turn-less turn, where you basically have no cards (because you've spent them on someone else's turn, or, worse, been forced to discard useful cards) and can't even do anything to improve your lot (curing madness, buying a 2-element).

Very good co-op game. Since there's several encounters during a game you can win some and lose some before the big boss fight, and it's always close if you win or lose. A co-op that really has a great balance between success and failure. And it's easy to shift the level of difficulty as well if you're getting too good at it. 

Nice theme as well and great artwork!

1 play (at medium level), but is was realy easy: you simply clean out your deck from 1's and replace them with 2's and 3's and then you defeat the curses for the final monster.

A co-op- a beautiful- beautiful co-op but still a co-op. I didn't hate it. I liked it well enough. I think we played all wrong. I don't think it is good with 5p. Or alternate it so the starting player changes each flip of the page. Some neat ideas going on but didn't really stick with me. I will definitely try it again if given the opportunity but I won't own it.

A very co-operative co-operative game which employs the usual co-op set collection formula and does not seem to suffer from an alpha player (hands closed). Everyone enjoyed the game, and much discussion was provoked by the tight situations. A bit strange that there was no 'big bad' to change things up a bit at the end, but the round tracker deals with that, I guess. Wibble.

I tried it out at GenCon. I wasn't very impressed by the prototype I played. The game was somewhat deterministic and county. It was a lot of just spending time together puzzling out the best solution. It could use a little more risk-analysis or something for my tastes.

At first, it feels like you are mostly taking shots in the dark, upgrading cards and buying new spells, all without knowing what will be essential to the winning strategy.

This is a pretty standard cooperative game.  A little bit of sharing of cards/abilities.  A few waves of monsters then a boss.  Play/discard X cards to handle Y threat.  Choose to upgrade your deck, cull your bad cards or help others.

Nothing new here, but a fun game.  I'd be more than happy to play it again from time to time.

Great game to introduce deck building.  Very puzzle-y feeling and keeps the players engaged even in-between their turns, as players can be given extra actions during the active player's turn.

Zeit: 45-60 Minuten
Beste Spieleranzahl: 4?

Kooperatives Spiel, bei dem man Symbolkombintionen legen muss, um Monster zu besiegen. Etwas Deck-Drafting ist auch dabei, wobei man sehr eingeschränkt ist bei seinen Entscheidungen.
Das Spiel funktioniert für mich leider nicht gut, obwohl ich es mögen wollte, da es zu glücksabhängig ist. Je nachdem, welche Monster man zieht, könnte man das Spiel in den ersten Runden bereits gefühlt verlieren, da man sein Deck nicht verbessern kann, sondern es sogar zugemüllt wird. Somit hat es mir in zwei Durchgängen leider keinen Spaß gemacht, obwohl mir die Idee gefällt und die Gestaltung gelungen ist. Die Materialien hingegen sind leider eher fummelig und viel Stückwerk.

Przyjemna gra kooperacyjna w klimatach około Harry Potterowych. Trochę dziwne jest towarzyszące jej założenie, że o wyniku rozgrywki decyduje jedynie starcie z ostatnim przeciwnikiem, ale mimo wszystko i tak gracze lepiej wychodzą na zwyciężaniu na bieżąco. Jest tu trochę deckbuildingu, przy czym polega on głównie na dokupywaniu coraz to lepszych kart żywiołów, które to umożliwiają Ci korzystanie z czarów lub przełamywanie klątw. Można też uczyć się nowych czarów co bywa całkiem przydatne (zwłaszcza, że jeden z potworów zmusza graczy do usunięcia łącznie 3, więc warto mieć coś w zapasie).

It took a while, but the game finally clicked as to how the cooperation works: get elements into support, and then optimise their usage, alternating between dispelling curses and improving players' capabilities.

Once the run of losing results had been broken, the game began to shine as to how the players interact with it and each other.

Pretty unimpressed by this one. I like the idea of the Harry Potter-ish theme, but the theme just doesn't come through at all. Every monster you fight is approached identically. There is no variation AT ALL, as every monster just gives 3 random curse cards. Every curse card is handled in the same way. Again, no variation at all. You just collect 4 of the element listed and turn it in. 

Every player character only has minor differences, they all cast the same spells, they just have minor differences in starting elements, and a minor power that I honestly forgot was even an option most of the game, because I never needed it. 

The puzzle of the game is pretty bland, and easily worked out as soon as you see it. There's not much to get better at here over time. It's basically just a really really bland deckbuilder. It 

I'm not saying it's terrible, it's just....meh. It's streamlined so much, they took the game out of it. There's a lot better ways to spend your time.

It can suffer from quarterbacking a bit, however.

[Cooperative game played on "easy" mode.]  The setup is slightly intensive to build the book, separate the various sets of cards and build the player decks.

Only played with two. Beautifully produced game. Absolutely gorgeous artwork. Theme and mechanisms are very complementary. Chockablock with interesting and meaningful choices. Whether you are deciding how to upgrade your deck or creatively using your spells to unlock a combo opportunity, there is a great sense of player agency. The apprentice wizards have varied starting abilities, which can play out quite differently. 

That said, the game can run long and suffers from some balance and pacing issues, which lead to virtuous cycles or death spirals that can often make the game predictable (you know you are going to win or lose from 30 minutes out). Overall, a fun but somewhat flawed game.

A solid co-op game.  A good blend of mechanics, but there are a couple of flaws.  One monster will wipe out all support cards.  Generally if that monster happens to show up it will cause a game loss because of how important support cards are.  Not a ton of variety for both monsters and spells.  Already after just a handful of games, it is getting pretty "samey".  Needs an expansion ASAP.  It would be nice if there was some sort of special monster at the end too (instead of just another rando).

Intresting Dominion clone with a strong cooperative mechanism. I like the variable monsters/curse combinations, and the curse mechanics.

Still fun for families but "good" and "tactical" players will be bored.

The artwork is very good, and it's a clever, challenging and fun deck builder. We had a great time with our first play even though we got destroyed near the end. :)

The cards and board were rather warped when I received the game, and while I expect this is out of the publishers control, it made keeping the many stacks of cards neat very difficult. This might be a game that has to be sleeved.

Great coop mechanism in which each player themselves make their own decision how to support, so that will to a large extent prevent the alpha problem plagueing some coop games.

Playing with five players seemed really hard. And I'm not 100% sure why. Perhaps it was that each player got fewer turns and so had less time to upgrade their decks.

There's some quite big swings of randomness in the curses and the monster abilities which can sometimes be helpful (destroy the top card after having put a curse there  vs. discarding a 2 or 3 you've just upgraded to), but that seemed almost acceptable in a co-op.

It all holds together but between being a deck builder and being a co-op, it really wasn't ever going to be my thing.

RATING: 4
A cooperative deck-building game with asymmetric player abilities? This should be a 10.

Unfortunately the gameplay falls short. My biggest problem with the game is that it just feels like work and it's so hard to accomplish anything. Now the difficulty of the game itself can be easy or hard, depending on which setting you choose.

What I'm talking about is that the limited amount of spells (actions) and multiple-purpose cards make it really hard to do what you want to do. Maybe I need to draw green cards so that we can defeat a green curse. Well, you have to spend green cards to do so. So you just have to hope that enough happen to have the right cards. Maybe you want to play a lot of blue cards which will let you put more cards into support, so that your teammates can use those cards. By the time you have enough blue cards to do that your deck is too full of nothing but blue cards.

It feels like the game could have went through a couple more versions before going to print. One of the characters has an ability that lets them have five cards in support, when everybody else can only have three. Because of the way actions work and the way you need to use your cards for many other things (curing madness, upgrading cards, gaining new spells), it's incredibly rare to have even three cards in support, let alone five.

Not a terrible game, but not fun. Just missed the mark.

Sold.

The artwork is fantastic, but admittedly, I'm not a fan of cooperative games and this one doesn't add anything new to the genre as far as I'm concerned.  Also, very likely one person takes over and makes the decisions.  If this DOESN'T happen, the game will likely take 2.5 to 3 hours, which is just too long for this type of game.  It's as if someone said, "Let's design a co-op and see how boring we can make it."

The gameplay is pretty fun and the game has enough complexity and moving parts that it helps to tone down the "alpha-gamer" syndrome that can be common in co-ops. Unfortunately, the game ends up being a bit too fiddly for my taste. The concept is interesting and executed pretty well, but ends up feeling a bit tedious instead of involving. Also, constantly shuffling small decks of small cards just adds to the frustration. Not a bad game, I just think there are better co-ops than this one.

It is actually a good coop deck building game. There are lots of decisions to make and lots of ways of trying to mitigate the luck of the draw by sharing actions with other players or picking new spells.

It just went on a bit too long. Thinking about it, it is possible to shorten the book, so perhaps the next time we might take it down from 7 pages to 3 or 4 and see how that goes.

The Big Book of Madness (TBBoM) is deceptive because the slightly cartoony veneer hides a lurking monster of a game.  If you have a playgroup that includes gamers who are unable to sacrifice their self interest, even to win, then do not bring TBBoM to the table.  Even at easy level it will kick your Harry back up into your Potter if the group is not able to fully cooperate with each other.

The rest of the game is tricked out and the artistic direction is fantastic, as expected from Iello.  Normally I would be irritated that the otherwise awesome molded box insert does not accommodate sleeved cards, but this is a coop so I do not mind if someone decides to cheat a bit by trying to read marked unsleeved cards.  Next time we play at a harder level.

Also, a product design call out for the box size.  The subtle difference of having the efficient compactness of TBBoM is a fantastic feature adding to the overall attention to a great product.  Only the need to play more to really test its legs keeps this game out of a potentially higher score.

I've been looking for a gamer Harry Potter type game and this is the best I've found.  The theme shines through with the terrific artwork.  The deck building mechanic serves the game well.  The deck building has a twist in that you don't discard cards you don't use.  I missed that on my first play, but it adds a lot of strategy to the game.  Madness cards start filling your deck.  You better cure or destroy them because if you end up with 6 in your hand you're out!  The addition of individual player powers, spells and co-op use of elements (playing to support) bring the game to another level as well.  The game comes with enough monsters, spells, difficulty levels and different characters to make the game very re-playable.  Solid game with two.  Haven't tried it with more.

A fine game, and pretty. I like co-ops, but this was a little too much about collective planning and acting in the best interest of the group. Sometimes I would feel uninvolved in the game, either through having chosen a largely supporting role, or through other players becoming too alpha. Traded away.

Initial rating after one play.
The first halve of the game I thought: well, that is easy. But soon we where struggling quite a bit. And in the end we almost made it, but there was always one thing missing. Great tension. I like when I loose the first play of a cooperative game, but know what can be done better.
I like this quite a bit. I would probably not play it with 5 anymore due to downtime. But even that was not to bad.
Also: great art and theme.

Ok deck-building coop game with interesting theme and good artwork.

[+] components & artwork, short game, fast paced, easy to teach, must work as a team but...
[-] ...alpha gamer problem not solved (on the contrary, you are basically trying to solve a team problem so a single player can give the best solution and the rest just follow), not enough deck-building for me, same thing with spells upgrades, you barely have time to buy & use them before the game is over. 5p games have a small issue as each player will always play the same "spot" each turn (first player will be first player in each round, last player will be last player in each round with barely anything to do...)

Have played this a number of times solo and a couple multiplayer. Very interesting and engaging puzzle game, love the theme and the way it's executed. Amazing artwork really adds a lot too.

Lots of options to vary the difficulty and keep it challenging, plenty of variable setup to make ever game feel different.

Negatives would be setup being a bit long and annoying like most deck builders, the card sizes are also irritating and it is difficult to sleeve.

I was first attracted to this because it is a cooperative game. I really enjoy the hand management and the hard decisions that must be made about how to spend the element cards every turn. I love the sense of teamwork that it fosters with the support pool and spells that let the non-active player(s) take actions. The slick art is a bonus. I was going to rate it a perfect 10, but I find the backstory of the characters rather off-putting, so I had to dock the rating.

I am one of those who has opened the Big Book of Madness and lived to tell about it.  Of course, my luck, I drew the curse and had to scream wildly with my arms flailing around their booth at Essen. Co-op deck builder. Open the book of madness and set loose rounds of monsters that lay a trail of curses before our footsteps. Players must work together closely spending their hand of element cards to cast spells, collect sets of air, ice, water, fire for destroying curses, and buying more element cards to build their decks. Failing to destroy curses adds madness to player decks and ultimately drives them mad! Not sure how it scales. Three is plenty challenge enough.

Really great deck-building co-op game. Occasionally can run the risk of "Here's what you should do..." but if all the players can get into the puzzle aspect of the game, it works well.

I don't play this one in quieter groups or people get "godmodded" and sort of pull away from the experience.

IELLO has been pushing a shiny and colorful artistic agenda for years, which invariably enhances my enjoyment of their games: King of Tokyo, Welcome to the Dungeon, and this one.  Being shallow pays off more often than you think.

Utilizing tiny number cards in four different suits (colors), [i]The Big Book of Madness[/i] should be really dry, and it may be for some people.  But the whole package works for us - variable spells, card upgrades, looming insanity, and well-illustrated monsters - even if all 171 munchkin-sized cards require sleeves due to their unholy attraction to dirt and grime.  Though if you succumb to the delights of [url=https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/fantasy-flight-supply/products/mini-european-board-game-sleeves/]acid-free polypropylene plastic[/url], you'll need to kiss the insert goodbye, which unfortunately makes the game's organization a nightmare.

Other drawbacks: an overlong set-up and a rulebook that sinks under the weight of odd translations and off-balance organization.

But we like it, so it's all fine.  It doesn't even feel like a deck-builder, if that's a genre that you usually avoid.  Just keep a [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/131375/cheat-sheet-students-looking-answers]FAQ[/url] handy and let your apprentice flag fly.

This is an extremely fun co-op game that exceeded our expectations. I enjoy that there's several difficulty levels so even as you get better at the game, you can continue to ramp up the difficulty. The different character powers and variable spell and monster set-up add just enough variety to make it a different experience every time.

RATING: 5.5
Played it twice now (once with 3 on hard; once with 4 on medium), so it's possible that I have not yet found the true intricacies of this game.

Before playing it, I hadn't really paid it much attention. But as it was explained and as I played it the first time as I was absolutely amazed: this game combines a lot of things I love in games. It has stunning artwork, a theme I really adore (magic academy), deck-building, the concept of elements/mana, truly working together, being able to purchase new spells (and thus differentiate more), a continuous pleasurable tense timer... This is a game I absolutely LOVE!

...or at least it would be, if it weren't for just one big major factor that drags down all of its amazing parts that I love so much.

It was too easy. Way too easy. Both times.

The first time I was taught, so maybe something went wrong then, but when I flipped through the rulebook the second time I couldn't find anything that made the game even remotely harder. In both games I played our team got only hit by a curse once. Once. There was no pressure. No tension. No excitement. Surely, we discussed and planned everytime a new monster showed up, but even if we got hit by more curses it wouldn't be that big of a deal. We didn't even burn through half the insanity deck (or whatever it's called)!

So that's my one major gripe with the game: its difficulty. If a co-op is too easy, then why even bother playing it? I want challenge (that's why I play games like Fire Emblem on hard mode)! There has to be something more going on, something else the players have to tackle (not just more curses). Let the monsters have continuous effects; make it feel more like a fight! Let us fight minions or ANYTHING! 

Now, I know an expansion is coming up and I really would like to try that one in the hope that it makes the game (a lot) harder. If it does, it will easily turn this game in at least an 8 for me.

A REALLY cool take on deck building. The ideas of how the starting deck is constructed and the way that you have many different options on your turn make for a fantastic system which takes deck building in a new direction. Perhaps nothing here is entirely original but it feels very well implemented and meshes just fine with the theme, which I very much enjoy. Exceptional art and interesting mechanics make for a really cool game. Can't wait to share this with my groups!

Very nice artwork/components and interesting idea. Unfortunately, I still have to understand why we lost our plays.. Did we focused on too many things (improving deck, getting rid of Madness card, buying new spells) or were we just unlucky? Hopefully, more plays (also with different player count) will give the answer to that.
Nevertheless, an enjoyable experience with the right level of difficulty (although maybe some rules are a little bit fiddly).

Felemásak az érzéseim. Egyáltalán nem volt rossz, de valószínűleg a felfokozott várakozás rányomta nálam a bélyegét a dologra, így egy picit többet vártam. Ettől függetlenül élveztem a játékot, szívesen játszom még majd vele, de az instantget érzés kicsit halványult.
A játékban a deckbuilding mechanika dominál, varázslatokat kell gyűjtenünk, majd ezekkel az elszabadult szörnyeket ártalmatlanná tenni. A játék koop része jól ki van találva - tudunk egymásnak segíteni, támogatást nyújtani, ami azért ezzel a témával és a gyönyörű grafikával rendesen feldobja a játékot. A magyar verzió megjelenése dicséretes, egyértelműen jót tesz a játéknak, még ha csak pár mondatot is kell megjegyezni ami a kártyákon van, de így már a kisebbek és/vagy az angolul nem tudók is többet kapnak az élményből.

We had the good fortune of being taught by the designer himself! It's a riotous game, as long as you and your group freely encourages bribery!! Hysterical and good times.

21st Board Game I bought :D Was out shopping at Shosen when I just happened to find this game :P Liked this game when a friend introduced it to me. Personally hate economic games but this is an exception; liked the lightness of the game and the social aspect (plus the names of the businesses are hilarious). Simple yet gives players a little taste of how mega corporations work in real life :) Good Game :)

Easily my favorite game.  I love the combination of strategic thinking with social manipulation and bargaining.  The satire is almost sadly accurate, even years after it was made.  Each game is different because the social component allows you to try many different approaches depending on your fellow players.

I also helped with extensive play-testing of this game and I absolutely love it.  Like was previously said in one of the independent reviews, it's a strategy/politics game that plays like a party game.  Every single time I played I was deep in strategy and planning the entire time, trying to find out how to make my allies now only to undercut them later once I got what I wanted.  At the same time, there were constantly jokes and laughs to be had at the expense of the the card and theme (The "Sin Tax" and some of the technology business names are great).  I can't wait to finally get my copy to play again with the polished, gorgeous set.

fun negotiation, backstabbing, political-money game reflecting real life corporate//political truths (I am not a crook) -- works best with more than three players, and everyone must be able to enjoy this type of (here's a million, look after yourself) action, where you may never do what you say, or say what you do ... if with the right crowd (and the Amerikan Presidency impressions are flowing) -- ask not what chowder can do for you -- this game can be price-less and the laughter raucous -- bribe your way to the White House and pass that legislation you said you would never pass -- names and descriptions of companies hilarious -- a very tongue-in-cheek satire of a game -- grand fun with the right group

RATING: 6
The theme is dry, but the art and production brings some life to the game. The fun is entirely in the interactions between players - it's completely necessary to propose deals and alliances and backstab your people after being elected. Great fun.

Ahh, finally a funny game with strategic depth, and great table-talk, too!  Critically, for me at least, the mechanics of this game support the theme- you feel like a disgusting corporate fat-cat, and, frequently, the more underhanded and money-grubbing you are, the better you fare.  Monopolizing the auto industry?  That'll make you money.  Diversifying, spreading your corporate tentacles into as many pies as possible?  Yep, that's lucrative, too.  Vie for influence in a corrupt political free-for-all?  As long as there's money in it!  Pollute like a mug and abuse labor laws?  Why not?  You're a corporation, you ain't trying to save the world.  It's all about stacking paper.

Hilarious take on negotiations. The theme is perfectly realized, while I feel those with certain political leanings may be offended and spam the ratings for the game. Don't pay attention to them; it's a great game. The only real issue I see with the game is the randomness of the cards you get to draw for being president. Some amount to nothing, while others are pretty much "I win" or "screw you" cards. I can see fixing it with a house rule that we throw out some cards or just show them in advance. That way you know what you're bidding on.

I love the game, the humor, and I think it's all around solid.

Interesting negotiation game but with highly random card draw. The campaigning and legislation phases are fun but the executive powers vary a bit much. Not sure if enough strategy is involved as the cards to play might be sometimes quite obvious. For negotiation games, I'd rank I'm the Boss over Corporate America over Chinatown.

~2015-09-09~

Negotiation game in the vein of Chinatown, without the area control element. The ability to run for president and control the passing laws/legislations makes for interesting deal-making, though it's difficult to gauge how much money a player should spend for their campaign, particularly with the blind Executive Order cards (and varying strengths of the cards -- some cards simply provide $10, while others provide control of the consumer card, possibly providing $25+).
There is definitely strong elements of luck, though not as much as Chinatown.
There are some small opportunities to manage your luck, but often become very costly.

A great set of original mechanics that fit perfectly into this type of game. I love when a multi-player game is more about manipulating and engaging your opponents than simply playing an efficient individual game and hoping to dodge kingmaker's blows. 

It's easy to learn because it makes sense. I also love that the presidency acts as a honeypot for players who gravitate toward control, adding a powerful but balanced second 'fun condition'.

The gameplay is quite simple but the Negotiation, the Bribes, The Humor of the Business Cards you the funny names and hilarious Slogans.

Can't understand why this game is so overlooked and underestimated... everyone should be playing this awesome game!

Played my first game today and had an absolute blast!  Don't expect a ton of tough strategic choices to make because this game seems to be more about negotiation than picking the right businesses to start up.  For folks that have even a little understanding of the current political arena there will be a lot humorous jabs to be made. I can't wait to give it another go!!

Pros:
1) Accesibility. Rules are quick to explain and intuitive
2) Thematically strong. Playing the game actually makes you feel like a ruthless corporate bigshot throwing about "campaign donations" in order to achieve your ambitions.
3) Visual appeal.  Overall layout of the board and cards is very clean without unnecessary clutter.  The artwork captures the lighthearted nature of the game and the flavor on the cards hammers the humor home!

Cons:
1) I found that the amount of bribery that occurs tends to drop off after everyone starts establishing more overlapping businesses.  That made me sad.

I like negotiation games and games where the players can set and change the value of different actions, sales, stocks, etc.  This was fun, but I have a few concerns:
1.  I think this will be fun as an occasional game with 4+.  It was OK with three, but many of the negotiation aspects would be better with more.  
2.  Another reason that this will only bear occasional plays is that the chaos isn't just chaos--there are very distinct advantages to certain lucky card draws of the businesses.  The game moves fairly quickly and is fun, but it would be frustrating over repeated plays.
3.  The cynicism is well-placed and funny, but every single aspect of the game bears a very distinct political slant.  Some of it is borderline offensive, and we removed the porn industry card, though it is sadly true that it would be a money-maker.

**UPDATE**
I have since received my copy, and couldn't be happier. The materials are all of a very high quality, and the board, box, and components all look beautiful. The excellent game play remains the same, though now I've been able to share it with many of my friends. I have not played a single game that has been anything less than a blast, and every player has walked away from every game with a huge smile on their face, and asking when we can play again. Can't recommend this game enough.

**ORIGINAL COMMENT**
I've been lucky enough to be a part of the 'beta' process of this game, and it is absolutely incredible.  The game hits on all the right points -- structured enough to feel like a solid, wonderfully crafted adventure that ensures lots of fun, while being loose enough to allow players to create their own fun and really let their own personalities shine through and bring their own personal creativity to the table!  As someone whose been privileged enough to see the game evolve, it is fascinating to see just how much love and care went into the creation and development of this game.  It's been fun from the beginning, but what is going to be published is a finely tuned game honed through the rigors of constant play-testing, and a game-designer who never relinquished his quest for perfection.  And on top of all that, not only is the game fun and funny, but it also has inspired some very real discussions about the relationship between businesses and government in the US.  Insightful and thought provoking, but never heavy handed, Corporate America is satire at it's best. I really cannot recommend this game enough.

I have just started playing a lot of board games, and this is definitely one of my favorites. The first time I played, I got to be the president!! Being out on the campaign trail with all of my friends (and in this case, some became my foes for the next hour or so) was so much fun. Not to worry, we are all still very good friends!!! This game is packed full of excitement! There are many reasons I like this game, but for me the most important is that there is a lot of negotiation and bribery in the game. This leads to very interactive and exciting play sessions! I would recommend this game with a small group (5 or so). If the intention of the night is to have fun, then this game will not disappoint!!!!

This game can be played as shallow or as deep as you like, and the end of the game is always very exciting as the final dollar amounts are revealed.   The game is really easy to learn, but figuring out the best way to play takes time, and it can vary based on who the group is.  There is always lots of table talk--- mostly banter, but bribe negotiations play a role, too--- and something is always happening even if it is not your turn (so you stay engaged).  I highly recommend this as a game to play with a good group of friends, especially those who will try to win but do not take it/themselves too seriously (although there are plenty of opportunities to be cutthroat if that is more your thing).  Most of the games I have played have been 6 person games, and it certainly plays well with that many people.  To top it all off, the designer is a great guy who is really dedicated to the craft of game designing.  This is absolutely one of my all-time favorite games, and I cannot recommend it highly enough!

Supported this game on kickstarter. I was convinvced by the introductory video, I liked the theme, but most importantly, I wanted a lighter game than my other ones, to be able to bring to the table on a relaxing evening or when introducing a non-gamer to our board gaming hobby.

I was not disappointed. I like the humorous side of it and the very heavy and constant player interaction. I was not mindblown either - the strategy is quite obvious to figure out and not very deep. It has to be said on an extra note, that, the last few times I played it, I opened it up half-heartidly (I wanted something heavier but the group was in a different mood) but in the end it produced loads of fun and laughter for everyone (including me).

That's how it should be viewed, in my opinion. A nice, pleasant, lighthearted game, not one that has a serious mental challenge to offer. In this respect, it has fulfilled the role for which I initially supported it. My rating of 6 does not imply dissatisfaction, it is in accordance with the definition of the BGG scale: I will play it sporadically when in the mood.

RATING: 4
Not my kind of negotiation game.  Overlong and underdesigned.  The executive privilege cards are the swingiest, most horrifyingly unbalanced and ridiculous set of cards in just about any game I've ever played.  If two people tie for president, the makes you go find an outside party to break the tie by just saying which person they want.  The underlying game below a bunch of garbage is fine, but not original or all that interesting.   You can get significantly more interesting negotiation gameplay in half the time from something like Santiago, or take the same amount of time and quadruple the depth with Traders of Genoa.  You can even do a lot of the same stuff with a similar theme in a quarter the time in Article 27.

On the subject of the theme, I do like the idea of lampooning politics in America and just how much corporations have a say in what happens in this country.  I just don't enjoy much of how it is presented here.  The cartoons lack wit, and the naming jokes are sophomoric.  Everything about the package looks underproduced and Kickstarter-y, which is understandable but detracts from the experience.

Very good negociation is this game's forte. It does that very well, but that's about it. But its negociation aspect is so good, it carries the game as a whole to make it a very good game. But it's very binary, do you like negociation? Play it if you do, don't if you don't.

3/4/2017: I played this game for the first time on this date, with a total player count of 5. This is certainly a more complex party game that I have played so far. It has interesting mechanics that convey the different phases of the game. The game is just dripping with the theme of being business owners, consumers, presidential candidates, and the president. The satirical text flavor and graphic also helps to bring humor to the game. Just like any other party game, this game will light up when played with the right group.

RATING: N/A
Kickstarted. Players start businesses in various industries; having more of the same industry is good for income. Players also control which industries get "consumed" i.e. earn money. Protests can arise. Players bid money in three rounds to decide who will be President. The President will have claimed he will enact certain legislation cards of some available selection. He's not bound by his promises. Legislation helps or hurts certain industries and can also satisfy protests. A President must satisfy a protest if he can, before enacting anything else, and can only enact exactly three laws. Game winner is based on money.

Potential weakness is the same as Article 27: There's basically a single currency, which is freely tradable and is also the VP measure. So the implications of the terms of negotiated deals can often be precisely determined (in terms of the one currency), and transactions (money for action, etc.) may be immediately completable.

RATING: 8
Great game with solid negotiation elements and satirical humour littered throughout. A stand out in its genre though some may house rule the bidding aspect of the game. What Monopoly is suppose to be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A tongue-in-cheek game of the US political-economic system in which players represent mega-corporations who manipulate the public into buying their products and then spend money to elect the president most likely to enact legislation that favours their companies. Can be played straight but will be enjoyed more by a group that enjoys a bit of roleplaying as the candidates announce their election platforms. A light game that plays smoothly, this will be most appreciated by liberal-leaning folks with a sense of sarcasm.

Vaguely party-style negotiation game that outstays its welcome. Very random with some nonsensical rules. The game seems to assume that players will want to help each other out despite there being no incentive for doing so. Obviously a kickstarter game, from the components to the lack of development.

I got my copy of this game and it's fantastic. I've played it many times now and I'm really pleased with how balanced the game is. The play is engaging from beginning to end, the elections are super fun, and the satire is hilarious! I've heard from many people that this game is like "daily show, the board game", which is pretty spot on. Don't miss out on this game!!

Ok negotiation game. Kickstarter quality and lack of actual strategies put me off this game.

Totally underrated gem. I had this in my queue on Kickstarter but lost track of the end date. Was glad to see they met their goals on the last day. Wildly fun political satire game. Granted, you need the right group to play this, but since most of my gaming group are grad students and professors, it hits on all cylinders. If you want a light economic game that is heavy on negotiation (and frequently backstabbing), I'd grab a copy before the print run drys up.

A very good light war game. It feels like a cross between a war game and a euro due to the victor point mechanism and simplicity (for a war game). My main criticism is that while being more historically accurate, some of the scenarios are very unbalanced.

I usually avoid games that are primarily for two players as I usually find they get tedious.  However, Memoir '44 has been a very pleasant surprise.  The game length and pace is good, whilst scenarios keep the game fresh.  Also, dice aren't as disruptive as in other games and the fairly simple rules are well balanced against the depth of strategy.

There are certainly better games--and I feel like I graduated from Memoir '44 to Combat Commander, finishing my degree in WWII Hand Management Studies--but few things can compare to the joy of pushing around my little plastic army men and rolling my little dice with grenades on them.

Commands & Colours might be my favorite wargame system only for its having found a fun combat resolution system that involves rolling dice while neglecting the obnoxious need to add and subtract countless modifiers. 

As whole, Memoir '44 could really use some more meat on its bones, but it was my introduction to cardboard-based combat and its charming presentation and clever gameplay still hold a special place in my heart.

A fun fast game, with great minis 
and history review of battles
Set up time is 5- 10 min but is fun because of nice components

It is addictable, you play one round and you want to play more more and more again
definetly one of the best and most recommendable game that will be fun and enjoable for everyone. I would give it a 20 if 10 wouldnt be the maximum score. A total masterpice.

PS: you dont need any of the expansion, because this is a FULL HAUSE (dozens of minis and scanario terrains to mix and match, two sided board :D). Everything you need for a 100 % enjoment. However the great number of expansions show that this is one of the most successful games, has hundreds of fans and that Days of Wonder cares about it and cares about its fans. A REAL FAMILIE , what else can I say :)

UPDATE--Traded.

Had an absolute blast with this one at Buckeye Game Fest '07!  I love the switch sides aspect, the command system, everything!  I need to try Battlelore now, since I suspect the theme might appeal to me even more than the WW2 one.  

Traded Power Grid and both expansions for this and Battle Masters!  Goodbye Euro, hello fun!

[update] Have played this a number of times with my brother, and have really enjoyed it.  I'm hoping Kristen will like it, so we have a pretty fun 2-player game to play together.  

Set-up time is a little annoying, but if both people work at it, not that bad.

[I]tl;dr - Command Cards ruin an otherwise enjoyable light wargame for me. I can't take the luck of the draw where an entire flank inexplicably can't move.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Memoir '44 looks really cool, but the command cards ruin it for me. Without a way to flush useless cards, an otherwise strong position can be totally wiped out. I'm quite skeptical of a wargame that's so dependent on luck of the draw. Additionally, two-player-only games don't really have a place in my collection unless my wife will play them with me, and this one is definitely not up her alley.

Decent for what it is.  More of a kid or family game (if your family is really into WWII). Certainly overrated at the moment.  Artillery figures are an abomination...others are good.  Nice board and tiles.  Scenario editor will be available on website, but charging $20 (or alternatively owning two copies) for full version is a joke. (What, I have to pay for the privilege of creating scenarios that improve the marketing position of the game? Bah!) I can create my own scenarios using a graphics program! (NOTE:  A FREE scenario editor file is now available on the Memoir '44 Geek page.)

RATING: 7
I think this game is good.  The problem is with the double dip of randomness with both card drawing and dice rolling.  I love having one of these but am not too happy with both in the same game.  The various scenarios do add variety, but have some issues with balancing the sides. Although, if a war game is going to even attempt to be "realistic" there are going to have to be balance issues. That is, the Germans stormed over Europe (balance issue) and than, eventually, the Allies stormed back (more balance issues). So how does one represent this in a game?

I really like how light and cool-looking and easy to play this war game is, but it really bugs me for some reason that the victory conditions make you do really unrealistic things.

Example: "All right troops, wev'e routed that enemy infantry unit and they're running for the hills... after them! Don't let any of them get away alive! Ignore the fresh infantry unit coming down on us and the dinky little town we're supposedly fighting over! Kill every last man in one unit before shooting at a different one!"

RATING: 7
Score is 8 by itself (not enough unit variation/chrome/replayability), 9.5 with the air-pack, campaign book and one more expansion (variation/chrome/replayability), and then dropped back to 8.5 (because a game should not force you to buy so many extras just to get its score higher).

This game often evokes the rather heated discussion on whether it is a wargame or not. 
Let me put it this way - before getting this game, my list consisted of mostly Euros (of which I am still very fond). After playing memoir (and expansions) I now own more than 50 wargame titles and have a few dozens more through various P500 systems at GMT/MMP/LNL/DG/etc. I would never have considered myself a wargamer and supported the hobby (both in finance and spirit) if it was not for this game. If you look around, you will find out that my story is not an isolated case. To me, there could be no higher accolade for a wargame than bringing scores more players to the hobby, and if this is what Memoir has done - then yes! THIS IS A - WAR - GAME! (spartan music in background)

Update: score dropped down a bit, only due to mostly been replaced by Memoir Online (its own worst enemy?), zero setup times, and ready opponents. Also f2f version been replaced by C&C:A.

Still going strong and still a 10

2016-10-24
It is time I wrote more comprehensive comments here. Memoir '44 has been a game that has held its rating of 10 for years now. 

The first obvious reason for me loving Memoir '44 is that the game is easy to teach because the game mechanics and the theme support each other thus making the rules easy to remember. This also helps with decision making during the game. You can make valid decisions based on solely on your gut feeling. There is no need to go through complex equations to make a good decisions. Sometimes they might give you an edge but you can get close trusting your intuition only. However, at the same time the decisions you have to make are still meaningful and most of the time the best choice is not trivial.

My second reason for loving the game is that it plays fast in approx. 45-60mins a game, which is pretty darn good for such an action packed game. Of course, in such a short period of time you cannot even hope to grasp the desperation the armies experienced on the field during long campaigns, but I also think that you cannot get much closer in under an hour. Moreover the game has just the right amount of luck involved allowing for taking big and even bigger risks without making you feel that you are investing a considerable amount of time just to decide the winner by chance.

One point of criticism though. Despite being a modular allowing for countless of expansion and almost infinite variability, expanding the game from this base game is not necessarily a good idea. Personally I bought a considerable number of the available expansions in hopes of playing the game even more but what happened was exactly the opposite. The expansions introduced too many components to the game so that managing it all became very taxing. Furthermore, with the expansions you got many exceptions and rule breaking situations which were sometimes hard to remember because you were not using all the extra stuff all the time. Thus the game diverged from everything that made it great, i.e., from fast playing and simple yet meaningful to a slow handling but still a simple game. In other words, the game became unbalanced with regards to (weight x length) vs. (simplicity x luck) ratio.

So, my criticism is aimed more at the expansions than on the base game itself. It is true that after a point you kind start to wish there was more content in the the box but in my experience doing it does not make you happier.

In some ways, this is a difficult game for someone like me to rate.  I've played scores of "serious" wargames and how do balance those against something like this?  Not to worry - I think I can, by looking at the strengths and weaknesses that this has...and there are much more of the former than the latter.  For one thing, this is enormous fun.  

Other points are that the cards work really well and give a good feel for what it much have been to wait for orders in battle; the board and pieces are really well done; most of the scenarios are really close and to the wire; the game is easy to learn and quick to play; there's a great deal of replayability; and, I think it could encourage a lot of younger folks into more serious wargaming.  

The rules are obviously on the very easy side for anything you may attach the word "wargame" to, but I didn't see that as a problem in most situations because the balance was good.  The retreat rules did bother both myself and one of my playing partners a bit and we thought there was room for a few house rules on special armour, bunkers and standard infantry being caught by tanks in the open, or tanks being caught in forests (there is a rule for them firing in).  On the whole though, I wouldn't tinker too much with what is a good and fun game, but for the record, I've made a few simple tweaks, which SHOULDN'T be used all at once but a bit at a time.  Here they are:
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/29501

I would say that this game is better than many "serious" wargames and I'd much prefer to play it than some of the really heavy stuff like Flat Top and Drang Nach Osten.  I wouldn't say that it was quite as good as the classics, which aren't that much more difficult and which have a great deal more tactical and strategic choice - games like Midway, AK, WSIM...well a fair few of the early Avalon Hill Games and the odd game from other makers, too.  However, I don't think it's that far behind these, and they are a different beast - this has to be classified as "a light wargame."  

On the weakness side, maybe it lacks a little depth for those who like to think hard about most moves...but again, most people who play this don't want that.  Nevertheless, for me, good though this is, I can't get it to 9 or 10 as a rating.  One more point- if you enjoy this, maybe you could try some of the old AH classics next.  They won't bite, but you may enjoy them!

Solid and lightweight, it is entertaining and playing with little plastic soldiers is always a cool feeling. There are thousands of expansions but the core game is fantastic on its own and can provide years of entertainment. Overly simplistic though and it will not appeal to hex-and-counter fans as it is too luck-dependent and you usually can't do what you want.

Dumb and pointless;  neither a fun game nor a wargame.  I thought my kids would learn a bit of history, and instead they called it "unrealistic"!  Commands & Colors: Ancients is far superior.

Or, put it this way:  M'44 is right up there with Mickey Mouse Yahtzee, which really doesn't give the latter it's due credit...

I wrote those words at least two years ago, and I stand by them.  What I've learned, though, is that as STOOPID as it is, Memoir is nevertheless fun to play if you look at it in the following way:  It's NOT a wargame, and has as much to do with war as little boys and their gren army men.  

Maybe if it were re-themed I wouldn't be so negative about it;  as it is, it's like a cheap, disrespectful, dishonest rip-off of what WWII was all about, and the word "memoir" in the title seems especially cheesy for that reason.  

Now that I've cleared my conscious, I can eagerly await the Eastern Front expansion I just ordered for it....

Great war game with wonderful eye appeal.

Although a good part of luck is involved, good tactical skills are going to be needed for steady wins.

The visual aspect of the game and its relative shortness makes it a good bet for gaming with kids.  Since luck has a good part in this game, they can pull a few victory out of a superior opponent, keeping them happy and willing to play again.
My 6 and 8 years old sons love it.

Its easiest to blame the crappy scenarios. Some rules and terrain effects represent toytown silliness for the under-fives, but they are necessary to make the game work at all. The mouldings vary in quality and the best are not very good. Its a toy that teaches false lessons, but its an exciting one. Apparently fans' scenarios on the web are less dire, a reversal of the far more desirable situation found in CCA and Battle Cry.

Memoir '44 is the best introduction to wargaming out there. Nothing beats it when it comes to balance, simplicity, and even educational value (the Historical background for each mission is given in the scenario handbook). The game takes strategy, but put the Analysis Paralysis downtime behind with the card system. Player's only have 5-6 options per turn, but a whole deck of cards that are varied and interesting. My only two issues are the dice (sometimes one infantry unit can wipe out a whole tank unit so the randomization is still a little prevalent) and the set-up time is darn-near 30 mins. You can't even have a filler ready because it's only a 2-player game.

My rating is for the base game.  The rating for the family is much higher.

Memoir 44 is a fun game, but should not be judged in a vacuum.  To really experience it, you need to try the expansions.  West front is a tiny part of the picture.  When you add in the Russians and their command deficiencies, the Japanese and their Bushido Code, the Gung Ho Marines, the great desert tank battles between Monty and Rommel, the air rules, and the numerous tiny bits of chrome (specialized units and weapons), you see just how good this game is.

But when you try the Overlord system (even for just 2 players) and the Breakthrough boards, and try the Campaign Books -- oh wow!  This game just keeps reinventing itself.

It's not a game without deficiencies: infantry is more successful against armor than it should be and artillery is too powerful, period.  These could be tweaked with house rules.  Also, the medal count encourages carnage more than objectives (unless you use the Campaign books).

It's way more game than history.  If you want a fun, simple, conflict game, pasted on to a WWII backdrop, that will play in an hour, this is for you.  Otherwise, look elsewhere.

Why it's previously-owned:

This "light war game" plays fast and can be learned very quickly.  The mechanics (cards and battle dice) flow smoothly to create WWII historical scenarios that are great fun to play.   Games seem tight and can go either way from one turn to the next.
The only issues I've seen so far is that after three plays is it felt light on strategy with more weight on hand management and dice rolling.  Need more plays to see if one can really set a strategy.

Clever, simple wargames, easily playable in 30-40 minutes, but may take longer. Great double sided board. Great pieces. Clever rules. Just a LITTLE too simple for me, but excellent to teach my 12 year old daughter who plays it well.

RATING: 5
Excellent production values. Looks like a nice light war-themed game. Ideal for a grognard looking for lighter fare, or a eurogamer looking for an introductory wargame. Interesting system, fun game, and the short playing time is attractive. However, in the final analysis, too lighweight and too abstract for my tastes, but I wish it well!

[With Breakthrough, Desert Map, Air Pack, Campaign Book Vol 1, Eastern, Mediterranean, Pacific, Terrain Pack -- not everything, but close enough to easily re-run most of WWII in your living room at demand]

Fun!  Quick.  Not the deepest ever, and I know there's a lot of dice/card luck, but it does seem like my wife wins because she uses her cards more intelligently, and maximizes firepower.  And it's quick and the little soldiers are nice.  I think I'd like C&C:A more in some ways, but win less...

Can be a bit silly if one side gets decent cards early and the other gets trapped.  Want to play whenever I watch Hogan's Heroes.

Ok, once in a while someone gets insanely good luck with dice/cards (usually me) and this is a miserable experience.

Just had a few plays of this so far and really enjoyed it.  Trouble is card games - Netrunner, Star Wars Destiny, Race for the galaxy, etc (which I play a lot of) are quick and easy to get to the table which does mean really great games like Memoir don't get the table time they deserve.  

This game though does scratch a particular itch which other games cant reach!  It looks great on the table and is really immersive and fun.

RATING: 6.5
Okay game. There are lots of tactical decisions, but it comes down to hoping you roll the right symbols and draw the right cards. They gameplay is quick and entertaining. It's light enough where I could easily see teaching this to some of my nongamer friends (provided they were actually interested in playing).
Many of the scenarios in the game book seem unbalanced. I know they are supposed to be historical simulations (although I doubt they can be too accurate with this game), but this lessens my opinion of the game. Still, we can always make our own setups.

RATING: 6
This looks like such a compelling game, and has some excellent ideas.  However, the card system dominates play too much: if you get a bad set of cards, you will lose.  If you end up with cards dominated by one flank, and need cards to do something on the other, there is no mechanism to allow me to swap cards, or substitute an action for another, which is infuriating during play.  Also, some of the special cards are seriously powerful and can affect the game balance dramatically.

I also don't think there are quite enough dice rolls to even out the odds.  A single set of dice rolls can have a big effect, particilarly in those scenarios that have relatively few units.

Genial wargame (aunque algunos no lo consideren como tal). Es un juego táctico ambientado en la II Guerra mundial y a través de escenarios, tendrás que combatir para resultar ganador. El desarrollo de la partida se centra en el uso de cartas que te van a permitir dar órdenes a las unidades que hay sobre el terreno. Dependiendo de qué unidades muevas o por donde las muevas (terreno), podrás manejarlas de una forma u otra. Las reglas son muy sencillas, las partidas super rápidas (unos 35 minutos) y dan lugar a idas/vueltas para así poder nombrar ganador de la sesión al que haya ganado más "medallas". Must have.

(Own 2)

I am one of the many that rank "Memoir 44" highly as I love the simplicity of the rules, board and pieces. It's strengths lie in the relatively quick play time and the option to keep things simple while also allowing experienced players to add more rules and complexity in the subsequent packs that have been released. 

Those that don't like this game usually levy the criticism of "it's not a war game" which is fair enough but [i]is[/i] a game about war. Who cares if it doesn't have all of the stats and modifiers that other, more in depth war games have - this game shines because of it's accessibility.

The vast array of official and fan generated scenarios mean that there is plenty of replay-ability here. 

And finally, playing the game in the Overlord mode (I do it with 2 copies of the base game plus the Operation Overlord expansion pack) is a blast! I've tried it with 4 and while fun, the rule book clearly wants you to opt for 6 or even 8 instead as rules for 4 player games are not as clearly outlined. 

Excellent game!

RATING: 5
Memoir '44 is a bit too simplistic to be a serious simulation. Although I was very enthousiast at first instance, my sympathy is dropping the more I play this game.

M44 is a fast playing game. A bit too fast to my taste, because I like my games double or triple this time. So complexities as optional rules could have been added and therefore more game depth. Now it is all too shallow.

I also criticize the card deck. It is always the same one deck, with cards that make no sense or appear at too random occasions. There are no optional cards per scenario for instance or deck building possibilities. Both players could then have their own deck and build own based on their strategy.

Furthermore I do not like the gameboard division into three areas, but I can live with it. It works well, but is quite artificial. The three wing division should be on the units themselves, so you could shift over the board. I also have strong doubts about game balance in many scenarios, which always end too abruptly.

My conclusion: far too simular to Battle Cry, Battlelore and others in this line. More a result of good marketing than game design.

(And in saying that Memoir '44 feels a bit simplistic for conflicts it represents, I'm genuinely afraid that I'm going to buy a real wargame someday.)

RATING: 1
A dumbed down war game with no depth where tactics are not required and the game can be won with luck alone. For a similar experience you might as well just roll dice by themselves.

Risk management wargame. Great fog of war mechanism with the hand management. Good replayabillity, fast gameplay and a bit of luck. The only downside is the length of setup for each scenario. Uses the same system as Commands & Colors.

RATING: 5
A wonderful game of simplfied combat.  Though not a "wargame", it still contains some history, and the simple rules and quick play ensure that it's not hard to find people to play with.

There is a lot of randomness involved, so playing multiple games is suggested (and possible, due to the quick play).  This can also be used to deal with the imbalance of many of the scenarios, if a contest is desired.

Basic-level introduction to wargaming is playable, but unrealistic, highly luck-dependent and "wristy," infantry gun too hard to kill. You can get stuck with useless cards. Practically begs for a more realistic action deck.

RATING: 8
It's so easy to dismiss this as a stodgy old WWII war game. It's so not. The fact that it's made by Days of Wonder should be a big clue to this. Memoir 44 is an extremely fast playing tactical strategy game with a WWII theme that almost feels like a card game. It feels like a light game because it's so easy to learn, with simple mechanics that make it accessible to new gamers, but there is a very satisfactory amount of depth. There is quite a bit of luck involved, but it fits the theme and makes you feel more like a general dealing with the chaos of war. If you are typically adverse to war games, you should try this game out.

It's weird. I like the game, but it's not much of a war game. Whenever somebody gets around to winning it feels strangely anti-climactic. There's something weird about having some scenario where 8 tank battalions are still coming at your town on the board, but you just killed another little bit of troops, and therefore you won. Random card draws also make one's situation really crappy at times.

I think, perhaps, it's just a bit too stylized and euro for my ("war game") tastes. C&C: Ancients is a much stronger game.

A highly approachable WWII combat game.  The game components are very nice and the scenarios are nice historic representations.  Game play is straight forward.  The card mechanism makes the game playable, but detracts a bit from a historical operations feel.  This is most notable when card draws sharply conflict with scenario objectives.  It feels harder to adjust to the card draws than in Battle Cry, though the reason is not clear.  [GTI Code: TPCL]

2/10/06: Rating based on one play of operation overlord.  To me this felt like I was sitting at a table rolling dice, which should be more fun that it was.  This game felt too much like playing with plastic soldiers in contrast to a game like Wings of War where I felt like I was strapped into the seat of the plane, whipping it around in a tight turn for another chance at a shot.  This is a game where I wanted more detail and complexity than it offered.  Want to try again to see if I was just having a bad night.

RATING: 6
It's an OK two player game if you play with the right opponent. This game relies too heavily on luck in the draw of cards and roll of dice. After playing it as much as I have I feel like I have almost no direct control. The cards and the dice pretty much dictate what I do. You can have a strategy but once you have "figured out" a map you know what you should do and just hope for the appropriate cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I am sure this has been said this way before, but it is accurate, so I'll say it.  Memoir 44 is like playing an entertaining war movie, for all the good and bad of it.

It is paced just right for the balance it is designed with (luck, decisions, impact, etc).  The game design is very nice and tight for what it is.

--------

After more plays, I am more impressed than I thought I'd be.  First, the big negative, which I absorb later as a positive: the section freeze problem on bad draws.  This hurts, and feels settlers-dice broken, but I think you just have to think of it the right ways...

I like block games.  They have great fog of war.  They are also limited in auditing either untrustworthy opponents, or more often/likely mistake prone opponents (my kids, drunk friends, whatever).  The cards provide a fog of war element that does not take away the ability to audit.  Sure, the fog is slightly less effective than block games, but close enough, and worth the audit tradeoff.

So I now but card driven wargames more than I used to.  I 'get' the tradeoff in game design.

Another thing, a probably bigger thing, that I really like, is the orthogonal unit types.  This is possible due to the very high abstraction level, but the feel, at least at the war movie level, is still not abstract, in a good way.

Now I'll swing back to the negative that will keep this down at a 7, even though I think the system is capable of at least an 8.  The decision making and maneuver gameplay is pretty straightforward...the 'best' decision on a play is usually obvious, and the lookahead for plan is usually pretty short.  This is the one aspect that the other card driven wargame I like so far excels in: Manoeuvre.  The problem with Manoeuvre though is how the deck design is non orthogonal but detailed (not my taste), and drives odd gameplay to the point of losing suspended disbelief.  IOW, I think I actually prefer the CC system, which I did not expect to say.

So the answer?  Possibly CC Napoleonics, which has some combo mechanics and unit states that sound like they will drive longer lookahead and deeper decisions.

Sure, luck plays a huge factor in both movement and combat, but the game is just so fun to play!  The components from Days of Wonder are great (except for the flimsy artillery pieces), and the scenarios you can craft are limitless.  

Update: Just dropped my rating two points, as the game takes too long to set up and, with all the random elements, it never seems like I'm doing anything significant.  Still fun, though!  

Update: Got rid of it.  I just don't feel in control.  Rating down another notch.

Welp, I guess I just won't like wargames. Command and Colors has its own issues - dice combat, being strangely screwed out of ordering units on an entire third of the board, and imbalanced scenarios in particular. But I'm also just not that into World War II. I'll keep it, though - the components are rather excellent, and I might just find an opponent who likes it more than me. Everyone else I've played with has been even less enthused! Operation Overlord would be fun to try, too.

About 10 games into this now and loving it. A very simple ( read: unrealistic in many ways ) WWII game that is easy to learn, fast to play, and great for two people.

A fun "light" wargame that is great to play with beginning wargamers, or non-wargamers.

I've revised my rating upward a few times as I had a ton of fun playing this with my 9-year old son, which gives it a bonus point in my rating.

I'm not sure I'd ever choose this game to play with a fellow wargamer, but who knows. I'm working my way through the expansions and campaign book, so we'll see how much that adds to the enjoyment.

A fun game but lacking in strategy.  Doesn't belong in the top 10 games of all time in my opinion.  I just don't get the appeal but then again I have an ASL background.

Update: Played many more times now and have lost 9 out of 10 games.  Typical wargame strategy doesn't work well in this game!  Enjoying the path of discovery...

Update: Getting better at it, about 30 games played.  This is starting to become a staple.  I can't believe I almost traded this away after 5 games.

Update: C&C:A has superseded Memoir.

Szerintem nagyon szép, igényes játék jó játékmenettel. Egyetlen gondunk az volt, hogy néha teljesen használhatatlan kártyák is voltak a kezünkben.
A hivatalos fél órával szemben nekünk 1 és negyed óra volt a tiszta játékidő. Így se hosszú, de gondolom a sokadik parti rövidebb lesz:)

Elég nagy a szórás: ma negyed órás volt az egyik parti. Gördülékeny volt a játék, nem voltak felesleges lapok. Azt hiszem, ez eléggé pályafüggő is.

A solid choice for an entry level war game. As a history fan, I really enjoy the theme. The game doesn't take long to learn, but that doesn't mean it is easy. Hand management is a key to the game because you have to correctly time your movements. If you run out of cards for a sector, it can leave you vulnerable to attack. The game remains tense throughout where often you can go from a feeling of defeat to victory will a well timed move.

I didn't think I would enjoy this game as much as I have.  Considering that I hate dice driven mechanics. This game is definetely growing on me.

Update (9/4/06): I am enjoying this throughly with my wife.  I am glad I traded for this game.  It is a very good light/introductory wargame.  It fits the bill really well and I hope by the time Combat Commander arrives my wife's appetite will be raging for something deeper.  Rating 7 -> 8.

Update(11/20/06): Ok. I can't deny it any longer. This is a very solid game.  I love the excitement that this game invokes and it is so fast that any downs you experience, the game will throw you back up (assuming you never gave up). My wife loves it and that is icing on the cake! Rating 8 -> 9.

I now have Combat Commander and I just love that game.  I'd rather play CC:E much more than Memoir '44.  It is still a good game for what it is.  A fast light wargame.  A game I'll only pull if someone has never played a  wargame before.

Just played this the other night. It was a lot of fun. Beautiful game. Simple mechanics, easy to use.  Got it for Christmas. (YEAH!)

My first board game that got me into the hobby market.  Opened my eyes that board games could do so much more than RISK and MONOPOLY.  Overlord is the best way to play.

RATING: 6
Ultimately this game fails as it is too superficial, and not a true wargame. It is good for beginners but I need more meat in my rules. It has excellent support though, but it doesnt feel like world war 2 it feels more like Risk with hexes to me. I want individual units, stats and more detail

Fun light war/skirmish game. At times I want it to play longer, which means I should buy the breakthrough expansion and some of the other expansions for additional units. As of now, however, it doesn't get played enough to justify the expense of those expansions to make this game fit exactly what I want.

RATING: 6.5
I rated this independently twice recently, once as a 6, once as a 7; hence the 6.5 rating.

An improvement over Battle Cry! (using the rules supplied with that game) but still with warts that become apparent from time to time.  Most annoying thing is that many of the scenarios are seriously unbalanced so to decide a winner you need to play them twice, once as each side (What a copout on play-testing and balancing the game).

Not the best of the "battle driven" card games; a title which definitely belongs to Commands and Colors: Ancients (even if they can't spell!)

The game that started it all for me. Head-to-head combat in a thought-provoking setting. The core mechanics are very simple and easy to teach. This does not detract from the depth of the game, though. Each scenario offers a different set of challenges. Gambles and sacrifices can either spell doom, or become the defining moments of a battle. The player community is active, and the Days of Wonder team is very involved, making for an extremely healthy game.

RATING: 7
After a handful of playings, I have yet to make up my mind for this game.  I want to play it and like it, but more often then not it seems like an exercise in futility.  One side overmatches the other in each scenario and so far one hundred percent of the time, the favoured side wins.  It just comes down to who kills/captures more on each side.  I like the speed of play, the accessibility it brings, the quality of the game is great and the theme is great.  Now if I can find a little more enjoyment in the gameplay everything in the universe will be fine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After further plays of the base game I can confirm that it is fun. I'm concerned about the role of luck though, which seems greater here than in C&C: Ancients. Also it is really simplistic, which I'm sure is intentional but leaves me without satisfaction.

I am not usually a fan of games that are too light. This game is light on rules and I was worried about that however when I played the game played it worked amazingly well. It was fun and still strategic despite the simple mechanisms (with a little luck involved. My girlfriend really enjoyed this as she managed to click on to it so easy. I still prefer tide of iron slightly as it felt a little more strategic and deeper however this is a great introductory game to get into that...in fact no this game stands alone and works just as well good for when you feel like something a little lighter and with some less fiddly rules then tide of iron

As a game, it has the potential for fun.  As an historical simulation, it has "issues."  I know that some have taken issue, i.e., "flamed me," because of my opinion on Memoir '44.  I don't find the set-up time and the luck factor to be worth the gaming satisfaction.

Edit:

Complete downgraded for this basic box. Read BASIC box.

Why? It was thanks to the PC on line version that I could play it "hardcore" (read many times) and I was in shock by the lack of lasting appeal ... due to the luck this game is all about.

DICE + CARDS + limited surface = a game with more than 80% based on luck = sadly not so good as I thought.

Curiously PC versions of board games will show the strong but also the WEAK points of a design.

And Memoir 44 falls short in the luck category. As a matter of fact it IS a complete turd as "an historical wargame".

While games like Small World and Ticket to Ride opened up extreme good gameplay features, Memoir44 falls flat on its face by playing it many times.

A pity since I collected all the expansions. What a waste of time and money...

Basic Mem 44 is not a historical simulation, it is much too much based on luck and it is crippled on limiting mechanics. 

The only good thing for the fans is the Campaign books I guess so you can ride some long term games with it. Not much historical wargames of course.

---------

Update Edit: I upped it to 4 now after having tried the new breakthrough mapboards. It is now starting to look like a light wargame at least, but it still is far from a WW2 simulation. I guess with all the latest expansions included (breakthrough/winter war/new miniatures/campaign books), a "6" is perhaps deserved, BUT the basic box still stays an ugly simulation and a broken game with a WW2 themed attached to it as an afterthought.

You can have LOTS and LOTS of better stuff with these 300 Euro's in expansions. Perhaps start with C&C Napoleonics for a better wargame from the same author. 

Memoir D-Day is of course the best of the series and I recently gave it 8.2. A pity you have to fork out tons of money before you can play it with XXXXXX expansions and new card rules...

RATING: 5.5
An exciting, though not too realistic WWII game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
This game is actually not half bad but the influence of command cards determines to the largest extent who loses or wins. Another thing to point out is that while the scenarios are created to be realistic they are often in no way balanced. This game is still fun but I reckon what makes it most fun for me right now is that me and my friend keep score for each scenario which side wins most. 

The printable extra scenarios is a real bonus since the included maps either tend to be too unbalanced for you to wish to play them again or too few which will make them repetative. 

But on a whole it's fun

We own Battlelore, C&C Ancients, and Memoir 44. Right now, I think this is our favorite of the 3. It sets up quicker than Battlelore. We also like that ranged attacks are more useful and you don't have to concentrate so much on moving your guys around in little triangles formations. I think visually, we like this better than C&C Ancients. I actually like C&C Ancients quite a bit, but having only 3 types of units to remember makes Memoir 44 a little more fun for my wife.

The Days of Wonder production values are better than the original Battle Cry by a lot, and the cards have slight adjustments to them that I didn't see in the original Battle Cry.

My son (9) and I played through the first 5 scenarios and he and I love it. What especially makes me happy is when he starts making the sound effects and creates a story from what's happening during the game. He once had the "Our Finest Hour" card and got nothing out of the die roll. He made a hilarious act out of men running out the battle field in a full charge, and then realizing they forgot to load their guns with bullets. 

I love games that create narratives, and this game hits that perfectly.

Excellent conflict game.  Quick and easy.  I think it is a little better than Battle Cry, but not enough to seperate itself from being the same game.

If you're not too tied up in recreating WW2 from a historical pov and want to get into WW2 strategy games then I strongly suggest Memoir 44. The base game (there are many expansions) mainly covers Overlord and Cobra. The scenarios are well designed to get you straight into the game and following a tried and tested (I think Squad Leader founded this type of learning scenarios) method each subsequent scenario builds additional complexity. Many of the scenarios are vastly unbalanced but the rules acknowledge this and suggest switching sides so that both sides can tally victory points (called medals) from a point of both strength and weakness.
I played this game with my brother-in-law who doesn't have a particularly strong attention span and he got the rules in short order.

Amazing game !Loved it from the first time i even opened the box, loved it even more when i sat down and played it for my birthday present ! the fast pace and non bulky rules  make it fast to play and teach with still a good amount of tactics involved . Cant wait to play through all the scenarios and buy all the expansions . Definitly in my top 2 in my rapidly expanding collection , a must own for light wargamers or strategy gamers alike

RATING: 5
A GAME with a war theme, not a wargame. My just barely teens like it, and I like playing with them, so pretty popular at my house right now.  As they learn more about MILITARY tactics (virtually irrelevant in this game) I hope to steer them to meatier stuff.  But, M44 is enjoyable for what it is, a light, quick playing game with a little strategy, lots of luck and a war theme.

Update:  Well the above seems a little harsh now.  Kids are more like mid-teens and have even roped my wife into playing.  A 4 player game with a war theme that wife and kids will play, I'm bumping up my rating!

if you need an entry level game to wargaming this is probably it. It's fantastic in simple rule set and also scenario simulation, and I would say you can probably get someone who is not into gaming fairly quick up to speed. The only downside to this game is really the long set up time

Great fun!  Will see a lot of play.  Repeated play leads to a desire to play more.

Upgraded rating due to DoW customer service taking care of my issue with the figures, and because nongamers I know want to play it.

Gameplay is fast and fun.  The "as is" game is great, and this one will be a launching pad for a lot of fun house and optional rules...a delight for the rules tinkerer.  Will spend more time on the table than other more complex wargames.

After my first game I found this to be rather uninspiring.  It seems overly repetitive, and extremely luck-based.  Perhaps this isn't so evident in other scenarios, but for a first-timer I am somewhat underwhelmed.  I will definitely be trying this one more time, but if it's still this boring I will probably write off the entire Command & Colors thing as "not for me".

I've played Memoir '44 twice and haven't rated it yet because I'm still not sure what I think.  It's a nice looking game and I like the idea of what is going on, but in my two plays it really felt like the dice determined the outcome (one win and one loss)... it wasn't even close.  That may be partly because we didn't really know how to manage the game and/or because that's just how it goes sometimes.  Not sure what I think and/or if I care, but I need to play more to find out.  Also, we just played the first two scenarios so we didn't see a number of features in the game.

I really wanted to like this game.  I like the play time.  And the bits are pretty cool, although the soft plastic lends itself to deformed pieces.  But it all came down to the scenarios.  I'm not a history buff or a war buff.  I want scenarios that are evenly balanced and fun.  The few I've played were all unbalanced and often times had the Axis side doing nothing but "holdng territory," which equates to not much thinking, just staying put and rolling dice.  Bottom line, I'd pick HeroScape everytime over this.

Fun, fast wargame along the Commands & Colors system.  The game tends to reward passive play, as the more aggressive player has too much of the risk.  A time factor or attacker die benefit would improve the game.  Still, you get a lot of value in the game pieces for the price.

RATING: 7
Great idea and I love most aspects of the components, but I find the game scale irksome, even while acknowledging this is a "light wargame" focused on speed and fun. 

Given the standard map size limits, I understand the design need to limit ranges, but it still sucks that the scale/range/speed relationships between inf - tanks - arty are so scrunched.  It's like taking a 256 level gray scale 8 bit image and normalizing it down to 4 bit 16 level -- you lose a lot in the transformation.

Also, pet rock, shot itself in the foot by making the baseline Germans dark blue instead of gray.  Duh????!!!   Given Mr. Borg's and the production company's usual insights, I would have thought Feldgrau would have been a no-brainer color choice.  Bugs me every time I set up the Germans, and contributes a good deal to limit my praise.

I really enjoy this game.  It is simple enough that beginners can learn in 10 minutes and even win against veterans of the game.  The strategy involved is "what should I do with what I've been given?".  You see, the same senario can be played so many different ways each time due to the card variables.  A wonderful game I wish I could play more (my wife won't play it: not into war).

Brilliant tactical game with very pretty bits. The lack of control is probably irritating for the true wargamer, but I prefer it this way. Too much control makes me nervous.

Downgraded from 9 to 8. A bit too fiddly for the playing time. And having played the scenarios I was hoping that the expansions would renew my interest, but the Eastern front expansion didnt do that. At all. It all starts to feel very "samey" after a while, the game does not offer any surprises for me anymore.

When I was a little child one of my favourite games was battling with the toy soldiers: I had thousands of them, from the ancient Greeks and Romans to the World War I and II armies up to astronauts and spacefarers, all of them in the 1:72 scale. Then I grew up, dropped them but kept their fond memories in my heart: so, when I happened to play Memoir ‘44 for the first time, those memories resurfaced at once and made me discover how much I still love to play a boardgame displaying so many toy soldiers.

Of course many things have changed over these thirty years: Memoir ‘44 has rules, needs to be played with an opponent over a number of scenarios and requires some kind of strategy, while my childhood toying with plastic soldiers included just one rule, the rule of awesomeness. Yet there’s the same feeling and fun in Memoir ‘44 as I remember there was in those distant days.

I’ve written this foreword to tell in real terms how much I enjoyed playing Memoir ‘44 despite its historical background, a genre I’m not that crazy for: nonetheless, I found this game enthralling and, however easy to understand and handle, complex enough to appease even a demanding wargamer.
I can’t help but think though how much better it would be were it set in an imaginary or (science) fictional setting.

I played BattleLore before I played Memoir '44 (and played it more) but I find I like Memoir more.  Though I'd probably like medieval combat more than WWII, I don't much like the fantasy elements and the magic cards detract from, not add to, the experience.  Plus the board set up is just this drab sea of grey... no wonder so many people paint the figures.  And it costs quite a bit more to boot!

I prefer the presentation and simplicity of Memoir.

The war game for people who like the idea of war games, but not the idea of dedicating an entire weekend to playing one. Move units on the left, center, or right section of the board by playing a card that corresponds to that section. All fighting is determined by a very simple dice rolling system. It is possible to lose because of poor rolls, but more often than not the better tactician will win.
Plays in 30 minutes.

Much has been said so I'll keep it brief.  This is a fun simple game that relies on cards to structure your decisions.  If youve never played a wargame but were interested this would be a good choice to take the plunge.  Production quality is excellent.  Depending on the scenario set up is reasonably quick and play time is roughly 60 min, give or take.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Despite the fact that some scenarios favor one side, I've been surprised at how even games have been.  Weighted scenarios in your favor is no guarantee of success.  Good tactical play and understanding of how best to employ your units goes a long way toward victory.  One of my favorite games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A great 2 player war game. Move units on a hex battlefield and fight with dice. Memoir '44 is taking the classic, super complicated and long war games and simplifying it down into an approachable war game for the average gamer. A card mechanism does a great job of focusing your strategies and tactical decisions. 

Scenarios aren't balanced and should be played twice, basically to see who wins by more.

It took some time to convince myself to buy this game because i feared that if i bought the base game i could not resist buying the expansions... but last week was the time to pull the trigger and i gladly received my copy. Now, five days later i already have ordered most of the expansions and the campaign book... this game is such a blast. It surely depends heavily on luck in which cards you draw and which dice you roll but you need to remember that this is not some hardcore grognard wargame... the scenarios play between 30 and 60 minutes and that is exactly what i was looking for. I just can not get enough people on the table to play some 6 to 7 hour wargame... but Memoir will fit the bill now... i played it with a buddy of mine on saturday and he was immediately hooked as well... looking forward for many many games....

I think wargaming NEEDS what this game.  It's as if the game is a slap in the face to wargamers, saying, "You're taking yourself too seriously, you're making yourself look ridiculous."

Historical accuracy?
Realism?
Yet you still contribute huge, important portions of the game to die rolls, often single die rolls?
Tack on huge, indecipherable rulebooks and more hours than any game should take?

Please.  Spare me.  I'll take this.

Only one play so far, so this may change, but I really, really enjoyed the game. We played the first scenario, Pegasus Bridge, and I just really appreciated how simple and quick it is to play. The ease of movement, checking range, and telling how many dice to use is very appealing- a war game without the massive commitment of time, expense and 'fiddliness' that comes with something like Warhammer. I even enjoyed the randomness of only being able to issue orders to units when you have cards that affect them, as well as the randomness of the dice rolls. It makes the game very low pressure, instead of a head to head, stressful death match. Hoping to play this more, and perhaps find something that's similar, but a bit more complex.

Great, fast, playable and beautifully produced wargame. This game made me a boardgamer. It reminded me of the DOS PC game Panzer General, which was also hex-based. I spended lots of nightly hours on this one. The only note for new players is that the scenario's are not balanced, there is always an advantage to one side. This is something uncommon to causual gamers. Long setup time withholds me from playing this more.

I genuinely fail to see the appeal of this game.  I suspect that I have been taught it poorly, but even so the first game I played my team won.  That victory seemed more determined by luck than anything.  The next game my team lost, and I felt like we had no chance to even try to play well due to luck being so far against us.

This was my first try with the Command & Colors system.  It works well and makes a nice, light, war game.  I am heavily reminded of the old Battle Masters game, but now you have a choice on your turn instead of just flipping over the top card of the deck.

Remarkably, me being a Euro-gamer, I was able to thematically explain nuances of the game that my war-gamer friend didn't like, like why a flag can cause a loss and why a certain number of trophies can be considered a victory.  I would have thought it would be the other way around, where I would be the one questioning the thematic nuances.

The game is too light for me.  The dice play too heavily into the role of counteracting the solid strategy choices you feel you are making.

My first real boardgame. Great solo or against another player. The "storm the beach"-type scenarios are better for solitare play than any of the other Command and Colors games. Most games are close and exciting. Never the same game twice which is my prime criterion.

This one is interesting.  Every time I suggest it I get a funny look from my gf.  However once we start playing she is the one cajoling me to set up another scenario, or to flip the board to play the other side just one more time.  It's almost as if she's ashamed to admit at first that she enjoys playing a game which on the surface seems so "boyish." The plastic army men do seem a little anti-female at first as far as a game they might enjoy.  Like I said though, I have a hard time getting this one off the table once it gets there.  Over time I think this stigma is starting to lose steam with her and she's finally succumbing to this games charms.  It's almost like a Euro in disguise.

Yes, this is a pretty simplistic view of war however I can't deny that it's an enjoyable experience.  And since I won't be getting my gf to play CC:Europe or ASL anytime soon, or ever for that matter, this fits in nicely for us.  And at least for the time being it satisfies my need for a WWII themed game.  Perhaps as my gaming circle of friends increases I will step up to beefier recreations of  this conflict and I will start to frown on this game, but for now I really enjoy getting Memoir onto the table.  I look forward to trying out some of the other Command & Colors games as well.  I think Battlelore will be a hit. And I thought getting her to play with plastic army men was tough.  Wait until I throw the plastic dwarfs, goblins, and giant spider on her.  Again, I will get "the look" and then we'll kill two to three hours without even knowing where the time went.

I liked this game some time ago when I purchased it.
  
It uses the Commands and Colors by Richard Berg system set into WWII.  I played a few times on my own and became a little bored with it.  In late 2007 a friend and I played and it simply didn't have enough competition for us compared to "Ancients" which we both enjoy more.  

I gave my copy back to the FLGS to pass along to someone who would enjoy it more as space for me is always limited.  Good game.  

I simply like Ancients better and if I want to game WW2 I will probably pull out Combat Commander or maybe Lock n Load or one of my Chit (Victory Lost, etc) games.

Juego de recreación histórica. Es un wargame ligero, en el que se elimina la componente estratégica y se prioriza la componente táctica. Recrea, a través de escenarios, distintas batallas de la segunda guerra mundial.
En cada momento dispones de cartas que te permiten indicar qué acciones podrías realizar en cada uno de los flancos. Se le critica precisamente porque la suerte puede bloquearte flancos, o no permitirte acciones en las zonas donde interesaría.

Game mechanics are great, and perfect for anyone who finds wargames like Warhammer to be too complex and not clear enough. The game board is nice, but the two major annoyances I have so far are the hexes being double-sided and an absolute chore to find the ones you need on the other side of the ones you've already placed, and the fact that the artillery is really breakable. A wheel came off one of them the second I unboxed the thing. I've only had a solo game to learn it myself, may update after I play it with one of my gaming friends.

After quite a few plays with the base game only...I'm feeling underwhelmed.  It seems like there are too few opportunities to actually employ battlefield tactics.  Instead, games average down to majority wins.  If checkers and WW II made a baby...it might be named Memoir '44. :)

This game is not without it's positives.  WW II is my favorite game theme.  And it's always nice to have a few quick-playing games in one's collection.  The board, terrain tiles, and cards are nice quality (though the plastic figures are cheap and unimpressive).  I dunno.  I will probably crack open some of the expansions to see what, if any, depth those might add.   For now, I'm keeping an open mind.

Really expected to like this, but so far it's been mostly an exercise in frustration.  I always seem to start the game with no cards for the guys I need to move, and by the time I get cards that allow me to move them they're mostly dead.  [I'm told I take this game too seriously.]

Not sure what to make of this game, I can't rate it yet. It certainly has excellent components and is a very easy game to play. Reminds me of when I was 10 and crawled around on the floor playing battles with 1/72 scale soldiers...still just as bloody and random. I like the stance it has with youngsters and it is undoubtably a gaming dream for anyone under 12, and it'll teach them about something that's easily forgotten (WW2 :) For any Grognards I think it has playability with younger family members (Get the baby to just point out a card...could lead to your most humiliating defeat in history) OR playability with alot of beer and pretzels, certainly the level of concentration needed wouldn't be beyond the heavily inebrieated but still plenty of fun all the same.

Nice surprise of the game.  Even my wife like it, and its a wargame!  Granted, it's simplified from most wargames, but the flavor is definitely the same.  Nice components, great hex terrain system, nice dice, nice miniatures.  I enjoyed the command card orders, though can see why some would not like this technique.  Definitely some luck in this game, which I don't mind, but also a lot of strategy.  16 Scenarios is the first gamebox is great! (5 in Mansions?  Pathetic).

This is a really good fun game, but slightly let-down by the feeling that it should be more strategic; the luck factor (lots dice and random command cards) does get in the way a bit, for a wargame -- but, still, hugely good fun nonetheless.

It's now old enough that it seems that it slips past other people's radars, but this is still an evergreen for my wife and I. This is such a solid and diverse two player experience, and if you're into history, the scenarios will keep you coming back. This is a real slug fest of a war game, though. It can be a bit luck heavy for those that aren't into yelling at their dice roles, but the game does a good job of having some good tactical and strategic choices that can still fuel your creativity. Overall a very solid, streamlined and gorgeous two-player affair. If setup wasn't a bit of a bear, I might play more of it, as some games play in like 20 minutes.

But once you've crossed the line for heavier games you don't really want to spend time with Memoir.

A nice light war game.  It can be taught in about a half hour and usually plays in about 45 minutes (probably faster once both people know what they're doing).  I'm still a bit uncertain how much strategy there is in this game.  So far most of my games have been determined largely by luck.

This is the type of game when even if I lose (which happens quite frequently!) I still have a blast.  That's the kind of game I love.

I've revised my rating from a 10 to an 8.5, since--I've realized--if a game doesn't come out too often, it probably isn't a 10.  That said, I reserve the right to increase the rating again!

...and indeed, now that I've gotten most of the expansions (save some of the map-based ones), I have raised it back to a 9.  It helps that I have a nice Plano tacklebox to store everything.

I hate wargames but this one is really the only exception; the only flaw in my opinion is represented by the many scenarios in which you simply have to destroy more units then the opponent; I prefer much more scenarios in which players must conquer some strategic objectives; but even in this case you can win by simply destroying more units and not caring at all of them. This is the only reason why I don't rate it a 10

Enjoyable euro-style game with a well-executed WWII theme. Consistenly interesting strategic decisions, plus the tactical play required by limited card selections.

This being said, my rating drops by a minimum of 3 points if playing with an AP-prone opponent, as the base game simply lacks the level of strategy required to justify spending more than 1 / 1:30 hours per side, per scenario. What is a fun tactical romp at one hour becomes a painful slog when dragged out to three.

Memoir '44 is awesome.  I've cooled on it a little since it first arrived, but not by a lot - we both enjoy this one very much.  Really, it's about as deep as I want a (non-Euro) war game to be.  I find some of the play gets dictated a bit too much by the cards (that is, some of the cards feel too powerful), but otherwise the system is a nice balance between control and chaos.  The bits are great, this is definitely a game you can get into, whichever side you are playing.  We really enjoy match play with this one (seems like the only fair way to do it, really).

I can see this game is going to be a money pit, though.  I've managed to snag the Eastern Front expansion and the Winter/Desert map through a math trade, and it adds even more goodness to the game - the Eastern battles are epic and make use of terrain in much more interesting ways than the early hedgerow slogs in the Western front.  I REALLY want the Campaign book, which basically lets you re-fight the war one battle at a time, with the outcome of each battle affecting the next.  I'm just waiting until I've acquired the necessary components (the Terrain pack, the Air pack, and the book) before we get going on this, which is also perhaps why I've cooled on this lately.  My only complaint (shared by many) is the set-up time required - expect to put in at least a solid 30 min getting the board ready.  It's well worth it, though.  Can Days of Wonder make a bad game?

I have this for light games, and Tide of Iron for heavier games (and Conflict of Heroes and Combat Commander, too).  I like ToI with wargaming friends, and Memoir when I have to teach the rules myself.  Rating up, and I am really looking forward to playing some Sword of Stalingrad this summer.

Well, getting pasted didn't help my impression of the game, a fact I readily admit, but I also had a couple other concerns regarding the game.  First and foremost, playing a battle that ends in 20 minutes isn't all that satisfying... even if you play it twice.  The speed of the game seems artificial.  Second - dice AND cards?  Get out the body bags, 'cause I'm not winning this with my luck.  Lost Pegasus Bridge 4-1 and 4-2 for a total score of 8-3... hit almost nothing, got hit every time, and never got cards for the right flank as Germany... too much luck for me, and this game (like A&A: D-Day) is too short for the rolls to balance out.  Get lousy draw/rolls early and you might as well start the game over.

Deeply impressed with this as a two-player game, after a false bad first impression with multiplayer.

Several of the expansions look worthwhile.

Lovely historical flavour in the mission summaries. One of my favourite 2p games. Playing a series against my buddy. He is winning as the Axis powers. If I'd been in charge of the real thing Europe would likely still be under the heel of the Axis powers. Also own Air pack, eastern front, pacific, Mediterranean and terrain pack, winter/desert map and CB1&2.

RATING: 5
A little conflicted on this one after playing half-a-dozen times. Is it good and entertaining? Sure. But somehow it doesn't rise to the level of being at all engrossing like some of the better light wargames (Wizard Kings, for instance). For me, I don't agonize over choices, decisions are generally pretty obvious. Sometimes the flavor is good and it feels like a WWII game, sometimes it falls flat and you're just pushing around plastic - it depends a lot on the flow of the cards.

This is a decent enough game. It's fun, it's short, it's simple, there are lots of close games, and it's a lot better than any of the Axis & Allies games or Risk or Eagle games or most stuff in the "simple with lots of plastic" genre, if only because it's short. But it falls into the second tier for me, the "good stuff that I'm glad I bought but aren't exactly top tier and I'll probably sell eventually".

Memoir '44's predecessor, Battle Cry, had a bad entertainment vector for me. It was great for a half a dozen or so plays but crashed very, very rapidly after that. Memoir '44 hasn't entered that death spiral and I'm pretty sure it won't anytime soon, beacuse it's much more varied than Battle Cry. But for me, it's hard not to wish for a little more tension, a few more tough choices, that would punch it up over the top. As it is, a fun game - good especially for playing with kids - but for me probably not a classic.

Another comment is that some of the scenarios are really quite rediculously bad, which is not so good. Also, there is little to zero historical relevancy in the box aside from the blurbs introducing the scenarios. And what's with all the French scenarios? You'd think the liberation of France was mostly a French affair, and the British were some sort of bit player.

The Overlord format, while it sounds good in principle, is in my experience painfully bad. You've doubled the size of the game, but quadrupled the number of players, and Memoir '44 is a game that is already flirting with being boring at times. Halve your decision-making input, and it becomes a snoozer. 8-player Overlord is a party game, not a "real" game.

RATING: 9
I am loving this game.  Simple rules, fast gameplay, stressful decisions and tense moments, this game has it all.  The randomness does not really bother me given the setting of the game.  Additionally, the cards seem to offer ways of ironing out any disparities. After an incredibly close and particularly tense play of Sword Beach, I've purchased this for myself.  A must have.

UPDATE: The overlord version is very highly recommended.  The friend I usually play with and I took charge each of one side, added a semi-experienced general to each of our teams and then introduced four new players, two to a side.  Worked great.  My side was annihilated and it was still fun!

RATING: 7
I played Memoir '44 a ton when it first came out, and remained interested for a long time!  However, 7 years into the life of the game, and I find I'm a lot less excited than I used to be (Memoir '44 was a 10 for me at one point).

However, it's still a fun game that I'm happy to play!  The hand management aspect combined with the positioning of units is a pretty fun experience, and the multitude of scenarios ensures that every game is different.

The main drawback to me is the tedious set-up for each scenario.  The game plays rather quickly, but the set-up can be a real drag.

Other than that, a fun game that is amplified with great production values and a slew of expansions that add cool new twists to the game.  It's sure to remain a solid 2-player game in my collection for a long time to come.

RATING: 6
Holy hell, this game is addictive.  See, I'm much better at tactics than strategy; I like war and historical atmosphere, but I don't actually know any history or have any interest in faithfully simulating it; and I'm great at picking up on games quickly, but just stupid enough to never actually "solve" them.  In short, this game is made for me.  Short play time + asymmetric starting positions & powers + pure unadulterated aggression + limited meaningful choice at any one time = 100% pure, uncut, Columbian awesome.  

That's not to say this is the perfect game.  Far from it, actually.  The gameplay is overly simplistic.  There are a limited number of troop types, movement and combat rules are basic and rather unrealistic/inexplicable, and the outcome of battles frequently turns on the luck of the card draw (which usually only let you activate troops on 1/3 of the board, whether you have troops there or not).  It's a short enough game, however, that you can fill an afternoon playing best 4/6 (3 scenarios played twice, alternating sides) in about the time it would take to get in a full game of Through the Ages.  

And these aren't flaws.  The game is still very fun.  It's just sort of unsatisfying.  It's like gorging yourself on halloween candy, or watching a marathon of Aqua Teen Hunger Force, or creating a Candyland variant/drinking game.  It's great enjoyment at the time, and hard to stop, but afterwards you feel a little...unfulfilled (and maybe a tad bit ashamed).  

Overall, it's a hard game to rate for the reasons stated above.  For someone looking to get into wargaming, it's a good start.  For someone who doesn't give a damn about strategic depth and just wants a game that's fun, it's perfect (kinda like Galaxy Trucker).  But there'll always be something gnawing at me after I'm done playing (conscience?), and I'm not sure just how much that will start to bother me with repeated plays.

Miniatures- Great look and feel! Easy to see where the damage is and what your fighting against
Expansions- GREAT expansions and ideas in play and terrain. 
Scenarios- Its like a game of a million games. Tons and tons of official and user created content. You could play a game a day for years and never play the same game twice.. Im pretty sure thats an accurate statement too. 
Ease of play. Most people can get it right away. 

The one dislike is getting stuck with bad cards in a 4 card game. Sometimes your pinned under a rock, and the whole time you are trying to get out. I have tried playing the game using action point like in Hold the Line and its much better

RATING: 7
M'44 is a fun beer&pretzels entry-level wargame most suitable for kids, intergenerational gaming and adult gamers, who wish to take a break from more complex fare. Stunning components, short playing time, simple - yet expandable and highly customizable - rules and a reasonable portrayal of WWII warfare make this a fun and accessible gaming experience.

Having played both Battlecry and C&C: Ancients, I do feel M'44 is the most successful in the series. Battlecry's relatively bland, whereas Ancients - despite the greater complexity - doesn't IMO do as good a job portraying ancient battles as M'44 does in bringing WWII to the table. Why? My major beef with Ancients is that the critical weakness of flanks and the rear hardly are taken account of. Given the nature of modern warfare, this is no issue in M'44. 

Cards determine which options are open to you. The key here is to make the most of those (card) assets given to you. In 'simulation' terms, I believe your options being limited by the cards also makes enough sense. Lets assume you're a battalion commander. Not having any left flank section cards even though you want to order those units into battle might simply mean that your company commander in charge of that section of the front refuses to budge (a common occurrence in warfare) or communications with those troops have broken down. Similarly, not having say the air support tactical card, simply means that your superiors are denying you the requested air strike.I think such command issues provide greater realism than the traditional god-like powers allowing you to force each and every unit to engage in 24/7 combat.

Rules read.  Once my life gets less hectic and Heather thinks she wants a girls night out i will hassle Miek to either come to me, or I will go over to his to play.  I want all the expansions as well.



It has been so long since I wrote above, I am thinking literally YEARS!  I got my first play of the game and I am very impressed.  Even though I have read the rulebook MANY times it has been so long since doing so that both Mike and I had to brush up on the rules, but since each scenario adds another element it was easy to cherry pick what rules we really needed to understand.  Neither Mike nor I were disappointed, although it might just be a little simplistic for Mike's taste in war/miniature game!  My only frustration came from the gameboard which really did not want to lay flat, and I do not want to manipulate it too much and possibly destroy the board.  I defnitely want to get the expansions now and play through all scenarios.  I felt a depth to the game that the simple ruleset almost hides.  Very fun.  A solid 8 out of 10 which can only grow.  9/23/10

UPDATE I am in the process of rethinking my rating after having a really good time playing it


The setup and fiddlines kind of spoils it for me. Too much setup and bookkeeping for such an insubstantial wargame. It's kind of fun, and might serve as a decent introduction to wargaming, but it really doesn't do much for me. 

There is some room for some tactical thought but it's pretty shallow overall. I'll give it a 7 since its pretty decent for what it is, but really, when it comes to light eurogaming, I'd rather play Samurai, PR, Ra, and so on. As a wargame it has a very limited appeal.

An okay light wargame. The mechanics are smooth and polished, but my biggest problem with it is the balance. One side always has the advantage, so to really even it out you have to play two games and swap sides afterward. While I applaud Days of Wonder for making a wargame that's light enough for anyone to play and plays in a decent amount of time, it's just a little too shallow for my taste and gets somewhat mechanical. BattleLore is infinitely better.

A wargame that my wife enjoys.  Doesn't that speek volumes?  Enough luck and pretty bits to suck many people that would not normally play wargames.  A scenario, including setup, only takes about an hour.  Scenario unbalance is a great way to let less experienced players have a handicap.

I would have enjoyed this as a kid but as a World War II buff, I find it lacks any historical depth, is pretty abstract and overly random with an unbalanced and gamey activation mechanic.

Three plays and it just isn't doing it for me. I appreciate how quick it is to play (set-up is almost too long), but I'm just not falling for this game. Wonderful bits, production, and support from Days of Wonder---wish the game was more than just blah for me. 

Update: Played again and it was really fun. Didn't take it too seriously and that helped. I think I was having an anti-buzz reaction my first plays. Upped rating, but now I won't be coming back to it because it just doesn't thematically click for me, not because I dislike it as a design.

Nothing wrong with the card-driven mechanic.  But an easier way of playing the Command & Colors system with beginners (who don't speak English and so can't readily read the cards!) is to use the dice to determine commands / actions, and use regular d6 for combat.

I used to own the base game of this and sold it back in 2006. It just didn't click with me. In 2012 I played the breakthrough version of this game and realized that it was the perfect light game for my gaming group (most of whom won't play heavy/long games).

I am now hooked on this whole game system. I have hardly ever had so much FUN playing a game as I have this one. Plus I am using it to supplement my children's history education of WW2. Not because of historical accuracy, but because when we play it leads to further research on what really happened. 

Bottom line: This is one of my favorite games and I love playing it!

I agonized between choosing this or Commands and Colors: Ancients. Ultimately chose M44 because I predicted my wife would be more inclined to play this version of the C&C system. Why? More attractive components, a more engaging theme for her, and a base game that contains a more manageable set of units and rules. 

I was right about pretty much everything but the theme. My wife found the WW2 theme unsettling, and consequently this is not getting much play. However, I'm still holding onto the game because I do enjoy it. With all the scenarios and setups, M44 is a very flexible game that plays quick, offers interesting decisions, with a dollop of luck of the dice.

M44 is also an excellent entry into the "commands and colors" system, as there are really only three different types of units. Any complexity is really via the different types of terrain. 

I'm afraid that if I get any frequent plays out of this game, it will be via the Overlord maps. Since I've lost my wife as a possible opponent in two-player-only games, I expect that the game that will hit the table more under those circumstances is instead Commands and Colors: Ancients.

Update: I had picked up some Overlord maps, but ultimately traded all that away because it simply wasn't getting any play. I'm still holding onto the base game. My C&C game of choice is Battlelore 2nd edition, but the sheer simplicity and approachability of this game makes me want to hang onto it... for now.

Update: Sold off the remaining M44 stuff. That's not an indictment of the game. I think it's a great game. I just concluded I have room for only one Commands and Colors game in my collection, and Battlelore 2nd edition was getting more play.

The way the cards limit your tatical choices makes your choices much more difficult and more interesting. The ruleset is very simple and fun. It is great to set up and play a wargame in less than half an hour.

RATING: 8
Good campaign design!  The pieces are good and easy to learn.  It is good for the war game beginners!  Although it is not a war game, I like its simple mechanism.  Easy to teach the rules with my wife and kids.  I'm going to buy the Campaign Book Volume I.

RATING: 6.5
Granting that it bares little resemblance to reality, or a balanced game for that matter, it _is_ a fun game that can be played twice in an evening .... with a five year old should you desire, and that has some value.

Rated 7 for play with kids or during very short sessions when nothing else can make it to the table.
In other situations I'd rate the game a 6.

The ergonomics of the game can be an issue however with opposing figurines that are too similar in color, don't fit in the hexes, and get to be a pain to wrangle.  In particular M'44 suffers relative to its Battle Cry/ CC:x sisters from the inclusion of "elite" unit markers that are added into the already crowded hexes.  Worst case, you have an elite panzer unit that has four tanks mashed into a hex and a marker teetering on top.

I like the command and colors system, and I adore games about the second world war.  The fact that I can get my girlfriend to play it with me is a bonus.  I wish I could get games of something more complicated going, but I'll take a light game of Memoir.

RATING: 6
Overall a good "entry level" wargame. To be clear, the evaluation for Wargame stands between 1 and 2, but if you play it as a light simulation game, here's my final evaluation. Not only sure about the card deck, there are some "combo" that spoil the fun (e.g. Air Superiority and Barrage in the opening hand)

Fun game.  I like any game where I can play with little army men.  I've only played one game, and we totally tied.  But I call it a moral victory because I took the bridges like the scenario called for!  I like the different scenarios.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game for quick battles with lots of lots of replayability.  I'm not a huge fan of the way DoW does the expansions for the game where you pretty much have to have one expansion to play another in many cases, but at least there's lots of added opportunities here.  And the expansions themselves are quality, albeit pricey. Mem44 is excellent for bringing your kids into very light wargaming, although it's not a true wargame, but prepares them for the heavier stuff. My 12 yr old son loves the game and now wants to soak up all things World War II. Great components, simple system, highly recommend.

RATING: 8
This game gets me thinking. I am not a big fan of 2 player war games but this one feels different while being similar. The game looks fantastic and makes you want to play. The set up is a little tedious and the game can be slow with newer players but that does not hurt the game. I have played this game many times with my 10 year old son and we enjoy it. The one thing I do not care for is all the luck. There are dice which dictate the death of troops or not and then the cards the tell which troops can act. If you do not get the right cards the game can be frustrating. I understand how this reflects the true feel of how war goes...but that does not mean I have to like it. Overall I like the game and should give it an 8 but juts can't. How bout 7.8 

Overall Score 7, Appearence 9, Components 9, The Box (storage) 8, Rulebook 8, Ease of Play 8, Mechanics 6, Involvment 7, Replayability 8, Uniqueness 7, Luck 6 v Strategy 4 (The higher the number the more it leans that way.)

GATEWAY WAR GAME!

Got my girlfriend playing this (having never played war games) and a month later we're sitting around playing Twilight Struggle and other heavy GMT games.

This game is wonderful!  Fantastic theme and respect for the subject matter; it's downright educational!  Game mechanics can be explained in 10 minutes and you're off.  I feel the dice and cards provide just enough luck to add tension to a solid strategy game.

The components are out of this world good for the price.  Two different boards, and a book full of scenarios to change it up.  Additionally, there are lots of other set ups available on the DoW website.

Also, it plays very quickly, which can lead to multiple scenarios in an evening.

Can't recommend this one enough!  I want the campaign book so bad!

The various types of goals add much depth to the system.  Appeals to the light-hearted, the dedicated, those from the miniatures wargames background, and those from the eurogames background.  With the release of other entries in the Commands and Colors system, this one might not get as much play due to theme and the advancements other entries bring to the system.

Kandy-koated wargame. Simple mechanics that work if you're not expecting ASL-level granularity. The main downside is setup and tear-down time, and given my druthers I'd opt for Fading Glory if I needed a 60 minute wargame fix, but this is extremely light and accessible.

:star::star::star::star::nostar::nostar::nostar:; Memoir holds a special place in my heart. It would be a game treasured if it stood alone, but as part of the Commands & Colors series it just isn't as engaging. It's the PERFECT light wargame, but after you discover CC:A or CC:N there is no spark left.

EDIT: I'd like to say though, that if I ever have a son. I'd pick up a new copy of this game to start him in the hobby. It is still a lot of fun.

RATING: 7
Wow, I love this game.  Never played a scenario where I didn't have fun whether I won or lost.  Not terribly strategic but fairly tactical.  Having to move as a result of card draws can be frustrating but I just seem to have so much fun moving my little tanks and men around I usually don't end up stressing over it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I absolutely loved playing this game.  The rules were quick to learn and we spent most of the time playing and working on strategy and tactics.  To get there, there is quite a bit of abstraction, but still good fun and with a great theme.  As war games go, it is on the light side...but that isn't a bad thing these days.  With so little time to devote to war games, being able to play two light games in an evening is better than playing a super heavy over the course of a month.  Unless you are single, unemployed, retired, or a student, who has time to play the greats like Wacht am Rhein?

Ace! Particularly when played with the Campaign Book. Recently got it to the table again and restarted the Battle of Normandy. Such a fun game.

UPDATE: Marked down slightly due to its simplicity. I've since played Combat Commander; a far deeper and more interesting game. I appreciate the fact that Memoir is supposed to represent a more abstract approach to war, but now I know what can be achieved with a war game it doesn't feel right to award this an 8.5.

All time favorite game.  I love the era, I love the C&C system, I love the components.  In particular, I love the abstract battles where I can keep all of a unit's attributes (movement, battle dice, and range) in my head.  I also like the variety in all the scenarios and the endless possibilities of the expansions.  DOW has also established an awesome community that enhances gameplay and allows for new opponents via Vassal.  This is my all-time favorite game and will remain so for quite some time.  With almost 200 plays, I am no where near the end of all the scenarios nor has my enthusiasm declined from the moment I opened the box.

Memoir was a surprise. I'm not the biggest fan of WW2-based wargames, but SU&SD kept going on about how it was a great game for people who didn't typically like them. I found it used for a good price. The rules are easily digestible and try to simulate the chaos and unpredictability of war more than anything.

I don't think I could play this all the time, but I've enjoyed every time I've played it.

RATING: 9
Although one might say there is always room for improvement, in my humble opinion, I feel Memoir is about as close to perfect as you can get.  It accomplishes everything it sets out to, and does it well.  There is something here for everyone outside of perhaps the hardcore grognard.  Where else can you get history, action, basic strategy, card play, dice rolling, cool componentry, and just plain fun wrapped in a system that you can teach anyone in 5 minutes flat?  Plus, put it on the shelf for 2 years and you're playing again with just a brief review of the absolutely stellar rules manual.  Other companies should learn from Days of Wonder.  They hit the nail on the head with this one.  

One play and you'll be transported back to your youth playing army men in the back yard.  What more could you want out of a game?

Light, WWII game. Beating up on Nazi's is always good time.

RATING: 8
This game finds a good balance between strategy and luck, making it easy enough to pick up and play for any gamer. Die hard strategists won't dominate (due to drawing cards and dice rolls), while new comers (to strategy games or WW2 history) won't be lost under a tonne of finnicky rules. The mechanics for movement and combat are deceptively simple, and really smooth making the longest part of a given game setup and probably decision making. A game with this much replay ability, plus the sheer versatility of the rule mechanic means this game is great value for money, gameplay wise. Not to mention the components in the box are of a very high standard. My only two gripes would be the high price and low availability of expansions (most of which are worth it for what they add) and that occasionally the game seems unfairly weighted against the axis, though again more scenarios and my own ability might have contributed to that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Well, because my taste in board games isn't always shared by my friends - I've only had one session with this game so that's what my rating is based on :) A very fun and strategic game that was pretty easy to play and very quick to learn. Very nice content and a box that had some clever storage. Had to get rid of it though since no one wanted to play it. Again, not because it wasn't a good game but because my taste in gaming isn't exactly shared by my friends. I would advice anyone who's into strategic games to pick this one up because I promise you that you and your friend(s) will have a blast with it! Would love to give it a higher rating but because I've only played it once, at which time I misread the rulebook a couple of times, I've decided not to go any higher.

A fantastic card-driven WWII game for both wargamers and non-wargamers. Short setup, fast-played, simple rules. Great components. Perfect balance between skill and luck, enjoyable for both new players and experienced players. I am not into WWII so the theme could be more exciting for me but otherwise I love this game. I still rate the theme above average because of the historic intros for all scenarios.

Simple system, plays fast and does not tax the brain much. It is however too luck dependent to be enjoyable, I might as well just roll the dice..

Wonderful components (the cards are much more durable than Battle Cry).  A theme I have a personal interest in.  Very thoughtful player aids and well-written rules.  This game is light and short...but savory.  The card-driven mechanic is nicely done, forcing you to make some interesting choices, keeping the game flowing and adding the right amount of luck.  Sometimes you can be frustrated in how the cards play out...but many times this can be your own fault at how your pieces are placed.

After a couple of years, I've found that the game doesn't really portray anything resembing WWII combat and the cutesy-poo Euro graphics really irritate me.

I do think DoW should be publicly chided for the overpriced and stupidly packaged expansions.  Definitely choose C&C Ancients over this one.

(2009-06-02) To much luck, to abstract, to get very much interest from me.  However, my son, who is currently 9, likes it and so I've put my money into it, and I've purchased three of the expansions.

Even as it is, I dislike certain things.  The playing field is not deep enough (and the "Overlord" scenarios just make that worse).  The way they try to represent elite troops and superior weapons ( such as German Panther and Tiger tanks versus US Sherman tanks) doesn't feel right.  The six-sided die are inadequate to handle the range of results needed.

A very simple wargame, easy to teach and easy to pick up.  One of my wife's favorites, likely one of few pure combat games that she'll ever enjoy.  It's quite reliant on dice, but there's enough tactical decisions to prevent you from feeling like you lose on poor luck alone.

Best [u]gateway[/u] wargame. It's not realistic nor a simulation but it's very enjoyable and playable. Very high replayability and tons of scenarios. Beautiful components.
The luck can decide some games and the scenarios are not balanced (so each scenario must be played twice, changing side). [i]Commands & Colors[/i] games are better in any aspect and a step up in complexity. But [i]Memoir[/i] has it's own place because sometimes I only need a game for easy simple fun.
[i]Optional friendly house-rule: using any useless card to command a unit (from any section).[/i]
[i]My [color=red]Solitaire[/color] variant: for the "enemy" side, take only two cards. Select one and discard the other. Try to play the robot defensible, with all units in cover.[/i]

Same game system as Commands and Colors and Battlelore. So therefore I love the game, and the theme. It is however relatively light in comparison to the others I've played with the same system, and therefore I have rated it lower (as I prefer the additional elements which add more complexity to games like Commands and Colors and Battelore). Still a solid game however.

Memoir '44, I really enjoyed this as my 1st ever wargame and it still has the most plays by far. However i feel i have "outgrown" it to some extent and will only really play it with newcomers to the genre or my other half, it is a good game but I always crave a deeper game now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The system is easy and yet still gives you something to think about on your turn.  Obviously, BattleLore and C&C Ancients take it to the next level, but there's eomthing really nice about just sitting down and playing good old M44: it's more approachable, less to remember, and still a compelling gaming experience.

I don't like being constrained by the cards in my hand and only being able to order a couple of units at a time on 1/3 of the board. I guess for commands and colors ancients this made sense, but that doesn't seem to be how combat/communication worked in world war 2. I didn't feel like I was commanding a battle. I also think I'm less interested in tactical combat than I am in the strategic direction of the war.

RATING: 7
Dec. 2, 2009 -- I've played the Pegasus Bridge scenario three times now, and while I wouldn't want Memoir '44 to be my primary means of war gaming, I can certainly appreciate the game's design and fun factor. It's not a simulation by any stretch of the imagination and some of the rules are pretty gamey, but for a filler war game, it's pretty good.

Sure, a bad hand of cards can guarantee a loss at times, but when a scenario can be completed in as little as half an hour, it's not a game-breaker. I'm looking forward to trying out the other scenarios on nights when I want a lighter war game. 7/10

Feb. 26, 2010 -- I've played Pegasus Bridge four times now and Sainte Mere-Eglise once. The scenarios are down to about 30-40 minutes of play time, which is a pretty good timeframe for the type of game Memoir '44 is. Good dice and good cards trump good tactics, so the game is a little too random for my liking. However, for a war game that plays so quickly, I can't really complain too much, especially since it's helping me to introduce wargaming to my girlfriend's oldest son. 7/10

Wow - what a great game.  I know some have complained about this not being a "simulation" - but it is.  A very simple simulation, but even in spite of that (whichever side of the debate you fall out on), wow - what a great game.  Simple but painful decisions to make every turn, you'll always want to do more, nice easy to execute mechanics, and the scenarios are great.  I think that the Eastern War set is my next purchase!

One of my 7 y.o. son's favorite games.  We started out playing open-handed to help him get used to the game and also have played with he and my husband "teaming up" against me.  He enjoys creating his own "epic battle" scenarios and loves playing around with the game.  Overall, a fun game for the family, though perhaps a bit too much luck involved between the cards and the dice.  Actually, the dice don't bother me quite as much as the cards which can really lead to a lopsided game if one side has a "poor draw" despite having an advantage at the beginning.  Looking forward to trying more scenarios.

Man, this game has been one of my fav. games since it came out.  It is simple and elegant (as is all C&C games).  On top of the historicity, and elegant design, there is something to be said about playing with toy soldiers that gets the kid in me all excited!

RATING: 7.5
If you like light, tactical games with a World War II theme and quick gameplay, buy this game right now. The dice and the command cards do add quite a bit of randomness, which can be bothersome. But this forces you to make due and adapt to the situation, just like any general must do.

Lots luck, but it doesn't matter, 'cause it's dang fun. Setup is a little much, but replayability is huge. I love the disclaimer about scenarios' intentional lack of balance, so you play them both ways and see who gets the most medals. I mean, the Allied are SUPPOSED to lose at Omaha Beach, right? But who can lose BETTER? :-)

Like many, played a lot of boardgames as a kid but then lost interest.  Picked up the hobby again a few years ago and from the beginning I've been intrigued by Memoir 44;  perhaps because it seems like a green army men version of "Tactics II", which my friends and I used to play in my cool basement on hot summer days.

I bought the game on Amazon last week and it should be arriving on Saturday.  My wife actually seems excited to try it, though I don't think she will enjoy it much.  (Solo and online play, here I come!)

UPDATE:  My wife thought the boardgame was "okay" and I suspect she will play it with me again.  However, I'd like to point out that she LOVED the online game.  We played it several times every day for over a week!  (She wanted to keep playing but I got busy at work.)

RATING: 3
Some time ago a friend of mine invited me over to play a game of Memoir '44. He knew that it was on my silent want-to-play list, and since he knew it fairly well, he offered me to play through a few scenarios. We were up and running in little time with the very first scenario, and I got a taste of the card-driven combat system.

I wish I could say I enjoyed the experience, for I'll be the first to admit that Memoir '44 does an admirable job of making a wargame subject accessible to a broad public. But I'm afraid I didn't really like the way in which the cards directed my options. In my case I had, for about two thirds of the time it took to play the game, 4 cards giving me movement options on a flank I had but a single unit on who would simply act as cannon fodder for my opponent were I to marshall him out of his hideout. If the game is about making do with what you're given, the designer should make it so that an excess of useless cards can be turned into an advantage elsewhere. Memoir '44 does not give me that option, meaning that I subsequently refuse to play from a de facto losing position. Losing because a player didn't combine his options as well as the superior opposition is fine. Losing because a player was held back by the game itself—even worse, a random card draw—is not. Now this was just a single game which probably represents something of an unlikely occurrence to begin with. So there's undoubtedly lots of opportunity to hone the skill of 'managing the randomness' in this title, meaning that over time, you will see that the more skilled player wins out over n00bs. But frankly, I can't be bothered with this pattern anymore. Too many games utilise this core idea already, and if I'm going to play a wargame I want to be able to have more control over my decisions in the first place.

I was nice to be able to try Memoir '44 in a relaxed setting, but I don't think I'll be asking for this game anytime soon again.

I'm wondering if this will become my favorite game of all time some day. After 10 plays as of today (including my first 2 wins!) I certainly do love this game. Memoir is not perfect because of the level of randomness in the game, but each battle still has plenty of great tactical choices. There have been many a game that I've lost because I didn't have the right command cards, but there have been just as many defeats from my own tactical blunders. Definently an exciting game.

A lot more depth becomes apparent after a few plays. Hand management is key and forces opportunistic moves (thematically realistic). Bags of scenarios, lots of rules for different theatres, excellent components, breakthrough maps great and campaigns as well. Ignore the naysayers who say it is pure luck, it ain't. It does have dice but terrain and other factors mitigate. Enormous fun.

Now I have played all the other published C&C versions, and strangely this is my least favorite version.  C&C:A has the cool leader effects.  Battlelore has battle back (like C&C:A) and lore (and creatures) and Battlecry is more fun themewise.

But despite all that this is still a favorite of mine.  I rank this higher because it is easy to get out and enjoy.

Am a big fan of this game, despite the fact that a gaming friend of mine has issues about it's dual luck element - the luck of getting the cards you need and the luck of the dice.

Plays a lot like Battle Cry, which I never got into.  But the smaller box for this one, if nothing else, is a huge plus--It means I could bring it with me to game nights more easily.

Solid and enjoyable - if every wargame was this kind of easygoing fun, I'd be a convert!

Two players set up a scenario situation, each with their own victory condition, and chooses how to advance and attack based on cards drawn from a "command deck."  This clever mechanism forces players to focus attacks on various fronts and to move around the board as the cards dictate.  Victory points can also be scored by eliminating an enemy's unit, which keeps the game length to a reasonable time-frame.  The combat system involves dice and modifiers, but I found it to be less complicated than Arkham Horror.

Like all Days of Wonder releases, the components are strong and the rules well laid-out.  A good player aid is a must, however - check out the files section here on BGG.  On the whole this was an enjoyable game that I'd gladly play anytime.

Great into "wargame" in that it introduces terrain modifiers and hex based movement and odds calculations depending on range and firing unit.  It's fun to move little army men around.  The command and colors system does not fit in WWII with awkward scaling (anything from squads to whole batallions) and the left/center/right flank seems out of place. The system is more suited for Ancients and perhaps Battle Cry.

Its ok.  It gets good reviews. I gave it to walker and he plays w/ his friends. The new large-map expansions may be more fun.  I often felt that success or failure is pre-determined base on the scenario. Sometimes you just can't win. I haven't figured out the strategy to overcome overwhelming odds laid out from the start of the game. 

I like the card playing aspect that constrains a commander's choices. It gives a good tactical game playing experience: I have the following resources but can only do certain things with them. This simulates the chaos and communication in tactical battle. 

The battle engine is just ok. I really like A&A dice rolling engine. Memoirs engine sometimes feels too simple. 

I watched some game play on utube. It may be a better game if I worked to retreat weakened units. 

Falls under the category: I don't know why its popular.

I bought this instead of C&C:Ancients or BattleLore  because my wife liked the theme better.  Great choice: it's rapidly becoming her most requested game.

August 2009 update: she doesn't really request this anymore, so it mainly languishes on the shelf.  A pity, but it's a good thing I only picked up one expansion.

Perhaps the fundamental problem with Memoir is there isn't ultimately much control but it also manages to feel much heavier than games with a similar amount of luck.  I've grown into a budding wargamer, and so relish the complexities that Memoir doesn't come close to, and we've both been spoiled by faster, simpler, shorter setup, and equal to or less than luck games.

Very good two player light war game. Uses very clever style of mixing the luck (bad dice day, card drawing) and skill (tactical decisions). Using the proper landscape and shelters (aka die modificators) is essential. Also each skenario is different and to win you need to adapt different styles of fighting. I believe that growing number of scenarios and new expansions will make this game a long lasting classic.

Great game here from Days Of Wonder. It should go a long way in serving a Middle School History teacher. Realitively easy to learn and quick to play, it lends itself to other scenarios that are not even in the book (Battle Of The Bulge, etc) A little high for the pocketbook for a standalone maybe, however the game is ready to play minutes after pulling off the shrink wrap. Plus the figures are tough (No rotors falling of the new and improved gyrocopter GW guys you know). All in all a good game with a good background, and a lot to give to the gamer. Well Done Days!!!

Love it. Love it love it love it.  This only gets bumped down to a 9 because Ancients is perhaps a better use of the C&C system, vis à vis the three-flank card-based orders more accurately representing fog-of-war and tactics on ancient battlegrounds versus a more modern WWII-era combat, but still great fun.  Love the endless amount of bolt-on chrome provided by the copious expansions, and Overlord must be experienced at least once, but you can still have more fun with base-set M44 than almost any other light wargame out there.

A really great beer & pretzels game to play in a short time. Great for lunch breaks or to sneak in between other games. While I prefer games with deeper overall strategy and mechanics, this game's lower complexity makes it really easy to teach, setup, and play very quickly. The more games like this are released, the slimmer the chances Risk has of every seeing the light of day again...

This really is a tremendous gaming system.  Tons of endless fun.  Overlords are fantastic too.

We have had so much fun with this that it really deserves a '10' rating.  There is an amazing amount of strategy--both overall for a scenario and tactically for individual moves.  Tons of real choices to make as to which cards to play, what pieces to activate, and when all this should happen.

Set up and teardown is a bit of a bear but the gameplay for this game is rock solid.  The game is a Tweener.  too simple for Wargamers, too random for Eurogamers and not enough Cthulu for Ameritrashers.   Gameplay is simple.  Play a card, move your guys, roll the dice and attack.  If you don't have the right card, do something else

It is what it is. A fun wargame for those that loved playing with toy soldiers as boys (or girls). A bit too luck-orientated (cards and dice are heavily involved) to attract a rating of 7 from me. It is a good game though and I recommend trying it. I am tempted to trade it but I do wonder whether it fills a niche spot in my collection that I ought not void.

Plus expansions

This game has actually become an entire system now, thanks to the many expansions. Tracking down those expansions, however, will set you back a lot of money.

Base game out of the box is perfect for introducing new gamers, but will seem flat to more experienced gamers. Once you've added more stuff, you'll find a massive variety to enjoy the game: campaign, overlord, breakthrough, and the massive D-Day Landings.

What I really love about Memoir is that you don't have to memorize tons of rules thanks to the reference cards. Simply pull the cards specific to the scenario you're playing to refresh your memory, and then play.

Setup is a pain, though, due to the inconsistent layout of the double-sided terrain tiles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
M44 has so many postive elements going for it:  it is accessible to most people, especially non-gamers (you don't need to be a wargamer to enjoy it), it's easy to learn and play, and downright beernuts, six-pack, punch-drunk fun to play despite luck being a significant part of the game.  A high quality production with more scenarios than a bowl of Cheerios (including official and user-made) raises the ante on longevity - this one is going to be around for a long time.  A word of warning:  If you have a little rugrat(s) running around (as I have) you'll probably have to spike that baby bottle before you set up a game. :)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Beautiful production. Quite enjoyable, though the card-play can get frustrating - nothing worse than setting up for an assault on one flank, than never receiving card needed to play on that flank.  Found that thing usually balanced out anyway, though. Also didn't like that there's an awful lot of little technical rules that don't seem justified by the level of randomness involved. Love that games can easily be played in under an hour - that seems like a perfect game length.  So, while some frustrating elements, I'm still more than willing to play a pickup game at any time.

Excellent quality gaming board which is reversible

A massive disappointment.  I really wanted to like this game as I love all the toys soldiers and I really wanted a short gateway game with which to entice other players.  The random element with the cards is fine by me: I can live with a system like this.  The real problem is that the units' abilties don't really correspond to anything in real life.  They may as well be coloured cubes, which robs the game of wargame-type tactical decisions.

Low complexity game, but nice to play; good step in the direction of wargames; plays smoothly; setup a bit long compared to playing time; players do not have a full grip on the battlefield, as they are dependent on the cards they receive for a particular part; for a short game like this no problem; disadvantage is the frequency of scenario imbalance (sometimes even rather big).

Memoir'44 is an excellent game that is just plain fun. Sure, there is luck and not all of the scenarios are 50/50 balanced, but that is how war works. The variety of scenarios allows for a lot of replayability, even if you only play each scenario once (but why would you?). Other than that, Memoir'44 is simple to teach and plays at a good pace. The components are really high quality as expected from Days of Wonder and the game looks awesome when set up.

Very nice thematic game in which you can replay a dozen battles of WWII. With the two-sided board, you can both play two D-Day battles or a number of other battles. Although strentgh varies per side, they usually turn out to be quite evenly matched and after playing one game you switch sides to play the other side as well. The player with the most victory medals wins the game. Tought it to my son (8) who played along with ease, although the game is in English. Will defenitily play again :)

In my mind, the peak of the Command & Colors system. There are some problems - scenario balance and historical accuracy issues being two of the biggest - but they are easy to overlook because the game is pure, simple fun to play.

Prefer this theme and level of balance over Battle Cry, and appreciate how Memoir doesn't try to take itself too seriously (Ancients) or spend more effort on production values than entertaining scenarios (BattleLore).

Played a ton of this with my boys when they were younger, and still enjoy the occasional game. Certainly not as good a game as Commands and Colors: Ancients, but I prefer the time period and enjoy the tons of expansion bits that have added some neat chrome. I especially loved the Air Pack that not only added air rules but rewrote all the scenarios using the additional rules that had been added over the years. *Not even close* to a simulation, but usually exciting and always fun. 

Especially worth it for the Overlord games...if you can get eight people to play, those games are a blast.

Update: The breakthrough scenarios have given this a bit more life...the larger boards give some room to maneuver and make for more interesting battles.

This is a great starter game if you have children that you want to introduce to strategy games. Easy to teach and can be played by kids as young as eight.

I love the theme and the game is loads of fun. Probably my favor war game.  Still, it takes forever to set up the damn scenarios, and there's a lot of luck involved since you roll for hits and draw cards randomly for tactics.  Also, it can be a chore to remember what all the different terrain types do, and it's really only for 2 players, so that limits the amount of times it makes it to the table.

We have had a blast with this game. Whereas typically we are lucky to complete one ordinary wargame in a 3-6 hour session, we have knocked out 7 or 8 scenarios of M44 in that timespan. The action is intense and the card system translates into enormous replayability. The game also accommodates team play very nicely. The game is also very well suited for house rules and home-brewed scenarios.

On the downside, perhaps a bit more luck-dependent and "gamey" (as opposed to being a more detailed sim) than some wargamers might like, but that's not a major downside. 

In summary, a nice change of pace game and a good filler before and after a main gaming session. Go for it!

This is a quick, light introduction to wargames.  Lots of dice rolling, so there's a lot of luck involved.  There is also quite a bit of luck in the card draw to order troops.  Several scenarios offer lots of replayability.

I have played this game over 40 time in the one year that I have owned this. My girlfriend and I love this game and will play it for hour one end. This game has so much replay-ability its ridiculous! The base game come this 16 scenarios, which if you play both sides, offers AT LEAST 32 games even if you never play it again. Then there are all the official and unofficial scenarios available on to DoW website. There is a really great list on BGG that has all the official ones for all the expansions. I printed out all of these and have added an extra 15 to the base game alone. 

We love that this game is pretty portable. We play it at local  coffee shops and hookah bars that have pretty good sized tables. The best part of this game is that as long as the board fits the table, you should be fine. Might need an extra chair or a little extra space on the table for the deck and your extra pieces but they don't take us to much space.

War games are not necessarily games that I've ever been interested in getting into, but adding Memoir '44 to my collection for me was a no-brainer.

The single worst war game ever made.  Pure luck.  No strategy.  I don't care how much strategy you think you have, all the luck in this game will take it away.  If you are looking for a 100% war luck strategy(uh, scratch that last word) game, this is it.  You will see one troop take out 15 tanks and 15 troops with no return fire.  Yes, only THIS game can do that.  You could be down to your last troop and win this game.  You will NEVER find a game with this much luck.  It's like that crappy movie where the hero is getting his clocked cleaned the pulls out a magic weapon and wins.  The worst balance is the cards.  It's painful how bad they were thought out.   

Even though this game has been out for a while, there is no reason the following should not be fixed.

1) add return fire
2) balance the damn cards
3) remove all the MOVE ALL cards.
4) Attack dice should equal number of components in unit.  If you have 1 man left, you get 1 die - not the same as you did when you had full strength.

These simple things could make this tolerable. 

This game is not even good to teach kids as it would teach them bad ideas.  

If I could, I would give this a negative rating.
But as long as we all know this is a TOY that wasn't thought out too well, then a 1 is ok.

Beware - Battlelore, all Command and colors and now Westeros! All use the retarded system.  What a waste of money.  

Even poor villagers could shoot back in the real war (unless it's this war where they are waiting for card).  But in that case, those same villagers will take out your tanks with a pea shooter while you do wait for one.

 Does it make money?  Do people bet on craps?  So if you like games that are 150% luck with NO strategy, this is it.  I guaranty this prevents all strategy.  NO matter what you think you know about strategy, this retarded game will remove any chance of that.

So to summarize...I hate this game.  Are you getting this.....game...strongly dislike...bad...garlic...lighting too much.......I hate you mieces to pieces!

Simple rules hard to master game. No real rule reading one read thru and play. So game play immediate. It can be frustrating or more frustrating or just damn tense and exciting and exciting again & again...want to move those troops forward...but can't MAN it gets frustrating but it has a great feel to the game and chaos rules the battlefield but when u get the right command cards...well orders finally get to the troops and u can plan an attack wow does that feel soooo good!

Yes it's unbalance then again it's not then again it runs right up to the wire then it's over in 10 minutes...defeated HOW??? Play on! I want more depth but when I'm playing I never think of that I need to concentrate-don't make a mistake...decisions...tactics...and u know wha it NEVER plays the same way twice.

A streamlined and elegant follow-up to [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/metasearch.php?searchtype=game&search=battle+cry&B1=Go]Battle Cry[/url]. The rules are easy to learn, which allows players to focus entirely on their moves. The flow of the game is very fast, with little downtime. Excellent replay value, due to the configurable layout and double-sided board. For a light game, the luck factor feels just right to me. War isn't solely about strategy and tactics.

Not a lot added from Battle Cry, but the changes are all good. Some of the improvements could be retrofitted to BC too. I do like the Take Ground & Overrun rules. Some of the scenarios, especially those on the beach, have very limited opportunities for maneuver/cover which is disappointing for a WWII tactical game. Very easy to get new players started though.

Likes: Well made. Days of Wonder really paid attention to details and it shows in both the components and the accuracy of the scenarios.

Dislikes: Unbalanced scenarios - while it did reflect history accuracy, the winner could often be picked before the first unit was moved. Not that some upsets didn't take place, but at least in the base game, many of the setups were very one sided.

I despise rules for the sake of historical accuracy.  Why not choose sides, reminisce about who won and why, shake hands and call it a day?  OTOH, Memoir is so short and so light and the fog of war in the cards is so cool, how can you hate it?  Balance is noticeably absent (for historical reasons apparently) and luck of the draw is huge.

I want to play this game more. My wife isn't much of a war gamer -- even simpler ones as these -- so this doesn't get the play time it deserves. With the miniature army men and tanks, it takes you back to your childhood. Some complain about being stuck on flanks at times, but I think that's part of the game -- just like any deck-builder, sometimes the right cards just aren't coming up. I haven't ventured into any of the expansions yet, but so far, the base game is a lot fun.

RATING: 9
Solid "Euro-esque" introductory wargame.  Appealing components.  Well-written  rulebook and handy reference cards make this game very easy to introduce to people and throw on the table for a quick match.  Excellent variety of scenarios. Great, fun game but can't help but think that just a bit more chrome would counterbalance the admittedly high luck factor. I'm always up for this one!

Command interaction simpler than C&C:Ancients (one less "dimension", many less unit types).  Terrain much more important.  Simple game to play - probably too simple for my tastes in a modern-era wargame.  Decisions dominated too much by the cards, due to most cards being left/centre/right?

My 7-year-old son and I play this occasionally.  He has fun playing with me.  It is a very quick game, and you can play several times over (alternating sides).  There's a lot of scenarios and expansions that will keep this game system entertaining you for a very long time.

Seems extremely random to me. I've had a few games that came down to a coin toss (50/50 chance of either player winning), which is unsatisfying. I have not played the later maps though, maybe it will get better with those? The problem, now, is finding a willing opponent.

I'd like to try C&C: Ancients.

I have tried to get into "real" wargames a few times and they never clicked for me. Then I tried "Memoir '44." This is a fast-moving "wargame for the rest of us." It has enough historical flavour to feel somewhat authentic, but it's just plain fun to play. Only criticism is that the set-up is a bit fiddly, but that's a reasonable trade-off for the modularity of the components. Luck plays a significant factor, but knowing how to manage your cards and making the best of what you've been dealt is a key to success. Now lusting after the expansions.

RATING: 7
I'm not a wargamer, but I love this game.  It is fun, it is exciting and it is full of suspense.  Yes, there is also a lot of luck involved, but the game is short enough, so that doesn't matter much and you just have to learn to adapt to adversity.  People usually say that the game is too light for a proper wargame, but I find that to be praise rather than criticism - I really cannot see myself playing three hour long, fiddly games, full of some complicated rules.  And this is the exact antithesis of that: relatively simple rules, short, action packed thriller.

RATING: 5
An enjoyable, although not without serious issues, simple introduction to wargaming. I'm not sure that the flank/centre/flank mechanic is right for the more modern battlefields of WWII - perhaps they could have gone with a card mix that emphasised the need for combined arms rather than coordinating wings of the battlefield.

It is also incredibly luck dependant and with two levels of 'luck' to boot - the dice and the cards. As a player you can still make good moves and bad moves, although the good moves you can make will be curtailed by the cards you have available. If you draw good cards the decisions really make themselves. Even if you make good moves the dice can completely decide the outcome.

Also, the shallow depth of the board gives the battles a linear feel that is suited to ancients warfare but not to the mobile nature of WWII. This has been somewhat rectified by the 'Breakthrough' expansion and that is the way I would prefer to play the game.

In the end even the Breakthough map did not redeem it enough and I have sold it all off.

The Battle Cry system comes to World War 2.  Players play cards to issue orders to troops, which then move and/or fire.  Victory is judged by eliminating opposition troops and taking geographical objectives.  Lovely production, with attention to detail very evident.  Game play is about 90% Battle Cry - hope your cards match your troop positions, throw tons of dice and watch your plastic melt away.  Takes about 30 minutes per scenario.

[Borg] I like it more than Battle Cry. Fun, easy to learn, and it includes super play aids for a quick start with new players.

It's a highly replayable 'system game' with tons of variable scenarios just like ASL, but is magnitudes simpler. So far the best intro wargame I've seen. 

A luck factor does exist, but the design certainly rewards good play. Exposing units when you don't have more cards for that area will get you punished, so you do that at your peril!
 
Expansions add more and more chrome-y details, but the complexity is still minimal. Finnsish ski troops, Russian commissars, minefields are all handled with ease. All are recommended for fleshing out the possibilities of the system. High payoff for these extras, lots of challenge and lots more mileage.
 
For the best version of this system go try Commands and Colors: Ancients

I have had this for a while now, and I still like it quite a lot. Nowadays I mainly play it solo, and that's mainly because all of the immediate friends who I know who could play it are hard-line figure-based war-gamers, who play such games as Flames of War, DBA, DBM, etc. If you don't paint the figures, their not interested. I recently had a look through the ratings for this game, and I am pretty sure most of the lower ratings are from these same kinds of players: Gamers who really haven't figured out that Luck plays a strong part in pretty every war game you can name bar chess. And when luck IS included, it's all about the balance between "The Fortunes of War", and strategic control. It's a very fine line to walk in game design. If M44 only had the dice, it would gain a lot of converts, but I'm pretty sure it would lose just as many players who love it. The Card play involved in this game has great similarities to Robo Rally, in that, yes, you get a random selection of cards, but it is up to YOU to make the most of what you get. That's not to say that there is a way to win with EVERY hand that you get dealt. That would go against the metaphor that a loser will state at the end of any game they may play (" It's just the hand that I was dealt"). It's all about the balance between the choices that you make, versus whether you had Luck with you on that particular day. A lot of games just forget that sometimes it just isn't your day. Yes, sometimes the Bear gets you...

This has become one of my favorite games.  It is fast, simple to learn, but has a feel of a wargame.  A great way to recreate historic battles in a reasonable amount of playing time.  


But it isn't a heavy wargame, it's more like Ameritrash.  It has basically replaced my old Axis and Allies yearnings.  An Ameritrash game for the 21st century, or a light wargame.  Don't rate it like a heavy wargame.  It is fast, fun, action packed theme. 

My favorite "thematic" game.  It will be a "10" once it hits 10 years old.

I do like this one; its like "wargame-lite" with the complexity of Risk but with a little more agency. The setup time for the game is what kills it for me - usually takes 15-20 minutes to play a 15-20 minute round. If the setup of the game was removed, I would really enjoy this one.

Ah... it's like I'm a kid again, playing with my army men except... there's tanks, and barbed-wire, and sandbags, and barricades, and artillery, and TERRAIN... oh my! For those interested in WWII history, this game attempts to re-create some of the infamous battles. The dice in the game a great (and wooden!). What I love about this game is that the battlefield is split into three sections (ie: Left Flank, Center, and Right Flank). You can only command your men each turn based on the card you play. Choose wisely!

I'm immensely glad that I picked up this game despite the complaints of too much luck being involved. The card system creates a situation where you must adapt and play against the game as much as your opponent. Of all of my games, this is the one the (non-gamer) fiance and I can play without getting mad at one another. Oddly enough, the unbalanced scenarios are a large part of this. If you're expected to lose and do so, it's no big deal. If you win unexpectedly, it's just that much sweeter.

It's also a good excuse to play with plastic army men again.

This game is fun for all. I invited lots of people to play Memoir '44 and not a single one reacted in a "meh"-like fashion at the end even though not all of them were board game enthusiasts. A fairly light game-play with an engaging strategic decision making makes it an absolute classic. If at some point one will find the game too light (which won't happen quickly) the level of complexity can be nicely manipulated thanks to a wide array of expansions. A true classic. Near perfect if it wasn't for those models of barely satisfactory quality...

A quick fun game, if not taken too seriously. Too much luck and too much of a "generic" feel to appeal to the historical wargamer in me. I hate the "search out the last guy in the squad and kill him for a trophy" aspect. Still, it can be fun with the right opponent.

The little green army men of my youth refined into an excellent game of historical WWII battles. Perfect depth and time for playing with my 8 yoa son. Look forward to playing with him as he adds strategic depth to his decisions. We always read historical facts of the battle as I try to impress a little bit that these were real events and real soldiers. A perfect "light" war game with infinite replay value.

Fairly simple and light tactical level "wargame". The Grognards won't appreciate that description, but it's what it feels like to me. It seems more wargame than something like Risk, but it may be too simple for the wargamers to consider it safely in their camp. Perhaps we shall compromise and call this a nice little gateway wargame. Superior theme (WWII) along with some actual historical context add a great deal of flavor to this game. Has a bit of an area control feel (as do many games of this type) since there is significant strategy in how you deploy your troops. Very good implementation of this style of game. Rules are easy to learn and follow.

RATING: 6
I prefer C&C Napoleonics, and perhaps slighly Samurai Battles.

This is a much faster game than the two above, both in setup and play time. But it only has 3 unit types and little synergy between them. For me this really makes C&C nappy exciting and its missing here.

Some might prefer this though, as all the games in the system are random in nature and perhaps the simpler shorter game suits that better.

I also felt that the scenarios were a little too prescriptive. Less room for improvisation strategically.

I get the feeling that you can adapt C&C to pretty much anything you want.  The biggest hit on M44 is the business model of endless expansions and many that you can't get anymore.  The moment you started needing two copies of the base game to get the newer stuff done, I decided I'm out.

Played Memoir '44 8 times so far.

I enjoyed all the games that I played so far. Memoir '44 was a nice surprise for a non-wargamer like myself. Having different scenarios is great.

I might look into trying getting a copy of Battlecry at some point. *UPDATE*(I did get a copy of Battlecry).

I played Memoir '44 twice with the Overlord rules. It was quite different from the 2 player version. I won both games too. Once as the left flank and the second as the cheif commander.

I enjoyed very much both overload scenarios. I might look into owning two copies of Memoir'44 to play the Overlord version with my copy. 

I am happy that I got this game in my game collection, though I don`t play that often to justify in getting the expansions.

Memoir '44 is worth looking into for any gamer.

*UPDATE* I did get the expansions. Figured that I'll get them now before they go OOP and play a higher price for them later.

If I play more of Memoir '44, might look into getting more expansions. 

8 plays since recording games played.

After a dozen plays of this excellent new game I can say this:

Smooth and fast design which seems to be more seamless and creates more tension than Battle Cry! A 100% A+ on the replay factor. You'll either love these mechanics or, if you're an anal-control-freak-type, you'll dislike them. I love them because they create a level of uncertainty that I personally feel a war game "ought" to have. Days Of Wonder, as the publisher, has managed to make this game seem not only worth the price, but a bargain. It's beautiful. Nuff' said!

One play. Not sure yet. Did enjoy myself, though. Really, really dislike the "entrenchment" sandbag bits. They look like they cover two hexsides, not the entire hex. Confused me repeatedly, even after explanation.

I think the system is great - there's enough depth that you're never really bored, but can still be played with ease. Some of the scenarios are unbalanced, but the games are so short that it doesn't really matter. I guess if you played as both sides, as the rules suggest, that scenario imbalance would be less of a problem, but I never do. I'd  rather go on to another game  or another scenario.

RATING: 7
Solid design and lots of variability with the plethora of scenarios available.  It's always fun to play a campaign, or play with scenario/expansion specific rules.  It's simplicity and fairly quick play make it very attractive.  However, the frustration caused by the dice rolling and the card drawing is practically unparallel, and can leave a sour taste after a particularly unlucky play.  Furthermore, the strategy is usually straight forward, and there is often no motivation to move your units, but to just attack instead.  This can lead to prolonged periods of monotonous dice rolling until one player happens to roll better.  In this regard, I find that the strength of Memoir only shows now when you play a full campaign, or an Overlord scenario (which is just cool).

Having thoroughly enjoyed Battle Cry for many years, it was difficult for me to shift gears and apply the card-based system to modern warfare.  I'm still not convinced the game system is well suited to modern era combat, but the game is still fun, and DoW have done a great job with the components and supporting the game on their web site.

RATING: 5
I'm not a pure Euro gamer, but find that I tend to like Euro style games more then pure Amerithrash. I enjoy some direct conflict but not as much in games where that is the primary focus. May bump this up with more plays, but right now I prefer Summoner Wars as I like the theme better, special powers and the movement restriction, that is, in Summoner Wars you have a choice as to what units to move (up to three units up to two spaces) where in Memoir movement is restricted to the luck of the card draw. One could argue there's more strategy in managing your hand in Memoir, but, as of now I don't find that as enjoyable. Further, many of Memoir's scenarios are unbalanced... while it's recommended to play 2 games, one on each side, still... not sure why I would want to play a scenario when it's heavily slanted one way or the other.

I liked this game because it was easy to get and it looked a lot more difficult. I like the fact that it tries to recreate real battles so sides are hardly ever balanced. The fact that one single soldier could take on a group of tanks with one roll of the dice is a bit too much, however. If you can accept that kind of inaccuracy, I think overall it's a great game.

I love this game. Some people feel that the setup time is too long. However I have no problem with that, I can set up a scenario in a few minutes and I enjoy doing that kind of stuff. 
The game balance is amazing, the scenarios are designed so well. This is just an amazingly fun game, it moves quick, it's easy to learn...I could go on and on. I have 3 expansions and the first campaign book. I also play it online. I highly recommend this game for anyone interested in wargames and/or WWII. I'm sure there are some hardcore wargamers out there that probably feel this is too soft and unrealistic. But who cares. It's so much fun.

A solid, simplified wargame. What I like most is the ability to play a complete game in about an hour. The rules are deep enough without becoming tedious like so many hardcore wargames. The varied scenarios included in the box also keep the game fresh - lots of replay value here. Throw in a few expansions and you could be playing Memoir '44 for years!

Revised for 2012: Almost 2 years later, I have to drop my score from an 8 to maybe a 7. It was fun while it lasted, but this title rarely makes it to the game table anymore. The scenarios just aren't as deep as I would like. I favor more complex wargames these days.

More randomness than I expected from both the die and deck. I expected the deck to just limit actions mostly, but the disproportionate power of some grey cards made it more swingy.

Defensive bonuses are extremely powerful, turning most every game into one player storming the other's heavy fortifications and repeatedly rolling a single pathetic die, putting them even more at the mercy of luck as the chance isn't balanced out by the quantity of rolls as much. Thematic maybe, but boring.

A truly excellent World War II game.  This is a game that my buddy and I can play again and again and never get bored.  While there is definitely some out there that think the game is based too much in luck of the dice roll or card draws, I feel that there is definitely a lot of strategy to be had.  A classic that I never get tired of playing and sometimes I can even get my wife to say "Alright we can try a complicated Memoir scenario."

Better than CC: Ancients. Good ratio of rules/ease of play/tactics. After playing though a few scenarios of CC:A and Memoir '44 I will say that the system is better suited for a simpler game. 

Oh, and the scenarios in Memoir 44 are amazing. 

ALWAYS play with each player taking both sides. 

8 to 6. The game just doesn't have legs for me. I feel like I'm just playing out the most obvious strategy or getting stuck with crappy cards.

The only thing I personally don't like about the game are the scenarios that don't offer some kind of strategic goals or alternative winning options, because those games tend to end in a very non-thematic race for the last kill, regardless of any tactical/strategical point of view.

The game is visually appealing, and even the randomness of the card draw and dice rolling can be treated as brainless fun, BUT poor scenario design (so unbalancing!) makes a mockery of game play.

I loved M44 when I first got it :- fast-paced, fun and exciting. However, after about a dozen games or so it has become, well ........... dull.

I find that it no longer holds much in the way of interest for me. Command and Colors: Ancients is a much better game.

Update - I have returned to M'44 a couple of times, and find it to be a reasonable filler. I wouldn't spend money on any expansions.

RATING: 6
Fun Casual Game; Ultra Light Wargame (would be only a "light" wargame but there is a bit too much luck involved). Not the type of game you can plan to play for an evening unlike many other beer and pretzel wargames, but on the other hand can finish a fun game in 35 minutes. Basic game only handles 2 player though, so imho the audience is really the game to play with the son or daughter -- when you have 3+ of your nonwargaming friends around probably play another game.

Muy bueno, muy rápido y sobretodo lo original es que jugamos con los 2 bandos, primero uno y después otro y así se compensan los escenarios.

An impressive Euro-game styled war game.  It is based on the same game system as Battle Cry, but improves it.  Battlelore is also based on the same game system, but adds a fantasy theme, lore cards, and focuses more on melee, whereas I prefer the ranged combat and historical theme of Memoir 44.  Having played through several of the first few scenarios, my initial impressions are very positive.  Despite having a considerable luck element (both in card draw and dice rolling), Memoir 44 allows enough room for decision making and strategy, and the toy factor helps make it buckets of fun, and appealing to a variety of ages.  A big thumbs up!

Odds of an Allied victory for the standard Memoir '44 scenarios:
69% - 1. Pegasus Bridge
63% - 2. Sainte Mère-Église
46% - 3. Sword Beach 
66% - 4. Pointe-du-Hoc
19% - 5. Omaha Beach: First Assault Wave
41% - 6. Mont Mouchet 
35% - 7. Vassieux, Vercors 
52% - 8. Operation Cobra
39% - 9. Operation Lüttich: Counterattack on Mortain
67% - 10. Toulon (Mediterranean front)
75% - 11. Liberation of Paris 
54% - 12. Montélimar (Mediterranean front)
80% - 13. Arnhem Bridge 
65% - 14. Arracourt 
45% - 15. St-Vith, Ardennes
47% - 16. Saverne Gap, Vosges

GREAT game, and tons of web support.  In my heart of hearts I know this game is slightly better designed than its predecessor, Battle Cry, but thematically WWII leaves me kind of cold.

What always happens is you set up a scenario and immediately suspect that it's egregiously one-sided.  Then you actually play and realize that once again, you were wrong; most every scenario is well-balanced.

I’m not sure what this game is, but it’s not a wargame, at least not a game about WWII -- and yet … I totally get the allure of it. Let me explain. 

The way the rules work as an attempt at simulating command and control leads to absurd situations. Furthermore, the nature of the victory conditions is such that the map is rendered irrelevant. Sure, the hexes have terrain relevance when rolling dice, but you’re not playing the map in any realistic way, you’re just moving units and chucking dice to see who can get more hits before the other guy and end the match immediately regardless of the position of your forces. 

The result is more often than not something completely unrealistic and ahistorical. I’ve played my share of games f-t-f as well as the Days of Wonder app and in every single Normandy game, the Germans have brought units down onto the beach. Something ridiculous like that happens in every game, like one desperately broken unit forging ahead deep into enemy lines so they can pick off the last enemy unit for victory – as if they could suddenly call “time out!” on the battlefield. It’s one thing to have these ridiculous medals for victory conditions but the sudden death nature of how they’re enacted forces players to play a race for dice odds positioning not anything resembling actual battlefield tactics. The only resemblance to WWII are the army men you play with, but it could be rethemed and the experience would not change. 

And yet I get why this game is so damn popular. Managing a hand of cards and seeing if you can get the right card at the right time has a certain appeal. I'm not immune to the allure of seeing what cards I got and what surprises I can spring on my opponent. But in truth, it's easy to figure which card to play each turn (rarely not glaringly obvious) so there's little thought about what you should do, and then the dice take care of the rest anyway. 

The result is a low-stress wargame experience with a low rules overhead; ersatz decisions perfect for the casual gamer. Throw in some detailed figures, terrain, and a bunch of expansions for different theaters, and you’ve got a cash cow built on absurdity. It's the Olive Garden of wargames. 

Kudos, I guess?

Not sold on this. The command card system in this game (can't speak for other Command and Colors games) seems to be horribly balanced. Too many times you get cards that are mostly useless or 100% useless, which fill your hand and leave your helpless.

It goes beyond any kind of thematic fog of war implication and into the absurd.

The game has excellent looks. The positive side the fact that you need drawing luck to receive good cards for your moves, is that it won't absorb your concentration. It is a game that when I played it for the first time and lost, I still was enthousiastic about the experience. I bought it shortly afterwards.

This game has ups and downs for me. It recreates the theme of the wwII battles, expecially in beach assaults, but it's very casual, and often battles feel won more on dices and cards than real strategy. It's not overally right what I say, since there IS strategy in the game, choices, and so on, but still there is something missing for me. Every time I play it I feel cheated somehow, even if I enjoyed the game. Is not for the "dices", since I like every type of game and I value them "among equals", not among really different games, it's the final "sensation" it gives me after every game. Because I can do a good strategy, but if I cannott attack right flank, and enemy can, I really can't do much there.

A good game, but I like Commands & Colors: Ancients much more (not because of the theme---I like WWII games---but perhaps because of the fact that units don't work together as much in Memoir '44.)

An okay game, but the dual randomness of having dice determine combat plus the high potential to draw useless cards takes a lot away for me.

Con el tiempo va subiendo de nota, y es que probar nuevos wargames le hace ganar valor: y es que tiene más o menos el mismo azar que otros juegos llenos de reglas y excepciones que provocan errores y echan para atrás, transmitiendo una sensación parecida de "batallar", en menos tiempo y disfrutando más (a costa de un poco de realismo, pero al fin y al cabo, estás en el salón de tu casa...).

Based on 60 plays.
+ One of the best games I know.
+ Additional scenarios on Days of Wonder website.
> I'm sure that a good strategy usually triumphs over some bad luck.
> I've understood that many players feel having bad luck when I see just a bad strategy.
> While BattleLore is mostly about formations of units, Memoir emphasizes terrain hexes.
> A single Memoir session was enough for my friend to acquire a copy of a similar game (BattleLore) to himself.
> Someone stated: "I've played over 200 plays of Memoir, and I'm starting to see the limit of its replayability." Wow!
- Bad luck in Command Cards may cause a defeat. However, I don't consider dice to be a problem.

Update after 20 plays in 2008: 9-->10. After a year of hesitation, I decided to use the full rating scale. This is the game that deserves my first '10'.

I feel like the command cards limit your choices too much and could create some ugly situations where, if all of your remaining units are bunched up on one side and you don't have any cards that command that area, then you could be a sitting duck for however many turns. Regardless, the game plays quickly and offers lots of different scenarios to try out.

I'm changing my rating from 7 to 6, having played this today. I have to be honest, it's just not my sort of game. It's a wargame and I'm not a wargamer.*** I'm not a wargamer and my rating reflects this. We played the opening scenario only, and I really enjoyed it, winning as the Germans. It is a dice-roller, it helps if you draw the right cards, but as a Wargame-Lite, Memoir 44 works. Quick set-up, very quick play, an open and flexible system that I found a challenge simply as a puzzle. The mechanism for variable victory conditions is brilliant. I can easily see now why this is a hit game, it would seem to reflect the dynamics of WW2 encounters. No doubt we'll see Japanese and Russian fronts released soon.

Four year-old keen on tanks and likes the dice rolling. Card mechanics a step too far; a dice roll 1,2 = 1 unit; 3,4 = 2 units, 5,6 = 3 units fits the bill with his choice of sectors. Enjoyable game and online version is a good way to learn the rules. The only problem is young-fellow isn't interested in setting up or putting game away. Update: this would rank as my eldest's (7) favourite game on his choice.

I enjoy this game for what it is - not for what it's not. It's a light CDWG, with some chaos management and lots of toy soldiers.

I love my heavier wargames, but this one scratches that itch to be a little kid again.

Played 4 times. At first it doesn't seem to quite have the atmosphere of BattleCry, but now I can't pick a favorite. The pieces are better in Memoir, and that is a huge plus. The cards are MUCH more offensive, allowing armies to engage each other more quickly (which was an intentional design to make it feel like more modern warfare.) The colors are brighter on the board, but the piece colors are quite smiilar. Overall, I think teh edge is to Memoir 44, since it is more offensive and user friendly. But I kind of miss the careful engagement of BattleCry. Excellent game. [rvRaja]

What's the big deal here people?!?  Combat is very much like Axis&Allies, the figurines are a little awkward to move around, units somehow retain their complete firepower despite depletion, the cards for both sides come from the same deck meaning that a player could luck out on the better cards and make for a quick one-sided trouncing (granted there were a few of those historically, but where's the excitement?), game play is rather bland and the tactics is dictated by the cards you're holding.  I do not understand the fuss and hype at all.

[thing=14105]C&C:Ancients[/thing] might be the better game overall, but Memoir '44 has its advantages: it plays more quickly, it makes better use of the terrain, and I love the theme.  My wife tried it again not long ago and enjoyed it.  Most of my friends play as well, so it's not too tough to get an Overlord game together every once in a while. 

Rating is for the base game out of the box. My favorite scenarios tend to be those with unusual terrain, special units, special rules and all that mumbo jumbo. So with all of the different expansions, it's an easy 10. You don't need any expansions to get started with the game, but if you insist, start with the Army Packs: just pick whichever one is most interesting to you.

My recorded plays are only for scenarios published with the base game, or scenarios published later that only require the base game. All other plays are recorded under the expansion the scenario was published with.

Fun and light and WW II.  The popularity of this game makes me think there's a niche for more entry level wargames that people can get into in half an hour.  I made a miniatures version of the game on a big board with 3-D hills, trees, towns and 1/72nd scale tanks and I'm surprised at how much I enjoy Memoir 44 as a set of miniature rules.  It really is fast fun and gives you a chance to use the terrain in clever ways.  I prefer the rules set of C&C Ancients buy enjoy the landscape layouts of Memoir.  If you don't buy it expecting a deep wargame it's good.

I like the Commands and Colors system, but Memoir just didn't do it for me.  It's a good game, but after a while it just seemed samey.  Grab the best terrain and shoot away at each other.  In other systems there's formations to consider which makes it a lot more interesting.

RATING: 4
[Dice rolling for combat, Random card draws for commands, World War II, Kid's Game] [2P:4, 8P Overlord:4] Okay, so it's Battle Cry with a WWII theme. How is it better than BC? Some of the mechanics have changed to accomodate the change of military eras, enhancing the flavor of the game, but it's not superior to BC. It's tactical-level simplified lightweight abstract combat in WWII. Works for some, but not for me. Great bits from DoW as usual, but since WWII-era toy figures are common, it's not as visually stunning as some of DoW's other work. Some Geek will doubtlessly go on and paint the figures just like Battle Cry. You can see it coming: rating is the same as Battle Cry - '4' for a nice, simple distraction with no depth and very limited replay value. Don't play more than one game at a time, or it becomes *really* annoying...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
PROS:
Historical theme, WWII
Miniatures and cool missions, even for just the base game. 
A good balance of risk taking, strategy and luck.
Fairly easy to teach, and perfect play-time. It never feels like it drags and it's pretty rare that the battles have a clear cut winner until the last turn or two.
Fairly easy to teach.

CONS:
Takes a long time to set up compared to the length of time it takes to play (about 10 minutes to set up, 30 minutes to play).
The Command Cards (you know you saw that coming) can really hurt you sometimes. It is really frustrating when you pretty much start the game with a bad hand and continue that bad luck through-out the game.

RATING: 8
The most abstract of the 3 C&C games (still in print). Normally that would cause my rating to go down slightly on a wargame but the game plays so cleanly I forget that I'm totally skipping major parts of most WWII wargames because I get so sucked into picking options. The scenario support of Memoir is head and shoulders above BattleLore! and unlike GMTs expansions of C&C:A the cost of the M'44 expansions is a little easier on the pocketbook. My only negative comment - the unit pieces are juvenille in what is otherwise a big boys game. I know I'm in the minority but I would have preferred blocks instead of little green army men. Even though its not my favorite C&C game I think it is the best overall.

RATING: 7
The game was fun but it felt too light. I felt like the game was easy to grasp but some of the card draws sucked for us. We only played the starter scenario and found it kind of empty but we had no artillery or armored units so there is definitely potential for this to be good.

Only pretends to be a wargame.  Pretty light, especially for a "wargame", but it's fun.  Unlike real wargames, kids can even get into this one.

RATING: 3
This C&C implementation pales in comparison to Ancients. Feels odd that I love this system with minor changes and another theme, but am completely turned off by it here. It just feels so cheap and flimsy when you apply it to artillery and armor, and the battle-back and coherent line rules in Ancients give the game much more flare.

BUT to be clear, the system isn't broken in Memoir. I liked it a lot before I'd played Ancients. It's not the worst gateway around (in fact it's a decent one if you can stomach the lengthy set-up), but it's a game I actively avoid. Every need is better met by Ancients.

What a fun game! I've never been hugely keen on traditional hex-based wargames, so this lighter, fluffier offering went down well. I like the card-based movement and special orders system and I thoroughly enjoyed the Pegasus Bridge scenario that we played. Of course, if I'd been my adversary and seen my troops storm forward on both flanks then get a 'close combat' special order that won the game for me, I might have given it a lower rating :)

With more replay, I might well give it a higher rating.

We found this very easy & quick to learn since it is based on Battle Cry's system which we know...if you don't know Battle Cry, I think Memoir would still be easy to learn and easier than Battle Cry since the rules and mechanics are a bit more logical. Also, it plays quicker than Battle Cry since there are more chances to move & battle during the same turn. Excellent game.

[i]Nov 2014:[/i]  I have a soft-spot as this was one of my early favorites and my gateway into wargaming. Haven't played this game in years but held on to the set because of nostalgia and a sunk-cost bias. It's time to let this one go. Plenty of expansions (see Trade Condition). Rating decayed to 7.


[i]Feb 2012:[/i]  Changing rating from 9 to 8.The base set plus an expansion or two make for a quick and fun game. Adding another slew of expansions takes mor time to setup and cleanup. For the time and complexity added, one might as well play a meatier war-game.

A war game that I can play with anyone.  Sure, it doesn't have the historical depth of other WWII tactical games, but it gets played more than others simply because it is easy to teach and it plays quickly.  I think it is a superb game with agonizing tactical decisions throughout.  I like that you are limited by your command cards.  With all of the expansions, there are plenty of scenarios to play.

Not played a ton just yet, but easy to see how this is going to be a lot of fun.  Seems to have been designed with gamers like me in mind.

I don't like the hideous imbalance between sides in the scenarios, but other than that, great game.  Would gladly play whenever I got the chance.


EDIT:  After further playing, it holds up very well.  I certainly wish all wargames were this accessible.  Playable in under an hour, tons of great components, historical scenarios that approximate famous battles and offensives just enough to wet your appetite to read more on the depicted battles...well done.

This really is a brilliant game, and my rating has increased from 8 to 9. UPDATE: Still a great game, just don't seem to geab it off the shelf (Rating 8.849, Jan 17).

Too random and too long a setup time. The components are nice but I really can't be bothered to take it off the shelves when I could be playing Combat commander instead, which is deeper, a lot quicker to setup, feels more varied and isn't really longer when you take everything into account. It does have the advantage of simplicity, but the warlike theme doesn't pull a lot of non-gamers in.

Memoir 44 is a great way to get a wargame with World War II flavour without having to get bogged down by endless simulation rules.  I think it has the right balance of luck, tactics and strategy.  Plus I am a huge fan of the components.  I'm excited to try all the scenarios. While the scenarios may not be perfectly balanced, it's nice that they are weighted towards the historic outcome and that one player may have to fight a little harder.  It's best to give that role to the player who won the last time.  Anyway, this is the simplest of Richard Borg's C&C system but it's a good time even when considering my favourite game of his, C&C: Ancients.

I thought this would be a good game to play with my son but he only really wanted to set up our own battles and didn't like the tight rigidity of the scenarios.

I found it had too much luck. Firstly the cards you draw and then when you roll dice to see if your chosen action succeeds. Maybe one or the other, but not both.

RATING: 9
Great light wargame - simple, well-designed system that can be learned quickly, with most scenarios taking less than an hour to play, but complex enough to hold one's interest for a LOT of playing.  The command card system integrates some Euro-game type aspects, and introduces some randomness as well as time-saving constraints on player choices.  Non-wargamers are much less likely to be overwhelmed by this game since they don't have to consider all the possible moves, just the ones that their command cards permit.

It took me a while to warm up to this game.  My first few playings I didn't truly understand what I was getting into so just brushed the experience off as a cheap and quick dice fest with nice bits.  

Thanks to Memoir online my knowledge of the game grew and it has become one of my personal favorites, and few 10 ratings.

Memoir is a blast to play, is deeper than it appears, and fills the need for a quick but not vacant war game. It also looks spectacular.

I love it!!!!!

My son was intensely interested in this game from the age of 6, thanks to a few mentions on the Dice Tower and some browsing of a Days of Wonder catalog that came with Ticket to Ride.

The WWII theme kept it on the back burner for me until he was old enough to discuss some of the concepts of the war before playing with its tropes.  He started pushing for it some more after his 8th birthday, so I finally bit the hook and I'm glad I did.  He and I have played this together quite a bit and really enjoyed it.

It's a little light for me, personally.  I expect that I'd enjoy some of the other C&C systems a little more.  But I'd never trade the time I spent playing this with my kid, so I'll probably never trade the game either. I know that's a fallacy, but I'm sentimental.

A classic in our house.

I just don't "get" the high rating for this game here on the geek.  It's more of a pass-time than a game.  I'm not the kind of person that decrys games for having "too much luck" (I like some luck in a game) but this game is a joke.  The dice and cards have far more influence on the outcome that any decision of the players.  There just doesn't seem to be any point in trying to win.  It's a recipe for frustration.

This was my introduction to the Commands & Colors system.  I'd never heard of Battle Cry until after I started playing Memoir '44, and still haven't had the chance to play it.  C&C Ancients and BattleLore have now more or less replaced Memoir '44 for me, but I will still come back to this game as it has a slightly different "feel" to the play and it covers a theme that interests me.

I had knocked this one down a slot as I couldn't see myself playing it much after getting C&C Ancients.  With the addition of the Air Pack I may have to move it back up again.

A good game with a big problem- the game compounds balance issues to the point where at least half the games you play will be frustrating. Individual scenarios are (deliberately) unbalanced, the command deck can give one side killer hands that make the game a blowout, and the dice are rolled just seldom enough that they don't seem to even out the probability if you're having a bad game. That being said, the system is fun and tense, despite its problems, and it's satisfying to move the beautiful pieces around.

Just a blast!  Appeals to everyone who likes games in my circle, and has even worked well with those who haven't played the 'new games' or war games before. Gets better with age.  In terms of this and Battle Cry, I give the nod to '44 only due to theme (and expansions, TBPO).

an exagon based wargame strategy game with miniature placement, dice rolling, tactical moves and scenarios. the games following a setup for the current chosen scenario, propose some of the most important WWII battles. the games procede with player issuing orders trough cards and moving their units trying to reach the goals of the mission for their faction(axis or allies). This is basically a 2 player game

Memoir '44 brings many important battles to life in a way that is both educational and fun.

Such a good battle simulator.  You really feel like you are a commander trying to win some small part of a much bigger war.  This is not a lighter version of axis and allies, you don't feel like you are winning or losing the war for either side.  But you do feel immensely invested in winning each battle.  Reminds me of the scope of band of brothers (the show), which I often watch while playing

My least favorite of the 3 C&C games I own. The units just feel too similar and it lacks the spark of BattleCry and BattleLore. I keep thinking, though, that there's a great game here if I just buy enough expansions. (Mostly I think this when I get an email from DoW announcing a new expansion.)

RATING: 6
Not the best C&C has to offer, but it is a heck of a lot of fun. Ancients has better tactics, and Battlelore has more variety in the base set, but this one is definitely easiest to get on the table and play with a non-gamer. Still, I think that C&C's non-objective based battles get boring VERY quickly.
Played again after a long hiatus, and yeah, I wasn't too impressed. The mostly non-ranged combat of Ancients fits the play better. If I want a good game with flanks and tactics, I'll play Battleground: Fantasy Warfare.  If I want a world war 2 game, I'll play Combat Commander.
The game works for non-gamers, but hell, I can just take a little more time and teach them a REAL wargame:)

RATING: 7
Acquired September 2006. 

(As of November 2006) I have played this only a few times, but the popularity of the game is easy to understand. I think it is almost amazing that a war-themed game can be played so quickly and be so much fun. It cannot be considered a "true wargame," since it only superficially re-creates actual events. Card draws and dice rolls determine most of your options and success, but it's still a fun game, especially for "old wargamers" who no longer have the time or opportunity to play the "real simulations."

May 2009 -- I haven't played this game in several years, but would be willing to do so again.

Simple rules, but lots of fun. Games are fast and scenarios offer variety. I was not an early fan of Battle Cry, but this game led me to give it another try.

RATING: 6
A very light hex wargame that is a good intro to newbies to hex wargames, it isn't very deep, the scenarios aren't very realistic, I personally don't like the little models and much rather a more informative cardboard chit.  But to a newbie the models would seem more approachable, thats for sure.  The board and pieces are beautifully crafted.

Its card driven and I really don't think the card contents add to the realism and makes the whole game a little too gamey.  The left/right/center command activation mechanic seems rather strange for a WWII game and seem more suitable for a pre-radio era game where communication laterally across the battlefield may have been an issue.  Despite all this, it is suppose to be light and in the right mood, it makes for the perfect wargame.

WWII is one of my favorite subjects.

Memoir 44' has:
Nice miniatures, many historical scenarios, very interesting expansions, short battles (you could play 2-3 in a 2 hour session).

but:

A little light for my taste.
Also, a battle system totally card driven. Can become really annoying if you don't draw the suitable cards for the occasion.
Significantly luck dependent.

Ok (very) light wargame - just 3 troop types, no morale system, scenario based - but it works well and the simple mechanics provide quick and fun game play.

There is a significant luck factor in both the draw of command cards and the luck of the combat dice - if both are against you, you are gone big time! - but the game plays quickly so just turn the board around and play again. No hidden information other than your opponents command cards exacerbates the extreme luck swings

All the bits are excellent.

A solid war-game with good and intriguing mechanics. The scenarios in the book are interesting, but get old quickly. Playing both sides of the scenario is a great way to enjoy the game. I'd rate the game higher if it weren't for the luck. I don't tend to like games where you attempt to do an action, and then see whether random chance allows you. I prefer games where the luck comes out before you make decisions.

Simplified WW2 combat! Fun tactical game to play. Quick and looks great!

Not being able to use cards for sections where you have no troops and to a lesser degree, no Battle Back, make this a sadly inferior game to C&C:Ancients.

Elegant design. It's the kind of rulebook that you read and go "ahhh, that's clever" every few sentences. The cards are excellent, the idea that a random hand dictated your only available actions (for a wargame!) originally put me off, but I quickly realized that the cards work really well.

The simplified design sometimes shoots itself in the foot, but the quick playtime encourages 'just another game' so it's not a massive failed investment if you have an uneven game.

But the design that sometimes proves frustrating is also the game's greatest strength: by only allowing the moves printed on the cards, the game completely eliminates any trace of analysis paralysis, but maintains a thrilling combination of overall strategy and tactics.

The fact that you still feel in complete control, even with limited card choices, is impressive. This game is fantastic, it really is.

Simple: yes.  Is this bad? No!  It reminded me of Panzer Leader / Panzer Blitz a la Avalon Hill but with little figs.  It also is like a "Block" game from Columbia Games in that "Pegasus Bridge" has infantry all with 4 hits per unit.  Of course that's where the similarity ends... there is no surprise element and that's why it's 9 and not 10.  This is a great game, not just good, as it sets out to have easy access to many different gamers.  This is NOT for the grognard!!!!  And those who rate it low should consider if this was ment to be a crossover game or hard core.  Buy it and keep it... I see expansions for sure.

Memoir 44 was the first tactical war game that I played. The game is easy to learn and rules are explained very well in the manual.

The time frame for the original scenarios is 1944, a period during which the german army was slowly pushed back towards Germany, so the game is a bit more difficult to win with the german side.

The game has a few strong points:

1. Setup is easy. Just place the tiles and troops on the map according to the scenario and that's it.
2. Learning time is low.
3. A very simple battle system.
4. This game is fast. Depending on the scenario and your luck with dices you can finish a map in one hour or less.

Of course there are things that could have been done better. Gun miniatures look fragile, normal armor units can barely be squeezed into a hex, terrain tiles are very easy to move if you are not careful.

Anyway winning of losing I had fun playing this game, so it still gets table time.

Very impressed.  I liked Battle Cry, but there were many annoyances and imbalances, prompting me to introduce several tweaks and rules fixes.  The problems included: the edge of the world phenomenon when retreating, too many unusable cards, no way to cycle cards, the overpowered All-Out Offensive card, and the underpowered Skirmish and Sharp Shooter cards.  Well guess what?  Memoir '44 has fixed **every single one** of these problems!  I also like the faster pace and greater maneuverability (appropriate for WWII), the new rules for close assault, and the greater variety and balance in the card mix.  Most importantly, I feel like I have important choices to make while playing Memoir '44 - something that didn't always happen in Battle Cry, where the more restrictive cards and lack of manueverability often forced me down very specific paths.  All in all, I've never seen anything better in the super-lightweight wargame category.

For reference, I rate Battle Cry 7/10 and C&C Ancients 10/10.  I lowered my rating of Memoir '44 from 9 to 8 after C&C Ancients was released.  I still enjoy playing Memoir '44, but the meatier C&C Ancients is the most satisfying game in the series.

BattleCry is far better.  To me, this system just doesn't work as well for WWII.  Way too luck driven, and the tanks in this game are insane.  Ever heard of immoblization?  I really don't get a feel for WWII from this.

The system does feel right for ancients. Too bad I already invested in Memoir.  It's ok just wish I had C&C instead.

Hard-core wargamers probably scoff at its simplicity, but that's what makes it such a great game. Memoir '44 doesn't try to be anything but what it is: a fast-playing, exciting, easy to learn wargame with superb components and interesting gameplay options. A true winner from Days of Wonder.

RATING: 10
I bought this game to play with my brother. It is one of the best two-player games out there. Yes, it's a war game, but it's very light on rules and mechanics. Otherwise, the theme of WWII battles is wonderfully recreated here with scenarios from actual battles, and the ability to create your own. The game incorporates cards to perform your actions, and creates a fantastic bluffing game because the cards only let you move and take actions on either your left flank, right flank, or in the center of the board. You could bring all of your units into one section and watch gleefully as your opponent beats a hasty retreat thinking you're going to wipe him out on the next turn, while in actuality, you don't have a single card that lets you move those units again. Fun, addictive, and a great introduction to more advanced board games, MEMOIR '44 is a masterful creation of theme, mechanics, and components.

This was a big 10, but the more I play the more I think that fog of war can be done in a much better way than by the use of Command Cards. Setup is a pain, and moving the units around without bumping in the terrain tiles is an art still to be mastered here.

Do not expect any kind of WWII tactics either. Sometimes it is better to forget all your troops and keep charging with a single tank on the beach, even as Germans. Never tried Overlord though, looks more promising.

Played this once before owning it. I received it yesterday from my Secret Santa. Today I called a buddy over and we played 9 games! We both loved it. The only thing I think is slightly off is the potential for bad luck in card draw to screw you over in not having a useable command card.

I can't say enough good things about this game.  All of my boys like to play, and they even ask me to read the historical settings for the scenarios before we play through them.

The unbalanced starting strength of the forces adds to the historic feel of the game, and it's fun to take the side that lost the historic battle and try to improve on their outcome.

That said, this is more game than simulation, but for an evening of play with my sons, that's a good thing.

Liked it a bit better than Battle Cry, although I'm not sure why (it might be the scenarios). The strict retreat rules add some real tension in the beach scenarios -- you have to get out of the ocean in a hurry or you're a sitting duck. I like it a bit more each time I play, and have warmed to it over the years. It's provided a decent lunchtime wargame with adult friends, and now I'm enjoying it all over again with my boys who are of age to play.

Great simplification of wargames, but it is stupid not to be able to command a unit because the right card is missing (lack of control). It would be better to command at least one unit of your choice (houserule). It's also strange that only the attacker rolls some dice, the defender not (unsatisfying combat resolution). This implies that you MUST follow an aggressive strategy to succeed (lack of tactical decision freedom). Downrated it after several plays: I feel that luck is much stronger than tactics because you are dependent on cards [i]and[/i] dice rolls. It's a pity that the expansions do mostly add chrome but not add innovation or fix flaws. Formerly owned M'44 and finally traded it away.

Traded away my copy as I just couldn't see myself really WANTING to play this. Should someone else bring a copy and want to throw down I suppose I would.

I would rather play any of the other Commands and Colors offerings before this.

Q: All of the Commands and Colors games (Battle Cry, BattleLore and CC Ancients) are the same core system, right?

A: Yes.

Q: So why play the other ones and not this?

A: Well, Mem 44 is just too light for me when it comes down to WWII. I came up playing much heavier games on this subject and I like more detail than Mem 44 provides. That and I just cant help feel that the game mechanics were forced to cover WWII, they just don't feel quite right for the time period, however, the core mechanics of this series feels correct for the other themes.

This and the fact that all units have the ability for ranged combat really makes the playing area feel too small for the rules.

A great little tabletop wargame.  The fact that you have to play cards to activate units at first seems a little restrictive but actually proves a great way of controlling the flow of the game.

I love this game my first intro to war game themes. It has to many x-factors(or 2x game) to be great. But it is a solid good. You have to come up with a strategy then hope you have the cards then hope for die rolls. As opposed to TOI where you have your strategy then hope for die rolls(1x game). Still love the game.

This is a great looking and fun game. It's quick, and it's easy to teach to new players. The different scenarios plus the limited randomness of card draws and dice rolls keep it very replayable.

Despite the fact that it's fun, short, and not a proper wargame I can't seem to persuade my girlfriend to play it because of the war theme. Shame.

Edit: Convinced my girlfriend to try it and she actually didn't mind it. That prompted me to buy Battlelore as she'll now be willing to play that too!

RATING: 5.99999
Essentially adds "Wading Ashore" rules to Battle Cry. Enormously simplifies tactics with some minor improvement in the flexibility of card use, i.e., if you have a "Bombard" card but no artillery you may activate one other type of unit.

Fix - Allow players to use any two Activation cards of other areas to activate units of the desired area, use the value of only the lower/equal of the two cards played, the second card is discarded, then draw two cards to refill hand.

UPDATE Battles of Khalkhin-Gol expansion has renewed my interest in this still very enjoyable game.

UPDATE AFTER 300 PLAYS: This game really needs the rather obvious house rule that if you cannot order any troops with the cards you have, you can order one unit of your choice. I will not play without it. 

UPDATE: Play it regularly online and Hellfire Pass and other scenarios are still brilliant online. Wish Winter Wars would come online soon.

UPDATE: Online version in beta 25 is a 10. No need to set up terrain, sound effects and opponents from all over the world! Love it.

UPDATE: M44 Breakthrough with Winter Wars rules (For example, Probe 2 allows movement with 2 units who can fight, plus 2 units who can just move), really makes the game shine. The biggest drawback with M44 is now removed. I´ll try this rule with Commands & Colours Ancients. 

UPDATE: Memoir 44 Online Beta is wonderful.Bring on Eastern Front!

Remains one of my most played games. The accessability is hard to beat. I was a bit burned out after over 50 plays. But the Air War expansion saved it. Played 23 of the Scenarios from the Front on the Days of Wonder homepage. Stonne 1940, Third Battle of Kharkov, Operation Lightfoot and the Battle for Smolensk are great examples. The users have introduced new house rules that improve the game.

I'm still several lines away from crossing the line into heavy wargaming, but if any game has inspired me to look further, Memoir has.  Borg has brought similar mechanics to several games at this point, but the WWII theme sold me on this incarnation.  I still haven't invested in any expansions for this game (and there are many) and I don't think i'll need to until I have a child old enough to play because at that point I can imagine this game will get played everyday.  Until then, I'll just keep plucking away at the different scenarios until I've played them all, and then maybe play them all again.

A fine introduction to wargames. I suspect that this will be complicated enough for most people just starting out with this type of game. The included scenarios are short and sweet. At first they seem very unbalanced but many games finish very closely. The only problem is the set-up time and the frustration of being at the mercy of the cards you are dealt. The card issue can be dealt with in several ways however with a house rule or two.

Adquirido a jony 50/50 con V. Karku. posteriormente se acordo adquisicion a V. Karku de su 50%

Tambien disponible en steam. 

Wargame "Borg engine". buena recreacion de las batallas con una escenografia acertada (aunque un poco plana en detalles). El sistema de juego es sencillo pero en ocasiones el jugador puede verse limitado en las acciones realizables, condicionando la partida. 

El otro defecto mas relevante es que muchos escenarios son muy condicionados para uno de los bandos ya desde la preparacion de la partida. (de aqui la recomendacion de jugar las partidas de 2 en 2 cambiando bandos). 

Como introduccion a los wargames es un buen juego. como wargame hace desear un poco mas.

So much fun! The variety of scenarios and the gorgeous production values almost make me forget that victory is almost totally out of my hands. Sure, the scenarios are unbalanced, the card draw and dice rolls determine the outcome--but the theme and toy-value make it very cool.

The game overall is fun, but the luck element with cards and rolling is way too high for my taste and can make me want to walk away from the table.

Yes, it's very "lite" and luck of the draw (literally) plays a big hand, and on top of that, the scenarios are slanted in favor of one side or the other to the point where it's hard to overcome the advantage and change history.  But I still really enjoy this game.  I like the pieces, I like the combat mechanic.  The whole thing just works for me.

RATING: 8
Very good light-weight wargame. Looks good and plays well. Has lots of replayability because of the different scenarios. My colleague even plays this with his young child.

I must admit having some regrets about selling this to a friend a mine, but it just didn't get much tabletime while I had it, because of the 2-player limit. Of course I know of some friends who regularly play Overlord scenarios, but I'm not willing to invest that much time to a game I feel is best when kept short.

RATING: 6
A great light "wargame."  It can show non-gamers what is fun about hex and counter wargaming.  I like this game but I don't think I'll ever buy any of the expansions.  Its fun but won't get played often enough to warrant extra dollars.  The strategic depth just isn't there and I'd rather buy a more complex game than blow money on expansions to this one.  Definitely gets a thumbs up though!  Fun little game.

Update:  The scenarios all sort of suck.  The way the artillery works doesn't make any sense.    Still love the bits though, and its still pretty fun.  It works really well as an intro to C&C:A, otherwise I would probably trade it.  Its shaken out as a pretty mediocre game.  The lack of battleback is a huge problem.  Your units are getting mauled in close combat, but they don't hit back?  The tank and artillery rules also make little sense.  This system, which I love, just doesn't work well at all for WWII.

I ended up trading this away in a math trade.  I have C&C:A, which fills this niche much better.

My son is now old enough to play, so purchased once again. (3rd Time!!)
I've never liked a lot of the scenario imbalances, but this is not so important with a 9 yr old, as you help them along a little anyway.

Great news, my lad loves the game, and being a history sponge, he enjoys the fact his dad can tell him more and more about world war 2 as we go also. 
Now he has the rules down, he can slowly learn the finer points of the tactics involved, the hard way! We will make an armchair general of him in no time!

Picked up:

Terrain pack
2 winter/desert boards
Mediterranean Theatre
Russian Theatre
Pacific Theatre
Winter Wars

Also Bought the online pdf of campaign book 1. 
£9 is a bargain for the amount of content.
That is a lifetime of gaming right there!

Will try not to sell it all again this time!

Play this to introduce newbies to the world of war games.

My gripes with the system:
-No loss of dice when units loses strength (I don't bite that it represents degrading morale; units don't fight at maximum morale only to run after 4th hit)
-Arbitrary nature of cards
-No battling back when melee
-Left -Center - Right not suitable for WWII
-Loads of utterly crap scenario's (really a waste of time; I don't bite that you can play again and switch sides; I don't want to play a crap scenario twice) 

So, Napoleonics gets this right:
-Degrading strength
-Battling back when melee
And is therefore the superior game imo. Nevertheless, the easy Memoir system and quick turns make it THE ideal introduction game for newbees and younger players.

RATING: 5
Overrated on BGG. Way to much luck involved for my taste (both in card draws and dice rolls) - and playing with toy soldiers is not what I am looking for in a boardgame (not even in a wargame). Still, it is playable. Probably catered for a younger audience than me.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A "light" wargame which can be appreciated by grognards and beginners alike.

Played with 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 players (using a single copy of the game).  Also tried with 8 players using two copies of the game.  It was quite enjoyable, regardless of the number of players, as downtime is kept to a minimum.

Rulebook, mapboard, soft plastic units, counters and terrain tiles are of excellent quality (artilery pieces are a little thin).

Doublesided mounted mapboard with (2) isomorphic sides which allows for expansion of the battlefield by combining multiple copies of the game.

Game requires 10-15 minutes setup time (terrain tile and unit placement).  Use of a Plexiglas to hold the tiles in place is recommended, but not necessary.

Card holders are a GREAT addition, as I used these with other card games!!  :)

Card activation system minimizes "down time" and lends itself well to team play (players commanding one or more sectors of the battlefield --> Left/Center/Right).

Combat is resolved using special combat dice (8 are provided).  One seldom rolls more than 4 dice, so no dicefest here.

Game comes with 16 scenarios, each playable in 30-60 minutes.  Quick playing time allows for "round robin" type play.

Excellent game support offered via web site (here too!) as well as excellent customer service from Days of Wonder!

I liked the game and support so much I picked up a second copy!

The only drawback to the base game is that it's really only designed for two players.  Other than that I don't have much complaint.  The historical context of battles is great.  I like the "fog of war" introduced by the card selection process.  Definitely one that I'm always eager to pull out.

A very fun light war game for kids ages 7 and up. I got this game for my son when he turned 7 and at first he was aprehensive and was more interested in playing the figures as toys rather than with the boardgame. Eventually he gave the game a chance and he REALLY enjoys it! Since he's an early reader he has some troubles understanding what he reads so we've used the variant where we take out the special action cards. The game is very fun to play!

A VERY light war-game. Unfortunately the system promotes an unthematic playstyle, where you move your units really strange in order to get a VP or use the game-system to your advantage.
Also what's the fun in not having the right order cards..?
That is a huge luck factor.. i'll rather play heavier war-games.
Might be something for kids though.. the box says age +8.

In Battlelore 2'nd Edition they mitigated the luck in various ways.. much better. But then it's a different theme.. ;)

I've played this game with three different people. Two of them I beat handily in one game each (didn't have time for match play). The other has beaten me so bad that I think I have marks. In five games, I think I've only earned one medal. Is he better than me? Yes. Am I better than the people that I beat? Maybe. But it seems that all of the games have been blowouts and that it has little to do with play. The winner gets good cards, the loser doesn't.

A great game that incorporates some aspects of wargames, history, and the ability to do thing differently.  I like the card driven play, even if it isn't authentic.  There is also an aspect of the little plastic soldiers appealing to my inner child. 

Down sides are that the game is highly luck driven, not entirely strategic, and timely to setup or take down.  Also, the expansions add to the down side of parts and setup, while adding to the upside of more variability and more little plastic soldiers.

After playing some ten games on Memoir'44 Online, I'm starting to like the Pacific extension.
Many new elements are dumped into the extension.
For example, Jap can move 2 hexes and still battle, and they even close assault with +1 dice when at full strength.
On the other hand, Marine can always order 1 more unit than indicated by the card.

It's still not serious war game by any means, but already much more fun than the boring base game.

A miserable excuse for a game. My turns consisted of drawing a completely useless card and then being able to do absolutely nothing. Grotesque and demented "game". Never again!

In all seriousness, this game is HORRIBLY HORRIBLY HORRIBLY overrated. The game board is divided into thirds, and the cards you draw allow you to issue certain "orders" to units in one part of the board. If you get a bad draw, it is quite possible that you will be able to do LITERALLY NOTHING ON YOUR TURN. Not to mention that the combat revolves around crummy dice rolling. It is possible for a single infantry to destroy a tank in a 1v1 battle if you get absurdly lucky. Quite possibly the most disgusting and awful luck based game I have ever played in my life.

Gets me in a way that [GAMEID=551] could not, as I lack the American Civil War gene.  The game engine is excellent—a beer-n-pretzels wargame for those of us who are not hardcore wargamers.

UPDATE:  Yeah, it's just playin' with plastic army men.  But sometimes that's all you need.

[size=15]as [COLOR=#FF0000][i]BAM[/i][/COLOR] & [COLOR=#FF0000][i]BLANG![/i][/COLOR][/b][/size][/floatleft][/center]
UP-UPDATE:  As I close in on 40 plays I suppose I must bump this to a 9; my interest is only accelerating and as a game system there is just so much to love here.  And while it might seem like a "heavily-themed abstract" the sheer number of units, options, and scenarios makes every game unique.

Almost every scenario is wildly imbalanced (a nod to history), making any single play unsatisfying for someone; but when you consider a single match to be two games with the victor having the highest total medal count after playing both the favorite and the underdog, well, then the experience is very satisfying indeed.  As the favorite you want to run that steamroller to victory as quickly as possible and minimize the underdog's score; as the underdog you want to simply last as long as possible and rack up as many medals as you can before you're snuffed.  On the odd occasion when the underdog actually [i]wins[/i]?  Then it's time to dance around the table and flick infantry units at the loser.

Hand management, probability, and the sequencing of attacks are all neat puzzles that keep each turn interesting, even when you're the one getting pounded.  And the whole time the setup just looks gorgeous.

There are more scenarios than I can probably get through in a lifetime... though I'll give it my best shot!

UP-UP-UPDATE:  It's a 10, earned the hard way—through ever-increasing game-pleasure.  The best scenarios from the expansions are engaging puzzles that not only bear repeat play, but unfold before you into larger and larger possibility spaces the more experience you get with them.  Some feel as if you could play them endlessly without ever becoming bored*—the static setup is a puzzle that requires a dynamic solution, depending wholly on the interaction between how the cards come out, hedging dice probabilities, and your creativity in manipulating it all.  Grinding the same scenario over and over is less about finding the optimal path (and solving it for all time) than it is about finding the way through the unique iteration right in front of you, right now.

Cards, dice, plastic army men, a historical veneer and functionally infinite replayability—this is very nearly the perfect game.

[size=7]*Yes, I know this isn't true—but the subjective sensation of infinite fun propels me onward.  Besides, should I be so lucky as to actually "wear one out" there are only a couple hundred more to dig into...[/size]

Second copy for Overlord scenarios!

UPDATE:  The 2006 "Made in China" edition is a significant step down in production quality after the 2004 "Made in Germany" one.

:soblue:  The box has a cheap, plasticky finish instead of a nice linen one.

:soblue:  The dice are painted instead of embossed.

:soblue:  The printing on the cards, board and tiles is washed out and less distinct.

Looks like everything's cheaper in China, and it shows.

The players can agree who played the best game in spite of good or bad dice. The ability to invent your own battles on the Days of Wonder site is what makes this game a ten. My son made a Saving Private Ryan scenario and the Japanese attacking  the West coast. Good stuff.

One play so far, seems a bit too much like Battlecry for my liking. Don't get me wrong, I love Battlecry but the base mechanism is just too similar. If I didn't already have Battlecry I would rate this much higher.

Liking this game more and more. Great balance of strategy, tactics, and luck. Maneuvering armies around in this game is really fun and can be quite rewarding. Unfortunately the scenarios are unbalanced. Switching sides is an okay solution. I just wish a campaign were possible.

I assumed that by loving Battle Cry and C&C Napoleonics that I would naturally fall into this. But where those games stand on their own (the six or seven Napoleonics expansions notwithstanding) and have plenty of scenarios to keep me busy for every six months I get them to the table, much of the awesome features are not in the base game. I won't commit to the time, effort and money to obtain them with little turnaround playtime. Thankfully, Steam allows me to play a virtual version online, with many expansion features included, either solo or with another person...and for free! It's fun, but nah...

This game and Battle Cry are still the best in the "Commands & Colors" series, IMO. Fast, fun, flavorful, with lots of options and different types of units. Yes, there are certainly more realistic games on WWII combat out there, but none with the combination of features this game has: plays in 60 minutes or less, short set of rules, great variety in unit and terrain types, lots of scenarios, visual impact of miniatures, and a hoot to play! Can easily be enhanced with 1/72 minis available from various manufacturers. We've added Italian and British armies, and use figures in different poses to represent snipers, engineers, elite troops, etc. Detailed 1/144 tanks can be used in place of the minis provided to really enhance the game.

A fun enough game with a light touch of WW2 theming. I can definitely see the reasons for its popularity but it just didn't grab me personally. I've never been huge on WW2 tactical infantry.

RATING: 8
PRO:
- quick set-up
- relatively short playtime of roughly 30-45 minutes per scenario
- rules are simple, easy to learn, yet still "simulate" battle conditions nicely
- card and dice luck involved, yet still no "pure luck"-kind of game
- beautiful components, especially the miniatures look very great

RATING: 5
Seems very variable at first, lots of scenarios, lots of terrains and units, all with different rules, but in the end, it all comes down to luck: good dice or bad dice results, fitting cards or just always orders for the wrong side/area.

To much effort for the setup of the game, compared of the influence, you really have on the game.

RATING: 7
Visually appealing and can be played with younger players. It can be construed as a dice roller but there is an element of manouvre to maximise dice roll potential. 

Not as deep as a number of other games (and I'd have liked to see rules for morale and reduced fire capacity as a unit gets depleted). I can see where it's appealing for some but it is a little too simple compared to other wargames in my collection

Good fun for two and lots of repeat play value. Expansions add to the fun. The game system is determinedly simple and I am always quick to quibble with aspects of the gameplay - but it always delivers enjoyment. We routinely play that grenades only hit in close combat  and this works well in moderating the casualties and enhancing tactical play. Consequently, we also treat artillery as an armoured target.

Not being very into wargames, *I* feel like this conveys the feeling of WWII very well.  Scenarios make this a very replayable game, although I just end up playing the same intro scenarios again and again, introducing it to new people every time.  There are a few cards (i.e. Barrage) which I feel throw the game out of balance too often.

Memoir '44 is a cool game, but not as cool as Conflict of Heroes: Guadalcanal however. CoH has some very cool features Memoir does not have.

One of the things I don't like about the game is the setup. It probably is one of the things that keeps me from getting it to the table the most (that, and I don't get many 2 player games to the table). 

Strategy wise, it is hard to plan. I am not sure if I like the card system telling you what you can move and how. It is a very interesting mechanic.

First Expansions to buy:
Eastern Front, Terrain Pack, Campaign Book 1 (all that is needed to do all the campaigns)

Second Expansions to buy:
Pacific Theater, Mediterranean Theater, desert/winter board

Third expansion to buy
Campaign Book 2 

Fourth:
Overlord (maybe this one sooner, depends on if additional expansions are need beyond what I already have)

Can get new scenarios for Days of Wonder website.

Get the Army Expansions first (Eastern Front, Pacific Theator ,Med Front in that order)

Maybe get Winter/Desert board with first army expansion.  Purely cosmetic.

Campaign Books after the army expansions.

Overlord is great for 6 players.  Can be done with 2 base games or the expansion.  Expansion has a slick deck of cards to make it easier to play but has tokens instead of figures for units.

Not sure about Breakthrough.  Need more info.

Terrain pack only good for making your own scenarios.

Equipment pack sounds unnecessary.

D-Day Landings sounds awesome but you'll need a ton of expansions for enough figures.  Not sure just how many.

First play tonight (12.12.10). Set up to play solo as my wife didn't think she wanted to play. After a few moves she decided to give it a go and joined in. After losing as the Allies in Pegasus Bridge, her verdict? "That was fun!" :)
I thought so too. Looks like this one is going to be a winner.

Update: Almost a year later and this hasn't hit the table since the first time. Pity, as we enjoyed it.

Update to the update: Finally! Lazy afternoon and my wife brought this out. Ran through the first scenario again. Had a fun game, and my wife thought it was great. We want to get it back to the table ASAP.

Yet another update: Really enjoying this one now, and moving on to other scenarios while considering purchasing some expansions!

My wife's current favourite.

Played a few times and love the game. Relatively simple and intuitive rules, lots of different scenarios (and scenery), nice web support/forums, and interesting, but not stiflingly involved strategy. Perhaps a bit too much luck is involved, as a match can sway heavily at the beginning depending on cards drawn. This tends to even out, I think, in the longer games. We found ourselves increasing the number of "victory medals" in order to extend the game, which is definitely better than when the opposite happens.

Everyone must own at least one "Command and Colors" game and this one is by far the best to date.  the game can be quite brutal on the double shot of luck, but balance isn't so much a goal for the game which seeks to be fun in the playing and not so much cunning strategies and outcomes.  -Definitely a light-hearted affair.

Update:  Bumped it down a point as I rarely play it now.  Its not that it doesn't get mentioned when deciding what to play, it just doesn't get picked.  Set-up time or high luck factor maybe?

RATING: 9
Endlessly entertaining WWII tactical dice fest. Games are nearly always tense and memorable affairs, with skill trumping luck most of the time. There are a couple of cards that often have extremely swingy effects (Barrage and Behind Enemy Lines, I'm looking at you), but with games lasting a mere 45 mins you shouldn't get bent out of shape by a jammy loss, just set it back up and play again.

With expansions, which are nearly all great, there is a myriad of scenarios from all theatres of the war available, enough to keep you going for years.

Cool components and cards, fun to play, fairly easy to learn. Big problem: Scenarios not balanced and this part really sucks, because it can make it impossible to win. Rules suggest to play same scenario twice, switching sides in rematch. WTF? I don't wanna play the same scenario over and over, especially when I can already guess the outcome. Less historical accuracy and more (balanced) fun, please! Otherwise a good game. Overpriced expansion sets available (new armies, terrain, gameboard). Free scenarios at daysofwonder.com.

I own C&C Ancients and most of the expansions and love it so this will probably be a winner with me as WW2 is  one of my favourite periods.

Hoping to pick this up on my birthday (Aug 9) from my FLGS! Got it! After many plays I'll have to rate this a 10. Yes the battles are styleized but the ability to set up and fight quickly through the different scenarios and have different outcomes make this a great game.  

I have most of the expansions and hope to get a 2nd base game someday. The only downside is storing everything!

Okay okay, this is a really good game.  I finally gave in and tried it out.  Dang, that's a sweet fast playing system.  I wish the setup time was a little shorter tho.  Really, setting out all those tiles has to be my biggest complaint.  Neither of us were really bothered by card draws, and we both experienced sub-optimal draws for sure.

It also went so fast because we were already accustomed to Range and LOS from CC:E.  Talk about going about things backwards.

In my opinion the best version of the C&C system.  Lovely components and a blast to play.  Can't get enough, though I am uninpressed with the Campaign Bag and Overlord stuff coming out at the moment.
Also cannot imagine I'll need any more army/tile sets so I may avoid future purchases (apart from scenario books of course).

Update 03/02/11:
Since playing Mem44 Online I have begun to appreciate the falws in this system. With the randomness of both Dice and CArds I find this truly annoying.  However it still has its charms so I am keeping the base game, the Air Pack, and the Terrain Pack (for now) and selling off the rest.  There are far better systems to enjoy than this chaotic mess.

Memoir '44 is a deeply elegant light and simple wargame, all about damage control and risk analysis. I'm a big fan of anything short with great decisions to be made, and M44 fits the bill

RATING: 8
Fun, light, fast. I like the commandcards, the short turns that puts you right back into the action (instead of going out to make coffee while the other player makes his move).
So, there is a luck factor in the game, but the scenarios are short and you can get your revenge in the next game!

   Got my first play in this past weekend and followed it up with two more. I had high expectations for this game and since A&A is what I compare all to especially war games I came away with positives and negatives
   Negatives, played the first two scenarios and Yes my play partners are children so we did play the child rules so I expect that will add something. But the cards you have dictate what you do and where. If I really want to focus on the right but my cards dictate otherwise well? I think that is a reason I've never been much of a fan of card based games. That's really the only negative, yes the board isn't very big but getting the other games and expansions does solve that and being so new for me it's not yet and issue just see eventually I will want bigger. Ahh also limited units though first two scenarios only use two different.
    Positives, you can finish games in fairly short amount of time one game was after school something I wouldn't dare do with A&A. So a lot more scenarios to play plus the code I got to get more online should be good for awhile. Using terrain towns sandbags, bar wire and such certainly adds something and makes you decide besides just moving and shooting, you have to consider those options offensively and defensively.

What can there be said about M44 that hasn't already been said?  I love it for its great components, simplicity of play and its theme.  As a reformed ASLer i've learned that not everyone wants to simulated WWII at the hand-grenade level.  M44 is a great game for adults and kids alike.  I really enjoy it and i would encourage anyone who likes to play the "hard-core" stuff to give this a try.  The expansion are not necessary but add some spice.

My favorite incarnation of the Command & Colors system.  Simple of approach with multiple subtilities.  The Card Command system, while annoying to some, reflects the abstracted parts of the battle (units out of communication or leadership, etc.).

My first impression is there's lots of room for a fun game here. And I liked that my first play of it with directions consultation and everything only took an hour. But I got schooled, and I think the Pegasus Bridge scenario was supposed to be heavily tilted in my favor. Why? The dice. I don't think I did anything incredibly wrong. I'm hoping the dice factor isn't so big in the next game. Looking forward to playing with my little green men again.

RATING: 8
Great 2player game, did I say 2 ow you like to play with 6 or 8. 
The base game is for 2 players but if you go overlord (basicly 2 basegames set aside eachother) you can play up to 8 ppl (2 teams of 4ppl each or 3ppl when 6players).
Downside to this system is that there is a gab between 2 and 6 (8)ppl and it has to be even that each team have the same ammount of members.
Besides that ; great war game with easy to understand rules (if you don't over complicate it with all expansions) 
Golden rule with Memoir '44 is ; First walk , then run.

My favorite "wargame".  The game has a nice balance between strategy (how to play the cards) and randomness (getting the cards and dice rolls).  My dad and I love playing this one and we had a nice campaign going for quite a while until I moved out of state.  Of course, whenever I visit we try to get a game or two in.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Really want to try this out - might be one I could play with Dad.  Also sounds like an awesome time to play the overlord expansion (multiplayer with generals overseeing individual commanders).

Have played it a few times - didn't like it too terribly much, mostly because the process of eliminating units felt odd.  Their strength is equivalent, whether they are at full health or almost dead, and that seems strange to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
While this game looks like a wargame, it really isn't.  It feels like a German game with a war theme attached to it, which isn't a bad thing at all.  Two problems with this game: the roll of the dice (and the draw of the cards) create too much randomness, and the game almost takes as long to set up as it does to play.  I don't really like wargames, but I find this quick game to be a lot of fun.

Enjoyable ultra-lite wargame that the wife even likes.  The minis are overrated and a bit TOO soft and flexible.  However, the system is well done and has been well supported by DoW.  This is another game that while relatively simple is just the right length for its depth. 

This is Dow's best game in my opinion.



UPDATE: They fixed the too soft minis problem in the expansion minis.

My favourite game. Richard Borg has achieved superb synergy between theme and gameplay in this light war-game classic. I love how the tactics selection combines with managing unpredictability in battle order card draw and the dice based combat. The movable terrain and other features (bunkers, barbed wire etc) really help evoke the differing historical battles. It is great fun, thought provoking and plays with remarkable efficiency. An awesome experience, even when losing! For me, Memoir ’44 perfectly encapsulates the magic of board-gaming.

Memoir is a very fun and quick game with great components. This may not be a simulation but it's a pretty good low level representation of some great battles. The scenarios are unbalanced on purpose trying to represent the actual battles but if you go into the game knowing that then the experience will be very enjoyable especially if you manage to pull off a surprise victory! Great transition game.

Perhaps the best 'light' wargame you can buy.  An upgrade on Borg's "Battlecry"... quick scenarios, TERRIFIC components, high replay value.  Wild swings of luck and nothing close to a simulation... the scenarios that come with the game aren't great, but there's tons out there on the web.

I guess I've just played too much historical miniatures over the years that are much heavier than '44.  I've played this 2-3 times and it just didn't click with me.  It seemed difficult to follow much of a strategy when your moves were pretty much dictated by the cards you have.    Set up time to play time ratio did not seem all that good to me as well.

As others have pointed out, this isn't a wargame, but a boardgame with a WWII theme.  Clean mechanics, easy to teach, quick to play (which is perhaps most important for me - I never have time to sit down and play something for three or four hours anymore.)  This game is fantastic.

Update: down to a 7.5 - I've found deeper wargames that are just as easy to teach.  But it's still good at what it does . . .

Update II: Just broke this out for the first time in years.  Had two contradictory thoughts - "geez, I forgot how good the Command and Colors system is", and "you know, one play is probably enough for awhile."

This game satisfies my craving for wargames without playing a behemoth grognard marathon wargame.

As someone who got into the hobby through AH wargames years ago, I resisted this for more than a year because it wasn't heavy enough or sophisticated enough.  But low and behold, it turned out to be very fun.  The card system keeps AP and thus downtime to a minimum.  It's more luck-dependent than most, but then again, so is war.  Who knows why those idiots on the left flank won't attack -- maybe the radio got shot up.

I really enjoy this game.  It's like I finally have something that lets me really play with plastic army men.
It plays quick compared to heavy grognard style wargames.  Gives my son and I a reason to play together and have fun.

I like that I can crank out two games in about an hour and a half.  I like the history.  It does get troublesome setting some scenarios up especially when you have expansions.

Bumped it down a tad. partly due to setup & teardown time of all expansions although some expansion elevate the system.  Base game alone is good, but expansions improve gameplay but lengthen setup and teardown.  Also playing more Conflict of Heroes lately which is a very rich tactical game.

Personally, I'd rather play almost anything else from the C&C collection as it's more interesting.  However, with a 9 year old to game with, this is the one to play.  Simple rules, dice, and tanks.  What else does a 9 yr old want?

9) Excellent game system, fast to play and easy to pickup. My son (7) loves it. I'm painting the minatures.

10) I've played this game for months without any expansions and then I started the campaign book. Add to that a fistful of expansions and this is truly a great game. The special rules applicable to individual scenarios add variety and spice to the game. The air rules add tons of cards to use as player aids during the game.

Now I've played a whole campaign and the game in overlord format I've decided to change my rating to 10. A Classic

RATING: 9
What started out as a relatively simple World War II game using Richard Borg's Command and Colors system has evolved into a remarkably deep experience. The fighting system is still simple and will never win any realism contests, but the depth of scenarios available (especially if you have expansions) makes this a fantastic game for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game which I wish I could play everyday, but for the lack of an opponent. The game feels like playing with toy soldiers, with an actual ruleset instead of just brakakakakaka and pewpewpew. The use of dice adds some excitement and allows for some heroics. The scenarios are mostly fun and teach you a little about history. The only downside is the slightly long set up time. Yes, history is fun. Really.

Applying the command and control system (and casualty system) of a civil war game (battle cry) or an ancients game (command and colors) doesn't fit well with WW2.

RATING: 8
Blimey, a wargame with (gasp) HEXAGONS ON THE BOARD that is attractive, fun and quick to play! I played a lot of old AH/SPI kex and counter games in days gone by, and I'm impressed with the way this captures a lot of the flavour of those games without the anal rules systems and complicated charts. I've heard people grumble that it's not as 'realistic' as the old school games, although how you can say any game using dice and bits of cardboard can be a realistic simulation of taking a bullet in the chest is beyond me. I think the varying unit capabilities are modelled here very well, just in a more abstract (but intuitive) way than old school classics such as Squad Leader. Biggest luck element is probably in the card draw - there's a trade off between jumping quickly and finding you're in the open and don't have the cards you need and waiting for the perfect hand before commiting - by which time your opponent could have built up a strong position. Grognards may find it light, but to me  it's a deserved success.

Fun, but I have trouble suspending disbelief regarding ranged infantry fire against tanks (yes, I know the infantry is supposed to have anti-tank guns).

My boys took over my copy for a few weeks when I first got the game.  They loved it.

02-15-2015 Update: The current Kickstarter campaign for The Great War recently rekindled my interest in Memoir '44.  I am finding that this time around I am not troubled with my suspension of disbelief to the same degree as I was past. I am getting a lot of enjoyment out of the game on its own terms and as a result I have raised my rating for it.

A very pleasurable lite-wargame.  Fast enough that the random nature is not unpleasant.  Deep enough that the casual war gamer will feel fulfilled.

And the detailed historical nature of the simulations and scenarios adds a nice flavor for people who are used to the abstract paste-on themes of Euro games.  (Not a slam on Euros, as I love them, just a difference.)

RATING: 4
Realism is non-existent in this turkey. Units don't decrease in firepower with hits, tanks can kill 2 units in a single turn with the right cards, no morale and you're STUCK with shitty cards with no way to turn them into a much needed move. BATTLELORE II fixes a lot of these problems and is much more fun.  So MUCH Memoir built on such shitty basics.

Wow. I have Command and Colors Ancients and consider that incredible. The production value in Memoir is beyond top notch. The cards are colorful, well illustrated, easy to read. The terrain cards have all the information needed to easily understand what they do. The pieces themselves are plastic and well done. The card holders are a nice touch. Better then CCA wood block card holders. The dice are nice to look at, but too light, I like heavier dies. The only drawback to this game is the set up time. Lots of terrain, lots of pieces on the board. The game is incredibly fast and beyond super fun. A game system that lends to many, many expansions. I guess I will eventually have them all. Lots of scenarios availiable. A near perfect game. Now do I buy the Battlelore and Battle Cry that are part of the Command and Colors line? My eleven year old son, actually setted up the first scenario. I thought he was just playing with the pieces, but he said "Dad you want to be Germans or Americans?". Wow. Even as I sit here typing my son has already setted up Operation Cobra behind me. See you later.

This is a great game for the light wargame that it is. Presentation and components are nice. Rule book is easy to follow and rules very easy to grasp. Game play is fun and quick. Played with two player and solo. Game is expandable with lots of scenarios online.

Works well solo. JK's Solitaire Variant: Enemy player - draw three: save one, use one, discard one. enemy player always holds one card. friendly player draws cards as normal.

13/6/11 Reduced to 6 from 9. It's not any worse. I've just got too many meatier WW2 games to play these days.

I fell in love with M44 on my first play, and played it to death for the next 2 years without losing my enthusiasm for the game. Richard Borg's Commands and Colours engine is another winning design, giving real wargame action in a fast, efficient and fluid form. Anyone can enjoy this game, especially people of all ages who discover the delights of teaching that dusty old grognard in the corner a lesson or two about blitzkreig.

All the times I played this game I ended up with command cards were none of them were for the right flank and although I won the first game I find it all too random for my taste. 

We have been talking about skipping all the commandcards that involves unitmovement and somehow determine how many units one may move in another way.

Brilliant in its simplicity. It takes a long time to set up, particularly when you're new to the game, but the gameplay is so elegantly simple that it left me wanting to play again and again.

Rating will probably go up in the future.

Re-create specific World War II scenarios with Axis and Allied units -- though most are rigged to get the same results, which rewards the history lover. Unfortunately, the manual is not perfect and you need to refer to BGG to answer a LOT of questions.

A great tactical game that plays in less than hour, M44 strikes a nice balance between depth and ease. With 100+ scenarios this is a game I'll be revisiting often. 

UPDATE: 08/11

While I quite enjoy M44 I think CCA is a superior implementation of the system. Its too easy to get stuck with poor card draws and the inability to battle back. That said, this is my group’s favorite iteration of the system; the WW2 setting and plastic army guys win them over.

To all those who think this is luck.  It is not.  I have played several times now with the same opponent and he has won every time.  There is a lot of tactical and strategic skill in using the combination of cards dealt to the best advantage.  Skilful use of terrain is crucial to winning.  Usually if I lose I can point to an tactical error rather than bad cards or dice rolls.  There are some 'take that' cards but they are not on their own game-breaking.  Its quick, replayable and pretty fun.  The scenarios are excellent.

At first I didn't really like this game, thinking it too random and not appreciating the scale.

But now that I've played a dozen games, I'm into it. There is a ton of nuanced opportunities at every stage of play, and the mechanics are more clever than I initially gave them credit for.

Update: Sold off. I'm still convinced that there is a lot of nuance and a very deep game here, but unfortunately very few people are willing to spend that much time analyzing it to get good at it. The vast majority of people just want to play it superficially, which makes it seem more arbitrary and less satisfying. thankfully, I'm able to play this game against more appropriate opponents online, but my physical copy had to go.

RATING: 8
Rating is an 8 with ~20 plays (including the Eastern Front expansion). Memoir '44 is a fast-paced game of tactical combat featuring 16 different historical scenarios between the Axis and Allies forces. The game uses dice and features a random card draw (same deck for both players), and the luck can go against you quite conspicuously in both areas. Additionally, the scenarios themselves are often obviously skewed in favor of one side or the other. I don't mind any of this. In fact, I think it's great fun when units "give 'em hell" (unexpected good role) or fail miserably (unexpected bad role). I also think it's a thrilling challenge to begin the scenario outnumbered or in a slightly worse position. Even with the luck, good tactics usually win the day, or at least give players the satisfaction of making their opponent pay for their victory. Memoir '44 is a game I enjoy playing well, win or lose. It's also fast and has TONS of replayability. 

Lately I've discovered C&C:A, which outshines M44 in many ways. Commands and Colors features a good deal more strategic depth, greater unit variety, a more suitable theme, and better components (I'll take blocks over plastic any day). It does all this without sacrificing any sense of flow. M44 paved the way for me though. 

Update: Memoir '44 is about Terrain and Ranged Combat. C&C: Ancients is about formations and close-combat. Very different feel to both. I have five boxes of C&C on my shelf an no desire to start up another multi-box investment, but M44 is great fun.

[b]My thoughts on Memoir '44[/b]
Memoir '44 is a scenario based World War II themed game with dice rolling and card play. It is probably one of the lightest games with a war theme on the market, with a high production value and a lot of variety offered through expansions and online scenarios. I've got a love/hate relationship with the left-middle-right battle areas and the restrictions the cards provide. 
Therefore, I only like the occasional game, and whenever I play I enjoy it. Sometimes I feel that the game is too random for its own good, but on the other hand, I think experience and smart play increases the odds of winning.
I'm not sure that I like the point based victory conditions. This game could really do with a bit more mission based victory conditions, but otherwise it is a good system that provides a lot of light fun play.

Satisfaction: :star::star::star::nostar::nostar:

While a big fan of Battle Cry, I've found this game fails to have the same "drama" as its predecessor.  Our games seem to thrive on rolling one die at a time to chip away at the enemy, due to the reduced firepower and greater amount of terrain.  The latter also has the effect of reducing the amount of maneuver, since the maps we've played have channeled the armor severely.

Playing through the Pacific and Eastern Front expansions improved my opinion of the series.  Raised the original game a point to reflect the play value of the expansions.

I could see this easily rising with more plays.
UPDATE: so far, so good. I really enjoy the game.  Haven't played it enough to get the expansions involved, someday...

Popcorn Wargaming! I now have played M44, Battle Cry and CC:A from the Commands & Colors series. I enjoy the series more from game to game. M44 might very likely be the best from this series as it plays the closest to the core as I perceive it: fast accessible wargaming with high replay value and lots of theme. While CC:A offers more strategic potential, it can drag a bit - plus for M44. The luck factor in M44 is high but with 30 minutes for a scenario once the game is set up it doesn't bother me and I'm not sure if there is much less luck in CC:A in the end. It's just not as obvious. First of the series to get 8/10.

Game with C&C system. Strange victory conditions. If you kill a determined number of units you'll usually win the scenario, so the objectives are useless. The only objective is to kill faster than the enemy. I know this game pretends to be easy for everyone, but when you play by the rules you can see there's something VERY WRONG with it.
Easy to learn and teach to a non gamer. Good quality components like Days of Wonder used to make. Good for kids.

RATING: 6
It lowers the entry bar for wargames. Now that I'm in, though, I have some criticisms. Having the simplified dice is easier, and I like them. But also having the card draw just makes it a crap shoot. Leave your hopes of winning by having a solid strategy at the door and you may not be disappointed.

I like the theme and the bits. The mapboard with the giant hexes doesn't thrill me, neither does the actual game play. Ultimately I don't think you have a lot of control in this game. I don't mind the die-rolling for combat; that makes for some good old school wargaming. The card/command system is a neat concept, but it just leaves me feeling out of control of the game. After a game of M44, I usually wonder what else I could have been doing instead.

My second game in the series. Plays almost exactly like Battle Cry and that is a good thing. Lots and lots of scenarios. I love how quick it is to play and can uaually get a couple of games in in one sitting. Still, be prepared for a little frustration when your troops on the left are being decimated and you can't get the cards to fire back.

We have played through the scenarios in the rule book and a few more. With the right person this is really fun. But it doesn't come out too often at this point. I'll probably trade it away at some point because it is unlikely I will buy any expansions for it.

A fun game. We played 4 games in 2.5 hours.

Edit, I've played BattleLore - the system does work better in BattleLore, though I won't be buying it since I already have Memoir 44...

Update: Lent to a friend in 2006 - haven't seen it since.

Update: I prefer Command and Colors series which use the same system but to better effect, and with wood.

I don't really like the concept of playing a wargame, and I feel stupid setting up a board with all these plastic army men (though I wonder what makes little wooden pieces so much more tolerable).

I have no idea how to develop any kind of strategy, but it's very enjoyable to play since the game moves swiftly and there is just the right amount of freedom on your turn.

Great, great military game that is light enough to appeal to people that normally don't like military games. I've found myself playing up to 4 times a day and wishing I had time for more. Quick and easy to learn, and best of all, fun. The only thing stopping this from reaching a 10 is getting stuck with a hand full of cards for a region where you have no troops. I've had up to 4 of 5 cards unusable, with no real way to recycle other than losing turns.

Best of the C&C system by Borg.

Great components, its a fairly quick game, although the setup can take a while. The randomness causes the game to be more tactical, and since you are always reacting, there isn't much long term planning or strategy. And it IS a 2-player game (despite whatever DOW claims)

I mostly purchased this game so I could get my father more into wargaming.  My dad was always into chit and hex games when he was a kid, but after growing up he really didn't have time for those anymore.

Fortunately Memoir gives us a relatively low playing time, and also doesn't require as much attention, as usually whenever we get together to play there's always something else going on that we have to mindful of.

RATING: 5
The WWII version of Battle Cry doesn't appear to add anything - still has the randomness of the cards although at least not the one super-overpowered card. I guess the only point is to simulate a different set of historical battles. For me theme and simulation are always much less important than strategy and tactics. For some reason, I have never warmed up to war games though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like this game very much because my wife likes to play with me.  Cool historical aspect boosts the theme a bit.  Fun to play, with decent strategic depth, not necessarily something you need to think too hard over.  I really like the art on this title as well.

Edit - just played an incredibly fun and tense mission on Sword Beach.  The narrative in this particular game was fantastic, starting with allies taking a bloody beating trying to get onto the beach then the tide turning in favor of the allies once my artillery was softened and finally eliminated.  At the end of the game, with VP tied at 4-4, Allied is one order away from winning the game by taking an unprotected city/medal.  Axis has no orders in that flank, playing the medic card out of deparation.  A good roll replaced one unit and allowed that unit to be ordered to move and protect the town.  Allied special forces move in for close combat and eliminate another axis soldier from the unit protecting the town.  Attrition is not an option for axis.  Axis plays close assault, rolls 4 infantry hits, eliminating the unit and eeking out a win.  For this good time, Im re-rating from a 7 to an 8.  YEs, some luck was involved, but man was it exciting and it gave us a fun story.  Cant wait to play again.

Memoir '44 has pretty much all of the features that added up to make Battle Cry a faintly ridiculous experience: dicey randomness, wildly divergent card power (a player who draws assault cards and the like will demolish a player who doesn't), absurdly gamey tactics (such as infantry charging out of fortifications), critical threshold effects, arbitrary and anticlimactic scenario endings, and a general lack of verisimilitude. What M44 has going for it seems to be variety, expandability, and possibly a better match between theme and mechanics. Commands & Colors: Ancients has some of these features as well but for the most part they are much mitigated.

Fun battle system, with the luck of the draw (you can be stuck without relevant orders) and luck of the dice in the combat.
This can mean that even when outnumbered and outgunned you can still try to win.

An entry-level game about war at a tactical level.

I'm not at all sure that anyone who likes this game would like a "real" wargame. It involves too much dice rolling, the cards are artificially restrictive, and the game offers very little in the way of the thinking needed for, say, Squad Leader. And yes, I know that's not a fair comparison. It's like saying a MacDonald's hamburger offers very little in the way of a Michelin 4-star meal. Besides, five or six pages of rules isn't going to give a game with the richness of a game with ten times as many rules. But for me, like a Big Mac just isn't worth eating, Memoir '44 just isn't worth playing.

In most circumstances, that is. Maybe in a hospital it would be a good game to spend an hour over.

This is really the only game I have with the customizable hex battlefields and light war game feel to it.  I do enjoy it, but sometimes it doesn't flow quite so well when you receive a handful of lousy Command Cards to work with.  Additionally, it has been a challenge to find others to play this with (since war games aren't really my lady's thing.)  I have tried to play solo with some of the available variants, but that too feels clunky at times.  Overall, I do like this game and would like to get one of the different theater expansions someday; I just wish I had more opportunities to play it.

Goofy fun rolling dice and pushing around minis.  Always a good time.  Obviously not to be taken too seriously, but there are some interesting mechanics that prevent it from being a total dice-fest.

Plays quick, so you can usually play both sides of a scenario in about an hour.

To bad set-up takes so long, but that is the trade-off for the incredible amount of variability.

RATING: 6
2015-06-04 - 7 - My initial rating is after playing the first scenario - Pegasus Bridge, so we used only basic infantry. I guess it may get better in other scenarios with armory, artillery and special units. Anyway the card order system sometimes is really ridiculous, when you have most of your army on one flank and can't move anyone during several turns.

2015-07-04 - 7->6.5 - I played a scenario with more kinds of units. It's an OK game, which I can play if you ask me, but I'm not a big fan of it. I also don't like the fact that you should play every scenario twice switching sides as they are rather historically acurate than balanced. And the card order system still doesn't make sense to me.

2015-10-19 - 6.5->6 - This card driven system is irritating.

I have been playing this lately on Steam.  I played it once on the table at BGG con 2014, and we thought it was totally stupid and put it back.  Then out of boredom one night I tried it on Steam.  I have come to appreciate it and it is really fun to play.  At first, the cards seem stupid because you can usually only play units in one third of the board, but when I think about it, it makes perfect sense, since in my mind, war is complete chaos: communications get disrupted, field commanders get killed, supply lines you need to keep the ammo and food flowing get distrupted, etc.  So despite your desire to run the entire show, you have snags to overcome and you only get to play bits and pieces of the campaign one at a time.  Quite simply brilliant and thematic, IMHO. Well, I have been fighting the Nazi war machine for several scenarios and I am really liking this game.  The online version through Steam has really cool sound effects for the different actions you can take, too.  Nice job, D.o.W!! :)

I REALLY want to like this game. It's a game involving ACTUAL Army men for, Pete's sake! This is the kind of game that I dreamed about when I was a kid. This is the kind of game that we all imagined we were playing when we played Risk! This is the kind of game we played with out a board and our imaginations when we were little and it always ended with a I hit you, no you didn't argument. This was supposed to fix that!

But instead I just feel frustrated at the set up time, and the huge amount of luck (or poor luck in my case) that takes over this one. Too many games of poor roles and bad card draws sucked the life out of this one so quickly I could hear the pop. I tried, I really did, but I just can't lie to myself about this one being much fun.

I want to play this game all the time.   Everything is fantastic: the first rate components, the anticipation during set-up, the ecstatic victories and painful defeats of play, and the post-mortem while putting it away.   The great web support and the contuing flow of scenarios from the developer and the user baes adds up to a fabulous experience.

- 2 player
- Weight: Medium
- Genre: War/Dice/Campaign
- Length: Long

This WWII game comes with cool miniatures, high quality tiles, and a bunch of historical campaigns you play through. Each game is different and comes with a small description of the actual battle that happened in history that you'll be re-enacting on the board. It's an asymmetric game, meaning one player has a different objective and methods of play than the opposing player so you play each scenario twice and see who did the best overall. Luck of the dice and cards prevent the game from being too one-sided against new players but the game still has plenty of strategy. Lots of replayability and with the right expansions you can even make your own scenarios with ease.

Less variety than C&C:A, but makes up for it with the eye-candy.  I prefer the varied terrain of M44 to the spartan C&C:A, and don't care particularly much about the supposed comparitive lack of realism of the order cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Bought this as it seemed like a good entry level war gaming game. Wife isn't really into that type of thing but it seemed easy enough and the miniatures were nice enough that I thought she could look past it and get into it...and she did.

I will say I'm not a big fan of the card movement system, would prefer a tiled free movement system, but that sort of system made it easier for my wife to not be struck by the analysis paralyses as she only had a few actions she could take based on the cards. Good game.

Way too simple for my tastes.  Maybe the expansions make it better?  I would just much rather play Ancients or even Battlelore than play this again.  
*Edit* I'm interested in giving the game another chance, particularly with expansions.  
**2nd Edit** I like this game a lot more after playing it with expansions and after playing the excellent Memoir '44 Online.  I still hate getting screwed by the combination of crap cards and unlucky dice rolls, but the game has proven a lasting winning combination of fun gameplay and top-notch components.

Great value.  Introductory-level tactical game, but has too much set-up time, too much luck, not enough strategy.  Once a player gets well ahead, there's little incentive to continue the attack until he has a perfect position and a perfect set of command cards (some house rules with time/turn limits solved this).   (Rating based on a 2 for adults, 8 if the kids are playing)  The C&C system works far better with the Ancients game.

Well thought out game.

Many people have cried out too much luck.  There are 2 factors here, the Command Cards, and the Dice rolls.

The Dice each have 2 Infantry Hits, 1 Armor Hit, 1 Wildcard Hit, 1 Miss, 1 Surrender Flag.  To me it represents the fact that Infantry are easier to hurt (3:6 chance) and armor is harder (2:6 Chance).  This dice system works very well for me, and I like the unpredictability, the dice rolls seem to be consistent to me with the ratios given, which some bad/good rolls to give you a scare from time to time.

As for the cards, you draw 'em, you gotta learn how to use them to your best advantage.  I found myself screwed every now and then because the scenario had all my units in the center, and I wasn't drawing any Center Order cards.  I assume it's meant to simulate bad lines of communication, but I didn't like the feeling of not being able to do ANYTHING and if I wanted to play a real war game I'd go for Europe Engulfed.  I think you should be able to use a card to atleast order 1 unit if unable to use it otherwise.  For that I had to deduct .5 point. If anyone has any suggestions, do tell. (maybe I will learn to like this feature as I learn to use it against my opponent, who after all, has to deal with the same situation; this is a good article on this subject http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/42307 )

Other than that, the board was beautiful, the pieces look great (except for the artillery, which were flimsy), and I love the modular board.

The rule book was very colorful and helpful, full of examples.

I know you can get a scenario editor, and can't wait to try other's when I'm done with the given ones.

*I've painted my units, giving them a black primer undercoat, and then painting over with a green and blue metallic color to bring out the miniature's detail.  Believe me, this requires no skill and is worth it.

Reminds me of Battlelore and Command and Colors: Ancients. Can't imagine why.

It's almost funny -- normally I can't stand wargames because they are not random enough, involve too much planning and brain-burning, etc. But this one goes in the opposite direction. If the cards don't hose me, the dice surely will.

A game that provided quite a lot of fun.  I collected most of the system at one point.  But I've divested myself of the entire thing.  No one really asked for it after a few years, and I repurposed the funds from the collection into other games.

It is still a game I could easily agree to play.  But I don't need to provide it.  So we'll see if I ever play again.

I have to disagree that these are the best components ever, especially since not one of the artillery pieces can hold a straight barrel. The tanks, however, are quite nice. With no attrition due to damage, and no ability to return fire when fired upon, my suspension of disbelief was broken. The card-orders system could be nice, but is ultimately limiting, as there is no quick way to cycle through a bad hand. Yes, there were many limitations in WWII, but command options were normally not one of them - even though it is the single largest victory-affecting factor here.

A Command & Colors game, sibling to Battle Cry, using basically the same game system (tweaked for the WWII setting).  Command cards do a good job of representing the fog of war and communication problems in combat.  The game is fast; can be fun; but doesn't have a lot of depth. Still, it is well supported with many expansions and third party scenarios; an online scenario editor and online play.

I think I'm in the minority here, but I don't really like the "Overlord" scenarios. More (players) is not always better. 

On the other hand, I think the "Breakthrough" expansion with bigger boards and larger scenarios is a good idea.

Began playing Memoir '44 Online 6/11/2011.

Recruit miniatures and tokens from all sorts of other games, and you've got a playground of tactics!

Very luck dependent, but the first light wargame that everyone of our gaming group does enjoy. And that´s really worth it. But beware: You should be able to accept, that there might be very unrealistic and frustrating situations. We saw one artillery piece resist over seven game rounds (!) the attacks of three infantry units and one tank unit - with the result of three units destroyed, the artillery still intact. Another time three tank units tried overruns against infantry groups and were ALL eliminated because they hit nothing but the other player rolled grenades over grenades... Beside this, it is a great game we always enjoy :)

1. It is easy to play.
2. Every one in our game group likes it (wether he is into WW2 gaming or not).
3. Sessions are short enough to play some consecutive game rounds, so bad luck can turn into a win the next time.

Memoir 44 has a lot of what I expect in a wargame : strategy and tactics of course, but also "friction", this murphyesque (or clausewitzesque) feature that can make your best plans go wrong ("They didn't get the order in time") or desperate situations see the end of the tunnel ("Reinforcements are here !"). So in this respect the card deck is a great engine, because there is a real difference between what you see and want to do as a player, and what officers see on the field, what they can do. Of course it can lead to frustration sometimes ("come on left flank, move !") but with very simple rules it conveys command and control difficulties, fear, misunderstood orders, intercepted estafettes, etc.
Plus it is very simple, modular and above all, fun.

Simple mechanics that work very well together. Easy to teach and play. Good game to introduce to nongame experience people and kids to thematic games. 

Pros: 
- Gameplay is fun with exciting moments.
- The historical background is very interesting and it is very well represented through mechanics.
- Tons of minis.

Cons: 
- Sometimes it feels too random (card drawing and dice rolling), if you have bad luck with your cards sometimes you can not even move units, and that kills the fun (however it doesn't happen often).
- Set up is a bit long for the length of the game.
- The quality of the minis is not very good, they are durable but details are poor and the material bends easily.

Its game system is undoubtedly well developed. In addition, with all the scenarios from the campaign book, the game is highly replayable. But I am not totally comfortable with the theme. I might be overly sensitive: a couple of my friends who are avid fans of Memoir '44 and Axis & Allies keep telling me that it is just a game. True, but if I were a Jew, I probably would never imagine myself playing Nazi Germany. As a Korean, I absolutely abhor the idea of playing Imperial Japan. The Second World War feels so contemporary and real to me, especially when I read international newspaper articles about Japanese right-wing politicians. Perhaps I should look for other war games set in the ancient or fantasy world. Then, I might safely distance myself from the horrible reality and enjoy it as "just a game."

Usually instead of trying to fulfill a military objective, you're best off chasing down near-dead enemy units (which miraculously loose none of their strength until their very dying breath). Even Risk has more strategic depth than this. It's a shame, because the simple movement and battle mechanics are very good.

Very impressive game. Was sceptical at first that there was too much luck, but out of the first, say 20 games played, only in 1 or 2 cases could i really say i lost because of the luck of the draw (and depending on the map).
I love this game and everyone i introduce it too enjoys it as well. Most are eager to play several missions and lose track of time. 
And with such support coming from days of wonder it's hard to find a better mission based game out there.

I like light/fast/easy games, but: only one or two games of this have been really fun.  The rest have been "just OK" because normally, at any given moment, you have one obviously best card to play, and when you play it, you have one obviously best set of moves to make.  So most of my games have been an exercise in card & dice luck (which I've got, so I win) with no real choices.  Also, sometimes the rules promote silly tactics, like when the Germans run out of their bunkers and down onto Omaha Beach to pick off their last victory point or two.  UPDATE: more on my feelings about it [article=7004015]here[/article].

The game I've enjoyed most so far was the Montelimar scenario: I had cards for both flanks, but was deliberately moving on the right to try to draw the enemy's armor away from the left.  After the game I found out he never had any cards which would let him move that side!

Update: I think I prefer Nexus Ops; see my comments there.

So far, Memoir 44 seems like a really cool game. Lots of excitement but still plays quickly and isn't complicated. There is of course lots of luck involved with the dice and card drawing but it still doesn't make bad players (like me) win. I didn't think I would enjoy wargames but now I'm definitely looking forward to next scenarios. 

Update:
5 plays in and still wanting more! The scenarios play out really different. Even my wife, who usually hates luck in games and is not thematically interested in war, is eager to get it on the table. 
Components are excellent. Only wish that the unit colours were easier to distinguish under bad lighting.

I own every expansion ever made for this product, and I am a big fan of the Battle Lore system.  The game is simple and enjoyable.  The pieces are nice and the board is functional.  The downside is a long setup time, and lack of complexity.  This looks like a wargame, but may be may not necessarily simulate the World War II.

I like the game system as it is a lighter war game feel.  I enjoy CoH better but this one can be played with non-gamers as well.

Easy and elegant rules which result in fun gameplay. Setting the board with all the units probably takes as much time as playing the scenario. Felt a bit strange that board position didn't really matter. Only Medal Count is important and you have to make some illogical decisions because of that. Not much depth and limited options. Was hoping for more, especially considering the rating on BGG.

There's a lot more chance in this game than I usually enjoy, but there are enough tactical and strategic decisions for the relatively short confrontations.  Various scenarios are definitely unbalanced, and we often just don't feel like replaying a scenario with swapped forces.  The lightness of the game makes us more forgiving, but the randomness and the setup time have devalued the game among some of my friends.

A good light "wargame". One scenario takes less than an hour! Card-driven, luck-oriented but still fun. If you are looking for the REAL wargame, then Memoir'44 is not your game.

And hey: You can download a lot of free scenarios from the internet!

RATING: 7.5
[Original] This is a fun and easy WWII wargame without the heavy aftertaste of an old school wargame. Although serious grognards might scoff at its simplicity, it is wargame truly designed for the masses. Does it perfectly reflect the intricacies of unit combat? No. Does it simplify unit combat into an easily approachable form? Absolutely. Each turn is quick and flows rapidly from one player to the other. One minor gripe is that, even new, some of the tiny plastic units have slightly bent gun-barrels and stand off kilter (but then again, whose plastic, green army men ever stayed is pristine condition?). The rulebook is light and easy to digest; you can even download it from the Days of Wonder website. Take a look, and I'll see you on the beaches...

[2006.Dec.14] Despite the recent release of BattleLore, Memoir '44 continues to fill a wargaming niche that is ever-so-subtly different from that filled by its newer, sibling game. And as usual, I'm always eagerly anticipating my next M'44 game.

[2011.Mar.15] Got a chance (finally!) to play this again. It's still the same fun, beer-n-pretzels game that I remember it to be. I'm glad that it's in my collection.

[2014.Jun.14] Fun game. No doubt about it. The biggest drawback: set-up and clean-up. Still want to play though.

Highly disappointing, unbalanced and utterly boring game that struggles to be anything but a game that plays the players rather than an interactive game. After multiple plays (at least 10 games) I gave up entirely on salvaging anything from Memoir 44. The one thing that kept me trying to find out what the fuss was about was the constant praise the game has gotten on BGG and The Dice Tower. It seems that whatever qualities this game has are completely lost to me.
By far the worst game in the BGG top 100 for me so far.

One of the better war games out there.  It's a very clean system and a lot of fun.  I could see this system being used in other games too.  Some disadvantages:  The setup isn't very fun; unlucky card draws happen; there doesn't seem to be much strategy like in other games.  Strategy is usually just, "move forward and blow crap up" from what I can tell.  But, I'd knock out a game of this in 1 hour, as opposed to ASL for 12+ hours!

A card based simple wargame.  The best I have played.  Fun, pretty quick.  Works really well.  The best of the three card driven war games.  I could play this often, it has so many scenarios, terrain, units, etc.  Amazing little pieces.  I get the Hogan's Heroes theme song in my head when I play.  The terrain can be annoying, but I realize how much I enjoy the feeling of sneaking around the terrain and making my way over to pick out a few people from a mountain or forest.  I hate the plain battles of Commands and Colors and Battlelore (the worst of both worlds..).

RATING: 9
It's a nice, quick tactical & card-driven WWII wargame very similiar to Battle Cry. I like this a little bit better as I think combat cards are slightly improved and combat system is a little more streamlined.  For a Civil War kick, I go to Battle Cry, but for WWII, Memoir '44 is excellent as there will not doubt be virtually countless scenarios to be added/created as the game grows in popularity.

After several plays of Memoir versus Ancients, I find I prefer the gameplay of Ancients as there's much more depth and strategy from my perspective.

I knew I would love this game when I layed out the first scenario. I couldn't have dreamed that my wife would enjoy it as well and that she would even suggest we play this. We're now playing our way through the scenarios of the base game and we're enjoying every minute of it.

There's a lot of luck involved in this game. From the dice rolling to the card drafting, you're never sure your plans are going to succeed. But somehow, this feels extemely thematic and makes the game more tense. I also love that you play each scenario twice, once as the axis and the allies. The design and variability of this game are also huge plusses. Rated it a 9 after three plays.

Battle Cry gives me a good gaming experience.  So I hope the same from Richard Borg's new game.  Money, however, is a scarce commodity. Generally, Borg's game is about combat  manouever for optimal position and, pump, strike at the right time with the right additional modifier cards.  Simple mechanics but interesting enough.  Played it and gotta find it fun but with a kind of inflexibility imposed by the cards in terms of choices in the battlefield, which generally contrast with my past experience with WW2 at this tactical level.  I am not sure the game mechanics suit WW2 particularly well.  There are many good scenarios to choose from and with the no. increasing, the system can be tested to its extended limit.  Some scenarios might be imbalanced to my knowledge but generally they are fine in design term where the last card or unit elimination distinguishes the winner from the loser.

RATING: 8
I can get a little bored on a couple of occasions, during a game, probably because the game seem to often reach a similar state: you have units scattered on the board, and the obvious strategy is to attack the weakest ones, which involves a serious amount of luck. A game of Race for the Galaxy is so much richer: the situations obviously evolves in a qualitative way (your tableau grows).  Same thing for Agricola (new animals, new occupations, new family members come along during the game).  Even Go, despite the fact that it has only one kind of "units" (stones), which don't move, creates a board situation that constantly evolves.

As combats progress, tension zones are created.  This gives me a feeling similar to playing Yinsh or Schotten-Totten.  However, I find that there is are fewer tension zones in M'44 than in these two games, in a given session; Yinsh and Schotten-Totten having a much shorter playing time than M'44, this makes them more tense.

Also, compared to LotR: TMG (Combat Hex), I found that the combats are more generic: they always involve only one type of indistinct unit (infantry). I find LotR: TMG more epic, thanks to the different unit types (archers, spear men, heroes and all their distinctive special powers).  I like its nicer looking figures, its special powers, its more individual figures, its simple rules, etc. It gives me more of a "combat"/brawl/clash feel than M'44.

When playing solo, I prefer to play Conflict of Heroes: Awaskening the Bear.  In fact, the action-reaction mechanism of CoH keeps me more interested and focused than the more gamey IGOUGO system of M'44.  However, I did not find playing the first scenario of CoH face-to-face very rich.  Plus, CoH's rules are much more complex, and easier to forget.

The rules are rich enough for me, and almost too complex (i.e., not streamlined enough): terrain rules, obstacle rules, LoS rules, etc. In fact, I had to check the rulebook a few times. I also had to check the FAQ (all the answers were clearly spelled there!).

I found it more interesting than C&C:A, because I was able to concentrate on the game more. I seriously thought about chaining my order cards, about encircling the enemy, etc.

I like the fact that probabilities are quite easy to approximate: it is possible to make meaningful decisions.

I find M'44 better than LotR: TMG at forcing the players to adopt longer term strategies (efficient chaining of order cards, assessment of the emergencies with respect to the cards in hand, usefulness of keeping units in all sections while reacting to important situations on the board, etc.).

I also like deciphering what sections the opponent could act in. This is a useful facet of the game, that allows for some risk taking.

The variety of terrain and obstacles was a nice change from C&C:A.

I like playing against the AI, though, because I lose all the time (in 5 to 10 games), because I can invest as much time as I want in thinking, and because games last for about 30 minutes.  My repeated losses show that I have a lot to learn, which makes the game interestingly challenging.  In fact, making a whole plan around the hand dealt is not that obvious.  I also enjoy the challenge of getting a clear picture of the situation on the board (what zones are weak, important, etc.) and of its evolution during a game.  Knowing when to retreat, combining infantry and armor in a sound way are also interesting.

I really enjoy playing this game and I'm all for any game that bridges the gap between grognards and boardgamers, as I think this game does, but I have lost two very close games recently only because I didn't have the right cards.  In the most recent game, I had a tank unit 3 hexes away from a village.  If I could move that unit to the village, I could collect the medal and win the game.  But draw after draw I never got any cards that would allow me to move that unit.  All I could do was sit there and watch my opponent mow down the rest of my army.  Argh!

I got this for my Father's birthday.  He really enjoys full-scale war games, but doesn't often have the time.  This game does a great job of filling the gap; quick setup and play, as well as a easy-to-learn combat system, so it's great to bring in new players.

My only complaint is with the suggestion that you play as teams.  It doesn't seem like there is enough going on in the game to require teams.

The system is really simple, after a few plays if you play for purely the strategic point of view it becomes stale fast, and everything depends on the cards you draw.

RATING: 10
This is a very easy to learn war game that isn't bogged down in excessive rules.  The components are detailed and the card art is spot-on. There is a luck factor with the cards.  While you get to choose the orders you are issuing to your army, your choices are bound to the cards you draw. Still, strategy plays a role. My only real complaint is how difficult it is to "re-write history." In other words, of all the times I've played, whoever won the real life battle in WWII, turned out to be the winner in the board game as well. For instance, if you're playing a campaign as the Germans and they lost that battle in reality, chances are you are going to lose that game. It can put a damper on things going into a new game. 

UPDATE

Since that writing, I have won as the Germans in the Battle of Normandy and once as the Allies in another scenario that actually had the Germans winning in real life.

I fell in love with Memoir '44 at the first play. The Commands & Colors system works simply and beautifully. I like playing each side in a battle a few times and figuring out if I'm losing because I'm playing poorly or because it's stacked against me.

This game yells "gateway to amerigames" all over the place (from now on, to me it will be Risk-Memoir-A&A-?). After teaching how to play Settlers to my friends they thought it lacked of some confrontation (I just bought C&K). A few weeks later one of my friends suggested we play Settlers, but we were only 3 and the other one refused to play at all. I told him "lets play that game with minis!". A few minutes after that we were already in the butt-kicking! After I won with the germans (on sc. 1) he won at the end!

I'm playing all the scenarios with a friend of mine, check the sessions!

Edit: going down to 7, after playing most of the scenarios it gets old, that's why you need the expansions, i don't have any so now I'm just "growing old" of this (in a gaming way), I need more deepness or a real wargame.

Edit: I've decided to buy the expansions, I guess this game worth it. Yesterday I was going through my collection and realize this game is awesomely produced, and with the release of the Air Pack, this should come back to life. I'm even convincing myself of buying a second set to play it with more people!

I had played many all night sessions of [GAMEID=181] and [GAMEID=98] as a kid, so in the back of my mind I was itching to try a newly updated wargame.  [GAMEID=10630] cropped up as a perfect, light wargame that was newbie friendly.  Plus, it was produced by Days of Wonder, which had a good track record with us for making very attractive games.  Even better, my girlfriend was receptive to trying it out as well.

As promised, the game was a beauty to look at and the modular terrain tiles could be used to make almost any map you could think of.  Unfortunately, the game just didn't work for us.  Most of our games ended up with our units hiding in terrain and sniping at each other.  There didn't really feel like any grand tactical formations that we could try.  We always had enough cards to play so that we could do anything we wanted in any section of the board, so there wasn't enough tenseness in the hand management, cardplay area either.  Most of the missions could be completed simply by destroying units---it would have been much more interesting if there had been more goals to focus on.  To be fair, we only tried the first few several missions, so perhaps things got better later on.

Fundamentally, it may be that we particularly enjoy games where we're actively building things up, whether it's train routes, cities, etc., rather than just attacking each other and tearing things down.  On the other hand, we just might not have liked the actual gameplay of just sniping each other and rolling dice.  For example, we liked [GAMEID=15363] (which has a basic resource/economic component to it) and [GAMEID=23375] (which had CCG card play for combat) better.

RATING: 3
It was all there, bits, varied game board, theme, and even the game play itself sounded great. But as I played it, it just felt like a lot of dice rolling (which normally I don't mind), not much reward strategy for any strategy, and a card draw system that, without add on rules that allow for exchanging cards, have a tendancy to leave entire portions of the board unusable for much of a game. The scenarios are unbalanced and the game depends too much on luck and dice rolling.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Initial impressions: My rating might go up in the future for more unique scenarios and scenarios with different unit types. The basic concepts of this game are very simple: play a card, move your units, attack based on range, try to capture certain locations or wipe out enemy units. Some of the added stuff for the different terrain makes the game both thematic and fiddly, both during set up and in the actual game play. I think from this game I've come to realize I really like war games in theory, not so sure about the execution yet; sometimes I'd prefer balance over historic accuarcy. Because you play both sides in Memoir 44 it doesn't matter too much if one side is significantly weaker, but what I don't like about this game is how swingy it can be, both via clutch card draws and die rolls. For example, I lost 4-0 while playing the Axis because my air raid and one of my other attacks both missed on 50% attacks. Meanwhile when I played as Allies I only won 4-3, but that was because my opponent's air raid did succeed, and also my slightly higher than 50% chance bombardment failed, giving my opponent time to retreat his depleted armies and set up sandbags. Now considering I lost it's definitely more likely than not my opponent played better than me, but scoreline could have been wildly different if a couple of die rolls had landed my way instead.

EDIT: The different units do change up the game quite a bit and each scenario feels pretty different, but I think I'm keeping the rating a 6 because the game can still be really swingy.

Not bad. S.O. enjoys it. Doesn't hurt that her dad was a British WWII paratrooper.

Cards are too random for me, but I realize that is one reason it works so well (handy fog-of-war mechanism). It plays quickly, and the cards make the turn move along.

Great game mainly because I have so many people to play with I think. I have one of my friends, my dad, my brother and even my girlfriend and my little sister want to play it. 

The setup time is sometimes a bit long and you can get frustrated with the amount of luck involved, but most of the time I want to play another scenario right after we finish.

RATING: 7
Board/components look fantastic,  I haven't played it enough for a fair assessment, but I suspect it's a little too light for me.  The randomness of which sectors you get to control can be frustrating, and makes it feel like it really just boils down to luck.  I'm all for luck in a game, but carefully planned strategies are easily destroyed by bad luck.  So it's more of a tactics game.

AWESOME GAME!  Just about the best 2-player game I know of.  Luck plays a part, but tactics are very important.  The fun factor is really high on this one.  Some have complained that luck plays too large a part in this game, but in my experience, that is not the case.

This is a game about managing your command cards and your forces.  The replayability is high because you can't always use the same strategy in a scenario.  Depending on the cards you draw, you may have to try to win the scenario using a different strategy.  Short and long-term planning become essential.  There is a lot of meat to this game, yet the rules are so simple (especially for a wargame).

After a few plays, the appeal of this has dropped off significantly.  I must confess that I'm not a fan of the prevailing DoW art style, especially in this game, which comes off as goofy and cartoony.  Honestly, I think I could have done a better job with the mapboard and terrain tiles. 

I find myself preferring Battle Cry.  BC has simpler rules with a minimalistic art style that I prefer.  No reason to keep both, M'44 is on the trading block.

fun, but not quite so much as battlelore.  i feel that things just die a little too easily and quickly in memoir (with 50% odds per die that a soldier falls).  this game also lacks the same strategic positioning required in battlelore due to boldness and battling back.

if im going to play with soldiers, i think i prefer something like tide of iron.  the units are more specialized and rules provide more realism (although obviously not on a true wargame level).

If they'd had this when I was a kid, I might be a wargamer instead of a euroguy and sometime ATer.  The system is genius, and the production values are fantastic.  The flexibility and customization are immense virtues.  Maybe above all, in terms of the scenarios that come with the game, I'm amazed with how balanced it is, even and especially with asymmetric forces.  Every game feels close.  And by the end, when you can see where the armies have broken through and where they've held their ground, you're apprehending a visual story like few games provide.  A masterpiece, fully deserving of every kudo.

This game looks so great on a cursory inspection. The idea of a modular board to represent a bunch of different small battles that took place over the course of D-Day is terrific, and the simplicity of the rules  is attractive to anyone who likes the idea of wargames, but gets fed up having to stack chits and go through 50-phase turns. Plus, who doesn't love messing around with little green army men?

The game's a disappointment though. The rules are simply too dumbed-down, leaving players with zero strategic and minimal tactical options. And the decisions you do end up making don't feel anything like the kinds of things you'd be deliberating about in real life military conflicts.

I love this game!  I love hexagons, the little toy soldiers (they are so cool!), the theme (and the little background paragraphs for each scenario is a nice touch).  I love the tactical wargame feel to it, without the weight of a heavy strategy wargame.  I guess I like tactics games over strategic games - I guess I don't want to think too far ahead, and rather make the best out of what I have each turn.  (Probably why Agricola isn't a big hit for me.)  Sadly, wife doesn't like this game nearly as much.  I think it is because she gets frustrated by unlucky dice rolls.  And it can be frustrating not having the right section cards (although it doesn't bother me).  Maybe the just-purchased but not yet played Battle of Westeros can fix some of these problems for wife (although the added complexity might be a problem for her).

A great improvement over Battlecry in cards--you never feel stuck without any options.  The balance issues with the scenario victory conditions remain.  I tend to prefer the theme of the American Civil War for a match of the game mechanics, though.  The ancients theme of CCA is the best so far, actually.  WWII theme seems ill-suited for the left/center/right battlefield dynamic.  The scale eludes me as well. Makes me wish that Battlecry would be revised.  Command and Color: Ancients is the best of the bunch.  All in all, I don't see playing M '44 again when there are the other better-themed C&C games.

Picked up Feb 2006

Very simplified wargame, making it widely accessible. But your options are totally limited by your cards so there is quite a large random factor. I can see how some people would have a hard time with that. But, given that this is quick playing game, I can't see it as being a big problem since there isn't a huge investment of effort per game. Perhaps it is best thought of as a game of plastic army men rather a wargame. I've only tried a solo game to get a feel for the mechanics, but it seems like a solid 7 so far. The cardholders rule! I'm gonna have to get some for general use with other games.

RATING: N/A
Quick gameplay, but it's still a wargame. As such, I don't think that it will get enough use to warrant purchasing. However, the mechanic rocks so much!! Despite this, it would be worth buying if the price was $20. At the end of the day, I think Small World will scratch the itch for a similar game.

GREAT IDEA: Borrow the game once a month from Avi and see if the game is as well received as I would hope it to be.

Good kid's oriented introduction: http://boardgamegeek.com/video/8009/memoir-44/perfect-for-family-play-as-well-the-board-game-f


NB: The game has a high "want" factor due to its respectable game ranking on the geek. However, in thinking about how the one or two games have been played, the gameplay (i.e., with cards) leaves a positive impression, but the execution (i.e., rules v-v attacks on hexes at various distances) leaves  a negative memory of how the game was. As such, the game is definitely NOT one of our Want Very Badly games.

I think that Small World would scratch the Memoir 44 itch without having to go through (a) the typical war theme and (b) the resolving of conflict through targeting specific units and rolling dice. In other words, SW would probably be a little bit simpler in this regard and more fun.
NB: Small World focuses on area control vs. combat. This, in part, makes it more fun (and a "light" war-type game).

Good light wargame for beginners. If you usually don't like wargames because of their complex set of rules and long playing time... try this one!

Sceanrios are not balanced by design. If you don't like/can't handle this, don't play it.

I bought this online as a heavily discounted bundle, with 8 expansions. It will still take a lot of plays to be worth it, but so far, that seems probable. Days of wonder always produce attractive bits, and this is no exception, and the game itself is easy enough to play, while allowing for plenty of tactical detail (at least, for a non-wargamer).

Update: Ha! I thought I'd play this more than I have. I'm tempted to pick up some of the expansions that I'm missing, as well as an extra copy of the base game and expansion armies (I'm a completionist), but somehow I doubt that'll get me to play any more than I already do.

Great bits. Simple rules. Fast paced.
There's little strategy here: whatever your decisions, cards say what you can do and dice if you did it well. 
Cards aren't balanced.
Some scenarios (for hystorical purpose) aren't balanced.

This is a relatively fun, luck-driven light game with WW2 stylising. I bought this purely as a light game for friends who are not bothered with getting into the more serious stuff I play. In all honesty we haven't come back to Memoir after three evening sessions, but there's nothing inherently wrong with it as a light game.

I love the WW2 theme, I love the "historic" scenarios. I hate the three zone board. It's fast and fun, but ultimately unsatisfying for me. This game is all about tactics with only a slight bit of strategy. If I want a light complexity wargame now, I play Battles of Westeros because it fixes the problems I have with Memoir. If I want something meatier, I look to Combat Commander: Europe.

This game is FUN!  I think it builds upon Battle Cry and thank GOD you don't have to apply the stickers to the dice in this game and cut the miniatures out (like Battle Cry!).  Great game on its own.  This is one of those games that doesn't need an expansion, but new scenario's from DoW all the time is a great thing!  After a second playing I think cards with weather effects, snipers, possible natural disasters would be fun though!

Can't wait for this to arrive to play with my youngest - UPDATE now that we've played a number of times, it's fun.  Nice entry level game for him at 10, now 11, and plenty of fun variation from scenarios and maps to getting historic perspective on the real battles.  Fun with the kids, but not sure I would play with other adults as the more detailed battle simulation games scratch that itch better.  Was well worth the purchase.

Although hardcore wargamers can justifiably laugh at the amount of luck involved and the lack of realism, the fact is that this game is a heck of a lot of fun.  As an introduction to wargames  (hex movement, terrain effects, line of sight) it simply cannot be beat...although I'm a bit embarrassed by the cartoony artwork.  I mean, I'm a grown man playing with plastic soldiers already, do I really need the Disney treatment here?

Very disappointing game. It's more a dice and cards game, where too much luck is involved, than a challenging tactical game. Certainly not fulfilling for someone who doesn't want just a "fun game". Most of the time, game ends when it becomes interesting. Game mechanic is clearly unrealistic and frustrating to play, especially with the card system that is supposed to reflect "Fog of War".

Boring.

     No historical tactical strategy game should be this riddled with luck.  Despite the beautiful production and obvious thought and research that went into the scenarios i was disgusted by this game due to either not being able to employ any of my tactics due to luck of the draw on one occassion and having them crippled or frozen by cheese imbalance/luck on others. I should say that i only played it 3 times and was not compelled to give it more of a chance as i did not own it.  Because of that i gave it a 4 instead of the 1 i believe it deserves.

RATING: 10
This is my favorite game.  I even own unopened second copies of be base game and almost ever expansion in case something happens to the original.

I own dozens of WWII-themed strategy games (Squad Leader and so forth), but this is my favorite by far, and this is the one game I'd take on the desert island with me.

It captures strategy, history, tactics, and is all tactile and quick to teach and highly visual and varied.  Two of my daughters even love playing it in person and also online when with me when I'm out of town.    

This is a wonderful system and the online game is tremendously done.   It has both a solitaire mode and a great online mode.  A second version can also be played on Vassal with hundreds of scenarios.

There is also a terrain editor where you can create your own scenario and play on line or print out and use with the the boardgames version.  

This is the only "addictive" game I've ever played.

Unfortunately a bit too much luck for me.  A perfect strategy can be thrown down the toilet by a couple bad rolls.  Or you can just get not-so-good cards and never have the chance to make a good strategy.  I can honestly see why people like it.  Just doesn't quite do it for me.  I do like other games with the same amount of luck... so it must be something else.  Just can't put my finger on it.

In a sense I was waiting all my life for a game like Memoir '44:  toy soldiers fighting battles on a table top.

For me that is its great strength - bringing toy soldiers to life (without the expense and investment of time required to play with serious miniatures).

I have taught this to my nine year old daughter and to my nine and eleven year old nephews.  They love it - largely for the same reason.

It is fun to play to a point, but my own taste runs to games like ASL, so this does not really do it for me in terms of meeting my needs as a gamer - but as something fun to play with the kids, can't go past it.

RATING: 5
I really am conflicted with this game.

Overall it is a lot of fun to play, and there are many scenarios, expacks, and flexibility with the components. And those are all things I really do love about this game. But the thing that really sours me on it is the nearly complete reliance on luck.

Cards & dice rolls...you will live or die by them.

Still fun to be sure, and there is some mild strategy involved. The problem with the strategy is that it becomes less about the battle tactics and devolves into "how do I not feed my opponent victory points". Many of the scenarios are focused on a set VP limit, and dead units count towards that goal...so as I stated above, eventually you throw battle plans out the window and just try to keep vulnerable units out of harms way.

I will continue to mix in plays where I can, and maybe even buy another expack or two just because it is fun, but it just never scratches that "war" itch.

I have never played a serious wargame, but I believe the only one I can handle is Memoir 44 (if you consider this a wargame). 
Based on my (non-existent) knowledge of wargames, this is a very light wargame, but not a light game. People say this game is very simple. It is not. Some rules like line of sight, fire from mounts and some complicated action cards are not simple.  I like the asymmetric aspect of the game and I think playing time is in the right spot.

Very good game for a quick game between two players, thought it lacks in some more detail in the units that it would add to it a lot. quick battle system and very fun, minatures are of good design thought they could be a little more varied, the artillery units must be kept in a place where they are out of danger because they are very light. overall if you want to have a good ww2 game that will be fun and can be played in even less than an hour buy it with eyes closed.

I wish I liked the C&C system more than I do, but the appeal for me is mostly limited to the chance to play with my kids. Which I'm now starting to do, so it has that great strength. But for me as a semi- (former?) wargamer, it just feels too constrained, with too little movement. It feels like just the middle part of a battle, when the two sides are duking it out. What's missing is the probe & approach, the grabbing of terrain for a fighting position, and the cleanup/pursuit.

I suppose my biggest complaint is the victory condition, it never seems particularly realistic or satisfying with most games ending just when things are getting started.

This game has now been overshadowed by the superior Commands and Colours:Ancients.

So it may not be teh most acurate simulation of WWII ever - but it is a streamlined, fastpaced and entertaining game nonetheless. Virtually all missions feel well balanced as you are playing them.

My personal favorite of all the games I own!  The basic rules are fairly simple, but they can be applied in some amazing ways that create very interesting scenarios.  Although there is a lot of luck determining the outcome of battles, it fits the game perfectly and is always a lot of fun!

RATING: 8
Fun, lightweight war game, nice intro to war-games in general. Dice rolling and the use of cards give a good balance of luck verse strategy. The fact is, even in wars of the past, tactics and strategies may be planned for months, but things don't always go as planned when D-Day comes. When that happens, you make do with what faces you and plan for surprises and new circumstances. I think this game replicates that in a light, exciting way. This is an enjoyable and fun game.

RATING: 6
Good game - my only recommendation is to toss out the cards/sectors mechanic. Me and my friends play it this way:

1.) The second player, determined by the rulebook, gets to move 2 units forward as scouts. These may seize terrain, but may NOT engage the enemy.
2.) The first player, determined by rulebook, moves 50% of their forces forward, in response to "rumors of enemy movement in the area of operations." These may seize terrain AND may attack the enemy. 
3.) Second player then gets to move a full force attack, each unit marching/attacking as per normal. From then on, both players move each unit they control as if they possessed a card that allows all sectors to move all units. Without cards, we recognize no special abilities (Artillery Bombard, Air Strike, Armor Assault, etc.)

Expansions I own:
8/10 - Breakthrough Map
7/10 - Terrain Pack
7/10 - Equipment Pack
4/10 - D-Day Pack

RATING: 6
A great introduction into war games. Its simplicity makes it easy to learn, and it'll hit the table more often than others due to its relatively fast gameplay. Setup takes a little time, but the gameplay is easier than it looks. There's no defense to calculate, and dice chucking is always fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A pretty lightweight game but the rules are so simple and the play so fast that the trade-off in terms of time spent to entertainment gained is huge. There's more depth and more of a wargame going on here than you might realise - just like proper tactical WW2 combat, it's all about best use of terrain for your unit composition. The base game is improved hugely by some of the expansions. See my review for more details: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/168227

RATING: 6.06
Rating:

Game quality: The mechanics still seem OK and leave me wondering why I can't do certain things even though logic says I should be able to, ie my guys are standing right next to the enemy, but I can't attack them since I ordered units somewhere else to do stuff. 

The C&C system appears to create strategy and tactics through restriction versus more of a free form style system. I prefer systems that get out of my way and let me do what I want to. The system feels incredibly close to being awesome and yet...

Lowered score from 7 to 6 after a win oddly enough. Luck of the draw will play a factor at some point in a tight game regardless of strategy.

After 5 plays I lowered it to a 5. Seems stuck there. I want to love it, but I don't.

Update: After time away from the game and a 6th play, things finally clicked for me. I still don't love the card system, but I think it works for what it is trying to do in a gateway system. The lack of you being able to use your cards in the end can simulate just how tight resources are at the end of a battle.

It can be fiddly to set up.

I can't think of anything wrong with the dice system but something feels off.

There's still better versions of the system even when I originally played the game and now there is BattleLore 2nd edition which I think really fires what is left of this game since it includes miniatures, which was one advantage the game had over other versions of the system. If you are picking Memoir '44, it is for the theme. 6

Would I buy this again if I was starting over: I don't own it. I know someone who does and there is online play which handles the fiddly parts of the game. Considering I think there are also better C&C systems(just about all of them really), I can't come up with a reason to own it. If I want WWII, I got Band of Brothers or there is the Conflict of Heroes games. 0.

Do I want to play this if asked: I'll play if asked, but I'm not asking to play it. I'll enjoy it enough to bump it just above a 5. 6.

Overall: 6.06.

Rating Potential: Likely stuck as is. I think its greatest crime is that it was one of the earliest games in the C&C system. Give this game a BattleLore 2nd edition treatment and it could get bumped to a possible 8+.

RATING: 7.5
I've only played with child opponents but I really like the card play. The scenarios seem rough for the Allies but I suppose that's the way it was.  

I recommend playing both sides of the scenario to really determine the winner but we rarely have the time to do that.  It's still fun regardless.

RATING: 9
OUTSTANDING game!  My experience with wargames stops with Heroclix, so Memoir '44 is just the right amount of complexity for me.  My brother-in-law and I taught it to ourselves in one afternoon, and played through 4 or 5 games.  Easy to learn, but with enough tactical depth to keep it fresh.  I look forward to playing it a lot more (once he buys his set so we can play Operation: Overlord), and certainly hope Days of Wonder recognizes this hit and offers plenty of support and expansions.

Played twice. Nice quick tactical game. My opponent and I each won the same scenario keeping the same side once snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. Unlike battle lore the action starts on the first turn. The command cards can really screw you if you cant activate the correct area.
I like the way the game ends quickly when you reach the victory threshold. I will be buying this classic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Find this game too simplistic. Probably need to play afew more times to appreciate the game.

Update: Increase 7 » 7.5. Finds the game abit more strategic when you slow down the pace. On the other hand, finds the luck factor of the game very high, both from draws of the card and from the dice. There is this victory where I terminated 3 units in one turn to claim 3 Medals, all from unbelievably good dice rolls. But is it fun? YES. ^^

Update: Sold.

TV: 10.

Update: Watched Saving Private Ryan again.. Such a great scene in the opening 30 mins! Went back out and bought two (2!) sets of Memoir '44 for some Overlord goodness!

3rd best game of 2004.
Bands of Brother in a box. I don't have many chances to play this nor have I bought any expansions (which literally expand the game, to cover almost all of WW2), because they seem to add quite a bit of complexity, so I won't rate it 10, but this is still best wargame for me. Online version would be interesting, but I don't like the payment model.

I'm having way more fun with this than I ever thought I would for a "non-serious" wargame.  It is fast, and while there is a lot of luck I rarely blame the dice or cards for defeat or victory.

Easy to play and accessible even to novices.  Set up time is a bit long, and the gameplay is too limiting for my tastes.

Often, I give games relatively low rating simply because I think there is something objectively wrong with the game, i.e. poor components, lousy ruleset, etc.

That's not the case here.  I think the game is fine, but just not my cup of tea.  It's not a game I will actively seek out.

Best WWII game that I have played.  I only wish that it had more nationalities so you could play US, Russia, Britain vs Germany, Japan, Italy. (this is where I'd like to see this game go)

2009 update: And this is where it did go!  The question now is where to go from here.  One route is an obscure battles expansion.  I would love to see Alaska with Japanese and American troops on the winter board (a winter beach would be even better!).  With the new urban combat rules, I'd love to see an expansion with a city only board.  A Godzilla figure and scenario would be an awesome promo.

I like the scenarios as well and I'm sure the expansions add fun as well. I personally don't do wargams or 2p games much anyway, but this would be good for me if someone else really wanted to play.

RATING: 8.5
This game is excellent. The base game is great - with any of the expansions it's even better! The single best expansion to get for Memoir is the Air Pack as it adds planes as well as a full set of cards outlining the rules for all the other expansions.

The comment about the time to set up the game is a fair one. There are a number of elements to set up before you can play but I find that after finishing one scenario you can quickly set up for another (you'll rarely just play one scenario!).

Gameplay is simple and depth of strategy is good. Yes - you will get unlucky with your card draws and dice rolls but this is a strategy-light game. If you want something more realistic there are other games out there with instruction books as thick as your wrist.

I would definitely recommend this game to people who like the theme and have someone consistently to play against. The base game is great but is much improved by the various expansions.

Command & Colours. A neat system. In itself straight-forward and elegant. In the Memoir '44 version, though, it is complicated with special rules for different unit types, terrain and faction specialities. The C&C system in its core is elegant and disregarding the dice almost Euro-ish, but in this version it is definitely fully an Ameritrash game. That said it is still a neat system of playfully representing a WWII light wargame. 

Against the game, though, it the extreme reliance on luck. All attacks are dice ("colours"). And the options of the player depends on luck of the draw from the "command" deck. Wargames relies to an extent on luck for good reasons; to simulate the winds of war. But Memoir '44 is founded on luck to an extent that makes it sometimes frustrating and annoying. In some ways M44 is like Warhammer 40000 played on hexes and with cards telling which units to activate. When rolling this amount of dice a game should be fast and a laugh. However, M44 is rather an investment in time and frustrated tears. 

I recently played a large 180 minute campaign where an certain victory because of good placement and solid tactics was turned into an embarrassing defeat because of two cards played by the opponent and the game was won on literately one dice at the end. Some people might find that fun, perhaps even epically so, however I found it incredibly anti-climactic and it gave me a very bad taste of the game.

I just can't find much wrong with this game! I have played 5 games, once as Axis for first 3 scenarios and twice as Allies for first 2 scenarios. VERY rewarding game to play. Components are super cool (Even the artillery which is a little thin in the barrel) Want to play all the time and I expect this not to change with the caveat that future expansions and online scenarios appear.

I really liked the idea of this game, but just couldn't regularly get it to table with a second player and ultimately got rid of my copy.

I love that it's based on real scenarios and the theme was extremely well integrated into gameplay.

I enjoy the strategy of this game, using what I've been dealt in the best way possible.  It doesn't get played as often as others in my collection.  I think this may be due to two factors:  set-up time and theme.  Set-up is lengthy and the theme hasn't grabbed me like I thought it would.  I still enjoy the game though, and would probably play it a lot more if I could leave it set up on a table somewhere.

I love this game, except for the fact that the cards can be very limiting at times.  But that adds to the excitement.

RATING: 8
The Command and Colors system, overall, is a 7: It's lighter than I prefer, the movement, range and combat values are often wonky and the realism is...amusing. It is a very light wargame, lighter than air, in fact. But it does what it sets out to do and does it exceptionally well. Taken on its own terms, as a [i]game [/i]--not a simulation--it passes the most important test: It's fun. Memoir gets a boost to 8, because I'm a WWII guy. Ancients is not a particular interest, but it has a bit of added complexity that keeps it at 7. Battle Cry (both versions) and Napoleonics simply aren't a period of interest for me, so they are a 6.

Memoir specifics:
I was uncertain about this game, but with several plays under my belt I must say that I like it. With five plays now, I like it a lot. Enough that I've bought several expansions.

I advise you to ignore the folks who dismiss it as not a wargame, not a simulation, or whatever. It's a light wargame that does a nice job of abstracting the chaos of warfare. And it looks great doing it.

Setup time is on the longish side, but not as bad as I feared, and not as bad as BattleLore. But the payoff is a clean, easy to learn game that is just fun. It's not a deep simulation, but it doesn't pretend to be, and unlike a deep simulation, you can play several battles in a single night.

I think it does a nice job of balancing luck and skill, and above all it is playable. You have to make good choices and manage your hand, but it really helps to get a little lucky. There are a few cards that are quite powerful if used wisely in the right circumstance. You might not have the right cards and get hosed, but this makes you be flexible and creative. You don't have complete control of your forces, which is okay in a light game like this--and it's a pretty successful way of abstracting the chaos, disorganization and imperfect performance of military units in the heat of battle.

Good stuff, and I hope to play this many more times. It could easily move up to a 9. I doubt that it could be a 10 for me, because this is not my preferred level of depth and simulation, but this is not a design flaw.

Appreciate this game for what it is: fun.

Other things that might bother you about this game: the units (with minor exceptions) are generic; the ranges are a little off; and the victory conditions encourage gamey maneuvers at the end. But [i]at this level [/i]of abstraction, I don't see why they should bother you much, unless you're just itching to find something wrong with the game.

Nice board and pieces. Simple rules (for a wargame) - though learning curve suffers in comparison to BattleLore. Fast to play (compared to other wargames particularly). Lots of replayability (due to extra scenarios being online).

A GREAT light wargame. Yes, hardcore grognards scoff at the luck, but the rules are straightforward, the production values are excellent, and moving the little plastic units around is very satisfying. Because the scenarios are short (~45 minutes), some bad rolls early on mean you don't have to spend the next 2 hours "playing out" your inevitable defeat.

Light strategy war game that should be great for sons and fathers.  I like that the use of cards and board sections narrows the choices and speeds up game play.  Overall, however, this simply isn't the sort of game I like to play.  Still I can see how it has earned its praise.

This is a very fast pace game. You can setup and have a game done in no more than 60 minutes. The average play time so far has been 30 minutes. The game is simple to learn and the way the components are made there is some versatility.

For this style of game, the luck factor of the dice is not a big deal. 

The only thing that may bring this down is the luck of the cards. Sometime you can really get stuck because of the luck of the draw. 

I rate this game high because after 3 games of play I enjoyed it enough to purchase it for myself.

There are lots of great things to explore with this game: The Campaign Books, Air Pack, Overlord, Breakthrough, D-Day Landings maps etc.  All well done, light, and fast playing.  This is one game that really gets BETTER with larger expansions (overlord, breakthrough, D-Day) or with campaigns - but the base game is where it all begins.  Memoir also plays on PBeM Vassal better than CCA since you have fewer turn interruptions (no evade/battle back).

I've played the first three scenarios. In general, I've enjoyed the game. The components are very good and the scenarios are interesting. The rulebook is very well written, very clear and concise. However, the ratio of set-up time to game play is a bit less than exceptional. The games play VERY quickly. I'd like a bit more opportunity to try different strategies than head-long rushes and static defenses (perhaps later scenarios will lend themselves to more varied play). It's basically too simplistic a wargame for my tastes.

RATING: 8
Husband and I play this one quite a bit - he likes the military theme and the history behind the scenarios. Nice bits, good strategy, game time not excessive. Newbies can be easily introduced to the game by teaming up with experienced players. Takes a little time to get used to the different movement restrictions/rules for different bits, but the learning curve is longer than it is steep.

Played once.  This is a wargrame crossed with a German-style boardgame, and I'm not sure the result is ideal.  The game is reportedly trying to accurately replicate squad-level battles of WWII, and has beautifully crafted pieces and an extremely flexible board that can be used to replicate hundreds of "historically accurate" battle scenarios.  However, the mechanics of gameplay (wherein players draw cards from a deck and then play those cards to move X number of units in Y region of the board) severely hamper one's ability to command units and direct the flow of battle in a way that you'd prefer (and would be historically realistic).  Victory conditions also don't reflect the actual flow of a battle, as players can achieve victory without actually sustainably achieving their objective (e.g., there's no option for luring enemy troops into traps set at the objectives).  So, there's a lot of German-style board game in this, but to call it historically accurate would be like calling Puerto Rico a historically accurate rendering of economic development in the Caribbean.  Frustratingly, however, in their pursuit of historical accuracy some scenarios are extremely unbalanced, leading to virtually guaranteed one-sided romps, an annoying outcome for a game that takes more than an hour to setup and play.  As a final frustration, some cards are inadequately explained (e.g., air strike), leading to possible debates over exactly how much damage is caused to which units (a very bad thing in a wargame).

If I want to play a historically accurate WWII squad-level combat simulation, give me <a href="http://www.battlefront.com/products/cmbb/cmbb.html">Combat Mission: Barbarossa to Berlin</a>; if I want a German-style board game, give me Puerto Rico, Louis XIV, or any of the other great games out there.  I want to play more Memoir '44 before forming my final opinion (I especially want to play more balanced scenarios), but right now I'm not sure this hybrid has much vigor.

[Update: I think I may have been too harsh.  Must play more, but this time with more of a eurogame mentality, and less of a wargame menatlity.]

RATING: 9
Often it feels like a tense struggle (not always). A big big plus (hence the rating): my friends really love this game and even ask me when I have time to play this, while I am normally the big game pusher.

And the dice rolling in this one is the most tense dice action I ever had: "am I standing up again to throw them?"

WARNING: Completists should stay away, I invested 175 euro in the game and still have just a fraction of all the M44 stuff and to play all scenarios that are available with the correct components you even need a 2nd copy of the base game and 2nd copies of the nation expansions (this will cost you aprox 500 euro at this point in time: October 2010) . Good marketing Days of Wonder ;). I just improvise when I dont have all the official stuff to play a scenario ...must resist to buy more expansions.

Fantastic game that I'd give an 11 to if I could. The games are short, about 30-40 minutes on average, but there is a good deal of strategy fit into those 30-40 minutes.

A scenario-driven strategy war game. It was designed to recreate major battles of the second World War, with a specific focus on D-Day. It's full of interesting information, and it's very respectful to the source material.

There is a bit of a chance element to the game, as battles are determined using dice, but otherwise the game is beautiful, strategic and thoughtful.

I've only played this with my son so far, but the C&C system seems to translate fairly well into this environment.  No, it's not ASL, but it was never intended to be.  Within the light wargaming sphere, it works well.

(Edit Feb 3, 2007):  I've played the game several times and finally used the cards; when I play with my son (who is 5) I typically don't use the cards.  It has some advantages over Battle Cry:  the differences in distances for attack and defense, and the greater impact of items like hedgehogs and the like.  However, the game also has drawbacks (no leaders).

Overall, I like the game and will rank it similarly with Battle Cry.  The other two C&C games in the series, Battlelore and C&C:Ancients, will probably be rated higher to reflect the increased complexity in the game.

This is probably the only true 10 (according to the listed criteria - you will always want to play, forever, and can't imagine that changing) on my list.  I bought it when it came out in 2004, and I just keep playing it.  The thing is, it's so expandable.  The system can be played in so many different ways.  I've played base game, Overlord, air missions, the campaign book, and all add a fresh new way to play that's different than other experiences.

Great strategy game, although you need to have time to play each scenario twice, changing sides between, as the vast majority of the ones included seem to be biased in the allies favour.

Often-times I find that the dice can tip the balance a little more than they perhaps should, but it all adds to the 'wargame-lite' feel of the game; and that isn't necessarily a bad thing.

My favourite of the Borg C&C:A style games. Light and easy with many expansions that add a fair bit of depth. In no way is this a simulation style wargame.

RATING: 8
A much simpler version of Commands & Colors. Ancients is not bad, but it takes about as long to set up as to play. Plus it's incredibly unbalanced. There are too many minutiae to remember to play casually. Memoir addresses all of these weaknesses; it's quick to play but quicker to set up; it seems balanced; and it's super-streamlined. Fits me much better, given that I don't want to devote all my gaming time to one game.

Memoir '44 gets a lot of love, and deservedly so: it is a tremendously good WW2 game.  I love the asymmetry of the scenarios and the simplicity of the mechanisms.  The card system is simple, elegant and effective for producing a feeling of being in control, but not entirely.  I don't, however, have anyone around me who wants to play much.  

If a parent ever has the idea of buying Risk for their children, stop them and tell them to get Memoir '44 instead!

The one and only game that strikes the perfect balance between board game fun, and war game strategy. Tons of minis, simple yet effective rules, and a seemingly interminable array of expansions to add to your experience. The pieces don't fit in the boxes, especially when you buy a few of the box-less expansions that you'll try to fit in there. Some storage box is definitely required here. Set up can be a little tedious after repeated plays, but there's much worse out there.

I bought this on a whim without knowing anything about the game, the system, or the designer. Never regretted it!

My husband and I love playing this and I am hoping to lasso my teenage son into playing as well.  It is just a blast to play.  I love how simple it is and how easy it is to explain to a new person.  I love how it looks and the satisfaction of chucking the dice.  I love moving the troops around the board.  I love the historical aspect.  I am not expecting historical perfection in a game, but it is nice to learn a little something while having fun. Love it.

Memoir 44 is the best two-player game I know. Versatility in maps, terrain, boards, armies and battle conditions make this game endless fun. There is just the right amount of tactics and luck involved. I think that in the end the better player will win more often. Sometimes dice will hate you, but setbacks are normal in real war too. It takes about two hours to play one map twice so the game lenght hits my sweet spot. I own the base game, W&D-board and four expansions. This will give me and my friend enough challenges for many years. I have even started to make my own scenarios, which is just wonderful. Straight ten from me.

Memoir '44 is a fun light wargame.  The rules are quite simple, yet they allow for a lot of replayability before growing stale.  The different scenarios are interesting and historically based.  I like the fact that most scenarios are not evenly balanced, to maintain historical accuracy.  Both players can play the two sides of a scenario in about an hour, and then compare results to determine the winner.

Has it's share of luck, but great fun and the more I play the more I find that you can make your own luck by careful play! - The rules are clever enough to allow you to take a lot of the luck out by careful planning - saving up cards for that important assault, for example, and careful use of terrain.  Quick, furious and great fun!  The terrain expansion pack and plentiful supply of user written scenarios just make this better and better.

RATING: 10
A great 2-player game using WWII as the theme. Uses the Commands & Colours Game System, which is perfect for light\medium game players or newcomers. May not be the ideal game for heavy war gamers as the luck factor is mild to mild\high due to the use of dice and cards. Looks good on the table and plays in under an hour when experienced.

This is the most accessible and simplest of the Command & Colours System of Games. 

For both of those reasons it is also my favourite, Great expansion support only extends the shelf life of this gem but the base game offers 16 scenarios anyway so it offers great value for money.

Luck plays a reasonable part, but in truth this game is all about careful hand management (of your card based orders) and a good battle plan.

RATING: 10
One of my favorite games. Great fun and I suggest a must have. Not a heavy war game by any means. Certainly the option when your most likely partners (especially wives) aren't into fantasy. Personally, this theme my preference of all the C&C games.

Neat theme, great expansions, loads of scenarios, good duration (although can be a little long to setup).

The cards which determine the commands you can give and the dice for the battles being random, means every game is different. Even the same scenario plays totally differently. Not all scenarios are even, this is also an interesting feature. Makes this good for teaching new opponents. More user scenarios seem to appearing just recently (I just hope Battlelore doesn't steal all the focus).

Plays well with two (my wife enjoys all aspects except the setup time).

Easy to show to others who only take a few turns to grasp the workings and then they are pretty much strategising like experienced players.

Very good wargame where you re-enact specific historical battles on maps that recreate the terrain and battle conditions.
If you would like to play a war game with minatures that is historically accurate but don't have alot of time to spend learning and playing, this is the game for you.  This same combat system is also used on it's sister games Command and Colors, Ancients, as well as Battlelore, so if you learn one you can play them all!

Ok, it's not a wargame.

A little too vanilla compared to other C&C games. I have fun playing, but I have almost no desire to.

Otherwise I would rather just play Battle Cry.

We have many expansions for this now, and I would like to play more myself.

A good solid fun experience comparable to the game experience of Battle Cry. I haven't played this enough yet to say I enjoy it more than Battle Cry...but I think I enjoy it at least as much so I'm rating both the same.
Plays very quickly and if you've played Battle Cry...you'll get the feel for these updated rules in a few minutes. Nice components which are a given from DOW. Now I'm looking forward to seeing what Command & Colors:Ancients will add to this gaming system.

Memoir 44 was the first game in my collection and has been great to have. The game looks great and let's players use several types of strategies to win. The scenarios play very well and although some scenarios do favor one side they still seem fair. There is also background information in each scenario and often times special units(Rangers, French Resistance, etc). Also, the expansions do add more variety to units, terrain and special rules but the base game is definitely enough to have some great battles.

I wanted to play this game for a while and I was not disappointed when it finally hit the table.  This game is a nice light tactical board game and it has made me interested in heavier games with the C&C system.  However, Battlelore took the system to another level with the addition of special army powers so thus game has fallen out of favor.  Gave this game to a friend.

If you want a war game to play with your 10 y.o., this one will work.  If you want a war game that simulates battles, forget it.

RATING: 9
Excellent entry level head to head wargame for the general crowd. Probably the most famous incarnation of the Command & Colors card-based system, which restricts the actions you can take based on order cards that vary due to luck of the draw and a segmented board (thus you may be getting ready make an assault on the eastern front, but if you only get cards that give orders on the center you are forced to rethink your strategy on the fly).

Campaign books are a must, as the included scenarios are hit-and-miss, or at the very least you need to implement match-style play (play the same scenario from each side) as 90% of them are horribly balanced in favor of the allied player.

RATING: 7
WW II simulation boardgame. Set up terrain, troops and armor to recreate 1944 battles. Card driven game, play on left, center or right flank, like the predecessor boardgame Battle Cry and roll dice to resolve combat. A light fun game, good introductory game to more serious war games. It did make me think back on history, especially when playing an Overlord scenario.

Ok, so this is light and fun yes.  Light Strategy, very light.  Low on realism (army men can full sprint with out getting shot at--no suppressive fire/pin/stunned etc).  The reviews are correct the scenarios aren't balanced.Good at what it is.  A light, mostly random, low realism WW2 game that can be played in 30 minutes including setup time.  Add expansions to add a little complexity.

Eastern Front kicks this up a bunch.  Perhaps 1 point.

Got my first play in during Thanksgiving. My father and I recreated the battle for Pegasus Bridge; he played the Allies, I played Axis. Unfortunately for history, the Nazis were able to rally, even though taken by surprise, and repelled the invading Allied soldiers.

Obviously related to BattleLore, this game employs several similar rules for unit movements and battle tactics. I can see where some people would draw a distinction from other "war games" but I certainly had fun and my father has requested a rematch to correct the tear in the fabric of time and space created by the Nazi victory.

I do enjoy WWII games, and this one often stratches the itch.  It is a light wargame with strong random elements in it.  Planning strategy in this game can be frustrating as you have to the the cards to make things work, and then you need the dice rolls to finish off what you started.  Usually you have one thing or the other, rarely both.  Mercifully, rarely so does your opponent.  I enjoy this game, but the overly random element can get annoying at times.  I like rolling dice, it's just that this game takes it to a new height by having to have both cards and dice.

Yes, I know it's heavily driven by the luck of the cards and dice, but for some reason, this game rises above that. I have enjoyed the losses as much as the wins, and watching the war progress as each scenario is played fascinates me. I don't know how long before I'll tire of it, but all the extras out there insure that I'll have every chance to find out.

RATING: 8.5
This is a relatively light, relatively quick dice fest, with just enough decisions to keep it interesting.  There's no high strategy, but a little hand management can help some.  On your turn, you generally want to play a card that causes the most potential damage to your enemy, and/or mitigates possible damage to you, in that priority order.  As a result, after a few plays, hands tend to play themselves, but it's still a fun affair to watch the battle play out, and occassionally the dice provide for some memorable heroics (or cowardice, as the case may be!)

I can see this falling from an 8, but after 5 plays and 3 scenarios, I really like the simplicity and fun of the whole experience.

UPDATE#1: After 17 plays, the luck is starting to get to me. I think I'm 5-12 and it can be miserable to feel like the cards and dice aren't coming your way. Fortunately the experience is over quick--and after I've cursed the cards and had a few hours to cool down, I'm eager to play another match!

Update#2: Traded for HotS 1st ed.

People who look at M'44 as a wargame totally miss the point. People who look at M'44 as a strategy game totally miss the point, too. People who rant about the randomness and the luck in the game do not understand this game. And that's because M'44 is a quick, light, tactical card/dice game with a WWII theme. And people who realise this do have lots of fun with it.

It's superb.  I'm a big fan of Battle Cry, but Memoir '44 improves upon an already great thing.  Days Of Wonder should be very proud.  Also, I introduced it to my non-gaming wife and after the first game, I was thrilled to hear her ask if we could play again!  Did you all catch that last comment???  Non-gamer wife...  Played it...

Better than the hexy look it has! I do like this game, despite the dice rolling. Maybe it's the historical connection. (Which if it's true makes me a nerd.) Simplicity is the key here I think. Takes a short while to set it up, and not super complex. Just place the units and terrain hexes according to the map in the rule book, and then you're off. Not a lot of counting in the battles. (For example you don't decrease in strength because you loose a soldier in your unit.) Once you know how many dice to roll, you have the result in front of you. And only one person is rolling. I recommend you to try it at least once. It plays better than you might think.

When playing Memoir '44 you get to be a kid again playing with toy soldiers, but now controlled through the use of the fantastic Commands and Colours system. There are so many expansions and scenarios, I will never get tired of this great game. As usual, Days of Wonder has published a game with top notch components.

What a disappointment. Everything was dependent on what cards you got and what you rolled. If you don't draw any cards to go with your flanks, then you can't do anything.

Really way to simple compared to the other Command and Color's systems.  Very little differentiation of units and the add-ons don't work that well.  Look at either of the GMT command and colors, Samurai Battles, or Battlelore to see how this system can shine.

It really needed light, medium and heavy distinctions for armor, inf, and artillery to work properly for WW2.  It could have been easily done that way too.

Great gameplay, and a welcome break from the traditional chit-based war games (for which I still have a fondness). Less concerned with simulation and more concerned with having a good, tense time.

I bought Command & Colors: Ancients for my son when he was 4, but I was a bit disappointed. Unfortunately, my mother-in-law bought this game for him and it's even worse. CC: Ancients is boring and tedious, but at least it's a game, in the sense that you have to consider several tactical options, including defending, and the flow of the game is more or less like a real battle. Memoir 44 is not a game at all, and bears no resemblance to anything. It's actually a toy, not a game.

While I generally like wargames with more detail, I'm very impressed by how this game manages to be a good simulation packaged into a "family" game.

Edit: still a good game, but I don't seem to play it much at all (almost always would choose to do Combat Commander or something with a bit more depth).

Memoir '44 is an elegantly simple war game that has won over everyone I've played it with.

Although the Nazis did perform truly heinous acts in real life, the minis are just differently molded versions of the same units the Allied player is supplied with, allowing for visual ambiguity. One is just playing a game of warring factions, without being so clearly 'the bad guy'.

Its a shame that very few of the scenarios listed in the back of the instruction manual are evenly matched. I understand that by 1944 the Axis were severely outgunned, but almost none of the scenarios have the Allies at a disadvantage.

The 10 score comes with the caveat this is a light game with fairly high degree of luck. It was perfect for playing with my son when he was younger, but as he got older we found the game tended to rely a bit too much on lucky/unlucky dice rolls or card draw. So we do now prefer playing Breakthrough where the luck has a bit more time to even out. But for a light wargame with a good dose of theme, it's about perfect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very fun game, alittle light in simulation, but simple, quick and interesting. Can suffer if very unlucky in card draw, or dice for a time, but quick enough that the next game hopefully will make you forget that. Many games come down to the wire, though at times that may be because you don't really "feel" that it's over yet. But many of the newer games seem to have that "short attention game syndrome" IMHO. Well worth the cost of the game, expansions, and time for playing, shouldn't sit on the shelf.

A neat almost-war game, with - it would seem - almost limitless capacity for expansion. The card command system is a little difficult to take seriously, which is the game's major flaw, but two seriously-minded gamers will get a lot more pleasure out of it than any other Days Of Wonder release.

The second war game I purchased after Battle Cry.  Enjoyed playing it from the start (and still do!). Have all the expansions. Yikes!  My thirteen year old daughter likes this game too.  We have probably played it 15 times together.  
Have now run Memoir 44 tournaments two years running for a summer camp.  The tournament involves 36 middle schoolers all playing head-to-head games (Yep.  We have 18+ copies of the game.).  The week culminates in multiple Overlord games played simultaneously.  I've had spectacular success introducing this game to the kids.  It's amazing how much history some of these kids know about WWII coming in to the tournament.

x 2.  I was impressed with Battle Cry and even more so with Memoir '44!   This rules system allows me to replay WWII battles at a level of abstraction that I prefer.  Just enough flavour and tactics to be enjoyable while giving me the feeling of commanding forces in a historical battle.  It is easy to teach and quick playing.  Memoir '44 is a superb, light, WWII-themed game with elegant rules and extremely cool bits.  I love this game!  Actually, I love it so much I went out and bought a second copy to play Overlord scenarios.

Memoir '44 deserves to be considered an instant classic.  It was pure genius for Richard Borg to combine boardgaming and miniatures gaming and card gaming in his Command and Colors system.  In doing so he created a new genre of game.

The components are gorgeous.  The rules are simple, clear and beautifully presented.  There are a large number of excellent scenarios.  The game system is clean and simple, fast playing and fun.  The playability and enjoyment factor is extremely high.  The only area where there is some weakness is in the area of realism.  The game could have been given a higher degree of realism without increasing the complexity.

All in all I consider this one of the best games ever created.  It is not in the Conflict Simulation category, but as a game with a WWII theme it is unsurpassed.  I have played this game many hundreds of times, probably more times than I have played all other games put together.  I have also introduced many people to the gaming hobby by using this game, more than I have introduced with all other games put together.  And everyone I have introduced to Memoir '44 has loved it.

Good light wargame. The dice can feel very unfair sometimes, but that's the name of the game I guess. I never do well at this game but it's usually a good time.

The one downside to the game is the lengthy setup time for the scenarios. Other than that I can see no negative to this game. Days of Wonder always has beautiful components and the mechanic of the game is simple since you only play one card per turn but gives you enough to develop a strategy. Combat resolution at first can take some time but once you get line of sight and advantages and disadvantages of terrain it is fairly simple to resolve. Simply a great game.

[b]Memoir '44[/b] was reacquired* via trade (12/18/14)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I honestly don't know what I was thinking with this one; well part of my decision was because I loved 1775 and didn't think I needed both games in my collection... wrong! (I'll blame the Jones Theory on this one)

This was a great gateway game into gaming for some of my friends and a game they still want to play. My son also really liked this game, the cool miniatures certainly helped, yet somehow I convinced myself it needed to go. 

I am now really regretting that decision, Memoir 44 and 1775 easily belong in my collection since they offer very different experiences even though they share some mechanics. Memoir plays much faster, has cool mini's and tons of scenarios to play through. This is a game I will definitely reacquire in the near future.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]- Excellent intro into light war gaming, and one that my kids can play.
- Due to the dice based combat, which is very intuitive, there is enough luck in this game that the game remains very accessible. 
- This was one of the best gateway games that I introduced to friends that had formally played Risk, etc. They were instantly hooked.
- Card play: I am in the camp that enjoy the tension created by never knowing if you are going to have enough movement cards to activate one of your zones enough times to pull of your plan.
- A lot of scenarios, which all have a different terrain layout, found in the base game alone which gives this game high replay value.

This was the second designer board game added to our collection. I figured my son would love the cool army minis, and he did.

Includes the following map:

RATING: 7
It's fun to play: as some say, it's like playing with army men except within the structure of board game rules. 

It plays really fast, is pretty intuitive, yet leaves room for several tactical decisions. And as evidenced by even the basic scenario, depending on movement and the luck of the dice, the outcomes can vary widely. 

I got this for my step-son for Christmas 2006, and unfortunately he didn't show much interest in it, so I ended up playing it. The scenarios can be played pretty quickly, and one can add in complexity as one goes through the scenario booklet. In all, it's a clever game, one of those I wish I'd thought of. It's a good design, with typically outstanding Days of Wonder production, and scenarios that play out in a short amount of time, which is appropriate given the relative simplicity of the design. At the same time, Richard Borg absolutely nailed the design concept of making a game with some depth as simple as possible, with the absolute minimum of rules, and yet touching all the basic bases for simulating WW2 combat. 

Combat is bloody, and the game really shines head-to-head. I give the game an extra star for proving itself as a design over such a long period of time--12 years as of 2016.

Ok! We were not sure about this game, as we really haven't gotten into war gaming at all! My wife tried wargaming with her father growing up, and said it just wasn't her thing! But...this game is incredible, after one game...the first scenario...she asked to play again...and again... So this was a great purchase, and we both finally feel that we do like wargaming! The game is quick and educational too! Set up your army and terrain! Begin! Your cards tell you what to do; move, roll the specialty dice and see if you get hits! Wonderful game!

Takes the Battle Cry system and rachets it up several notches.  The ease of entry into the game is high, and the replay factor (that "let's play again" feeling) is off the charts.  I am crossing my fingers that its success (of which I have no doubt) will lead to expansion sets / additional scenarios that cover the rest of WWII.  Packaging up sets of alternate minis and hexes for other conflicts seems a natural thing to do, too.

This is fun!  I do, sometimes, become annoyed that I can't make the play I want to make because I don't have the right card at hand.  I forget to attend to my hand first, then the board situation.  I don't mind the dice randomization at all though.

I take a great measure of pride being a Canadian, seeing some Canadian scenarios in the base game, and using it as a reminder of our participation in the conflict. Few games can give me that personal tie-in. Update: now that I have had the opportunity to use some expansions I really understand the elegance of the commands and colours system. One can gradually increase the variety of terrain, units and tactics. I love it.

A nice short war game with good components and mechanics. There is a heavy dose of luck through the cards and dice rolls, but it's not too bad provided you accpet it for what it is. A shame about the lack of scenario balance, but there is a large online community with lots of user made scenarios.

A simple but deep wargame that is easy to learn and teach.  I like that the scenarios slowly add more rules and amp up the complexity to teach the game.  My only fear is that unbalanced and limited scenario numbers will force continual purchases of the expansion packs to keep this alive, but so far it's been fun.  It also makes me want to try out other games based on the same system. Much better than Risk without being daunting at all.

100+ plays. This is my preferred game using this system - it's an attractive theme, the rules are not as complex as Battlelore, the tanks provide more dynamism than Battle Cry. That dynamism breaks down the conservative defensive approach typically taken by troops, making the game more fun. No doubt it's heavily luck-laden, from the dice to the cards, but you can play smart and dumb, and smart will win using combinations and weight of numbers, waiting until the time is right to strike hard. All the different available scenarios provide all the variety of tactical situations you should need, especially if you start adding in variants.

I'm a big WW2 fan, and the fact that this can be set up and played on a week-night and is a wargame is too good a combination to ignore. I don't think it's as good as Ancients or Battlelore, but it's still up there. 

The Eastern Front expansion is excellent. The Russian command system can be frustrating, but then that's the whole point! Now that the Brits have arrived, we can fight over sand as well - another good expansion.

Memoir '44 is a fun light military game. The setup is quick and most of the battles last a half hour. The only complaint I have is when the command cards do not match any section you have troops located. It gives your opponent an advantage as you sit a wait. A solid game that I am ranking a 8.

An excellent game, not only to introduce new and inexperienced players to war gaming, but because of its almost endless replay value, a great game for experienced gamers.
The only 'negative' is identified by statistical nerd bean counter, rules lawyer types! That it is 'not very realistic', I don't think we need to use much imagination to imagine what the 'ultimate' in realism would be.
Thankfully, those types are very much in their own 'minority' leaving, for the enjoyment of the 'majority', this wonderful and fun game.
The other negative is also quoted by the above group, that of the luck element regarding the card draw mechanism, my advice to them is to 'carefully' read any actual account of an encounter and the obviousness of the involvement of opportune fortune will shout out to them!
If I could give a higher than 10, then I certainly would!
Oh! my qualifications for making this statement: 45+ years as a wargamer, model builder and boardgamer, i.e. 'quite qualified'.
In closing: there are two basic categories of 'games', 1, a game, or 2, a 'simulation', sometimes, but rarely does one also satisfy the other, i.e. true simulations rarely make fun or good games (other than to the previously identified group)!

Ovvero, come giocare a soldatini anche da grandi!
Uno di quei giochi che rischi di giocare a nastro tutta la nottata. Ottimi materiali, regole snelle, divertente, longevo (e infinito: sul web ci sono centinaia di scenari creati sia da Richard Borg che dagli utenti). Mi piace la divisione dei tre fronti, che ti obbliga a amministrare gli sforzi (e i turni!). Mi piace molto meno il fattore-culo: oltre al culo nel tiro di dado - che ci vuole ed è tutto sommato semplice e bilanciato - si aggiunge il culo nel pescare le carte azione. culo x culo = culo alla seconda. In seguito ho scoperto - e apprezzato - il motivo per cui le carte azione sono pescate a caso e fanno sì che il grosso dell'esercito possa rimanere bloccato per tutta la partita: Borg ha voluto rendere nel gioco l'assoluta difficoltà nelle comunicazioni nelle battaglie della seconda guerra mondiale. Spiegazione convincente! I pregi sono comunque superiori al difetto. da rigiocare (e le partite durano talmente poco che si concede sempre una rivincita).

I only have the base game. It is fun but lacks depth for me. The command and colors system though interesting often leaves a player with cards in their hand that are of no use.

Decent little game with a WWII theme.  Looks good.  Plays fast.  I like the way the command cards simulate command-and-control issues; you can't always issue orders to units in an omniscient and immediate manner.

If I'm in the mood for a WWII wargame, I'd probably lean towards ASL or Up Front or something along those lines, but M44 is good for playing with people who aren't really into wargames.  Also good for playing with my son, who likes the idea of wargames, but isn't quite ready for ASL.

A pleasant experience but if I want to play a 2 player wargame I prefer something a little meatier. There's something about the game I'm not sure about.

It's not the cards as combat commander and manoeuvre prove the fun of tactical CDGs.

It's not the plastic soldiers as warfighter and tide of iron give me a great nostalgia buzz during games.

Perhaps I started my wargaming at a slightly higher level- I dived head first into Lnls nations at war series as one of my first tactical wargames and bought memoir about 3 years later due to a few others recommendations.

Or perhaps it's that for me this style of card play doesn't quite match up to my take on WW2 tactical gaming. Fantasy, ancients, medieval even WW1 seem fine with 'wing' activations but for me WW2 is a bit of a stretch but clearly I'm in the minority when it comes to this game.

If I want a fun/fast(ish) 2 player Ww2 experience I think for me a similar level would be spearpoint 1943 with the terrain board Expansion and also the bonus of a faster setup time.

This was a nice surprise! I own and love C&C:ancients, but I had always dismissed memoir 44 as the "simpler random version" of the system. Nothing could be further from the truth! Memoir is just different! Terrain is much more important, spreading and quick moving is essential as opposed to maneuvering and line formations, and saving the good cards for the right moments is crucial. In the end I still prefer C&C: ancients, but I enjoyed this a lot and I maybe even end up buying it.

RATING: 6
an OK game. Not bad, not great, just ok. It's entertaining and I don't think it's as bad as people say and it definitely isn't as good as people say either. After playing real war-games I can't take this one too seriously. It's very luck driven. Now I don't mind luck, it's just that this one is a little excessive for what it is and brings the game down a bit. Some kind of luck mitigation would have been nice. I do understand why the design is the way it is though.

I do praise the game on the merits that anyone in your family can play this. It's a great game to play with kids and casual gamers. I'd say it's a good gate-way game potentially to war games. A decent family game.

My rating is based on all the expansions. Some scenarios are terrible and ruin the game. Play the best and most interesting scenarios when introducing the game, otherwise it will fall flatter than a pancake.

edit: people have been telling me that playing the overlord expansion is the way to play this game. I will have to give that a try and see if my opinion changes.

edit: After looking into the overlord version of the game I'm inclined to agree with what others say. It seems to be the way to play. More fun and more luck mitigation and control.

Also I've come to realize that while this game has a wargame theme it's not really a war game. It's a tactical conflict hand management game. You must manage your hand and resources as best as possible given the situation. Looking at this game from a wargame perspective is only going to make you disappointed.

I'm considering increasing this game to an 8 rating...time will tell.

RATING: 8
An exellent game. The war theme works well even though it doesn't reflect into the game very much.
Of course if I started to look into the realism of the game, this would be rated 4. But that's not really the point of this game, Memoir '44 doesn't even try to be realistic.
I play other games to have more realistic experience of the war and have some heavier strategies. This one though needs no any more realism. 

The main point is that this game is fun to play! Player gets to plan some strategies, and even though they may not be actual strategies straight from WWII, I don't care. Card-drawing affects your choices heavily and do not let me even begin with the dice.
Game is heavily luck-based, and almost a direct copy from Battlelore, but works just fine. I'm definitely willing to play more.

Really a great game, not a simulation, game!

Edit: 7->8, bought the game and feel extremely happy about it. Fast and fun!
Counting the played base gane scenarios under this title. Played expansion scenarios are counted under their corresponding titles.

Edit2: This just rocks! More skill included than meets the eye. Just damn the setup time!

I absolutely love this game. When playing, you get the impression that the designer, Richard Borg, took great care in designing the scenarios to faithfully reflect the battles represented in the rule book.

I have never not enjoyed playing it.

Good game. Very different from Battlelore. Infantery really is cannon fodder here. 50% chance that infantery takes a hit with a dice. This game is also much faster than Battlelore. Half an hour once you begin playing, when Battlelore takes over an hour with lore.
We only played 2 initial scenarios. Need to play more to get a good picture about the different strategies.

One play - I think I prefer this over CC:A for games in the CC series. The CC card system seems suited more to a game like this that doesn't pretend to heaviness. I also felt like there was less imbalance in the cards than in some CC:A games I've played.

Played this a lot before signing up for an account, mostly with my dad. He eventually sold his copy, plus all the expansions. Truthfully, I don't miss the game. 

The base set seemed streamlined and efficient, but that changed quickly. When all the expansions started piling up, my eyes began to glaze over. Enough with "more soldiers" thing, we've got a box of them already! The new sets added a few more rules to look up, a few more figures to organize, and some more stuff taking up space under the bed. 

While the card directed action still seems innovative, the game no longer provides the level of engagement I'm looking for (I was never too crazy about the WW2 theme, anyway). It's still a great game, but after sampling other games, I can't think of a reason to return to World War two. Maybe my interest in games evolved to the point where I outgrew Memoir '44. I don't know. It's like the  relationship we had with our first boyfriend. He was okay ...for the time. We may still think fondly of him, and remember the great times we had, but eventually we moved on. Is that such a bad thing?

I've played this a dozen or so times online and a few times on the board, and I really like it. It's pitched right at my tolerance level for war games (i.e. light). I imagine expansions will be necessary to keep it interesting in the long-term, but a fun game.
Update 2013: This has grown on me more with repeated face-to-face plays. A good game system brilliantly executed.

I want to play this game more often, just never get the chance, my SO loved it, but she's not so much into boardgaming so, I haven't been able to play, but it is such a good experience.

I think many people play this once with the first scenario (pegasus bridge) and rate it low based on that. It's also unfortunate that to get the best from this game you need multiple expansions.

A great World war two game, and a great 2 player game. The way the card play meshes with out the board is divided into sections gives the player tough management decisions to make, which is a good thing. One down side is that the set up can take quite a bit of time. Nice components, though.

Good game. It surprisingly has a lot of chance to it (rolls, drawing cards), but that makes it much faster than other military games. Also, the board is just the correct size -- large enough to move around but not small enough for constant fighting. The terrain and bunkers and such really make it shine and gives it the tactical thrill it needs. So you can say it is a luck-driven game, but not really.

A very good game overall. Nice components and mechanics. Nice maps although some are meant to play as campaigns since they are not all balanced. The only thing that sometimes makes this game lose all of its charm is the completely random results of dice rolls which may make some situations seem utterly ludicrous or the complete inability to make moves since you were unlucky in the card draw. Despite these two flaws, it is usually still fun to play for beginners - once the charm fades, its time to play Tide of Iron. Note: Steep prices. Owning all expansions would easily cost more that 500$. Days of Wonder sure know how to make us pay!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Really simple mechanics for a war game. Adding options and expansions starts modifying these, but not in a very hard to understand way. My only gripe about the game is that it is clearly designed with expansions in mind, that is, the really interesting battles do require much more than the basic box. I have already sunk a good deal of money in it, and I am in the fence as to whether or not to buy the rest of the things I would want to. Another thing that I find not so good is that many of the missions require you only to obtain a certain amount of medals, which most of the time is attained by killing enemy units. This makes many of the core objectives of the missions where you get medals kind of unnecessary. Why take the city or the bridge when all you need to do is bang up on the least defended enemy units? Again, I like the game, but I still need to do some sifting through the available missions to find out what really works, and that takes some playing through not so good scenarios.

Just got the game and we played the beginner scenario twice. The first go at it I was just ok with it,by the 2nd play I was seeing how you could save your card's and wait for the right moment when your troops are in place for a big move and play some strategy.
The game is pretty strait forward,not difficult to learn and overall a good solid game.

M'44 is now obsolete for me, it's only saving grace is its subject matter.

This is the classic C&C implementation again, only with WWII figures, components, considerations, and combat.  This means it is mostly a duck'n'cover routine, with occasional running, shooting, so on and so forth.  I think of the three games that I own that utilize this type of system (this, BattleLore, C&C:A) I must say I like this the least.  I find that this game does, truly, rely heavily on the card draw.  There are no mechanisms in place to allow you to try and make best of what you have.  Having played it many times with the same friend, we often quote "..having hot dice rolls is important, but without the right cards you don't have a chance."  There it is.  In this game there is no battle-back, just defense.  This makes only the scenarios where, historically, there is no clear winner the most interesting of the bunch.  Anything else -- it's just not as fun.  If you are in it for the minis (AKA, you have a young child but want to have some fun) I'd definately recommend BattleLore over this.  If you are looking for a better implementation of the same system, I'd reach for Command and Colors: Ancients.

When do I play this?:
If I had a 8 year old son, I'd be playing it all of the time.  Instead, I have a mid-20s girlfriend who isn't so gusto into the whole thing, but she humors me from time to time. All and all, this is a fun game, but because it's only for two players (best played, anyways) it doesn't get as much table time as I would like.

Terrific war game-lite fun. Playing with the figures brought me back to childhood, but with the added depth of tactical decision-making and a real sense of urgency with each passing round. The C&C system is versatile and works quite well for those of us who don't have the time (or even the inclination) to do a deep dive into the world of intense war gaming. My daughter loves this game as well, which makes Daddy quite happy. Lots of fun.

Best WW2 game I have played, although I must admit my bias for rules that don't come in volumes when it comes to wargames (see ASL).  Some of the scenarios are horribly one-sided, but especially when using the game as a historical tool, this is a great thing.  Again, the best solution to imbalance is play two games and switch sides (count total medals).  Not a top tier game, but definitely a lot of fun.

Played my first game with the wife over Skype long distance, and we both had never played a game, and she had never looked at the rule book. this speaks for the ease of learning the game.

We found this game to be incredibly intense even though it is a beginner war game because of the dice rolls, and the card drawing mechanics. although currently im unsure if all this luck is a good thing, i feel as though it is mitigated through the games many other mechanics.

The one thing that makes this game very interesting to me is the following of real world events, while still balancing the game out, even though it looks to be at first that the game is imbalanced towards one side massively.

I will report back to my notes after several more plays

Visually thematic and the card restrictions and use of dice makes for tense game play. Having played many European games over the years, it felt unusual being passive on my opponent's turn, just being a spectator (or refereeing) when I'm so often actively card counting, tactically deducing, evaluating costs etc. (This is no problem if I want to give my brain a rest, but is quite dull otherwise). I'd like it better if the conflict was more interactive like in Risk/Clash of the Gladiators whereby the defender feels involved in the confrontation.

hmmm...I don't want to give this game a 10 but I feel I have to.  I keep playing it.  With more than 200 games under my belt and this still seems to get played weekly.  The more I play it the more I like it.  So it started out at an 8, crept up to a 9, and finally a 10.

Luck? There is no more luck to this game than Settlers of Catan.  Planning is critical.  You must always play the current card with the card 2 turns down the road in mind.  If you do this, you will win more than your fair share.

The replayability is almost endless.  I hope to see more expansions from Days of Wonder.

Lowered to a 7 - approaching burnout.  

Back up to an 8, hope they come out with more campaigns.

It is a good game just one that I don't care to play often.

Now this game is not the most complicated one. Roll some dice, give some orders, hope for the best. It's not a game for hardcore wargamers or strategists, since the dice have so much effect, not to mention the cards that constitute your orders. Still it warmed my wargamer heart, and the scenario we played seemed really well designed. While the game is not the best WWII simulation, still it's a fun game to play. Just don't take it so seriously.

RATING: 6.6
I've played about 6 games of it, and watched a few more.  While it was initially fun, the way the game mechanics work for using units tended to bog the game down at some points.  Also, since all units have ranged attacks, I can't help but feel that the hex-board should be larger.  This limit to size would be a complaint at the Commands & Colors system in general; however, Memoir '44 tends to emphasize the claustrophobia inherent in the system, unlike C&C:Ancients where the small size works fine with the focus on melee units.

RATING: 7
Not much complexity as far as war games go. I've tried it with the air pack and its better. Nevertheless a fun distraction. And who doesn't want to play with army men. A great intro to wargames if you have kids the right age. C&C Ancients is the better game system with more fleshed out rules but is not as nicely produced or as nice to look at.

Great as an introductory wargame, I like the Card driven system as it adds nice fog of war, I am not going to buy the expansion the current scenarios comes with game will be enough for me, I feel it is too simple for my taste. 
The thing I dont like is there is no return fire and if you dont own command in certain sector your unit just will watch the incoming fire with no reaction, cant wrap my head around this particular mechanism. 
However, it is excellent game for non wargamer and people who wants to get into wargame. 
The ancient version C&C works better.

Good game, simple and fast; there's a lot of luck involved in it, but also some strategy; most important of all, the game is very fun. Great components and fantastic Rulebook. 'Only' 7.5 because I don't like the World War theme very much and because it's a game for only two players, substantially.

A widespread light wargame with tons of minis.
There is some strategy but is far from being definitive, on the contrary there is a really high luck factor in both cards and dice.
Plus, the scenarios are insanely unbalanced.
But the commands and colors system works great and makes it easy and fun to play.
Damn, I'm over forty years and enjoy playing with toy soldiers again.

Love the historical context. Im not to bothered by the fact that some scenarios seems to be unbalanced. I'm not to bothered also by all the chance involed in dice rolling and in the action card drawing. The fact that they give you the outcome of the battles make me want to turn that over, even if the scenario is clearly unbalanced against me.

J'adore le contexte historique du jeu même si certains scénarios sont loins d'être bien balancés. Je ne suis pas ennuyé par l'aspect chance qui est très présent dans le tir des dés, et dans le choix des cartes d'actions. Le fait qu'on vous donne le résultat des scénarios est un incitatif pour changer le résultat même lors que le scénario est clairement en votre défaveure.

I haven't given this one enough of a change to rate it yet. So far, I haven't been able to get into it, but I generally despise wargames. I bought it with the idea that it was a wargame for people who hate them, but maybe you have to like wargames at least a little bit for Memoir 44 to work.

UPDATE: Played with a gamer friend and it worked beautifully. Great, engaging game. I think the base game is fine, I don't feel the need for expansions.

Didn't notice this is a 2-player game when I initially picked it up.  Haven't found the right 2nd player yet.

Played the iPad app to get a feel for the rules.  Some things about movement based on cards in hand and what constitutes a flank based on where you are on the board confused me a bit.

RATING: 9
Another fun game from Richard Borg. The Command and Colors system is very versatile so its not a surprise that it works well in the WWII theme. The game is quick and easy which makes it ideal for introducing children or newbies to war gaming. This is one of the few war games that my wife will play (and enjoy). Production quality is very high. The number of scenarios that come with the game is limited, but access to the internet allows you download dozens of other official and fan made scenarios. I highly reccomend this game to anyone looking for a WWII themed game that does not take all afternoon to play.

26/06/2007: Memoir has kept me busy creating my own scenarios and test-playing them. I purchased the winter board and all of the expansions, and am having a whale of a time indulging in the scenarios and designing my own. Wonderful, easy-playing and enjoyable, and yet not too tedious and complex. A big thumbs up from me!

RATING: 9.5
Memoir '44 might as well be the best gateway game for wargaming out there. Command cards (unit activation), terrain, scenarios, line of sight etc. many elements of classic wargaming are in there. And yet, the game is just as simple as most Days of Wonder games, if not simpler and it is still tremendous fun. Being a 2-player game, the basic gameplay is very much like an extended (in variety, not in complexity of course) version of chess, take turns in moving your units, fire away and hope for the best. I think the game can appeal to a wide range of gamers (excluding the unnecessarily serious) because of the luck element. To me, it makes the game more dynamic and fun, will I be going to draw the right cards, roll the symbols I need etc. All this and the fact that there are myriads of expansions out there make this an absolute winner.

EDIT: Having played this a few times in a row recently, I still love but sometimes long for something similar of slightly higher complexity (i.e C&C Ancients or Combat Commander) - Maybe I just need an expansion ?

When I first got Memoir '44, I played it a bunch and really enjoyed it.  The games were fast and exciting and had a sense of history about them.  I was inspired to seek out more detailed war games like Twilight Struggle, Combat Commander and Warriors of God to name a few.

Coming back to it after exploring the lighter end of the wargame genre I found Memoir '44 to be [i]very[/i] light.  So light, in fact, that I'm not sure I enjoy playing it anymore.

E' probabilmente uno dei migliori, se non il migliore, wargame "leggero" sulla II^ Guerra Mondiale. Da non perdere! Si gioca facilmente, rapidamente e con grande divertimento! Il gioco si spiega in pochi minuti, ha strategie definite ed abbastanza componente fortuna da rendere ogni partita diversa. Per i componenti, la Days of Wonder si è confermata una delle migliori, sono assolutamente favolosi, con eccellenti materiali di qualità dalla bella grafica (molto adatti all'epoca), il tutto completato da un manuale che mostra moltissimi esempi, illustrazioni e figure. Il gioco attira molta gente, persino chi non ama i giochi di guerra. Infine una grandissima varietà per quanto riguarda scenari disponibili online e le numerose espansioni che ci sono.

The nice thing about this game is I have no impulse what so ever to paint the miniatures. I think that retro coloured plastic soldier thing suits this game.
Theres less luck and more strategy in this game than you would expect. Theres mostly always something you can do with the hand you have.
A quick paced and addictive game.

RATING: 7
this game has really fun cool looking bits and a cool variable map/scenario system. i really wanted to like this game more than i did. i just found the combat system to be overly simplistic for my tastes. i also got annoyed by the order cards. sometimes bad draws mean you can go a whole turn or two without having anything effective to do on your turn. i will say that i find the claim that the scenarios are unbalanced to be overstated. there are usually different win conditions for both sides. despite being cursed by the dice gods, i have won as the germans in scenarios where they were at a disadvantage. i can see why people like this, and i wouldn't mind playing on occasion, but ultimately this game is not for me. (i've actually traded away two different copies of this game)

update: after playing C&C Ancients, I've come to appreciate the simple and straight-forward game play that this incarnation of the C&C systems offers.

RATING: 5
So far this is very decent. I really like the mechanics and the feel of the game. 

The negatives: 
1. No reasonable mechanic that can be used to filter through cards that suck. 
2. Some scenerio's are completely imbalanced. I don't give a poo about historical accuracy if it gets in the way of balance. I wish that they had historically innacurate balanced versions of every scenerio. If that and a descent way to deal with having a hand of unusable cards was added to this game it would go from a good game to a great game.

Good step up in presentation from Battle Cry, but somehow the WWII theme doesn't ring true. Still feels like I'm pushing around cavalry. It works well, but I'd still go to Battle Cry - it's uncomplicated and quicker to play. I guess WWII just isn't my favourite time period for gaming.

Sheer excellence! The game is surprisingly flexible and turns go by pretty fast and thus the scenarios last about 35-45 minutes max. That makes this game especially suited for the match play that the rulebook also recommends. There's just enough luck, but not in amounts that doesn't leave room for well prepared punches from time to time. Cardplay is of vital importance and not playing all your big guns first.

I had always looked at the game from a personel challenge point of view and discarded it the first time I layed eyes on it. However one play and the realisation that this had to be THE game to introduce my 10 year old into gaming was enough.

Opened the box, found the rules quick and logical, played two games in two hours (with set ups and learning the rules).  One of the funnest games I've ever played and has a lot of interest with my friends! Though, I just started playing, so rating may go down over time.

EDIT: The dust has settled a little, the game is still very fun, but needs a little more depth.  Great introduction to hex based gaming. I may look into some varients.

I loved Sirocco as a kid. Memoir felt like an updated version of this 1980's TSR desert battle game. The mechanics are similar with cards for movement, die rolling, terrain, etc. Memoir seemed to have a bit more depth, based on the one game I played. Great game.

A great way to introduce younger players to the war game genre, it's a stepping stone to better fare.   It's not designed to be a simulation--it's designed to be fun, and it accomplishes that goal. If this had been around when I was 9, my Stratego game would have seen a lot less action.

An introductory wargame with a short playing time and very neat components. 
Its tactical level combat and card-driven movement is easy to learn, but very enjoyable on the end.There are die in this game, so luck is an inevitable question here, but with a playing time this short, it's easy to start a new game after fate turned against you.

Perhaps its because i didnt do very much research, but I expected a heavier wargame out of Memoir 44. Because of this, I avoided playing it for a long time. Turns out Memoir 44 is a very easy game to learn and play. Within minutes we were playing the introductory scenario and having a blast. The battle system is simple, yet doesn't hinder the strategy. Sure, it's kind of a dice game, but the key to victory is more in smart map movement. There's a good amount of scenarios included in the base game and many great looking ones available through expansions. I haven't spent a lot of time with Memoir, but I can't wait to see more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Excellent lightweight tactical wargame. It has simple rules (for a wargame), and one game usually takes an hour or less. The scenarios are drawn from historical battles and are therefore unbalanced (as the real battles were); to restore balance, you just play each scenario twice, swapping sides. This gives two very entertaining hours of wargaming!

Production quality is indeed top notch, and the game attracts every eye in the room. A bit too depending on dice rolls for my taste, but extraordinarily fun, and surprisingly quick. A basic "beachhead" scenario, coupled with a thorough rules explanation, takes an hour. The Overlord concept is nice, but drags a bit, and may leave some players doing basically nothing. Many units will never even get a chance to move, before one side takes up enough Victory Points to end the game. I'd prefer more objective-oriented scenarios.

First impression:  I'd like to like this more than I actually like it.  The set-up is kind of long.   My son doesn't enjoy this as much as I thought he would.   Maybe I need the air-pack expansion??  I have the base game only.

Update:  We played this again after several months and enjoyed much more this time.  If you take it for what it is, it is a blast to play!

RATING: 7
I have been playing this with my 17 year old son. It is a fun little game and highly reccomended. I think the minis are excellent, though the arty pieces are a bit too thin and flimsy. It's not a game I would suggest playing to my gaming circle, but one I'd happily join in on. Luck has played a big part so far in my games, but that has not stopped the enjoyment.

Plays well.  My kids all want to play.  I have developed a few variant rules to offset the massive power the rules give to artillery and to emphasize infantry's need to find cover.

RATING: 9
I like this just as much, if not more than Battle Cry.  The improvement here, I think is that I felt like the scenarios took less time to achieve completion and, although one side seemed clearly out gunned at the start, most of the games have ended fairly close.  Quick to learn, fun to play - great game.

A less tactical Battlelore with boring army pieces and no heroes, but none of the strategic army formations and variety of infantry of C&C. Middling middle type of game that doesn't do anything well.

Picked this up at a thrift store for $3 and it was unpunched!

After playing a bunch of scenarios I can see why this game is so popular.  Only downside is the set-up time is a little long.

After playing C&C: Ancients and Napoleonics I think this game needs a little more depth in play.  I may have to pick up some expansions.

Memoir '44 was my first attempt at anything wargamey, and I must say that so far it's been a success. The rules are fast and easy to explain, but the card-driven system makes it fun each and every time. With tons of scenarios and expansions, I can see this hitting the table a lot.

I had the game for a couple of weeks and I've enjoyed it every time I've played.  I've tried vs. a middle-aged friend, vs. my 4 year-old boy, and even solitaire.  The only drawback is that my wife (with whom I do most of my gaming) doesn't want to try it.  Oh well.....

Update (Feb.'09): It comes out every couple months and it's always fun.  Usually play with my son.

Amusing, but silly.  Bad artillery rules, even for such a kids' game.  Plastic pieces are "neato", but this game is NOT for a real wargamer.  Too many imbalanced scenarios (see game's website).On the good side, there is quick action and the super-simple rules allow for beer-and-pretzels play

Learning to love this one- the first war themed game I've really enjoyed, and the guys seem to like it.  I like the short playtime on many scenarios, the game mechanic isn't too simple but is fairly easy to learn, and the scenarios make it really re-playable.

Later: This is an amazing game.  Easy enough to teach to my 10 year old niece, but not a 'kids game'.  Fun, even when you lose- maybe even more so, because you just want to try again and see if a different approach will work.

(9/25/07) - Just got this game, looking for someone to play with!

(10/5/07) - [9] - Played this today and I'm hooked. An instant classic as far as I'm concerned. Currently a 9.

(12/23/07) - [9.8] - The more I play this the more I love it. I've done about 15+ games of it in the last 2 days and I'm convinced that this is one of my favorite games. While the element of luck certainly plays a huge part, I think it just makes the game all the more challenging. The essence of this game is adapting strategies to work for an ever-evolving situation. Re-rated to a 9.8.

(9/25/08) - [10] - On the 1-year anniversary of my purchase of this game, I find it fitting to give Memoir '44 the 10 it deserves. For a while I had been on a C&C Ancients kick, and even contemplated lowering Memoir's rating as a result. However, recent plays have led to resurgence in Memoir's popularity in my game room.

Played it quite a bit when I first got it and have some interest in the supplements, but the game seems way to luck dependent on getting the right cards. Dice alone in wargames simulates the proper luck factor well enough, but the cards here seem too restrictive, and the cool "toys" only carry a game so far.

I have played Memoir several times and have enjoyed each session. The C&C system is smooth, fast, and most importantly fun.  Sure it is frustrating when you cannot contact troops on a flank or in the center but I have found that experience is beginning to lessen those occurances which tells me that skill in the tactics of hand management weighs more heavily than luck as some maintain. The key to the fun of this game is to roleplay reasons for missed die rolls and breakdowns in the chain of command.

I have played two or three scenarios with the physical game and several via steam. For me there is too much luck involved (dice determine hits and cards determine what units may move). Maybe the luck factor is not so dominant in more complex scenarios where you also have other units beside infantry. I have not played such scenarios yet.

It's OK, but I probably ran into the same problem as everyone else. As a WW2 light wargame, it's too light to appeal to the people who might be interested in the theme.

I have played this extensively online, and once or twice in real life.  This is the sort of game I tried desperately (but failed) to invent as a child/teen - a light wargame, sufficiently complex to feel like historical representation, but simple enough to teach without too much aggro.  Would love to play this a lot more with humans, but my regular gaming companions are somewhat averse to war games.  Expansions-wise, I like the Mediterranean best because of the larger number of tank battles, but I wouldn't turn my nose up at playing in any theatre.

Wonderful, quick two player game.  I don't like 2 player games much, but this one is very fun.  I think I'd enjoy War of the Ring more, but 2 player is not something I get very often, other than with my wife, who wouldn't play it.

Edit 11/07: I don't know where this fits anymore.  C&C:A is probably the best game of the series.  BL is probably the best production and extensible.  I don't see a role for M44 anymore.  I may trade it away.

I don't own a copy of Battlelore so for now, we're filling that niche (card-driven war gaming) w/Memoir. I suppose this isn't REALLY a war game in the classic sense but that's what we call it in my house and that sparks a fire in my older son. It's fun and it even opens the door for youngsters to learn a little about history.

Update 12/2010 - now have a copy of Battlelore but I'm going to revisit Memoir w/solo plays (older son has lost interest... curse Lego and MegaBloks! But there's hope as my younger son is the one who has the true interest in war gaming and all things military).  I'm currently trying to get an affordable copy of Mediterranean pack along with the desert/winter board (and I suppose I'll cave and get the Air Pack as well).

RATING: 4
Surprisingly constrained game (lack of cards means lack of action), but can see how to strategise a few moves ahead to use the cards in hand to try to develop a plan.  Modularity and customization both add to the appeal of the game, but enjoy game only as an abstraction of WWII action.  I would personally play C&C:Ancients in the Commands and Colors system.  For a WWII game, much prefer Combat Commander: Europe. 

Rating ticked up a notch for a very simple reason.  My 8 yo daughter wanted to play CC:E with me, so I introduced her to this game as a first step.  And she loves it.  She in fact will request the game out of the blue.  I was going to trade it away, but am now keeping it and having fun with my daughter.  And that's what gaming is all about.

28-06-2015. Rated after 4 (recent) plays. Memoir '44 is a simpler version of Battlelore Second Edition. You basically each turn play a card that allows you to play certain units. 

You move, attack. Both work very easily and hits are calculated based on the units you are attacking. You can damage units (remove figures from the hex), have them retreat etc.

You aim to get objectives, like occupying villages etc. The game is nice, fun, good. But I rather play with a LITTLE more complexity like Battlelore 2 offers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.75
A great game for 2 players. Each game is a recreation of a battle from the WWII European theater between the Allied forces and the Axis powers. 

This is a light wargame where your strategy and tactics ultimately come down to a dice roll. While bad for an unlucky player, the dice keep the game moving along nicely. As much as a board game will allow, you will get a good feel for what it was like to be a part of these historic battles as you command infantry, tank and artillery units around the battlefield. 

The expansions are awesome, exciting and highly recommended. They feature additional theaters of war such as the Pacific, North Africa and the Eastern front.

I honestly didn't really figure I'd like this game - I'm not much of a war gamer. But I am a huge history person (disclaimer here - I TEACH history), so I adore the historical accuracy of the battles.  This is easy to play and really rather fun. It is a great two player game, easy to learn and play with kids, and there are lots of free scenarios to download.  

The one drawback is that set up is LONG on this game. Almost as long as the game itself! (JW)

RATING: 7
My buddy and I have played through roughly half the scenarios, doing the ones we've enjoyed most multiple times. I love this game. It has now gone from 9 up to 10. It really is just a fun game. Quick and easy to play.

The only downside is the set up. Sometimes it's tedious, but a small price for an amazing game.

Edit - Down to an 8. Aside from playing different scenarios, there's not much replay value here for me. I mean, I don't mind playing the same scenario over and over, but it loses it's initial appeal after the first two or three plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Awesome - best "wargame" I've ever played, but I really love WWII. I keep trying more advanced wargames (Combat Commander, Tide of Iron), but none provide the fun factor of Memoir. I find that in Memoir, the luck of the dice rolling is less a factor than in some of the other more advanced games like Combat Commander.  You can get screwed with the cards in Memoir just like in Combat Commander, but usually you only get screwed because your opponent was successful in destroying most of the units in one section and you are stuck with useless cards, whereas in CC you can often just have a hand of useless cards.  Not sure exactly why, but I don't like Commands and Colors at all - partly because I don't like blocks.  I enjoy Battle Cry, which is the closest match to Memoir, but would always prefer to play Memoir.

I don't think the system holds up as well with 20th Century warfare except maybe on the beaches, but I still think it's a heck of a lot of fun. With the amount of expansions and support considered, I add a .5.

Own: Terrain Pack/Winter Wars/Sword of Stalingrad/Pacific Theater/Campaign Book 1

Absolutely love this game. It is great because I can play with my brother/dad in around 45 minutes when I don't have the time to play something longer, or don't feel like playing something too demanding. Heck, even my 9 year old sister will humor me and play it sometimes. Sure the luck is pretty heavy in this one, but the dice/cards can also make for some great moments, "and then I rolled 4 tanks to take ground and win the scenario...", even if you hate to be on the losing side. It is also quick enough where bad luck wont screw for the next 2 hours. 

Of course it is not too historically accurate, but still great fun nonetheless.

Gift from [b]Secret Santa 2011![/b]

I don't get to play this game often as my wife doesn't enjoy shooting at me with tanks. But I really enjoy this game when I get around the couple people I've been able to play it with.

It's easy, it's fun, it's thematic enough even though it's quite abstract, and there is more depth & decision making available than may appear at first glance. Sure, you can just throw down cards without much thought and do okay sometimes.  But maneauver and well timed attacks will win out against lucky card draws, lucky die rolls, and poor tactics most times.

Memoir is a uncomplicated to teach and to grasp and fun to play. I wish I had the opportunnity to play it more. Highly recommended!

I know I rated this game low, but it really was not all that great for me.  Everyone calls it "Battlelore lite" which is odd since Memoir came out first.  I do not care for WW2 battles.  I enjoy the fantasy battles much more.  I also like the complexity of Battlelore more.

Nem vagyok az a lövöldözős típus, viszont a történelmet nagyon szeretem.
A Memoir'44 ezért, vagy éppen ennek ellenére (?) megvett kilóra. A kivitelezés professzionális minősége, a játék könnyedsége (igazán van jó pár apróság, amit nem árt fejben tartani!) mind-mind arra tereli az embert, hogy ismerkedjen a wargame-ekkel.
Nagyon jó bevezető játék, játszatja magát. Az aszimmetrikussága miatt rögtön érdemes vele több játszmát nyomni. A kockadobás által behozott szerencsefaktort meg a helyén kell kezelni (ami ilyen gyors játékmenet mellett nem is okohat gondot).
Talán érdemes volna megismerkednem néhány kiegészítőjével is...

This is a light and fun war game. However, it is not one of the top 5 or 10 games ever. There is too much randomness and luck of card draws, dice rolls, etc. Not much depth of strategy, lots of set up time, etc. However it has great pieces and is simple to learn. Is it a good game? Maybe. Is it fun to play? Yes, once and a while. Is it the game that all the hype would make you think it is? NO!

I like squad-level wargames and this is simple enough. It takes quite long to set-up compared to game time though and the card system can leave you with a handful of useless cards which brings too much randomness (in addition to the dice throwing :-) to this kind of game. Still this comes out when there is enough time to play a few scenarios in a row and only 2 players.

Easy to learn, takes some tactical thinking, but also depends a lot on luck (the command cards and the battle dice). Brings a nice level of uncertainty to the game as you can't always move the units you'd like to and they don't create the results you'd like or expect to see.

Excellent game system and suitable also to be played with children, especially if leaving out the tactics cards.

I raised my rating to an 8 (from 7).  This has really grown on me since acquiring a good number of the expansions.

RATING: 9
I'm not generally a fan of WW2-themed games. There's something about that theme which feels old and drab to me, probably thanks to how much time I was forced to spend hearing about it at school. 

Memoir '44 is neither of those things. 

It's one of the best games I've played, impeded only by being designed for two players only. It has a nice balance of tactics and strategy, a fair dollop of chance but not too much, and it plays in less than an hour. I'd say most games of Memoir I've played have lasted 30-40 minutes. 

Well worth anyone's time, regardless of whether the theme is appealing.

The game that got me firmly hooked into this hobby. 

I initially bought it at a toy store with a gift voucher I had gotten for my birthday (meant to buy puzzles with) to check if the Commands & Colors rules weren't too complicated for my taste, as I was thinking about buying into Battlelore at the time. 

I had a blast with this game, and by now own every expansion ever released. I bought Battlelore as well, a year later, but it hasn't been played nearly as often as this one has.

Very nice components, the little army men remind me of when I was a kid and played with little army men all around our house and in our garden. The rules are very easy to learn (and hard to master). Good variety of scenario's in de base game and online at DoW's website.

I just don't have the time to play all those scenario's I've acquired over the years...

This is the game I played most of all my games. The reason is the high replayability with all these different scenarios. As well its duration is rather perfect for a game that you can intersperse again and again. Of course there is a lot of luck, but I don't mind. For me it's the simulation of war ... for example: if you don't have a command card for a special section - don't complain, do the best out of your situation, maybe the communication broke down or something.
The game is simply great!

This game is highly approachable, plays quickly, and doesn't seem overly luck-driven despite the battle dice (though there are times that all your careful planning is undermined by a bad roll, and I'm puzzled that the number of soldiers doesn't affect the number of dice you roll - this seems like an over-abstraction). The varied scenarios are interesting, and the components (minus the too-flimsy artillery guns) are fantastic. For a non-wargamer this simpler, more accessible alternative to a standard war game is much appreciated.

This is a really nice looking, simple, but challenging game. All parts are really high quality sold for a good price. There is tons of randomness in the gameplay, and some somewhat silly elements in the rules, but these keep the game flowing at a nice pace, and level the playing field between grognards and newbies: a really good gateway game, but a far cry from the complex, realistic games I like the most.

RATING: 5
The idea of this game appeals to me more than the game itself. I don't like how long it takes to set up the board and place all the plastic pieces. I am a fan of turn based strategy games where each unit has strengths and weaknesses and different movement and firing ranges. This game falls in that category for me so I thought I would like this game a lot. My problem with the game is that I want more variety in unit types and capabilities. In other words I think the game needs more variety instead of more complexity. The expansions do add some variety, but terrain changes and the unit types are not quite different enough from each other to really feel like the variety I am looking for is there. Good things about this game are length, simplicity, and replayability. I grew up playing with plastic soldiers so the toy-like aspect of the components really appeals to me. This is a good game but not for me.

Hate the randomness factor when you have very little to play in your hand, especially with this theme.  I love the theme but it feels weird when you can only control certain units each turn (or when you are right next to an enemy but can't fire because you have no cards for that section).

I do have fun playing it with my dad though and that's what brings the score up.  Playing solo can be fun just to see what happens, without rooting for a particular side.

Secret Thrifty Santa gift 2010 - thank you thrifty santa! Very much!

So far Mrs Schkff has actually even suggested the plays of this - quick playing time is a definite plus. 

I am very much enjoying 'wargames' with card/dice driven command choices (Memoir, Yankees & Rebels, War of the Ring). The division of the left, center and tright flanks feels a bit more limiting and artificial than command dice, but plays well as a game mechanic, and is thematic enough.

Intend to pimp my copy out with some Airfix 1:72 troops before too long. I can only imagine how I would have loved to own this game 30 years ago, and hope to vicariously enjoy that experience with my son in a couple years time.

It's just fun to play. I prefer games over simulations, and while I wouldn't want too many games this streamlined, what it lacks in minute detail it makes up for with pure gaming fun. Playing smart and using the cards effectively will outweigh the luck of the dice in almost all cases - the dice play an important role in ASL too. I appreciate a WW2 game that keeps it simple and puts the emphasis on fun. I embrace the game for what it is. Because I can play it with kids and adults, because it plays quickly, because the rules are easy, because it's just fun, because of the re-playability of the game with all the possible scenarios, because of all these things it has risen in the ranking for me. With the right crowd, and that's a crowd that can embrace the luck of the dice, this is an excellent little ride.

Eastern Front really opens the game up and is my number one expansion. There's some good scenarios and extra units / rules changes that don't overly complicate Memoir 44. I wouldn't own the base game without it. With it you can begin to look at some of the other expansions.

To top it off my second expansion would be the Air Pack. The planes themselves aren't fantastic, but they do add another dimension. The cleaned up scenario book is equally as attractive as the planes. That said, I've always found weakened units running away out of harms way in Memoir 44 to be a bit of a cop out. Except when they're mine of course. The planes in the Air Pack are good for mopping up and picking on tanks hiding in woods or towns. The feature of having to move planes every turn they're on simulates loitering time and fuel reserves nicely. It also means you'll be more likely to wait until you really need them for picking of those weakened units and you've got the run of cards that will guarantee the planes will be in the air for a few turns. End placement between two sectors and weighing this up between terrain modifiers and adjacent ground troops is a positive move towards making the Air Pack addition an intelligent add-on.

Finally, for a third expansion I'd either start to look at the battle maps - very reasonably priced and the Sword of Stalingrad (with close combat cards) and Tigers in the Snow (with Tiger tanks), are the best of the bunch. If you want a very different Memoir 44 experience with lots of positioning (and longer play time), then the long double sided Breakthrough map really changes the way the game is played as units must be positioned more, often before the fighting gets serious.

I don't like games with plastic soldiers or war games, but somehow I think this game is really good. I like the base game only and am not interested in expansions (although the base game could do with more scenarios.) It would also be more fun if the things fitted more easily on the map. Still, I think the concept is ingenious.

Another game of the [i]Commands & Colors[/i] series.  Very similar to [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=70&Itemid=1]BattleLore[/url][/i], without the War Council, but more based in ranged combat.  That's why it plays a little bit different, from the distance, almost without bloody melee fights.

A wargame for non-wargamers.  The rules can be summed up in 4 pages and it's 30-60 minutes per game.  The brilliant card-driven system uses cards to determine what you can do; it's not as simple as wanting to move a unit in order to do it...you need the card to do so.  Beautiful pieces and on-line access to dozens of scenarios make the replayability quite high despite the simplicity of this entry-level wargame.

Setup is pretty time consuming, and sometimes lucky card draws can decide the game.  But I still very much enjoy the game for what it is - a light wargame with some cool historical stories behind it.  And plus I get to play with little army men again as an adult - can you beat that?

I find the cards make the game seem quite artificial. There is nothing more frustrating than not being able to attack with the right guys because you do not have the right cards. While meant to be a part of the design and insure that hand management is part of the game, it makes for unappealing strategy.

Also, I don't like how damaged units still shoot at full power, combined with the objective being to take out a set number of units. My handful of games have often come down to sniping out the final damaged unit.

Finally, I wish they presented more balanced scenarios. Almost every time I've played (which is only a handful), I switched places after playing and the same side won.

RATING: 6
Had high hopes for this title, but ultimately it did not work for me. Looks pretty, but too simple for there to be much of a game here. Some scenarios are blatantly unbalanced, others turn into a stare fest where the first player to make a real move is immediately at a disadvantage. Hopefully Commands and Colors: Ancients (recently purchased) will salvage this game system for me.

I finally got a chance to play this a couple of times with two of my sons. It went over quite well. I only did the first scenario both times, but still it gave a good feel for the potential of this game. It's not something my wife would likely be interested in trying, but I can see having a good time with my kids trying out different scenarios. I have often heard that it is too simplistic, but I don't have much experience with war games or miniatures games, so this will likely be a good weight for me and my kids.

[UPDATE] I've had a TON of fun playing this with my oldest. I don't care about its few problems when he's fully engaged and peppering me with questions about WWII. 

Great presentation and bits. And the best part is that there's a really great game to go with the great bits. Yes, many of the scenarios are lopsided, but I'm okay with that for the sake of historical accuracy. If it bothers you that much, switch sides as they suggest; or better yet create some scenarios of your own that are balanced. The ease with which others can create scenarios for this is one of its best features...near-endless replayability. I'm anxious for the expansions.

Fun simplistic wargame. I've been interested a little in wargames, but turns take so outrageously long and it's hard to find that chunk of time for just two players. The fact that this game scratches the itch in about 60 minutes (less than 100 for two games back to back, although i don't find it necessary like some) with a simple to learn ruleset makes it a winner in my book. Although I like Tide of Iron to some degree, the game length turned me off significantly. I think Memoir is an acceptable level for me to dive into, wargame-wise.

Feels a bit like your mobility is dictated at the whim of the cards, and victory is at the whim of the dice which isn't all bad but it doesn't feel as realistic with two layers of luck-mech involved.

Memoir '44 fills an interesting niche. It's a light wargame with miniatures, but manages not to overwhelm players who like neither wargames nor miniatures. The game is pleasant to look at and give you a feel of the battlefield. There is enough luck in the game to keep it tense, although sometimes frustrating. There is little downtime between turns. As long as the cards and dice cooperate, the battles can be very exciting. UPDATE: Dropped from 8.5 to an 8. It's easy to adopt a strategy in Memoir 44, but too often these plans must be abandoned because the cards and the dice just don't want to cooperate. Still, exciting, tactical battlefield game.

The theme is great, the setup is quick and the rules are clean. The terrain and units rules are very intuitive. Biggest weakness of the game (and also BattleLore) is that the ending can feel very anti-climactic sometimes, especially if it's unexpected due to lucky dice rolls. I like this, but do wish they had paid a little more attention with game balance; picking the wrong scenario can ruin your session.

The simplest of the 3 C&C games right now. Good for new gamers.

This is what WWII gaming is all about for me.  I'm sure that the grognards out there look at this one with scorn, but its fun and has simple combat resolution.  Just enough for me so that it isn't too light or too heavy - just right.  There is a dual strategic element where you have to balance what you want to do with the type of order cards you are getting.  The setup can be a bit of a drag, especially when there are lots of bits to pick through, but that's why it doesn't get a perfect score.  I would really love to do a comprehensive WWII campaign with this one!

Pretty random; somewhat fun. I didn't feel like I was making any meaningful choices most of the time. Even with terrain features, it just felt like we were throwing armies at one another. 

Also, I don't think killing units is a good victory condition for a wargame. It leads to pretty weird dynamics that seem gamey and unrealistic.

I'd totally buy the Knizia remake though. :)

The hype was right - this is a fun, light wargame.  Simple rules that can be taught in 20 min.  Enjoyable gameplay and (mostly) excellent scenarios.  The set-up can take a while, but I appreciate having a wide variety of terrain to introduce new elements and tactical challenges.  It is important to remember, when playing this, that it is less "strategic" than tactical.  You often focus your efforts on weak units, and the random card draw can make it a difficult to put together some kind of grand strategy to win the mission.  However, for what it is, it plays extraordinarily well.  I'm looking forward to playing the multi-scenario campaigns in the first campaign volume.

RATING: 9.5
Today’s review will be on the board game Memoir ’44.
As the title implies, this is a World War II strategy board game for two players. It was released in 2004 by Days of Wonder, a Board Game company based in the U.S. and France. The game was developed by a guy named Richard Borg using his Command and Colors system which Borg has used in a few dozen other games and expansions. 
Gameplay under the command and colors system is pretty easy to pick up. The board is divided into three flanks. Each player has a certain number of cards which allow him or her to use actions to move and shoot with units in the various flanks. Some cards only let you move units in one flank, while others let you move a few in all flanks. There are also a few special ability cards thrown in for good measure. Dice are used to resolve combat encounters. The score is tracked by how many medals each player has. Medals are earned by capturing and holding points on the map or wiping out enemy units.
Now that you understand how the game works, let’s see how it stacks up in the review.

While I will give the game a numerical score, what’s really important is the content of the review. A type of gameplay that I like may just rub you the wrong way, making my score irrelevant. So rather than focusing on the number I give it, take a moment and decide if the ups and downs of the game fit what you want to get out of a game. I review games based on three main criteria...presentation, mechanics and gameplay, and value. Each criterion has sub points that I’ll discuss as we go. So let’s start off with presentation.
The first part of presentation is artwork and style.
The artists decided to take a realistic approach to the visual look of this game. The units are colored in muted greens and grays and the battle surface is painted in similarly realistic fashion. The overall effect is nice, but it’s not without its drawbacks. Because of the bird’s eye view approach, it can be tough to tell what some of the terrain pieces are supposed to represent. Also, the colors chosen for the symbols on the dice kind of clash with the rest of the game. The neon oranges and purples, while admittedly neat looking, just don’t fit with the realistic approach the rest of the game took.
The cards are a pretty big component of this game, and fortunately they are printed in a clear and easy to read format. You can tell exactly what flank the card activates and how many units you can use by just glancing at them.

So out of a possible score of 10, I give the artwork and style a nine point oh. The overall style and effect works, but there are a few bizarre outliers like the dice and terrain that are a bit of a detractor.
The second part of presentation is the quality of the pieces. It’s here that Memoir ’44 really shines. When I opened the box I was blown away by the durability of everything from the board to the box itself. The board is thick and well made. It’s double sided and folds into a nice compact square for storage. The plastic used in manufacturing the units is clearly high quality and the individual units just feel good to the touch. They’re not made of the cheap slippery plastic that some of these game companies use. I have had no problem with the components of the game, so I will go ahead and give the quality of the pieces a 10 out of 10.

The third and final component to presentation is the rulebook. It may sound strange, but I firmly believe that a rulebook needs to be clear for the game to work. If you have to go online to figure out how to play the game because the company included 8 pages of incomprehensible gobbledygook, the game certainly suffers. The rulebook for Memoir fares pretty well. Richard Borg, the designer, is American so the rules have the advantage of having been written in English in the first place and not translated from another language. The rules are presented straight forward with plenty of pictures to accompany the text. The game also comes with some nifty cheat-sheet cards. Although the rules are pretty thorough, there are a few rare anomalies that pop up during the game that aren’t covered in the rules. In addition, I would have liked to see a little more explanation of some of the ‘special ability’ cards. I also take umbridge with the wording of some of the scenarios, which are included in the back of the rulebook. Each and every scenario in every version of the game, every expansion of the game, even on the custom content ends with the same boring sentence. It’s a minor thing, to be sure, but you do get sick of reading the cheesy line every time you play a game. Despite these issues, though, the rulebook earns a 9.5.
These three components, art and style, quality of pieces, and rulebook give us a combined presentation score of 9.5 out of 10.

Now on to the meat of the game…the mechanics and gameplay. Memoir ’44 is an easy game to pick up and play. The card-based nature of the command and colors system is fairly self-explanatory…pick a card, move the units, roll of the dice for combat, draw a new card. Its simplicity means that it is really easy to teach new players. By the end of one game, they not only get the rules…they’re hooked!

The games themselves are fairly short. In my experience the average battle takes no more than 40 minutes. I’ve played through the landing at Omaha beach in less than half an hour! I personally like the brevity of the games and I know a lot of people don’t like to play a war game that lasts 6 hours. On the other hand, I know there are people who like that sort of drawn out experience. Just know what you’re getting into when you play this game. Because the battles are so short, you can easily make the game experience longer by playing through a few scenarios in one sitting.

The brevity of the battles, though, has some noteworthy drawbacks. Indeed, the battles sometimes feel just too short and they almost always feel like they come down to the last few turns. Sure, this makes for some exciting battles, but this almost feels too luck based. When playing I’ve always felt I have just barely enough control over making meaningful decisions, but since there is no clear victor until the last turn or two, it really does sometimes feel like all my decisions up until the final few moves are wasted.

The command and colors system itself can be a source of strife for some players. The system forces you to go from flank to flank according to what the cards you draw dictate. This means that sometimes you will be getting butchered on your left flank but just don’t have the cards to do anything about it, or on the other hand you may have finally gained the upper hand in the center but are unable to follow up, again because of the cards. While this does in some ways model the confusion of the real battlefield, it can be frustrating watching your units dying off in one flank while the cards force you to focus on another. 

The game does a good job of balancing out these frustrating moments and honestly, they don’t really happen too often. I’m just getting nitpicky with the review. In general, the battles are exciting and tense and like I said earlier I usually feel like I have enough control to make my decisions meaningful. Despite the drawbacks, the gameplay holds up to repeat playing. I’m certainly always up for a quick game. So I give the mechanics and gameplay of Memoir ’44 a score of 9 out of 10.

The final criterion I judge a game by is the value. This score is made up of price and replayability.
I know price is very subjective, so I look at the cost versus what you get in the box. In terms of price, this game does fairly well. I picked this up for about 50 at The Last Square in Madison, Wisconsin and I always recommend you buy games from your local mom and pop game store rather than online. For that price, you get a sturdy set of pieces, a durable game board, a fairly well developed mechanic, and over a dozen scenarios. I give the price 9.5 out of 10.

The other component of value is replayability, and Memoir ’44 is chock full of it! As I just said, the basic game comes with over a dozen scenarios based around the Normandy invasions and aftermath, and the various expansion packs have added another 50 or 60 scenarios based on the various theaters of World War II. There’s even an aviation expansion that adds air power, though I haven’t played it so I can’t really comment of its quality. Days of Wonder has also released a scenario maker through their website and players from around the world have submitted their own scenarios. The website has a good rating system that lets you sift through the garbage to find the golden user-submitted scenarios. My own dad made a scenario for BattleCry, the Civil War game also based on the Command and Colors system. The terrain pieces make it easy for you to set up the map however you want. And the short nature of the battles always leave you wanting to play just one more round. I give Memoir ’44 a replayability score of 10.

This gives us a total value score of 9.8.

So sending all of these scores through the tabubolator gives Memoir ’44 a combined overall score of 9.5. Sure, it has its faults. Some of the game art strays from the realistic theme, sometimes the games just feel too short, and the card-based nature of the game means that you are sometimes pigeon-holed into focusing on one flank when the battle is really happening in another. But the game balances these frustrations with some truly exhilarating moments into a well-polished, two-player game based on World War II. If you like war games or strategy games, and just have one friend like I do, it’s worth giving this one a spin.

Selling on eBay, this is a game for children, and is not interesting over the course of 10 or more plays.  {Original comment, Spring 2010} Each scenario is sort of fun the first time around, but there is virtually zero replayability to this game...it really is a "kid's game"...and that's ok, but I will sell it after I have played all the scenarios.  I will not buy all of the expansions or add-ons.  Silly, stupid, childish "dice-fest" - this is not a tactical strategy game, it's a dice rolling game...instead, play "Let's Roll Random Dice & See Who Gets Higher Numbers!"...that's a much better game than these, and there's a lot less involved in set-up time.

Commands & Colors: Ancients is a great game, this is the same but with Tanks - I doubt it can be anything but a nice game. But I mostly bought it because of a friend that LOVES games with tanks in them - he once said that Caylus was a good game, but that there were too few tanks in it.

Played once with the second scenario (Sainte Mère-Église). It's a light, bare bones wargame with pre-deployed units. I like how terrain has an effect of combat and the availability of different type of units. Some of the rules are thematically strange though - why would a unit being fired upon not try to at least fire back? And how can a unit which has lost most of its members be offensively as strong as a full unit? The thematic quirkiness irks me a little more than it should though.

[17 plays] Days Of Wonder with Richard Borg have incorporated many of the best house rules developed for his excellent Avalon Hill "Battle Cry", added some new ideas and mechanics, and given it a WW2 theme and killer components.

If there are limitations on your game collection, I don't think you need to own both M'44 and Battle Cry. Choose the game in which you have the strongest historical interest.

I believe the command and control card system with a 3 section battlefield is a better fit historically with its predecessor Battle Cry than it is here for the WW2 theme of Memoir '44, but it is a great game regardless.

I rate Battle Cry just a tad higher for its originality, out of love for all the great gaming we got out of it originally (and still do), and for my fondness for Civil War history.

Most recent play 7-13-12 with Garrett, Michael, Corey, and Donovan.

Theres a good amount of luck in this game. The first scenario is very basic and it doesnt really showcase the game's full potential. After playing a better scenario with more of the game's component, it's a solid, fun and tactical game! I would even say that this should be a must have for a collection. It's fast, relatively easy to learn and a lot of tactical strategies on how you position your men to give them the best fighting chance. Dice seem to have a bad reputation in modern board gaming, but memoir 44 does the dice rolling pretty well.

This is the first game I 'discovered' after first joining and exploring BGG. I knew it would be 100% perfect and buying it and being blown away on opening it was what got me collecting. Although I've found a lot of other games on the site I love, I find that I keep searching for that next 'Memoir-like' discovery on the geek. 

My kids bought this for me which makes it more special and I play primarily with them (my 10 year old son (edit: NOW 16) beats me (edit: STILL) about 60% of the time).

I have three base sets, all the expansions and have doubled up on the desert/winter map and eastern pack and am just waiting for the next item to come out.

Theme + mechanics + cool bits + collectibility + simple enough for play with the kids = perfect game for me

As for the luck prevalent in the game from card draws and dice rolls, I didn't find it much of a downside despite it biting my team in our first game.  It allows fun and unique mechanics and with shorter game times, the luck can average out of repeated plays over several hours.  The thematic elements and the mechanics seem to make me enjoy playing much more than caring about winning.

A friend and I both have this so we can play some Overlord scenarios.  We probably will attempt to develop some multiplayer variants, as well, as the team matches don't work very well.  All it really adds is the need to talk about strategy, but you don't really want the opposing team to hear any of it.

RATING: 6
My most controversial one, I think.  By any demographic (lifetime gamer, sometime grognard, love Euros, etc) I should love this.  I don't.  I find getting cards which enable me to do nothing frustrating, and I expect scenarios to be far better balanced when they are not attempting to be historical in nature.  It is so nearly a classic, but actually is quite flawed I think.

Memoir '44 was a fun game, it was simple enough, but had enough decisions to make that it felt strategic. Setup took a while and usually was a pain though.

The game is in excellent condition, but it is missing two minor pieces: a gray (Axis) hedgehog and a green (Allies) artillery gun. 
These were missing when I received it in a trade and despite having submitted a dispute, I have not been successful in receiving them. (The user's trading privileges have therefore been suspended.) As they are each one of many identical pieces, they can be substituted for something else(e.g. a paper clip), if they come up in your scenario at all.)
I'm trading it because my wife is not a fan.

This was my second ("gateway") war game. It's simple and fast-paced. Depends heavily on luck with dice and cards. One of my friends loves it, although he's usually not keen on playing board- or even war games.

Finally I sold this whole Memoir game packet off to a friend, although I liked it. But in the end it is much too simple and doesn't really comprise WW2 in a way (tension, realism, thought) my other games do.

Here are my thoughts on the expansions:
-
Eastern: The best expansion to M'44 in my opinion. The Russo-Finnish War scenario is great. But the sniper rules are strange and unrealistic.
-
Pacific: Unplayed.
-
Terrain: An average expansion to M'44, with many new rules, which almost all aren't used. Is best suited for people, who like to build their own scenarios.
-
Map: Is only required for aesthetic reasons. r{[-]You might want to use the desert side for C&C Ancients though.[/-] Doesn't work.}r
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This game is awesome. The rules are incredibly simple, but its easy and fun to play. Despite my wife kicking my ass the first few plays I still enjoyed this.
The only possible criticism of this game is that the scenarios will eventually feel repetative after you've played it a lot. But thats the only downside to an otherwise great game.
When I first rated this game I said that eventually the scenarios would begin to feel too similar, even though there are 16 of them in the initial rules.
I should have read the rulebook properly for on the back there is an ID number. Put this into the Memoir44 website and you have access to a whole ton of scenarios, and even a scenario generator (although you pay a small fee for that part). Then of course there are expansion packs. All in all I can't see myself ever getting bored of this one.
This game rocks so hard it should have its own MTV channel.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
With all the buzz around this game I had high hopes for this one, but I have to say I am truly disappointed. The game have nice components, but there are no hard decisions at all in the game. You always know what the best move is but you might not be able to execute it because you have the wrong card in your hand. Other card driven games have alternate functions of the cards which help to prevent a player from getting "dead" cards in his hand and always be able to make some sort of reasonable move. Not so here. Do not believe the hype. Stay away from this!

Pontosan azt kaptam a játéktól, amit vártam. Kellemes, könnyed, szépen kivitelezett háborús játék. Gyorsan előkészíthető, egy-egy parti akár 15 perces is lehet, ami gyors újrajátszást és többszöri stratégia kipróbálást tesz lehetővé ugyanazon szcenárión. Háborús játékkal szemezőknek, akik nem egy teljesen szimulált háborúra vágynak és hosszú játékidőre, szerintem a Memoir'44 tökéletes választás.

I wanted to like Memoir '44, as I am interested in the setting.  Days of Wonder has produced a very high quality boardgame, the bits and board and cards were all well made, and the rules were streamlined yet effective.

However, staying with realism has made most battles obviously one-sided; I respect realism and honestly am glad that it was used, but one side enters the game with a defeatist attitude.  The rulebook even states to play scenarios twice, so that the other player can be the loser.  I would have been a lot happier if there was even the slightest bit more balance to the game.  It's pretty depressing to know you'll most likely lose from the get-go.

Edit: The more board games I play, the more this seems like just a toy.  Not a good thing.

Edit edit: Okay, I've played it a bit more and it is pretty fun, and approachable for people new to board games.  Maybe not as bad as I thought.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
For adolescent boys, easily a 9+. It's quick and easy, and looks nice. The modular board and flexible system encourage experimentation and creativity. I would have loved this when I was 12.

For games between adults, though, Memoir is mediocre at best. It's too simple to be a good simulation and too random to be a good strategy game. The pieces are cool, but a pain to setup, move around, and keep track of. Get something from the Conflict of Heroes line if you want a fun, reasonably light tactical wargame.

I like the game a whole lot, but it shrinks in the shadow of its big brother Battlelore, which is a little more complex and a little more satisfying for that reason.

I enjoy Battlelore a bit better, but I can see myself playing games of this with my son when he gets older, and using it as a teaching tool to learn about military history.

The system is easier, quicker, and cleaner.

RATING: 6
A bit too simple. Decisions aren't difficult as they are pretty much forced on you by the cards you draw so your long term strategy will no doubt be meaningless when you come to draw your cards. Victory goes to the player who draws the necessary cards at the right time. Having said this it's still quite fun to chuck dice around but this game is a huge luck-fest. I was really frustrated at this one possibly because I'd played battlelore on iOS first and found this was a simplified version that didn't mitigate luck as well as battlelore did.

Отмечу, что особенно приятно, что сценарии привязаны к реальным историческим событиям. Минус: карты-памятки лишь в одном экземпляре. 5 баллов.

RATING: 8.5
Rating after a single play and we just played a simple scenario, so I don't think I got to appreciate the fullness of this.  Still, I like the battle system for its simplicity and all the cool bits.

UPDATE: Does nicely move the C&C style system into WWII. Reminds me much of Ancients, as troops still fight at full strength even if down to a single unit. I love the mobility here, especially with the tanks, and it provides some really dynamic scenarios.

After 6 scenarios worth of play, I'm feeling a bit disapointed.  In my opinion, far too much of the game is dictated by card draws and everytime I play me and my opponent are always wishing for a bit more (Machine gun emplacements, op fire, etc and why the heck is it so dang hard to take out undefended artillery).  We know it's a light wargame and shouldn't be asking more of it....but dangit, it would be so much better!  Right now the fun factor and flavor are great, but I expect it to wear off soon as there is not much to hold our gaming interest.  Wouldn't it be great if there was a medium level turn based war game with the same high quality bits?

Fun game, although setup can take a little while. Initially thought it was nothing but a dice fest - little thinking, lots of luck - but there's a bit more to it than that. Hand management is important, as well as some tactical planning. It is pretty fun, although I think Heroscape offers similar feel and is probably more fun (I'm more into the fantasy theme than WW II). The overlord version, which I've played only once, seems to be a big improvement - which is why I think a 7 is pretty solid for this game. I'd like to try that more.

Lots of fun, but setup can be a bit of a pain some times (lots of pieces). But it's definitely fun and has a good balance of strategy and chance. The board can be a little crowded at the beginning, but once you've gotten into the game a bit the board is less full and more strategic, less cramped. It could be better with a bigger board, but makes for good 2 player games. Has some good replay-ability since it comes with plenty of scenarios and you can always make up your own. Has expansions but you definitely don't need them to have fun with this game.

One of the best light military strats out there.

Might be the newness of this for me - so far only done a handful of the scenarios - but this is GREAT! Loving the quick and simple way it plays, plus the interesting hand management aspect. Wasn't convinced about getting something war-y, but so far, so good!

One minor quibble - I have the feeling that I wish there was more of an objective for each player at times (or at least for one player) as the "first to kill x units" is a bit lacking... perhaps later scenarios have more of this kind of feel to them?... anyhow, plenty of fun still to come, I think (hope!).

[update Aug 2016] - hasn't grabbed me, other than a 2p with Robbie in Derbyshire which wasn't amazing, so dropping down to 7.5 from the Feb 2011 8.

I have a love-hate relationship with this game.  It is so abstract it is impossible to take seriously.  I find myself asking "why don't I play something made for adults?"  but in terms of dollars spent per hour of play this one is at less than $0.25 and still dropping.  It has the most palatable theme for non-gamers and the simplest basic rules but tremendous potential for customization.  However, as my son has gotten older CCA trumps this one with its tighter mechanics and shorter set-up time.  CCA is also more ergonomic and less fiddly (after you get past the stickers, that is!)

fell in love with this game when i first got it.  it is a ton of fun to play and easy to teach.  it's got a lot of luck and strategy at the same time.  perfect for the "light" wargamer.  my only complaint here is that it takes a while to set up for only a two player game.  i don't think that it lends itself well for larger games (like overlord scenarios).

Hopefully, despite its brevity, this is still helpful. This is a fast game, despite its "military strategy" looks. Dice rolling plays a fairly large role so the randomness is there, but what it demands of you is as advantageous a placement of your troops as you can to allow for the best possible dice roll chances. Countless scenarios are available to try out and the expansions add different rules, units, and terrain for you to incorporate into your games.

Fast hex "gateway" wargame. Easy to learn, but very heavy on the luck element. Success relies on your ability to draw the right command cards and roll. Not a WWII simulation by ANY means. 1 type of infantry unit, 1 type of armor, and 1 type of artillery. Actual WWII battle tactics mean almost nothing.

My favorite WWII strategy board game.  Quick, easy and countless scenarios for download.  I love the historical background introduction to each scenario and feel like there has been allot of thought put into the scenarios.  Online there is allot of rules manuals, FAQ's, campaigns, scenario compilations, house rules, mods, etc. on the official game site and others.  Hardest part is setting up the board since terrain hexes are double sided and sometimes hard to sort out the right ones (but hardly an issue).

RATING: 7
Fantastic game! Owned by my brother-in-law. The day he bought it we played through the first 6 scenarios, back to back. Next time we played we played another 3.

All scenarios are extremely asymmetric, something I usually like in a boardgame. Many of them also feel quite unbalanced, which is of course not very nice in most games. However, in Memoir '44 it's completely fine that scenarios are unbalanced. It's very much in line with the historical setting, and which side is favoured changes between scenarios.

We've been playing with me as the Allies and my brother-in-law as the Axis and after the first 9 scenarios I'm in the lead with 5 victories against 4. While some scenarios seem almost impossible to win for one side (I'm looking at you Omaha Beach), when played as a campaign, fortune really ebbs and flows in a great way. (I think there is a rulebook for real campaign play, but here I'm just talking about playing the same side through all the scenarios, in order.)

If you just want to sit down to play a single game against someone, you might want to gauge the scenarios a little, and either pick one that seems fairly balanced, or make sure the less experienced player gets the easier side.

Starting to like this game less and less.  Generally not being able to produce new units, makes the game slightly paranoid for those who like really deep strategy.  And the card system sometimes is a bit too limiting and luck based.  For war games, Axis & Allies is much better for me.  For 2 player games, Twilight Struggle is much better for me.

RATING: 7
While I really enjoy this game, I think it receives WAY too much hype. As I sit now, I can see no reason to ever purchase any of the expanded maps, or equipment packs, or strategy and tactics guides. All the studying in the world cannot prepare you for the "fog of war" factor in a hand full of garbage cards.  I do have a fairly decent sized collection so that may be why I only get this to the table every now and again but I still think you could sink way too much money into something that ain't THAT great.

I had a lot of plays of "Battle Cry" and "BattleLore" under my belt before I played "Memoir '44" for the first time.  It is definitely a step up from "Battle Cry", and when comparing it to "BattleLore" I would say that the emphasis in "Memoir '44" seems to be on the various terrain and obstacles, whereas the emphasis in "BattleLore" is more on the individual units and weapons, which creates a fairly different playing experience between both those games.  A few things that "Memoir '44" has going for it are that fact that it is a little simpler to play than "BattleLore", it's setup time is not nearly as painfully long, and it seems to play a little quicker.  This means that it's easier to play a game, swap sides, and replay the same scenario.  And who doesn't love plastic tanks!  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8.5/10

This game would be better and more enjoyable if the order cards weren't so unbalanced. While there are some tight tactical decisions in this game, there are times where you only draw cards to order one or two units while your opponent gets powerful special effect cards.

RATING: 7.5
Rating based on about 5-6 scenarios played.  This is a solid good game.  Probably the best thing about it is the pace of the game.  It is very lively and quick.  This makes it fun and playable for younger players, non-gamers, and people not that into wargames.  It is easy to get into and has an addictive quality that makes me want play more scenario and try it again.  Really for just game play I would probably have given this a 7, but I have to reward another .5 just for how well the scenarios are layed out.  The downside is the game does seem to be slightly to "light" for me to really consider one of my personal favorites.  Just not quite enough agonizing choices to make.  It is more go with the best odds you have and hope the dice do their thing.

A fun game to play, but due to the scale of the theatre, it seems to me there are very few real choices to me made.  The cards a person draws combined with the dice a person roles is far more important than any movement choices.  Ie. there is a ton of luck,  but for a 30 minute game, it is OK.  Any longer and the game would not be worth playing.

After 5 playings, I'm ready to rate this game one notch under Battle Cry, but just because BC was there first.  Good fun, game is over fast which means that just as the Allies break through the German flank on a beach scenario they lose because the Germany arty on the other flank picked off a lone soldier cowering behind a hedgehog for the final victory point needed.  Oh well.  If it were longer it would be less fun.

EDIT: Downgraded 1 point because the setup time/play time ratio may be the worst of all games that I own, and that has started to keep this game off the table for me.

I really like the fact that there are nearly endless scenarios to this game.  I have played this game probably 100 or more times and the variety in scenarios keeps it fresh and up to date for me.

I own the Russian, Pacific, Terrain Pack, Winter Wars, and desert/winter board expansions.

RATING: 7
Can easily be a fun or a frustrating game.  It's all about how the cards are dealt, or how you roll the dice.  It removes a lot of the advantage or disadvantages from the battlefield and leaves things almost entirely up to chance.

One game is never enough, to get a good rounded game time it's best to play at least two or more.

Game looks great.  I didn't care for the hand management aspect of the game though.  When I look at the board I formulate a plan then I would look at my cards and I couldn't do what I wanted to.  This frustrated me.  It helped me to learn that I prefer an action point allowance mechanism in games.  It's a good game and I can see why people like it...it just wasn't for me.

Okay...this game is one that falls between categories for me.  "Hardcore" wargamers will not claim it as a wargame and a lot Ameritrashers wouldn't touch it because it is about history and war. 

I spent 20+ years as a historical miniature wargamer and board gamer.  This game allows me to get a quick wargame on the table that doesn't require me to spend hours painting, setting up terrain etc.  This was the first adult board game that my son and I played.  We have a blast playing it and lots of great memories.  

I rate it an 8 because it is a good gateway game for either someone who likes history, pre-teen kid, or anyone looking for a better version of risk.  

I'm sure it will see less time on the table as my son gets older and his tastes change, but for now, I will play it anytime he wants to build some memories for us.

Laura's Rank (4/15) – 3.0 out of 5. Pros: I think this is a good game overall. I like the scenarios and how it changes the game up every time. Cons: I have to be in the right mood to want to play it. It can be a little bit complicated (though we haven't played too much). The odds are weighted based on the scenario somewhat, but this can make it more interesting too in that you have to overcome unique challenges. The theme doesn't really grab me as fun, compared to many of our other games.

Ryan's Rank (4/15) – 4.0 out of 5. I really, really like this game. I love WWII as a theme, and while this is a bit heavier game than a lot of stuff we have played thus far, it all makes good sense and the rules are pretty clear. I don't like how vague some of the command cards are, so we end up using the online FAQ a fair amount (which is a great resource). Who doesn't love playing with army men?! The only thing keeping me from a 4.5 is the time it takes to set up and properly play both sides of a scenario. That (and Laura's lower ranking) means it doesn't come to the table as often as I would probably like.

Played 15+ times. Fun, fast, light war game for non-wargamers and wargamers alike.  Pretty similar to Battle Cry.  I won't own both games.

I don't really mind whether the scenarios are balanced or not because the play is in the cards and the tactical maneuvers.  Besides the game is just fun. 2006/06/18 Expansions owned: Eastern Front

Based on an older game mechanic, the battles on Memoir'44 are quite light and the flow is fast. All the commands are given by cards so luck has quite a strong influence, but it suits the lighter feel in Memoir quite fine. When you want to have some WW2-action without plowing through 4 hours of sweaty tactics and nit-gritty rules, this is for you.

Another good beer & pretzel game. Its not a very in-depth game.  Its a fun light wargame.  It is nicely done and very simple to learn.  This is one of the two games (Battle Cry being the other) that I use to try to get people who have never played wargames into playing them.  If it were to be rated only on its merits, I'd rate it a 7.....but because it is a great stepping stone for new players into better and more in-depth games, I've gotta give it an 8.

Not a simulation, of course, but an excellent game with a period flavor, enhanced by the successive expansions which add detail without adding complication. Luck factor (in the form of dice rolls and order cards) is high, but a well conceived strategy can counterbalance bad luck and poor hands of cards (not always though, just like in the real thing...).
After two years of having fun with regular scenarios, I finally decided to buy an extra set to play Overlord variant.

RATING: 7
At first I resisted the luck factor and how much it disrupted strategies. It can be frustrating when you have no cards to repel a fierce attack in a particular sector and no advantage to gain attacking in the other sectors.

But after enough plays it balances out. You get lucky, you get unluck, but most of the time, you're faced with interesting decisions because the optimal on-board is not possible with the cards you hold. This makes for a fast, slick, surprisingly deep strategy experience.

The game is a fantastic piece of design, if nothing else, and for me at least is less about who wins the battle (some of which are somewhat one-sided for historical reasons), and more about being entertained by the game's rhythm. Strangely addictive, and highly recommended.

Love this game, though I wish the action-card system didn't force a battle to take place over all three zones. If forces are concentrated, you quickly grind your hand into having very few options. Apparently Breakthrough fixes this, by allowing Command Cards to be traded in for a weaker, choose-your-own action.

It's just so... It's fun to look it has cool bits, but ultimately it's like playing toy soldiers with dice to hit them and cards to order them. Draw the wrong cards and you are hosed. The whole family of these games makes no attempt to reduce firepower, etc. due to casaulties. Ultimately what's the pt? It's not realistic, it's not challenging. I like toy soldiers too, but I'd rather set up my own with my own ideas about fog of war, causing hits, etc.

The mechanics make this game for me. I love how the available orders are randomised and only allow you to move a few men at a time on only a few sections of the board. Furthermore I love how the battles are so easily resolved with the simply roll of a die which are so ingeniously printed with the unit symbols on them.

Most of all though I love the modular maps and the variety of missions. It is worth noting the superb production quality also the boards are thick as anything (nowhere near as thick as the Tide of Iron boards though) and the units are just the right size so you can easily tell them apart and manoeuvre them.

A very simple, card-driven wargame (yes, it is!) that has some nice subtle strategies.

Easy to play, tough to win (for me).

Let down by too many scenarios not having enough pieces in it making it all to easy to imbalance. You probably shouldn't be able to successfully make a beach landing by skirting the edge of the cliffs until you are out of range of the artillery and then landing en masse in the far corner of the map. Well, you should, just not in a game set during D-Day. The lack of really great scenarios prevents this from being a truly great game and keeps it in the 'very good' category.

Exactly what a board game should be.  Surprisingly easy to pick up and to teach, this game gets more interesting with every play.

I have a funny history with Memoir 44. When Battlelore was all the rage, I borrowed M44 from a friend to try it out with my wife to see if we'd like the game mechanics enough to buy Battlelore. We enjoyed M44, and eventually bought Battlelore. After playing Battlelore a couple of times, I began to find myself thinking more about M44. Battlelore just feels like a re-hashed version of M44, with many card mechanics being re-arranged to appear in Lore cards instead of regular Command Cards. M44 just felt more.. fun. I mean, you have scenarios where you air-drop your infantry from 3 feet off the board and start them off where they land. How cool is that!?

Now I've bought myself a copy of M44 and much prefer it to Battlelore.

3 Dec 07: 7.5 --> 8.0. Just can't get enough of it. Yeah, sometimes the card draws are crap, but the sheer fun of moving men around and shooting stuff is simply addictive.

After three plays I am still unsure about this game. I really like the fact, that the game is very easy to learn and to play. It plays very smooth and quick and normaly you don´t get any difficult rules discussions or analysis paralysis. On the other Hand, I feel that my choices are too constricted by the cards. Also, I really  think that there is too much simplification - I´d really like a little more details. To put in a nutshell: I like the fact, that the game is very simple and I don´t really ike the fact, that the game is very simple. Go figure. :-P

RATING: 9
When I got this game, as a veteran wargamer, I really expected to be disappointed.  But the opposite turned out to be true.  Okay, it does not have the detail of many war games but that can be a major advantage.  My friends don't want to sit down to a 4+ hour battle where they struggle with the rules continuously.  Memoir 44 scenarios can be played over a lunch hour, often twice, once as Axis and once as Allies. The large number of accessible scenarios and campaigns without a hefty investment in miniatures is also a positive.  I would recommend this game to anyone.  Checkout Tom Vasel's video review if you are still skeptical.

I enjoy this system, though I'm not much of a WWII buff. Overlord is a good time, which might make it the only reason to get out anymore (since I can play C&C:Ancients or BattleLore). I think I actually like Battle Cry even slightly more than this one. The one thing this one has going for it is it plays quickly on Vassal (even via email) - I finished a live online game in like 7 minutes one night. The scenarios have no balance, but if you play both sides, that's not really an issue.

For my general opinion on this 'series' of games by Richard Borg, see my comments on "Battle Cry".

This game, together with BattleLore, strike me as the best of the bunch.

Update: On reflection, I was probably too hard on these games with my initial ratings, so I've upped them a bit.  Even my initial rating and comments weren't meant to indicate that I didn't like them or wouldn't play them - I do enjoy them, and will happily play them from time to time - but none of them really grab me.

This is a great game.  Too bad my wife won't play it.  Setup is a chore, but it looks great all laid out, and it is a blast.  The first time I played it with my buddy, we played the Pegasus Bridge scenario.  He played the allies, and I assured him that he would definitely trounce me.  I went on to completely destroy him (lucky rolls).  He still wanted to play again, and beat me the next two games.

A simple game, barely a wargame due to how light it is and how lacking it is in flavour induced rules, but so streamlined. The combat system feels like a skirmish is happening. Not necessarily in the sense that everything is happening at once like in Warhammer, but more encapsulates how flanks operate, suppressing fire, and looking for an enemies' weak spot. Certain units may move and fight more than others, based on terrain, or suppressing fire, stamina, morale or choke points. But none of this needs pages of rules to simulate; rather, the gameplay itself brings to life these variables, with card play and tough player decisions. Memoir 44 might seem like a mere gateway war game, but there is so much depth there.

A few games in with my son.  Playing a simplified version.  It's great pushing plastic soldiers and tanks around.  Dice chucking is fun but we had to get a dice tray so we don't destroy the soldiers' formations on the board!

Vistoso y apasionante juego de estrategia donde la suerte juega un papel importante: dados y cartas . Aun así, es divertido, sencillo, no precisa leerse extensas reglas y se juega en poco más de 1 hora. Sus expansiones lo mejoran y engrandece.

This game. Oh heavens I genuinely enjoy this game. The rules are simple enough and are learned pretty quickly, and having the terrain and unit reference cards are a great help. The pieces and board are very high quality, and the cards are as well. Game play is as fast as you make it, but man some of the scenarios can just be tough to win on either side. I love it and i look forward to getting more expansions.

M44 is very wargame lite. I don't mind a little abstraction in my games as long as they make sense, but in M44 there is too much abstraction in the way your units are limited in movement depending if they are on the left, center or right side of the game board. 

M44 has it's place among gamers, which explains the multiple pages of "10" ratings, unfortunately it is too simplistic for me. Because of that, it would not be fair for me to give it a rating.

Downloadable content, big plus.  Would love to see this one get more traction in my groups than I suspect it will.  One knock that is no fault of the game's own but a by-product of the tight design is the long setup time relative to play time.  I love it all the same.

Well produced game, easy to teach, and it's nice to have a dedicated 2-player game around. Card choices can sometimes feel limited, but at least set up and play time aren't egregiously long. All in all a game that should see play once or twice a year in our group.

This is what I was missing when I was 8 years old playing with army men!  Found the pace and play to be quite enjoyable.  No heavy strategy here, but I that's what makes it accessible (if you like the theme- my wife didn't).   My rating stays the same after 12 plays, different scenarios.

RATING: 9
Boy what a wholesome game! Fun, quick and with enough tactics to still be able to guide the luck. Put off from buying it because Battlelore was clearly more - better theme imo and with spells too, but BL quickly got tiring when you realised that it was all a licence to print expansions. Memoir is more stand-alone I feel with expansions more of an option than a necessity. In short I love it!

RATING: 10
I thought to myself one time, "How will I know when I find a ten rating? Maybe one of my nines is a ten in disguise." The answer is: you just know. Memoir '44 was immediately a ten; the gameplay is excellent and tense, the history behind the scenarios are an essential aspect of the rulebook, and learning the game took no time at all. It has the right balance of luck and strategy, enough cards to keep me happy and dice to keep my husband satisfied. The detail involved in the making of this game is simply astounding--even the armor design is accurate to the time period and side. If there were any complaint, it would be that set-up and take-down can go on a little long. Since we tend to play at least two games--one on each side of a scenario--that still doesn't seem too bad for us. I could go on about Memoir '44, but I think it's hard to understand the greatness of the game if you haven't played, which may be why it took me a while to finally buy it. I'm glad I did!  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Strikes a terrific balance by combining some of the better aspects of Euro games with war game elements. Luck of the draw on action cards can be a huge influence on options and outcomes, but the brisk pace at which is moves is essential to its makeup. Plenty of flavor and opportunity for both strategy and tactics. The multiplayer "Overlord" game variant also is a blast!

So far I'm loving everything about this game.  Set up can take a while, but I actually enjoy it.  Its like playing with army men.

Most of my games have been solo.  I've tried a few different approaches; playing both sides, playing one side and drawing a random card for the other.  Not sure which I like better and if there are more optimal choices out there.  

I've heard criticisms about the cards forcing too much luck.  I disagree.  #1 I do think it imitates the chaos of battle.  And #2, I don't think its too limiting.  Sure you may not get the exact draw you were hoping for, but it forces you to think on your feet and be flexible.  There are enough generic battle cards to even it out.  

Looking forward to getting the Eastern front, winter/desert map, and terrain pack next.

Memoir '44 is really a euro with a wargame theme, and the result is refreshing.  It is tactical without a blizzard of counters, and instead focuses on ACTION.  A single game can play in as much time as it takes to setup, which is a credit to its enthusiasm.  Memoir '44 renewed my interest in wargames.

This one has been a hit with family and friends, which fits right in with my master plan of setting the wargaming hook, then pulling them up into longer, more complicated fare.  It's all falling into place....

Memoir '44, while it'll never scratch the same itch as a good conflict simulation, is still a blast to play.  While the setup is a bit clunky, the gameplay is quick to learn, exciting, and for me, hits a risk-management sweet spot.  I doubt I'll be running out to scoop up all the expansions, but I do expect that this title will be getting taken off the shelf many more times.

RATING: 8
Essentially Battle Cry set in WW2, Memior '44 corrects some of the (few) flaws in the original C&C games and provides a very polished fast paced WW2 game. The expansions have been great as well, adding tons of depth and replayability. For some reason the Command and Colors system feels a bit more abstract in Memior '44 than in the other games in the C&C series (probably because of its setting), so I prefer BattleLore and Command and Colors: Ancients, but its hard to beat Memior '44 if you are looking for a fun light weight WW2 game. The Overlord rules are still my favorite way to play the game, and the best multi-player implementation of the C&C series so far. 

The rating is based on playing in Overlord mode. Without Overlord, this drops to a 7 because of the increased luck in Memior due to the lack of "Battle Back" rules.

My opinions on this game have changed over time.  Although I do think that the simple mechanics and nice miniatures are a good way to get people interested in a simple wargame, the mechanics of the game are too abstract and luck driven to really satisfy my grognard heart.  I am tempted to sell this game at a loss and buy Tide of Iron, but a hefty investment in the Advanced Squad Leader series has me hesitant to spend any more money on a tactical WW2 game.

One of our gaming group has this, and, as a long time wargamer and having heard the reviews, decided to give it a go.

I can't begin to describe just how disappointing and Mickey Mouse I found it. So you destroy half of a platoon of enemy troops - guess what? Their range and effectiveness is unaffected. How realistic. Not. So you think you've got tactical and battlefield strategic smarts? Well, you're fucked mate - the cards you've drawn are about as much use as a cotton condom.

It's a cartoon version of Squad Leader for people who'd rather not get too involved in historical detail.

The elegant and simple system doesn't waste time with the complex unit details that bog down more involved war games.  The cards shape but don't command the outcome of the game, and each scenario offers each player interesting tactical decisions.  Very fun.  My only irritation is the set-up time, which can at times make an otherwise great, short game too much of a bother.  

9-2-08: Moved from 9 to 8.5, mostly because thinking about pulling this out and setting it up is just barely enough to make me reconsider playing the game.  

02-08-08: Dropped a full point to 7.5, because for me it scratches the same itch as Heroscape, and right now I really want to pull out Heroscape in a way that makes this a second choice.

Plus the amount of options to expand your collection is far better than Battlelore 2nd ed. 

Overlord is my preferred way to play this game. I'll almost never turn down a game of Memoir Overlord

I have never played a war game, but this sounds fun. SUSD made this game sound lighter than other games in its genre and the fact that your move is determined more by the cards in your hand rather than what you want to do sounds like the sort of tactical gameplay that I would enjoy.

My biggest concerns with it are that either the game is too strategic or that it has too many rules, since my group seems allergic to rule books.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good introductory war game. The variety of scenarios makes for multiple entertaining experiences. The command cards can make things a little interesting when you want to make a particular move but do not have the necessary card to do it. A scenario can play through in about 30 minutes. The simplified rules for children worked well for my daughter to be introduced to the game. I would like to get the expansions to add more variety to the game as well.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I feel this game is wat over-hyped. It's OK as a very simple wargame but it just doesn't give (IMHO) any feel for the events it's attempting to reflect. Battlecry is much better suited to this kind of "simultation"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun, fun, fun.  It does  not set out to accomplish anything else.  It succeeds  in being total fun.  Not getting the cards for your strategy to succeed can be a fun way to get frustrated.  Different scenarios keep the game fresh and entertaining.  There is always a strategy to try, switching sides is the way to play.   

This game makes everybody happy.  The person who wins can see their decisions which caused them to win, and the person who loses can blame 1) cards  2) die rolls 3) scenario. 

If I didn't have to set up the board this would easily be a point higher, but the set up time for a light game is excruciating and keeps me from suggesting to put it on the table.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I love the battle style of this game, it's a great deal of fun taking strategy and careful unit movement but still has plenty of luck in it...cards/dice.

UPDATE: Upon playing Manoeuvre I was forced to lower this rating a bit. It's still a good game but Manoeuvre is brilliant. Don't get me wrong these are very different games but if I'm looking for a quick light battle style game I'd rather play Manoeuvre.

Very nice light war game.  Quick to learn and play, though with some tactical depth.  Using strategy cards means each player's turn is short, cutting down on waiting between turns.  It's not very detailed, but terrain plays a substantial role and some strategic depth.  That and the historical information for each scenario helps to give the game meaning beyond the dice rolling.

Don't let my 6 rating fool you.  I didn't think this was a bad game.  In fact, I think the system's description of a 6 fits perfectly.  This is an okay game.  It involves some fun and challenge, and I will certainly be willing to play sporadically if in the right mood.  Just like other Days of Wonder games, the components are top notch and really contribute to the experience.  The inclusion of numerous scenarios is also very nice.  I fear it might get a bit old and repetitive too quickly, but it's certainly a nice introductory war-themed game.

I picked this up back in 2008 and have played it a lot over the years. Thought it's a 2-player game, you can easily play with more people. The game is fairly simple, but that's what makes it so good. There are loads of extra scenarios on the web, and you can even make your own. This means that the game is different every time you play it. 

The only problem I have with this game is that the sides can be a bit unbalanced. This can be fixed by playing a scenario twice, once as each side, and comparing victory points in the end. Though that means the game takes longer.

I used to think I just couldn't get into a wargame. (I know that this technically isn't a wargame, according to the pro wargamers, but you know what I mean.)

I heard and read so much good feedback about Memoir '44 that I finally gave it a shot when a coworker gave me his copy.

I have been pleasantly surprised. I've been loving this game for two primary reasons:

1. I love tactical games, which this is.
2. It's much easier than Squad Leader - which is the other wargame I've played.

On top of that, other people have enjoyed playing with me, my wife included.

There are also plenty of expansions and a great website and online community.

EDIT (5/18/2011): I just updated my rating from 9.5 to 10 because I realized that I want to play it just as often as, or more often than, my other 10-rated game - Dominion.

EDIT (4/14/2015): This game continues to be my favorite still years later, even though I'm usually not in the mood for gaming.

RATING: 7.5
This game took me a while to get into. I think the first few times I played it, the command cards were a source of frustration rather than a way of directing tactics. I think it is possible to lose due to sheer bad luck with card draws (or dice rolls) but games are generally short enough that it doesn't matter too much. Overall, the game is a fun and I look forward to more games soon.

A lot of people have complained that the cards ruin the strategy by bringing too much luck into the game.  I think the opposite, in that the cards provide a "handicap" that changes every time and make each game fresh.  If you want a 100% strategy and no luck game then stay away, you will be frustrated.  But if you want to test your strategy against "all comers", including sudden shifts of gameplay, Memoir 44 can be an intensely exciting game.  The board tokens and hex pieces are also awesome!

RATING: 8.5
Great two player game if you like the type.  However, it does have a lot of luck involved between the dice & cards which can be really frustrating when you have a unit one move away from a victory and can't get the card to move them or constantly roll tanks when you want infantry and vise versa.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An OK game.  I find the miniatures actually more fiddly to move around than counters or blocks.  Though they do look very cool.  However, my biggest complaint is how poorly it "feels" like WWII combat.  With no penalty for attacking, it makes good sense for infantry to charge across an open field to engage armour.  Really.  Having said that, I do like the lack of omnipotent command abstracted by the command cards. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Sold it.  Although an entertaining and somewhat historical simulation, I did not like the luck or misfortune of card draws that can leave flanks unable to activate for multiple turns and be at the complete mercy of your opponent. Complete frustration watching your flanks get rolled with nothing to do except smile. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Setup time to play time ratio is killing this one. Reference "sheets" are a bit clumsy as well. Alas, back in the day when I was still very smitten, I painted the bits and will probably never part with it. Plus my kids are aching to learn it so there's still plenty of fun left.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A test of your acceptance of luck. With two luck-based mechanics dictating both where you can attack and how said attacks go, the game often renders the wisest tactician inept. Still, somehow, it frequently creates delightful moments of tension and crafts war stories worth retelling. Too bad it takes as long to set up as it does to play.

Solid 'gateway game' toward more serious historical miniature wargaming.

Excellent 'dueling' game, as tension between victory conditions keeps things interesting for the entire playthrough.  Do consider swapping sides and seeing who wins by the largest margin, as missions are often imbalanced - as historically appropriate.

Dice and card mechanics add a moderate luck factor that is both a) thematically appropriate and b) a powerful equalizer of player skill.  However, games do not tend to feel won or lost 'by luck of the draw', but by personal strategy and maneuver.

I enjoy how Memoir 44 balances strategy with the uncertainty of combat. The Commands and Color systems allowed for a great war game without the need to consult a Combat Results Table (CRT) or a dense booklet.

Outstandingly simple but so much fun. I like everything about this game, the period, the figures, the flexible gameboard and terrain tiles, the simple rules and the command cards. This has got to be one of THE best examples of a game to entice any new/potential gamer into your fraternity and I don't know of any similar game that allows beginners to play on a par with veteren players straight of bat. Yes there is a lot of luck but good card management and strategic use of terrain and special unit abilities (eg Armoured Over-runs!!) should even the balance.
Definite 10 out of 10 from our club at the moment - particularly like the eight player Overlord capabilities.. just need to devise a Campaign system now...

Easy to learn (10 min), quick to play (20-30 min), and enough strategy to make it replayable several times over. This is just a great game is you enjoy light strategy board games without the rules indoctrination. The hardest part about getting people to play strategy wargames is the rules indoc. This is the answer to those friends that just want to play a couple of games while visiting or watching a baseball game on TV. You will get your moneys worth out of this game in no time.

Playing the game with the "Overlord" rules - with eight players, probably ranks an "11".Is this popularity deserved? The answer is that Memoir '44 is the pinnacle - the absolute best of light modern war games. With the tried-and-true system Borg invented in Battle Cry perfected - Memoir '44 plays smoothly, quickly, and provides a pile of fun! The game can be taught in less than 10 minutes, but has definite strategies, but with enough luck to make each game varied.  I usually can say something negative about most games, but Memoir is a game without error - a masterpiece of fun and excellence.  The expansions only add to the fun - with the Air Pack probably being the best.

play with 11 year old son who loves it so much he bought himself expansions with last couple of years birthday money that he had not known what to do with.
A simple,flowing easy to grasp and play game that is a fine way to get a newbie into gaming or a square eyed boy off the x box.
we have Eastern Front and winter wars with the breakthrough kit and i would recommend all 3 of these expansions as natural follow ons to the base game as you get the big boards, the new army and rules and the items you need to play bigger 2 player games at a slightly higher level of complexity and it makes it a bit more tactical too. In short Eastern Front, Winter Wars and the breakthrough kit all compliment each other nicely and seem like a nice natural progression from the base game into somthing a bit heavier.

Finally got the chance to play this (with a custom made scenario). Really like it, but I already have Battlelore, and both games are really similar.

I enjoyed playing this, the rules are easy to learn. There is some strategy involved and some luck too. The minitures have storage for the axis and for the allies. The terrain tiles add a sense of depth and randomness, this is also a issue too, I am being petty here, the 1st scenario ask for certain tiles well there isn't enough tiles of the type asked for. That is the only complaint I have it's fun you learn something about history.

RATING: 8
This is such a guilty pleasure. It's so quick and easy to play, though setup can take a little while. If both players are working together to set it up, it's not too bad at all. It tickles the chuck lots of dice, have a few laughs, beer and pretzels itch.

I play with the variant where you have a pool of additional command cards that either player has access to. Been testing out between 3 to 5 cards and it's been really good. I also play the variant if there are temporary medals on the board, the player who benefits from the additional temporary medals must hold all the objectives in order to win. It doesn't matter if they've already killed enough squads to gain the medals required to win the objective. This might imbalance some of the missions, but I've found it a lot more fun.

Assimilated in the Borgian mass. Can be used to bring alive battles from squad to division level as the mechanics allow disregarding both unit size and battle length.

Fun game - and I don't really go in for war games (and I recognize that calling this a war game is like calling the film WarGames starring Matthew Broderick a war game).

RATING: 7
Endlessly re-playable ultralight wargame that does a great job of simulating the fog of war and the vagaries of the chain of command. 

+ Practically no teaching time required
+ Plays in 30-45 minutes
+ It's FUN



- Strangely ambiguous rules regarding beach and ocean movement. Still haven't entirely figured it out.

- Tanks make little sense. You can really tell that they're cavalry units from other C&C games with slightly different abilities. They're fragile, ineffective when attacking buildings and bunkers (whatever happened to concussive blasts?), and often seem like more of a liability than an asset. Yes, they're powerful when used effectively, but the way you have to use them seems counterintuitive and just doesn't say "tank" to me. Also, artillery units are harder to hit than tanks... 


Update: I have degraded my rating slightly after my exposure to C&C Ancients and Napoleonics, which retain the low entry barrier but have far more depth of play.

This is the absolute lightest a wargame can get and still feel like a wargame.  It takes 5 minutes to teach, and that's if the person you are teaching is somewhat dim.

Great 2p wargame.  Rulebook was frustating at first, until we figured out how the cards worked (w/o the book).  D-day scenario is a reminder of the sacrifice.

RATING: 9
The game is simple without being simplistic.  Tough decisions have to made.  Reckless behavior is punished.  There is actually less elements of chance then in an ASL game (where even the bowel movements of German soldiers is rolled for), which I am also a big fan of. Well thought out.  Great expansion ability.

Great game. Very easy to pick up and play, games are relatively brief, so it's very easy to do 'match play' (playing one side then playing the other straight after): which is a bit of a must, seeing as almost all scenarios seem to be loaded in favour one side or the other (mainly the Allies)! All topped off by an excellent application of the theme, which really builds atmosphere. Definitely rates a 9 from me after four games. I'm loathe to give an extreme score to a game within a year of purchasing/first playing it, but if I still feel this way about it in a year it would rate a 10 I reckon. Chalk up another success for Days of Wonder!

I guess everything has been said before about this game...

If you like the idea of a wargame "for the whole family", go ahead and try it.

Also note that it has lots of extensions, so if there's a little collector voice inside your head and you have a limited budget, think twice before buying the base game!

To ahistorical and abstract to be a serious wargame but fun for a play every now and then.  Good for introducing kids and the Risk crowd to wargames I guess.  The axis and allies of grand tactical level WWII games.  (think PANZERBLITZ / PANZER LEADER ish scale)  Despite different scenarios, the play becomes very repetitive after a while.  I've not tried the expansions, but I kind of doubt they fix this issue.

Played a bunch on steam, finally got my physical copy, a really enjoyable tactical face off for two players.  Quite a bit of luck, but not so deterministic that strategy won't prevail.  

Probably the biggest reason that I don't play it more, is that I'm lazy, and it takes a long time to setup.

Also, many of the maps are imbalanced.

I didn't love my first play of this a several years ago.  it seemed pretty vanilla, but I was playing the intro scenario, at lunch, and we played it wrong.  Not a great recipe for success.  So I decided to revisit this with my 8 year-old son; partly because he likes little green army men, and partly because I knew this would be simple enough for him to grasp, and partly because I wanted a way to introduce him to some history and hoped this game might start a conversation.  I know it's war, and violence, but 8 year-old boys are inundated with that stuff anyway, it's just usually in a cartoon fantasy world where walking lions swing glowing electric swords while battling armor wearing snakes... so what the hell.  Anyway, it worked like a charm.  He loves this game, and has started asking me questions about the real life battles.  History, here we come!

RATING: 8
A good choice if you're new to wargaming and (like me) are a sucker for plastic minis. There are enough optional rules and expansions to keep it fresh for a long time. Be warned: while there's plenty of strategy, it uses cards and dice, so there is a good amount of luck involved. Be sure to check out similar games with other settings: Battlelore, C&C: Ancients, C&C: Napoleonics & Battlecry.

I finally have the game and played it, and you bet I'm giving it a 10.  There's just no other war game like it (well, except for BC).  The simplicity stays in tact with quick reference cards that answers questions about the rules quickly.  After all this talk, this game better make game of the year or something... after playing maybe 500+ games of BC, you can count on me playing 1000+ games of M44, I definetly recomend it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A wargame for those who don't like wargames.  It's simple enough that you won't be overwhelmed, and although it may not be the best at replicating real scenarios, I think it is much more playable than most of the wargames I've seen.

The real difference between this and your standard wargame is the number of turns you receive per flank.  If you find regular wargames dry, give this one a try.

Good for younger players who aren't ready for a full-on WW2 simulation.  But the scale of the scenarios can be wonky and the mechanic simply doesn't suit WW2 tactics as well as it does Civil War tactics in Battleground.  In the Civil War whole divisions could and did sit on their hands during battles because they didn't receive instructions. I've played whole Normandy invasion scenarios where 50% of my men never leave their Higgins boats, and that just feels weird.

Great game for battling with my son.  We've completed all the scenarios (playing both sides) and are moving onto the expansions.  Dad has 75% of the victories but that will change as Dave gains experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Mechanics are very much like Battle Cry with a WWII theme.  A set scenario is played with varrying terrain and troup placement.  Cards are used to activate units in one or more of the 3 flanks.  Attack is done with varrying numbers of dice.  We only played the simple scenario but it was very enjoyable and I really can't wait to play it again with some of the more advanced scenarios.  There are even scenarios which require 2 boards which may mean I wind up keeping my for trade copy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's OK.  I loved BattleCry and bought M44 as soon as I could, but some how it doesn't recapture the magic of Battle Cry for me.  I'd have liked more balanced scenarios (maybe different VPs to win for each side?)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A short wargame!  And it's not totally devoid of strategy!  I must admit, I thought it was too good to be true, but after playing it pretty extensively, I am a big fan.  Perfect for quick sessions, and introducing people to what wargaming is about.  Only drawback is long setup time relative to playtime.  Setup time is about  15 minutes, and playtime can be as low as 20 minutes.  Still worth it, though.  Don't go for the expansions, beyond maybe the Eastern Front with the winter board.  The campaigns and air rules especially quickly bulk the game up beyond the simplicity that keeps the system going.

Wargames are not my thing. I do like confrontational games but not wargames per se. As well, WW2 is not my favourite area either. Only played once just to see how I would like the system and the whole concept of "wargames". Probably won't play again.

RATING: 8
I like game variety in my collection and game play.  This gives me a very "light" war game with miniature feel in a game that can be played in 30 to 60 minutes.  Multiple scenarios that can be replayed on a 2 sided board.  I understand that the dice and cards might add too much luck and variability, but that's how life is sometimes - a roll of the dice or play of the cards.  My brother in law enjoys it and look forward to trying it out with my brothers.

RATING: 8
After three matches, the game seems to be a little bit too light for my liking. I will happily play it, though. It's a fast and very light wargame and there not that many competitors in that genre. The cards and the dice usually mean, that you can't give orders to those units, that you would like, so luck is a big factor. Bigger than skills, I think.

Add about 20 match-up games and more distance to war games (in timely sense) and the game feels rather good. Of course the dice and the cards bring random elements in to the game, but they even each other quite well - and the other player has the same problems. Also the game is quick, you don't need to think about every cunning strategy, because you are not able to perform them. You need to manage with the cards you have.

The theme is great (for me, might not be that hot for others) and the components are good looking. Only minus thing is the color palette, at least in my kitchen light the grey and green are sometimes hard to distinguish... I have now played every scenario on both sides and I'm looking for the expansion to give more content and life time to the game.

I have finished the game second time on both sides and started going through the Eastern Front.

I updated the rating from 7 to 8 (01-DEC-2013), because, well, I like to play this game. I wouldn't necessarily want to teach the game to anyone new, but if the rules are known, then this is a nice game to play.

I have now played Eastern Front and Pacific Theater on both sides, still like the game. Next up Terrain Pack or Sword of Stalingrad scenarios. Using the expansions adds rules AND setup time, lots of more hexes to select from, special rules and so on... Best to play one scenario both sides at one go to decrease setup time.

RATING: 6
Is it more luck driven than tactics-driven?  It's one or the other, because I lost my first two games, even when we switched sides for the same scenario.  I'm leaning toward the tactics side of things, but I can see myself playing this a lot, back-to-back-to-back.  It moves quickly, and has an addictive flavor because of its short playtime.

MONT MOUCHET: This scenario may be more balanced than others, since my opponent won both games we played, playing each side of the scenario.  It might also be that I was a new player, and didn't really understand what I was doing.  It's not a bad introductory scenario, though, since it covers different terrains and battle rules.

A very simple and lightweight wargame. WWII battles are replayed with a high level of abstraction. It's a great game to introduce new gamers (and kids) to the wonderful world of wargaming.

One of the best light-wargames I've played. It has the perennial favorite WWII theme without complex ZOC, stacking, range rules. The cards simplify play by directing what can move or fire.

Great. Easy to play and understand. Quite well balanced. Even play it with my son, though we needed to use the "young generals" rules at first, as his reading skills were less than perfect at the time. Only major complaint is that the blue and green colors are far too close to tell apart easily under less-than-ideal lighting. Minor complaint is that half of the components appear to be mutated in one way or another, but that's not a real big issue.

Why do I have a problem with Memoir?  I'm really not sure?  But, I think a lot of it has to do with the fiddlyness of having to move 4 individual soldiers from 1 hex to another, which leads to accidental destruction of the platoons either side with my (actually not) fat fingers...

I like this game a lot but i think it seems to be alienating my friends and family when we play. 
They seem to think it is too random but i disagree, there is a random element but superior tactics and understanding of the battlefield usually wins through. The alienation comes becasue i keep winning!

RATING: 7
The second game in the Command and Colors system, this one set in WWII. Every C&C release shows constant evolution and Memoir '44 is a big improvement over the system first presented in Battlecry, adding rules for taking ground as well as overrunning with tanks. This makes for a much more fluid battlefield without adding too much in the complexity department. On the flip side...With all that it does right, Memoir still suffers from some the same problems as Borg's other C&C games. Killing units is usually the primary win condition, leading to wild attacks in the end game. There are also no rules for morale or battling back, making these hyper aggressive moves all the more rewarding. The command deck system falls apart a bit when applied to a more modern setting as well. Why is it that my troops don't fire back when assaulted? Were there really no radios in WWII? Then why can't I order the left flank?!? The unpredictability of the command deck combined with a lack of Ops fire, Cover fire, or any other modern combat tactics makes the WWII theme seem a little artificial.

 Memoir '44 has hit a rough spot in my collection. It's not deep enough to play with my gamer friends, but is a little too much for the wife and kids. (Not that my wife can't handle it, war games just hold no interest for her.) So for the most part, I break it out now and then (particularly when expansions hit...gotta catch 'em all!) get irritated with its idiosynchrocies, and put it away for a couple of months. Recently, I have been toying with some slight modifications, mostly imports from Battlelore and C&C Ancients. Put simply, Grenade hits are only counted in close assaults, and defending units who hold their ground in an assault get to battle back. Typically I abhorr house rules, but these seem to give the game a more tactical feel, with a little more risk involved when assaulting.

2/2010 - Traded for Tide of Iron.

6/2011 - Memoir '44 Online has brought me back into the fold. The ability to set up a game in a matter of minutes with no clean-up has refreshed my enjoyment of the game system. It's a VERY well-done implementation...Download it now!

What a pleasant surprise! I thought for sure I would hate this game, but it's one of the best I've ever played. I don't like dice in general, have often found line of sight to be infuriating Heroclix and am not crazy about war games. The line of sight is the most intuitive I've encountered (if not entirely realistic), the dice don't totally run the game, and it's SO MUCH FUN. This is one of those games that is much greater than the sum of its parts. Even things that would normally drive me crazy in games just left me smiling (for example, the second scenario features "air drop" reinforcements that involve dropping the plastic minis onto the board to see where they bounce to). I think a lot of this can be attributed to the short play time; my first game only took 45 minutes from opening the box to finish. Some of the scenarios seem to be unbalanced, but the game plays quickly enough that you could easily play both sides of it. I'd recommend anyone try this even if it's not their type of game, and I look forward to trying out the other C&C games.

A Fun light "war game." A game can last less than an hour. A game where strategy is based on luck. Being too aggressive can work for you or against you it just depends on the cards, the dice and the scenario. It's fun game with lots of accessories and expansions. It's a toy dress up as a board game. I love it.

So far I have played this game only three times but that is sufficient for me to decide to bump my rating of it up to a 9.    I haven't played many wargames so I cannot compare it to other games like Axis & Allies.  What I can say is that the game system is easily learned.  So much so that it allows you to concentrate on the fun and strategy instead of being bogged down in rules.  Memoir 44 is plays fairly quick so you don't get bored with it.  UPDATE - played it many more times since the original rating and it deserves a 9 for sure.

Toned down Battle Cry's problems (useless cards, stupid retreat rules, overpowered infantry charges) and added new improvements (varied terrain/obstacles, more interesting scenario victory conditions--but worse balance). Still a LOT of dumb luck, though; no getting around that.

Oddly, though, the most annoying this about it is long setup time, making a "short" game (and it is) into much more of a time sink than it warrants.

Excellent Light Wargame.  Presentation is top-notch,  and it plays very fast.  With combat resolved by dice rolls and movement decided by card draw,  there's a very significant luck component (mitigated by the short playing time.  Designed to be a play both sides game, so scenarios are not really balanced).   Setup is a little bit fiddly,  since you have to put all the terrain on the board while following a layout.  The pieces are very nice, soft plastic, although the artillery looks a little fragile and tends to bend.

Biggest disappointment of my collection. Love the theme, the history, the components, the concept. But the execution was horrible. Dice for combat are always a nightmare, and needing certain cards to actually command the units you want to is way too crippling. You can think up a nice strategy all you want but the cards and dice will destroy you.

Replaced by BattleLore.  I happen to like the theme and feel of BattleLore much better.  Otherwise, a very good game.

Only rating it high because I do not see it as being intended as a serious wargame. Strictly supposed to be fast and fun, which it achieves for me. My 12-year old son enjoys it, although he's not consumed by it, so it only gets a 7 from me.

I'd give it a higher rating if it had:
1. used a fire-before-move mechanic instead of the move-before-fire (there's a reason the phrase is Fire & Movement);
2. given a flank/rear fire bonus;
3. included a suppression mechanic.

If the miniatures had come painted I'd like it even more..

RATING: 7
Not a bad LIGHT war game.  Although there's not much differentiation between nationalities (infantry is infantry, armor is armor), it's still pretty fun.  The card-based command system makes things interesting and frustrating all at once.  So, if you like rolling lots of dice and can live with the possibility of couple of good or bad card draws having a big effect on the game, give it a try.

Update:  My son (11 years old) has taken a keen interest in Memoir, so we've been playing a ton.  Still say it's a decent light war game.  I'm hoping this will serve as a springboard to meatier titles down the road (ASL!).  The many expansions do help provide a reasonable amount of differentiation between nationalities (although not quite so much with each country's units).

I passed on this game for a long time because frankly it looked too light, too youngish.  But with the people on BGG singing its praises so loudly and so often, I had to look into it deeper.

I'm really glad that I did.  It's deceptively simple looking, but I think the versatility is great, as is the gameplay, the use of cards to order specific units, the quality of the components, and the sheer fun factor.

I also love that you can quickly play a scenario.  There are many times when I want to play a WWII wargame but don't have the time available for a long, drawnout battle.  Often, this solves the problem quite nicely.

Plus ... you get to play with army men!

A historical boardgame where players face-off in stylized battles of some of the most historic battles of World War II including Omaha Beach, Pegasus Bridge, Operation Cobra and the Ardennes.

This game has a lot of things going for it, mainly the nice models and the speed of play. The dice mechanic doesn't make a ton of sense to me (why not just hit on 5+) but it does streamline play a bit if the rules got more complex. (I assume)

The cards (to me) really break the game. There is nearly zero balance in the cards (only slightly more then Battlelore which is somehow more broken than this game). It's highly possible through the course of a game you will move 20-30% more units than your opponent or that they will be unable to counter a move due to simply having no cards. I hate the mechanic that someone has just flat our better cards and I've won/lost games due to someone having several cards on a flank that could wipe out several units. It's totally possible to have a section fully outnumbered and out of position but then lose them due to no cards.

It's also possible (as mentioned before) to have a game where someone gets to move 20 units throughout the entire game and the other person moves 35 (it's happened, we tracked it for a game)

The dice don't bother me, that's a normal part of a wargame. The setup time, scenarios, models are all great. The cards fully break the game. As a solution in Memoir they attempted to add some drawing mechanics for the really crappy cards (draw two keep one) but it's just not enough. It's the equivilant of having multiple pistols in En Garde. The cards really need to be balanced. As is the cards are not situationally better, most cards are just flat out better than other cards under any situation.

This is compounded by the fact that under several scenarios there are not even certain unit types which makes several cards fully useless.

I believe this title created a turning point in the development of wargames.  Because Memoir '44 was so approachable, and because of the short play time, a whole new fan base was created and made available for wargame designers.  

No longer were designers saddled with creating games for the spectacled, pocket-protected, introverted types.  They catapulted into the Dorito-munching, Mountain Dew slurping 'Wazzup' crowd.  Indeed, a tremendous leap forward.

What makes this title so appealing is the customizable board and endearing toy-soldier pieces.  Together, those two elements married nostalgia with swift, variable play.

This game also popularized card-driven games--no small feat.  Until Memoir '44, the card-driven mechanic wasn't embraced with open arms by the gaming public.  It is now dominating the industry.

Fun game.  Fast, sometimes furious action.  Limiting, though.  At times you feel as though your wrists (and brain) are shackled.  You see the battlefield, know where you need to attack or defend, and all you can do is lamely shuffle a few troops within a different area of the board.  

Frustrating at times, but I do enjoy pulling this out every so often.  It's easier to get non-gamers to say, "Yes" when they gaze upon a colorful, map-like battlefield hosting fantastic toy soldiers.  Oh, yeah.  :)

I've never seen such a huge number of comments and geeklist for such a game as this so early on...i think this game rocks as an alternative to a long heavy wargame. plays quick, is fun and tense. 5 games later and still love it, plus i have my non gamer mates beat the pants off me, which they enjoy. My first overlord scenario (ardennes scenario) with just 2 players was also a cracker! with a huge tank offensive on both sides on the right (or left depending on where you sit) flank with an overwhelming axis victory! goes up a step.

Some people think this is too lite of a war game, but I like it.  Plays quick, luck of the draw does play a factor in the game, but overall a nice game.  I'm excited about the expansions.

RATING: 7
Played a few times. I have too few opportunities for 2p games to play this one enough to have a better opinion. I suppose that after a few more plays, using more of the rules, I would either really like the game, or definitely think it is too random (because of both the dice rolls and the card draws) for my tastes. For now, I am standing on the edge - I would like discovering the game some more, but it is not one of my absolute priorities.

This is a great, light, tactical WWII game.  I can play it with my 6-(7, 8, 9)-year-old, and I can play it with my gamer friends.  You don't have a lot of control and there is plenty of luck, but it is a fun experience playing army men with some rules.  I like C&C: Ancients a little bit more (and BattleLore a little bit less), but M'44 is also very good.

Brilliant game - a complex and satisfying WWII tactical wargame playable in under an hour.  Want different scenarios? - the Memoir44 website offers a load of downloadable/printable scenarios for the basic game. Only 2 things let this game down; firstly the scenarios are unequal, so if you want 'fair' play you need to play a pair of games, one each side.  This could have been adjusted by a simple game mechanic of setting different victory flags for each side.  Secondly, the expansions are expensive and dont really live up to the original game, in particular being disappointing through the limited number of scenarios offered - I would have rated this game 9 otherwise, and little in the way of downloads last time I checked.  I was so pleased with this game that I ran a tournament in my games club.

I thought this game would be more deep than it actually is. As far as war games go.. this shouldn't really be considered one. It's really not even that strategic. Dice rolls will make or break your plan.. I never enjoy games where your strategy could go awry due to a few mis-rolled dice.

Nice miniatures game about WWII battles. Mechanics are interesting, though sometimes not realistic, but this is a game and suppose to be fun.

Rulebook is great, almost no additional questions arise. Maybe will rate higher after more plays.

After only a few plays I knew this was a great game that would be easy to teach to others.  I can't wait to try Overlord.

Edit: I haven't played this one as much lately.  Thus, I dropped the rating because I want to play BattleLore and Commands & Colors: Ancients more.  I think there aren't quite enough unit types and there are a few too many terrain rules by comparison.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I haven't owned the game for long, but I love this game. I love how clever the mechanics of the game are, and honestly, I love the luck factor. The cards and dice are what make this game great--well, that and the scenarios, and the tiles, and the pieces. It's such a high quality game that I will be playing for years.

I can't wait to get the expansions.

UPDATE: I own about 75% of the system and i can't get enough of it. Play 2 player once a week and an overlord on average once a month. Still my favorite game (Well, Seasons has become my new favorite, but I still play Memoir at least once a week).

One of my favorite games, since I am very fascinated by the Second World War. I am a proud owner of all the expansion, inclusive the famous bag! Easy rules and great components and it is very fun to recreate history. The set-up times does take some minutes, but talk about WW2 or the game and just get in the spirit for the game while doing it, and you'll be fine. I am looking forward to introduce Memoir '44 to my gaming group and have entire evenings playing this game.

Fun tactical game. I enjoy it but think the sector aspect can be very frustrating. You are sometimes forced to watch a third of the map crumble to the opponent and you are pretty helpless to do anything about it. This can also lead to unfinished business in some areas, which is kind of annoying.

RATING: 5
Chaotic, but fast-paced and tense.  This game is an awful lot of fun, just don't take it too seriously.  Very abstract, which is pretty rare for a tactical scale game.

The only downside is that it can be a bit frustrating when the card mechanic gets in the way of things by giving you an impossible hand (which is rare, but can happen).  You can almost always do something, but it does stain the overall experience a bit.  Forces you to play in ways that don't make as much sense.  This is not a deal breaker, just be aware of it going in.

I was a bit sceptical buying this game, because basicly it's risk with cool military units. But my GF saw a video review of it and somehow got interested in it. So, i bought it. And after one play i can say it's more fun then i thought. 

Personally, for me, it could be a bit more strategic, because it really is that "risky" throw the dice battling, but it makes it also a very easy and fun game to play, because anyone can win. I like the cards though. They give you that "yeah" feeling sometimes.

So there is some tactical stuff, but a lot of luck. Because it excites my GF so much i enjoy playing it a lot too and am looking forward to the next game. This is also the kind of game most young teenager kids will love to play.

+ Anyone can win, it's just fun
+ Great components and quality tiles / maps / cards
+ Nice artwork
+ Clear handbook and streamlined / elegant gameplay
+ A lot of variations and scenarios available

- It's not setup in a minute, it takes some time.
- It's based a lot on luck

It looks nice (high prod value),but sits uneasily (IMHO) between a wargame and a "german style" game. I've played a few times but don't particularly enjoy it any more than "micro" hex and counter games old and new. Could it work as a "gateway" wargame??

RATING: 7.5
Memoir only suffers from the lack of options with units (Unless you want to spend another $300 on more expansions).  The game mechanic is great as is the terrain bonus/faults.  On the border of a 8 and 9 level for me.  I think it would be flawless if they had more units (different types of soldiers, different types of tanks, aircraft, etc).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Memoir is a quick, fun, tactical board game.

I really enjoy that you can knock out battles fairly quickly and that the battles aren't necessarily balanced. Much like the history that they are based off of, certain battles favored one side... the question is... can you rewrite history? Because of this fact, it's best to play each scenario back-to-back with your opponent and then see who had the best aggregate score. Luckily, this isn't too difficult once you've set up the scenario for the first time.

Yes... there is quite a bit of luck based on card draws and die rolls. The fact that, at times, you can't seem to draw cards to save your life or that your plan of attack is flubbed by a seemingly easy die roll can be frustrating but the game as a whole makes up for those few frustrating times. You also have to realize that your opponent will more likely suffer the same fate at times too... so things generally balance out.

And while the game is great as a 1 vs 1 game with the one-off scenarios that are included in the base game, it really shines in the many types of "epic" games that you can play. I was fortunate enough to play the D-Day scenario at Gen Con 2014 and it was amazing. Not only was I taught the game by Richard Borg, seeing the game at that scale and playing with that many people was an experience I'll never forget. The addition of being able to use the campaign book to string together bunch of battles is pretty great too.

Recent plays have really made me appreciate the simplistic design and how it allows you to focus on strategy and tactics and doesn't get in the way of game play. Great game.

This game is a friggin' blast.  I constantly get my rear-end kicked but it is worth the thrashing to play this game.

I will try it again though and hope it is better than I think it is and I do like owning it. I am after all - a collector as well as a game player.

Maybe my expectations were too high.  Maybe my friend and I weren't really the target audience of this game.  But this game was unsatisfying on so many levels.  The combat is far too simplified (you can win the game by rolling 4 hits).  The luck factor is through the roof.  People complain about a game like Risk, but at least the die rolling is spread out over dozens or even hundreds of rolls, so short-term luck is mitigated.  And the cards required for movement don't make things any better.  Maybe my opponent should've known better than to draw so many generic movement cards while I drew 'Behind Enemy Lines', 'Air Power', etc.

Memoir '44 is a favorite of mine. As a WWII history buff I love having such an accessible wargame, that I can introduce to just about any of my friends. The components are fantastic (especially in the original edition). I love how the cards simulate fog of war, but the game still rewards great tactics. I love the asymmetric scenarios, and switching sides at "half-time" and playing the game again. Overall, this is awesome!

It is a plus that it plays so quickly, but there is a good deal of unbalance with the scenarios.  I'll give it a seven for now, but that may rise or fall with further plays.  I'd say that the schmoes who complain about the luck need to go back to puerto rico.

[b]AWESOME TANK-BATTLING, MACHINEGUN-RATTLING, DICE-THROWING, LIGHT WARGAME![/b]

Fellow geekers, I have a confession, and it has been many moons since my last: I don't like ASL or any of the chit-moving, all-week-lasting, squad-level, WW2 wargames. My reasons are twofold: I don't like having to squint at chits with 15 numbers on the pale cheap-ass card representing a Panzer unit; plus, I really don't have the attention span to focus on one game for the days it seems to take to resolve a tank battle, like Stalingrad Operation Blue, set against the background of the snowy wastes of Russia, using a system that even details the armour of a KV-1 tank (75mm). Kudos to the designers for being so fastidious, but games like that are not my bag, nor ever will be. I'm interested in War World II, but that doesn't mean that I want to play a wargame on a poster-map, using an encyclopedia for the rules.

Give me a game that plays in a half-hour, lets myself and an eager opponent pit wits over the furious battles of WW2, and allows me to move hordes of plastic tanks about a battlefield to the clatter icon-dice, and I'm a happy bunny. M'44 is the game that fulfills those simple criteria.

One of the bright, shining jewels in my games collection, Memoir '44 was a real find for me - without BGG I would never have bought this game. I don't think that the back of the gamebox would have ever sold it to me - if I'd bothered to pick it up - and that is where the magic of the Geek sparkled like fairy dust all over this great game.
This has all the bits, bobs, and pieces that I loved about A&A; a WW2 theme enhanced by great all-round production values; a simple, solid ruleset, modified by terrain, etc; and the BEST set of dice to grace any game since Heroquest.

The scenarios are lop-sided, mostly, but that is all part of the game's charm. I WANT to fight against the odds, rushing my men into machine-gun nests, bring my tanks up to pound the guts out of the town hiding a bleedin' sniper, all the while taking an incredible beating from German artillery. That's how I want my quick-fire WW2 boardgames to play out. If I lose, I just play the scenario again, or swap sides and blast my friends to kingdom come. With a swift game like this, you have the chance to do such things.

BTW, I have always loved card-based mechanics, so their inclusion here is a work of inspired genius, bettered only by its younger sister, BattleLore.
Yes, the game is dependant on good dice-rolling and card drawing/playing. So bally what? War is all about luck, anyhow. Luck and planning. And in M'44, if you plan around what you're dealt, making the most of your options, take a few unlucky licks, you should trundle to victory more times than not. Stop whining, soldier, fight!

I will never turn down a game of this.

A good get-them-into-the-door style of games, especially for those interested in this type of theme.  The variable board seem to provide a good replayability in terms of the vast number of scenarios offered.  The only downside is that since it is card driven, you should be able to perform some kind of action with whatever you draw, but as the way Memoir '44 is conceived, it's way too easy to be screwed by cards that simply have no use to you.  As a result luck rules everything here.

RATING: 8
No, it doesn't have the depth of ASL. But it's a fun game of army men, and there is more to it than moving forward and firing, if only because you might not have the cards to continue the charge.

Just upped my rating to 9. I´ve played it about 80 times in the last year or so and roughly finished all 30 or so official scenarios. We're about to dive into the abundance of fan made scenarios and the game keeps getting better. I pre-ordered the expansion sets and that's a first for me. It is a game that deserves to be played as a campaign.

RATING: 5.5
Like Battle Cry, a light, quick, random wargame, with simple rules and a configurable board, allowing for various scenarios.  Brilliantly, like Nintendo's Advance Wars series, they have scenarios which incrementally teach you the game.

This is currently my big love (as of 12/07/22) and I've gone crazy obtaining all those expensive OOP expansions. All I'm missing is Tigers in the Snow and Hedgerow Hell (and the Campaign Bag) but I think I'll just give those a pass since the Equipment Pack is almost here. Love it to bits. It's simple enough that I can play it with my 7-year-old son and my 61-year-old father (who doesn't game) but still feels compelling and meaningful. Sure, there's a lot of randomness and luck involved but somehow I don't care at all that my ratio of wins to losses is something around 2-12. For a game I suck so badly at I still just can't get enough. Currently getting through the Campaigns in the Campaign book with the Mrs. Can't wait to get started on Overlord and Breakthrough format. We'll see if this earns a 10 or I get bored and lower the score.

Rated this low only because I almost never get to play it. I played a LOT of 40k as a kid and this seemed like a decent, quicker substitute.  I have a few expansion packs but it's hard for me to get this to the table in my game group (setup takes a while and it's only 2 player). If I'm ever in a two player setting, though, we seem to always pick something else.

Very simple game to teach/learn but has a huge replay value due to loads of offical and community made scenarios.  Very high recommendation.

I have this feeling that if I had played Memoir 44 before Commands and Colors I would have liked it a lot more. Since I played it after C&C, however, it feels like a simplified version of the Roman game. There is no battle back, the leaders are conspicuously absent, and the cards feel overpowerful. I’ll likely play this more because the basics are still fun, but given the choice I will nearly always go with C&C: Ancients.

Excellent, simple 2 player light wargame. Good introduction to wargaming and good fun.

Played games with my son, and once with my wife and a fellow BGGer

Doesn't work as well as C&C:A which I play regularly at dinnertime on Vassal with a mate.

Having played C&C:Ancients first I have to say this is more a toy then a game. Lots of plasitc bits but lacking elements in gameplay. Deserves it's spot as intro-wargame but I will most of the time prefer to play Ancients.
The C&C system is definitely a good one and Memoir is a cool beer & bretzel game. If you want a light wargame this is the way to go.

3/15/07 - Man, this game really took a big nose dive on my respect-o-meter.  I played it a bunch when I first got it and thought it was rad.  Then it sat...and sat.  I finally broke it out again after a few years and found it to be aggravatingly unbalanced, scenario-wise, and entirely too simplistic.    There are a lot of 2 player games in the same category that operate on a much higher level - Dungeon Twister for one.

PS: I used to rate this game an 8.

I am the kind of dude who enjoys a complex game provided it's warranted.  I believe Memoir '44 is unqualifyable as complicated but is nevertheless one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played.

RATING: 6
A little too simple for my taste. I suspect to get the full measure of the game's design one has to be willing to buy expansions and copies to get more parts. This was just a little too much for me. The return on investment just was not there.

This is a very clean, exciting version of BANG! with a few minor differences in how hand sizes are controlled, and I like the tactile features like the player boards. Likely I can actually bring this more to the table than the Western theme or even Samurai Sword, because the show and comic are so hot. But that wouldn't be a bad thing in this case.

Basically just a retheming of the original Bang!  Sadly, this game, despite what it says, is not good for 4 players.  Five or more is the only way this game will be playable at all.

 Slightly different team play and fixed player boards. Otherwise very much Bang with some Walking Dead Flavor.

A perfect marriage of theme to game. Bang was meant to be converted to a zombie themed game and the Walking Dead is the perfect way to do that. It's even better because it's the comic book version - not the TV show. Plays exactly like regular Bang, only heavily themed to zombies!

Initial Rating: 4.5 (October 2014)

Bang! The Walking Dead is exactly as the regular Bang! game. It has the same cards and effects, but with different names. I appreciate the new theme from the comics but that’s not enough for me to like the game. I really like hidden roles games, but Bang! is among the worst of the lot for me. 

I’m rating it a bit higher than regular Bang! due to the great theme and art. It can be fun with the right group, but long playtime AND player elimination make for a bad combination. 

You can see my comments of Bang! as they apply also to this edition.

Bottom line, I would play again if requested, but this is not a game I enjoy very much. Many friends enjoy the game though.

While i enjoyed the port from regular Bang! to the Walking Dead IP, I still found the game to be overly complex for what it is, and random in all the wrong places. If I wanted to play a Take That style card game I would rather play [gameid=228].

RATING: 7
Fun game that gets more exciting with more players. Game loses its fun if you get eliminated early.

Lots of wasted opportunities to use the license as a means to shake up the game play. The confusing reskin simply makes the game more confusing to play than the original.

Ironically, the reason I like the Walking Dead version more than the original is that it is a more readable and clearly defined game.  The visual cues are much more understandable.

fun if you are into the walking dead. Bang Halo has replaced this game for me with everyone playing being able to re-spawn instead of being out of the game twiddling their thumbs.

RATING: 6.5
Fun game that is easy to learn for new players. The different roles provide variety, however, I feel the roles aren't exactly balanced. This game includes player elimination and can continue on for a while leaving the ousted players spectating which may not be appreciated, especially in some cases where things go badly and one player is eliminated very early.

RATING: 7
Fun variant of the basic BANG! game. Characters are varied enough to make the game interesting. We play with a house rule: after one game, we leave the characters we used aside, so that we're guaranteed to pick new ones. We always played with the "We are the Walking Dead" expansion (see separate item).

A flaw is that at times there seem to be few real choices to make.

I like bang a lot, so when I heard there was a walking dead bang I had to but it. The game is a little complicated to explain, but doesn't take too long. Once players do understand the game it is a lot of fun. My biggest complaint is that there is player elimination, which I don't typically like, but the game plays fast enough that player elimination doesn't play that big a factor. 1-11-16

18CO

I'd rate this as a 7.  Definitely for advanced 18xx players.

Session report: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1526930/18co-rock-stock-rules-posted/page/8

We played 3 player which probably isn't the best number.  I suspect that this would play better with 4 or 5.  Our 3 player game lasted 11.5 hours, but that included rules explanation, and a lot of note taking.

My notes: I played with Chris and Andy on Saturday.  

My thoughts as a beginning/intermediate player. 

I thought that this was a game that advanced players would enjoy.  It was a little more that I was comfortable with, but with Chris I end up playing a lot of the more complex 18xx games.  Chris is pretty patient with me.

If you’re going to start DSLR, either start it high enough to go before DPR,  or accept  the possibility of a circling track into Denver that cuts you off from the North and East and forces you to go into the expensive mountains.  At the start Denver was surrounded by tight track circling back to Denver.  This lasted a while because only Andy had an interest in pushing the trains to open Durango.

The single impassible hex could be better distinguished.  Values printed on cities should be larger. The stock track makes it harder to keep track of operating order.  The player aid chart needs to be updated and improved.  Maybe a stock track player-aid as a separate sheet because it’s hard to see the values from across the table.  Maybe these are just new player comments, but I had trouble figuring out run order and which companies would operate before me.  Also I’ve seen some 18xx have a separate sheet to track of payouts, to help you remember what companies ran for.  That’s an aid which would have been helpful to me during the stock purchase rounds (I had printed out all the files, brought them with me.  I had the stock track on a single sheet and referred to it frequently.) Think about an easier mechanic to show that merged companies are allowed an extra train, maybe by creating a “+1 train” tile which sits on the charter.  Apparently with us having the second charter underneath was not enough of a reminder as players forgot.

Track is pretty restrictive.  Towards the end, it was more track lays that you couldn’t do than things you could do, mostly because the necessary tiles were already in play.

Might be better with 4.  I was operating less efficiently and had too many things to think about with managing 3 companies.

Durango may be significantly less attractive with 3 as 2 players will passively delay trains to keep it from opening.

I think that Andy got hurt by not opening any of the higher IPO companies with more tokens.   I was hoping to merge UP with DSLR in order to get the tokens and give it better access to the board, but DSLR was running so well on its own, and so expensive that this didn’t happen.  UP was stuck mostly operating into Denver and north of there and building East.  My impression is that there are significant disadvantages to merging unless you have to.

I only won because Chris forgot and didn’t buy a 5D train when he should have.  It was late in the evening.  He was keeping an eye on our play as well as managing his own companies, so he had a lot on his plate.  I shouldn’t have won, but I did feel good when I bought the E train and obsolete both of his 5s.

By opening two companies at the start and purchasing privates I had to keep my share price low which left my companies starved for cash for quite a bit of the game.  I think that if I play again, I may only try opening one. (Probably a newbie mistake.)

I think that I’d need a couple more plays before I developed a feel for how and when to merge companies efficiently.  That’s the key piece of this game that I feel that I don’t have a good feeling for.

The beginning auction didn’t take a significant amount of time and was a mechanic that I was comfortable with.  Andy signaled with strong bids what he wanted to do.  

We went 11:15AM-10:30PM including setup and instruction.  I’d attribute at least two hours to taking notes and posting questions.  I think that the biggest delay is two newer players who don’t have a lot of developed 18xx instincts and who had to consult with Chris quite a bit on optimal play.

Thanks to Chris and Andy for playing and teaching.

13/10/2012 Gluck Auf, from Kramer&Kiesling.  Absolutely delicious mining game.  Worker placement to take actions, scoring by majorities on the delivered materials.  A bit more than one hour, it goes to the level of Tinners' Trail, for example.  I hope they can finally release it.

6/7/2013 Patios de Córdoba.  By Jesús Torres.  Nice game with character selection to get nice flowers for your patio.  It has a bit of memory which is not my favourite.

23/8/2013 Body Party.  Crazy game about trapping cards with your body... and your partner's.

18/8/2015 Vaqueros: Duelos de velocidad colocando cartas.  A mi me pone de los nervios, pero como todos los de velocidad.

20/8/2015 Polaris: Una persecución entre dos submarinos manejados por dos grupos de cuatro personas, cada uno dedicado a una tarea.  Se juega en tiempo real, tiene mucha comunicación y unas dosis de estrés de narices.  Muy original.

20/8/2015 Pandemia España: versión de Pandemia con ciertos cambios.  No puedo con el sueño que tengo y lo dejo, pero parece interesante si te gusta Pandemia.

Played Velocity, by Owen. It's a race game he has created to improve on Formula De. I thought it was okay, it still needs some refinement. 

Played Monster Menagerie by Owen Oliver. It's a set collecting game. You have four actions per turn to collect monsters to fulfill orders, train them or teach them to fight and turn in orders for points. It is a nice blend of action point system, player interaction and resource management. I hope someone picks this up.

"4 - Not so good, it doesn't get me but could be talked into it on occasion." from the ratings guidelines pretty much describes how I feel about playing any unpublished prototype. The art and iconography usually suck real bad in prototypes. For me having good visual cues on or well designed game components is often what makes a good game great, an average game good, or a bad game average. The only reason I would want to go through that is if I have some vested interest or I know the designer and want to help them somehow.

This rating is for an “Unpublished prototype”. Actually, I think it’s not a prototype anymore, it just hasn’t been published yet. But when it does, I’m not going to sleep in front of the FLGS the night before in order to secure my copy… It was waaaay too basic (a deck-thinning game with a cycling theme). Basically, you have two guys with two decks of cards with numbers on them. Each turn you play one of their cards and move that many spots and then remove that card from their decks. The first rider to the finish line wins the game… That’s basically it. There are a few extra rules and twists which make the game slightly more interesting, like being in the front of the race exhaust you so you get bad cards shuffled into your deck, but it’s such a basic game that lasts too long for the depth it offers (or the lack of it). Oh, and the player who was in front of the entire race, and therefore got a ton of bad cards in his deck, actually finished second, so that strategy actually seemed viable, which goes against the grain of the theme.

Made a game which has combined the two things I like
the most in this world. Movies and games. This will 
never get published due to the fact that procurring the
rights to print pictures from all the movies I`ve ever
seen would be outrageous. But since this game is my own
creation nobody can take away the creativity and pure
pleasure I get out of this game. Each player bids for roles in the film making process and tries to make a movie either the fastest or in theme (Horror/Comedy/
Sci-Fi/Action/Drama etc..) To finish the film you have
to complete a plot and sub plot in your movie. There are
random events along with piles of stars/characters/verbs
/props-like -locations/weapons/monsters etc.. Money is
also important to keep the production of your movie going. I can let loose my total creativity and design
expansions non stop. I have over 500 cards made and still going strong. The fun factor is also incredible since we keep pitching our progress to the other players to win the peoples choice award at the end of the game.
The movies can become works of art or total turkeys.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Made a game out of one of the best movies in the world
namely " The Thing " My brothers and sons helped develop
a hidden identity game that we`ve played the most out of my huge collection of games. The reason is that it`s fast
to play and gives you the paranoid feeling that the movie conveys. Who can you trust? Some or none of the players have become Infected by an alien parasite. You have three turns to get equipment before the final showdown. Are you going to stay in your room or will you
risk meeting the others. Everything from the movie is thrown into the mix. Blood tests / explosives / flame throwers / weapons / traps etc.. Thinking of letting
the BGG community partake in this wonderful experience
and have all the cards ready to print&play. Not so good with computers though and do not know how to post this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the best aspects of this hobby of ours is being able to design your own type of game. Just finished prototyping my own "The Cabin in the woods" game and I`m
bubbling over with anticipation over what my brothers will think about it. A bit of this , a bit of that and the pieces just seem to interlock into gaming nirvana.
All geeks should try making their own stuff instead of lazily only consuming other designers work. It might make them appreciate what thought processes go into a game.Films have always inspired my creativity. And as a horror buff I`ve yet to come across such a game that captures this genre well.

Telektonon- The game is called Telektonon and as far as I can tell, is board game primer to some bizarre cult. You use a giant board, turtles, pyramids and a crystal to communicate with Myan gods who were lovers, one which lives here on Earth, and the other on Mars. By communicating with these gods you will reveal prophecies. You must fulfill these prophesies in a set amount of time. If you do so, you (Yes you, the player) will start to learn telepathy. No chit. Not only will you learn telepathy, you are required to use it on other players in the later stages of the "game" As you continue playing, BTW did I mention you play in real time? And by real time I mean 1 day = 1 day (there are even certain days the rules forbid you from playing). Anyways as you progress in your telepathy skills, you will start predicting more and more important prophecy's, which eventually will culminate in allowing you to save the world (yes, the real one, Earth), saving everyone from "false time". If you succeed in saving the world, you win.

IÂ´ve got some unpublished prototypes: ( All in German )
MAFIA: ( the title says it all ), some kind of "Blood Feud in New York", but more made after the Computer Game "Mafia". ( Game has to be improved )

PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN: ( Really, I used this title even before the Movie ). French, Spanish and English Fleets fighting against each other and against Pirates who are trying to capture their merchant ships. Players have to build buildings on their islands to support the fleets. This Game is compared in complexity with "Blackbeard". It uses Event Cards, an interchangeable Gameboard, crew and ship datasheets, supply and a lot more...playing time 2-3 hours. ( Game has to be streamlined )

KNIGHTS & QUESTS: A Game set in a medieval-fantasy world were the player with the most solved quests wins the game. It has knights & quests ( of course ), Villages, Citys, Castles, Heroes, Kings & Queens, Dragons and Skeletons and more. Playing Time 2-3 hours. ( Game seems to be the best for now )

THE CHALLENGE: A Fantasy Boardgame with an interchangeable board and over 50 locations with ever changing possibillities for their inhabitants. ( No Game is really the same ) ( yet unfinished )

3x SPACE GAME: In a very early stage of development. ( A little TI3, a little Civilization and some more )

Wildcatters:
A game about oil. A very good combination of pick- up and deliver and area majority and action points.
Played it 6 times now with the developers. It is a real gamers's game, which plays fluently, has good interaction and posdibility of screwage without totally crushing the players plan.

Problem is that the cpmponents are really nice which makes it hard to find a publisher.

Dance Off from Sedge

Syll-a-bull played at AGE 2007. Fun enough combination trivia/word game where you're trying to remember phrases in a category (movies, body parts, etc) which start with a particular letter-- you put a counter into the middle for each syllable in the phrase. If you can't think of one in a certain amount of time, you take all the counters in the middle and roll the dice, which will change the letter or the category. First out of counters wins. There's also challenges (Bull!) for dubious or repeated responses; loser takes the counters. Nice family style game, easy to handicap by giving younger players more time/less initial counters.

Make no mistake, the perfect game (a true 10!) does exist--if only in potentia. It will be designed by Reiner Knizia. It will have auctions, role selection, and variable player powers; among other beautifully crafted mechanisms. 
It will also have gorgeous, pre-painted plastic miniatures and amazing art.
One day, this game will be released--and my wonder and pleasure shall be so great that my head shall explode. 
[EDIT] Aw, hell, screw it, Reiner's never gonna make my game.

This appears to be a fairly simple "dudes on a map" or risk style game, but set in the world of legend of the five rings, or Rokugan.

Version 0.1: Plays quite well already. Combat appears a bit random, though, and victory conditions have to be reworked. Besides, some tweaks to production/research and troop types are necessary.

Version 0.2: A huge improvement over the previous version, almost all weak points have been addressed. Now even includes space ship miniatures!

Version 1.0: Components now have a nice, although not perfect quality. The game itself is very tense with lots of decisions, but downtime is a huge concern, especially with a larger number of players.

Chris's unnamed skeleton game. Interesting abstract, though the rules of the game as they stand tend to cause very aggressive play. 

Dec. 12, 2011
Chris's abstract, a nearly complete game. T&E scoring, surround areas with piles of chips that split then move. Very confrontational... the turn wait before you can score means your opponent will certainly jump in and spoil your plans before they can pay off fully. A smaller board would increase this interaction and make it even more intense.

Jan. 14, 2012
Another play of the game mentioned last time... The smaller board is definitely better. However, a new movement restriction was added which hurt the game in my humble opinion. Some discussion was had about what should happen during stalemate "captures" and what should happen to resources left on the board at the end.

Dungeon Brawl
Deck builder, with a spatial board element. The theme is fantasy adventurers fighting each other over loot. Each deck is a character class, and they seem to play fairly differently. Characters harm each other with wound cards, like curses in Dominion, making decks less effective over time. I enjoyed it.

Very interesting and fascinating boardgame.
Quite dynamic. The artwork is of high quality and the plane figures are thoroughly made.
I started playing the game when the rules were only under development and the playing field and tokens were hand-made of paper by the game designer.
More than a year passed since then and I still love to play it with my friends as much as other popular games.

There are good and bad prototypes, so I give a 5. They all become better with testings, but they all need a chance! All the "real games" have been prototypes one day, so, playing them is maybe the chance to see the evolution of some serious games. Besides, playing a prototype is also a way to help game designers to realize themselves (a big majority design them for the pleasure and the "aesthetic experience"). It's also a way to play games that are not accessible to others ;). I also think that bad experiences in prototesting just proove that well known game designers are really smart!

The future title "Das tiefe Land" the translation would be "The Deepland". I played it and I liked it. It is a semi-coop, worker placement, board game that is up to 4 players from Feuerland Spiele. It is about the cooprative dike construction and the management of your game plan, similar to Agricola / Caverna / Arler Erde, but it is not a Uwe Rosenberg game.

Prototypes played:
- SpyMaster (8/06) - really liked this.  The rules may have taken a few more minutes than optimal to explain, but the game was good.

- UFO Races (5/10, 8/10, 9/12, 10/12 x3, 10/13, 9/14 x2, 2/15 x2, 5/15) - Part Robo Rally, part 3D Speed Circuit.
- Starship Captain (10/10, 10/10, 1/11 x3, 3/11, 4/11 x2, 6/11) - Cleans up a lot of issues with Attack Sub - set in space
- Dealin' Wheels (8/11) - Used auto dealer game prototype
- Low-Level Criminal Game (8/12) - Card-driven crime game.
- Pole Position (10/12) - Horse-racing / stock market hybrid.
- Phobos (1/13) - space mining, tile laying, area control
- Escape from Pirate Island (1/13) - coop, thematically similar to Forbidden Island
- Rolling for Amusement (1/13) - smart Yahtzee

One of my favourite things about gaming is just learning new games and sussing out the nuances of each one. The thrill of discovery keeps things fresh for me and there is always that hope of coming across another grail. 

Applies to designing and playtesting as well, have about 5 on the go currently and looking forward to getting one closer to a playtest version. Since there are no wargames with low luck that [i]also[/i] fit other certain preferences I think I will focus on this first since I love playing a good wargame but hate dice.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
This is a catch-all entry and not a game, per se.  I give items like this a rating of 1 because they are "not a game."  I rate them when I log plays against them.

I log plays here when there isn't an entry in the BGG database for a game (unless there's a more appropriate place to log it, like "Traditional Card Games").  If the game is subsequently added to the database, I move my logged plays to the game, if the game is published in substantially the same form.  If it has changed significantly, I might leave the logged plays here.

Note: in late 2004 and early 2005 (after I started logging), I had several plays of James Nelli's prototype known as "The God Game" which never got logged.

Note2: I decided in February 2018 to log all Looney Pyramid games to Pyramid Arcade if they didn't have a BGG entry, even if they weren't Arcade games, strictly speaking. I hope this will allow me to better track which pyramid games I have played.

This is where I rate all the games I designed myself or that were designed by friends. I only include finished games. (Yet unpublished, obviously). I created a number of unfinished games or broken games I did not care to fix. Those are not included here. (They include, among others: a weird dungeon crawler, 2 Knights of the Round Table games, a political game, a strategy game somewhat similar to Dungeon Twister, but with a different theme, a game of mystery set in a house haunted by a monster, a Civ game with no direct conflict, etc...

@Egypt Game@
I made this when I was about 10 years old. A conflict game set in Ancient Egypt. Needless to say, it stank immensely.
(Rating: 1)

@Plein Air@
A really shitty hunting & fishing boardgame I made with a friend when I was about 12 years old. It was a bit like a free-form Monopoly, but (even more)broken. It was also extremely long.
(Rating: 2)

@ Famous Movie Game @
Sadly, this ridiculous, yet addictive movie adaptation is probably my best design to date... What it is? It's a secret...
(Rating: 7)

@ The Game of the Great Trickster @
Done in a Parker Brothers' style (or sort of), this one is fun, yet so cruel it earned the nickname: the Game of Hatred. 
(Rating: 5)

@King Arthur Game Number 3@
This one was actually finished, but I only got to play it once. Wasn't so bad, but kind of a War of the Ring rip-off :(
(Rating: 4)

@King Arthur Game Number 4@
A card-driven adventure game, can you believe it? It also has nice components, but I only played once or twice. It's incredible how you can get sick of a game after designing it for weeks.
(Rating: 5)

@The Merchants of Opam Sea@
An economic game, akin to Caylus. My first foray into Euros. It was a success, I'm happy to say :). Strangely, I have only played once. Meh.
(Rating: 7)

@Religions of the World@
A sweep of history game (the basic system is taken from History of the World) that describes the evolution of religions in 12000 years of human history. It's for 3 players only, it plays in 3 hours, and it's very fun.
(Rating: 8)

@The Matter of Britain (aka King Arthur Game 5)@
Well, this time I did it, it seems. A truly fun and thematic game, and one of those I am the most proud of. Needs more playtesting though.
(Rating: 8)

@Starcraft Makeover@
I don't like the Starcraft boardgame. Neither does any of my friend. However, I bought it and it has lots of snazzy bits. So I decided to make another game out of its entrails. And guess what? It's fun. Needs more playtesting.
(Rating: 7)

@The War of the Demons!!!@
Game I made for an RPG campaign. Needs more playtesting.
(Rating: ?)

@Nephilim boardgame@
Another game for an RPG campaign. Sort of a block occult war/conspiracy game.

Designed my first game on monday.

Playtested it the first of november (thursday) with alain.

and it works. 

Scores were 24 and 13

Now i need to get at least 30 minutes of the playing time.  
We took 90 minutes. Instead of 60 minutes. Ideally it should allways play in less than an hour.

There is some stuff in there that I'm really happy about. it is a bit dry though. :)

I have an idea to cut down the playing time and add an extra feature.

With Combat Commander and Conflict of Heroes so recently at hand, I grew the interest on this game more as I dive deeper into WWII tactical level with a dozen of games.  And yet, if this is different enough... 

This is a game of the old VG's Ambush type.  Strong narrative elements with various types of combat missions with men-to-men fight.    I wish the series can continue with the German early units/ divisions.  Heroism and courage should be featured in this type of game.  Potential of the series is huge.

Love Clear for Takeoff so much and actually think that this is one of the most accomplished and deep games I've ever play-tested. The rules are really simple to learn, but it's not so simple to think about the combinations you play and to make well-timed decisions.
What I like most about the game is its harmony in everything both in art and in clear weighted game mechanics. To express through words my feelings about the play I'd say that you feel integrated with the game. Once you learn processes well and start properly taxiing aircrafts on a runway, feel the weather, start understanding that realistic processes - the airfield is becoming alive.
Each play is unic and satisfying, the more you play - the more you appreciate the game.

An interesting "What If?" scenario whereby Quebec proceeds with separating from Canada.  Rule for British, French, and American intervention.  Suffers from under-development and a lot of rule questions which have never been answered.  Due to its limited appeal, it was never picked up by any other publisher and reprinted.  Still, it is the only game that I know of on the subject.

2008: This entry is for a two-player space battle card game I designed in high school and fleshed out in '08. I finished the alpha 0.1 version of the rules on 3/28/08; the first playtest was 3/31/08. It has promise but I don't want to do the amount of work involved to bring it out at the moment, so it's been back-burnered. Two plays in 2008.

2013: This entry is for a trick-taking card game I designed on 5/1/13 and prototyped on 5/3/13. The five years since I last designed a non-RPG-related thing have made a big difference. This one looks like it will be fun, I know my own tastes better, and I feel like I grok what's under the hood and have a better grip on why this will work. I hope I'm right!

First playtest 5/5/13. It has promise.

An interesting prototype for a game about absorbing other creatures, played sometime in the 2000s: Kevin, a smart guy I knew back in Ann Arbor, designed this fun little game about crawling around a board and absorbing the other players' creatures. It was one of my first real contacts with game design as a process, and while I didn't love the game it made an impression. (No logged plays.)

RATING: N/A
The marble game: Two friends and I designed a wargame based on flicking marbles at each other, with different units and playing on a string-bounded field of carpet, as kids. It was a lot of fun, and I wish we'd written down the rules -- over the course of a couple of years, it evolved into a pretty involved game, and I'd love to try it again as an adult...except of course I remember very little about the actual rules.

Rat race by Jeroen Geenen. 7.5 pretty good game that deserves to be published.

Energiespel,provincie Flevoland, 7. Powergrid ideas but simpler. Doubts about replayability.

Fish4Fish, cardgame by Jeroen Geenen. Short filler, not really convinced. Not bad, but nothing special either. 6.25 6/3/2010

Unnamed 2-player game at the Medieval festival in Sisteron. Sticks in a row. Take 1,2,or 3 sticks. The one who takes the last stick loses. Very simple. Rating 4.

Royals and Rebels: prototype that will be released in Jan.16 by Playthisone. Actually a great trick taking game of a hierarchy of royals at the top, then knight and tradesmen, finally the farmers. However, there is one rebelfarmer in the game who can reverse the roles and make the farmers the strongest cards. Great game. Rating 8.

26/9/2015
Half a game of a prototype played during Quined's 10 year party. The American designer was excellent in figure sawing, not so much in game design. Enough said. Rating 4

7/10/2015
Queen's Parade by Jeroen Geenen.
Not a bad effort about building houses in a city. You want the queen to visit as often as possible. The queen visits the city via a different route each time that can be influenced. With your buildings you want to get majorities in the various quarters. Perhaps not quite fluent enough for publication. Rating 6.5

Unnamed proto bij Hans. 7x7 grid, tiles face down. turn a tile or move/hit. only allowed to hit your right side neighbour's tiles. I like the idea, but it is too random in practice.

Dicetto: Yahtzee variant, but more fun and more interactive.

20/3/2016
Missie Vis: set collection and roll and move in a whale's belly. Simple, but some fun for families. Prototype by Judith de Haan, student.

17/9/2016

Oporto is a trading game at it's heart.  But there's so many choices to make and so many mechanism that everybody will find it's count.

At first, the rules are daunting, but the game is so well intertwine that it all makes sense.

Beautiful board too for a prototype.  Martin is a real detail afficionado.  Good job!

I suspect, based on the comments of the publisher (something about locking the designer in a room for a week to get the game) that this is a publication (or toy) looking for a game. . . . everybody WANTS to see a PIRATES! boardgame (that is at LEAST as fun as the computer game), but . . . you don't get a game out of something just because you want it.

At least not a good one.

I will not be an early adopter in this case. . .  .and I have actually bought games from Eagle just because of their production/toy value. . .

RATING: 8.5
*Robot League*: 2 to 8 players.  Best with at least 4 players.  Players each build their own robots with different parts and send them into a factory to do various jobs and sabotage each other.  Complicating this is the fact that you have to program your robot in advance, and your opponents may interfere with your plans.  Earn money to supe up your robot for future games.  Also, the board and robot pieces are built out of Lego bricks!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
*Rabbits!*  3-5 players. A card game where players control a team of rabbits, who are trying to get carrots from a garden.  Carrots are worth different amounts of points, and the player with the most points at the end wins.  Rabbits can acquire carrots from the garden, raid each others' warrens, beat each other up, and breed new team-mates.  
Each rabbit is based on either a "famous" fictional rabbit, or a real rabbit, and each has a unique special ability, as well as skills and a defense rating.  Examples of rabbits are Bugs Bunny, Thumper, Rocko and Fiver.  
Players must queue the next two actions the rabbit is going to take, and they have only so many cards, so the more rabbits a player has, the more varied he will have to make their actions.  
There is also a shell game aspect to the game, where players wonder who has the magic 10 point carrot.
I have also made an expansion for Rabbits! called Super Rabbits! which gives each rabbit a special action, and also includes some more complicated extra action cards.  I've never tried it out, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
*Dungeon Tiles*. 2 or 3 players, so far.  In Dungeon Tiles, each player controls a team of heroes or monsters trying to get treasure and kill each other.  The game uses tiles to build the dungeon, cardboard counters for characters and cards for monsters, traps, special maneuvers, treasure and weapons.  The game uses no dice.  The major twist in this game is that players are mostly not in control of their characters.  Once they place a character in the dungeon, the character will follow a program, acting in a predictable way.  Instead of controlling the character, the players try to create the dungeon in such a way as to ensure their characters get the treasures and their opponents get ambushed, outmatched, or killed in traps.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
*MUSCLE*.  2 players and up.  This is a fighting game using toys from my childhood.  I invented this when I was twelve years old, but did a total overhaul in my adult life.  The new system lets you create your own fighter who becomes more powerful if it can win battles against others.  Battles are chaotic, with loads of crazy abilities, characters flying all over, weapons, different arenas, comboes, fatalities, reality-warping mana bursts, secret characters, etc.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
2 players, one of which must be me.  *Go Figure!*  This was fairly popular with my friends at some point, but I haven't been pushing it lately.  It's like a King's Quest type "adventure game", played on paper.  The other player controls their character and describes to me what they are going to try to do.  So far there is only one level, but it is very deep, and there is a rating system, so players can try to beat the high scores listed on there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
2-4 players, more players possible with more decks. *Packrats*  Unfortunately, this is stuck in a development black hole.  It is a fun, quick, light card game where players assemble contraptions out of junk cards.  It is loosely based on Rummy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
2-4 players. *Sleepwalkers*  A card game I invented with Bonnie's help, sort of a version 2 of The Ever-Changing Board Game.  Players are exploring the Dream World, looking for Artifacts.  They can play dream cards to build their own domain to build their own power and hamper their opponents.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
1 player (plus me), about 20 minutes.  *Life on Hold*  A silly, quick game where you simulate a person's life from the age of 18 until they die or retire.  I might revisit this game to bring to Folk Fest.  Having found this in my storage locker, it would actually be kind of fun to try it out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
*Awesome Quest!* 2+ players.  This game uses a subset of the cards from my 1000 Blank White Cards deck.  Like a CCG, each player creates their own deck of cards.  This deck is used to collect the most awesome collection of "Things", give negative things to your opponent(s) and use action cards to generally mess with the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
2+ players (?), 15 minutes+.  *Underdog*.  Similar to a traditional card game, players play cards to build their score, and get bonus points for specific sets of cards.  The twist is the player who is in last place can veto the first card an opponent tries to play, making them play a second card instead.  Has been tested with up to 5 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
^Daimyo.* 1-4 players (or more?). 1.5-2 hours. Cooperative deckbuilding game where players are retainers to a Daimyo in Edo era Japan. This game is still pretty early in its development, but people are enjoying it quite a bit, so I figured it was safe to add to the "collection." It's very swingy and I haven't decided the best way to fix it.

Emprise! This isn't my game, and it is a published game. It just doesn't have a BGG entry (yet). 2-5 players, 10-30 min. A light card game with interesting tension, but a fair amount of luck.

RATING: 7.25
*Don't Whiz on the Electric Fence* 2-4 players. Based on a game shown on the Ren and Stimpy Show, the object is not to whiz on the electric fence. It's pretty silly, obviously, and plays with a Russian Roulette feel to it.

RATING: 8
*Conundrums* 2-8 players. A combination game, icebreaker and tool of self-discovery. Would you rather become 5 years younger, or have the ability to fly? Would you take $50,000 if it meant that 100 random people would die? If you had to choose between the oldest tree in the world dying or time travelers killing Ghandi, which would you choose?

I had the wonderful opportunity to play test this game back in May/June 2014. It won PolyPrize at my local gaming convention and I bought the play test version that was submitted. 

I really do love NY1901. Every time I play NY1901 I have so much fun. The different bonus cards and special street cards give a different environment each time I play and that makes the game more enjoyable. The art is so beautiful and the bright colors make the board pop!

There's nothing about this game that I don't like! The amount of time to play is reasonable, the mechanics are great and it's a joy to play. I hope everyone can get a chance to play this amazing game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Reality TV show based game.  I like the cards, and the "story" lines that would emerge as people played random cards with facts about the players (For example, the first card might be "Revealed a sex scandal about another contestent", the second might be "Caught with farm animal" . . . etc.

The theme of ratings and challenges for the "immunity" stick also worked well.  With a more complex scoring system, this one will be a winner.

Another prototype, Straw.  A card game where player place "weight" on a cammel's back until it breaks.  I like this one a lot, and hope that it does well.  The light gameplay was great, and the game seemed to have a hand management, then tactical phase where you avoid breaking the back.  I'd play this one again anytime.

Really fun gateway game but still offers lots of strategic choices for the seasoned gamer. Reminds me a lot of Lords of Vegas which is one of my all time favorite games. My 9-year-old son enjoyed the building aspect while my wife and I enjoyed the friendly competition. It truly is a game that can be enjoyed by the whole family. I would agree with most that say it is one step up from Ticket to Ride (in a good way!). Looking forward to getting this game when it is officially published. I have every confidence someone will pick it up. It's too good to sit in prototype form forever. :)

RATING: 7
Played a playtest copy. This is really interesting as a "step up" from Ticket to Ride and similar fare. You're still basically drafting and playing to the board on your turn, but there are a few more ways to score points, which boil down to tension between immediate point grabs and long-term building goals. Claiming the areas and fitting your Tetris buildings onto them reminds me of the only good part of Vegas Showdown, the casino layouts.

It's medium-high on the confrontation scale, which is a good thing, but the game does limit you from just claiming territories out of spite, as you have a limited number of claims before you need to actually start building. A few rough edges, but I'll chalk them up to its being a prototype. Definitely recommended as a light-medium area control game.

More accessible then his other prototype as the game is easier to see. The option of changing walls and lines adds a lot to the game. This is not simply a race, but you have to think it through to get the optimal placement. Having you lines used for more then one connection is optimal.

RATING: 6
A little too much going on that makes it hard to plan and you hope for the best. However, Ray is still testing out some options, such as the hidden cards, change of trick leader and cards played at the top. Huge brain drain, but not in a bad way and with some tweaks has a lot of potential since the playing of cards into precreated tricks is a very interesting concept.

RATING: 7.5
A game of exploration and battle. Explore either earth or a new nation and fight to be the most populous and wealthy. you also need to ensure that your political alignment gives you the best benefit. Based on your population size, you get to select which set of actions you want to do first, but selecting the best resource pile and at the end of each era, you gain bonus points that add to your population size for your final score. Great production value and the mechanics are original. The game flows well, although it may be a little long, there is little down time and it does not drag.

Try to win tricks that match the cards on the mat to make the largest connected area. There are spacial powers and a dummy hand which is controlled by one of the players.

Based on one play: A nice concept of buy and sell, which you have a future market and you can even short sell goods in the hope that the price will fall. A great premise, but there is something off as the volatility at the start is almost non existent and it is very hard to have any control over making money. A few refinements needed but well on its way.

Rail Baron Express (working title)
1 play
Designer: Joe Huber
An attempt to polish Rail Baron so there is less tedium and a faster end game. A good attempt that still needs development (IMHO) as one is out of the game with another 40 minutes to go so it should culminate more quickly once all the railroads are acquired (perhaps a much steeper price after the deck is once through).

Undisclosed card game
1 play
Designer: Alan Moon
Playtesters: Ron, Scott, Alan, Jim
Fun; suggested color coding some of the card info for easier planning

Kingdoms (working title)
4 plays
Designer: Ron
Playtesters: Rob, Jack, Meg, Matt, Jim, Don
Session 1-5: solo 12 provinces, 3 nobles, 2 armies, 1 bishop per family
Session 6,7: four player; clarify border provinces
Session 8: add peasants for 16 provinces; add kingdom markers
Session 9-10: add advanced kingdoms, advanced province build
Session 11: add advanced play of all six family members to same set of provinces (up to 4/province); add markers for all scoring (kingdom, control, loyalty - trade token for raids)
Sufficiently developed to warrant color coded cards for next round of playtesting

Undisclosed dice/board game
1 play
Designer: Alan Moon
Playtesters: Ron, Ralph, Ken, Alan
Even lighter than TTR; Dice make things somewhat random at first but rules limit the amount of luck (reroll and point saving); routes become very competitive as the game progresses; game plays very very fast.

Played a playtest copy. Fills the same slot at ticket to Ride although it is a tad bit more advanced. This game is a solid 7 for me but only because its a "gateway game" and I'm into more advanced medium to heavy euros. 3 Years ago when I first started getting into board games this would have been a 9/10. Which is fine. Im not 100% the games target market. One thing I can say is this game is fun, played it a few time before the listing got put on BBG. Remained fun, something TTR does not do.

Matt's Gamblor - (6.25).  (2 play)  (Interesting game-theoretic idea, but a little long and a bit too pure.)

Peter's OoM - (5.5).  (4 plays)  (A TI3-like game without the fluff or theme.  It's still a massive work-in-progress.)

Dave's OT - (4.0).  (1 play)  (This is a broken blend of Conspiracy and Clans.  Too random, and not much fun.).

1xBerg's _Archon_ [Unplayably bad in this early draft.  Bad enough, in fact, that the game that might have been present wasn't obvious either from reading the rules, or discussing "what might have been meant."  A sloppy waste of my time.]

1x_Spectrum_ [In this draft: a harmless but imperfectly compelling abstract.  Has potential.]

1x_as-yet-unnamed card game_ [Hey!  Daughter #1 is the designer:  what's not to like?  Actually, the game is pretty cool.]

1x_Nieuw Amsterdam Expansion_ [Prototype.  I expect it'll change, but details are inappropriate.]

1x_Un-named Greek God-themed Cardgame_ [Son #2 designed it as a class project.  He's spun something quite thematic, but inspired by _Greedy Kingdoms_.  Hope the teacher treats it sensibly, or I'll be surly.]

1x_Museum Heist_ [A bit too longer for its fillery ambitions.  It has potential, I think; but there's still some tuning to go.]

1x_New Frontiers_ [Really enjoyed it:  absolutely top shelf stuff.  Interesting decisions; nice presentation (even in prototype form); one I'd buy in a heartbeat.]

1x(Secret Project) [Cool.  A bit unexpectedly: it takes an element I was dubious about, and makes something quite clever from it.  Working from a frame I enjoy no doubt helped, but I'm optimistic here.]

1x(Secret Project) [Very engaging.  It's a 2p game; which isn't necessarily in my sweet spot; but this one is very interesting, and plausibly has a bunch of replayability.]

1x(Ting's Project) [Has potential.  I think it's not quite there yet - in that it's still possibly in the "more at the mercy of randomness than it wants" zone.]

4x[Jon's Trick-Taker] [Amusing.  But not yet compelling, I think.  It's missing some mojo, and I don't (yet?) know what that is.]

I took part in a playtesting of a game about a Museum.  In it, visitors come in and try to steal art pieces.  Some of them even hide and strike at night.  I liked the game a lot, nevertheless there is still some work to be done.  I believe version 2.0 will be outstanding.

[i]Caballeros y Tesoros[/i] is a web published game by [url=http://www.labsk.net/]BSK[/url]'s [url=http://www.labsk.net/index.php?action=profile;u=1621]verarua[/url] that you can find [url=http://www.labsk.net/index.php?topic=14891.0]here[/url] and [url=http://www.labsk.net/index.php?topic=15128.0]here[/url].  It is a light dice game in which players try to steal the treasures hidden in their rival's castles while destroying them.  To do so, they will have to recruit knights, construct catapults, earn money in the market and, of course, fight against the other players.  The player with the most treasures at the end wins the game.  Not a bad game if played with the right attitude.

I got to play this game at Metatopia 2016 and boy was I impressed.  It was by far the best board game I played in the entire convention.

It is a Sengoku era mash up of a Risk style game with Monopoly and Card game elements.  It sounds like such a chaotic mix of games, but it all meshes together brilliantly.  Unlike risk, there are advantages to the various territories which makes for some further planning.  

The "Monopoly" board type is really unique.  They are movable Tatami themed sections with three landing spots on each section.  With the cards, if you play a Monk card, you get to swap two of the sections on the map.

The card section is mostly used for combat, but there are some unique cards that can allow you to do some neat things like the previously mentioned Monk card.  The best card is the Emperor card that lets you cheat and have more cards in your hand.

The artwork is great and the prototype was very high quality.  I am looking forward to this game over all others and cannot wait until the kickstarter.  When we played this at Metatopia, all 4 of us who playtested told the creator we would have bought it off him if he had it for sale that day.

What really stood out in the playtest is that there was no one way to play it.  You can move around the "monopoly" sections, you can just use cards, you can horde money.  Everything is balanced so well that it all just works.

I advise everyone to check it out, its a great game!

1) Hex on the Beach -- a very light card game about making drinks.  Needs some major tweaking as there just weren't many decisions in it at all.  2) B-57 Cooperative Realtime Game -- a fast, realtime card game where you have forward and rear gunners playing cards to take out planes.  Creative ideas and it reminded me a bit of Wok Star.  Perhaps a bit monotonous but it's so quick that wouldn't matter.

I am giving this an 8 and not just because my buddy designed it.  In its current form it is a quick and fun little gladiatorial style Mech fighting game.  Love how the cards act as the weapons and armor for the Mech and can get blown off when these areas get targeted.  I am definitely interested in more plays as this continues to go through playtesting.

Players manage a hand-of-dice as they try to maneuver their pawns into the best seats on the school bus. That's right, everyone wants to sit in the back of the bus (where the seats are worth more points).  Collect goodies from under the seats which you can hold onto for points or use to enhance your movement.

Small dice games are not my thing at all but the concept is interesting.

Greek Mythology Dexterity Game(?) x 1
As card dexterity games go I think the designer could be on to a winner. I'm not the target audience by any stretch but the mix of special powers and locations seemed good and the scores ended up far more balanced than I expected. 
My primary concern is with the 'need' for someone to run the game in terms of which abilities trigger, who still has 'throws' left during another players turn and which cards are overlapping. Clumsy fingers could result in many many arguments as the cards get ever so slightly shifted.

The rating refers to my general interest in playing prototypes rather than any of the games below!

Adam's new game; Invocation.

A quicker Alien Frontiers type dice game, but you use pieces (cultists) to select what you'll try and buy and then roll to see if you 'afford' them. Holding back extra cultists allows you to add 2 to a die.

Clever, quick, very little down-time, a great premise.

Adams' second prototype; Prague

This one didn't do it for me. I dislike all of the text on cards and having to be constantly looking at what everyone else had in front of them. The roles changed hands so quickly, there was little point in planning ahead. Not really for me.

Update: So many prototypes, there's no keeping track anymore!

I played this yesterday and enjoyed the drafting mechanic. The game seems to be a bit clunky but if polished more can be a very interesting one. Loads of unique aspects to it!

Played Triassic Terror by Peter Hawes at CanCon 27 January 2012. Enjoyable, moderately heavy and potentially deep, area control Euro with a great theme.

Played Minions by a first-time designer from Newcastle at CanCon 29 January 2012. Enjoyable little abstract strategy game with good potential. It seemed a labour of love he was more interested in making  copy by copy than considering trying to get a publisher on board. He hadn't heard of Kickstarter and was hesitant at checking it out.

Played Monstrous at CanCon on 27 January 2014. A fun card-tossing game that manages to be rather thematic. Watching out for the kickstarter.

Dice Factory/Roll for the Galaxy, by Luke H: 9. Strangely enough, it's less luck-based for the most part despite the introduction of a ton of dice. The innovation chart is definitely cool and the many routes to victory are well-balanced.

Space Junk, by me: 8. A nice little puzzlish game using  Galaxy Trucker pieces. I'm sure some more tweaking is in order, but so far I think it's nice.

Beeline, by me: 7. A recent rebalancing made this a lot more fun. Took out the strongest and weakest cards (now the strongest is worth about twice the weakest) and blocked the corners and center. Simple changes improved it a ton.

CMU Chrononauts, by me, Keith B, Ian L, and Alan V: 6. A decent alternate timeline based on regular Chrononauts, tailor made for our school. Brings back some bad memories, though.

I tried playing a couple of unpublished games for a local game designer... the process was interesting.  The first game was fair, but boring, the art and theme were a turn off.  The second game was broken... with limited time to game I don't think I'll be playing any more unpublished games, I prefer a game that is more likely to be thematic, fun, and thought through.

Obviously not every prototype is a 10, but I love playing a game with my designer hat on, trying to figure out what works and what doesn't, and how to improve it.  For me, it's a lot like the process of refactoring a language design (my research).  As with languages, coming up with an initial idea/set of rules is tough for me, but shaping an initial idea into something elegant and cool is where I excel.

[COLOR=#0000FF][b]Commentaires Personnel:[/b][/COLOR] Ce jeu consiste à ce que lors d'une réunion, chacun apporte un nombre prédéterminer de cadeau(x). On place les noms de chacun dans un bocal (1 fois pour chaque cadeau). Puis on tire un nom... la personne nommé va déballer un cadeau. Ensuite un deuxième nom est tiré, cette personne à le droit de déballer un cadeau ou encore d'aller voler un (des) cadeau déjà déballé. Ainsi de suite jusqu'à ce que tout les cadeaux sont distribués. Note: lorsqu'une personne se fait voler un cadeau on remet un billet à son nom dans le bocal.

J'ai été totalement surpris de voir un jeu aussi bien fignolé, ainsi qu'une exactitude historique bien étudié. Ce jeu en est rendu aux deniers ajustements avant impression; l'auteur ne veut simplement pas être pris au dépourvu avec des combos inattendus qui pourrais éventuellement ressortir du jeu pour en faire un jeu ordinaire. L'auteur, [b]Marco Poutré[/b], à fait un travail exemplaire avec ce jeu que j'aurais toujours plaisir à jouer.

[COLOR=#FF0000][b]Comments:[/b][/COLOR]  I was expecting a hard to learn game, and something that needs tuning-up. I was totally floored by the accuracy of the game and all the fine tunning. This game is ready to be printed, the only thing is, the author wants to make sure nothing can pop out of this well tuned game, as unexpected combo, or glitch that makes the game just a regular one. Marco did an amazing job on this game, and I'll be glad to buy his game.

So far I played

[b]Refugium[/b] (Draco) - evolution game that made me laugh twice. Still some mechanics and rules need to be changed to make gameplay more smooth 
-- edit horribly fiddly game. Rules are too complicated, lots of cubes on a little space. Hated it yesterday when I played it - 5
[b]Warszawskie Dzieci[/b] (Filippos) - great mid-light eurogame, that reminds me of Thurn und Taxis - 8 - published as Mali Powstańcy by Egmont - http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/52568
[b]Pret-a-porter[/b] (ja_n) - downtime is a big issue for me here - 6 Reworker by Ignacy Trzewiczek
-- edit --
After few changes it's getting better and better. No downtime, quick gameplay with same depth. Only bidding seems a little bit off: 7/10 PUBLISHED but as a completely differend game :/
[b]Battlestar Galactica: the Card Game[/b] (Filippos) - great cardgame - 7
[b]Gildia Złodziei[/b] (Filippos) - broken ;P
[b]Psy (Draco)[/b] - nice kids game. Plays fast, maybe not so good for 6 plaers. - 6
[b]Basilica (Stalker)[/b] - great 2-player territory-control-puzzle-logic game. - 7 PUBLISHED!
[b]Scrapoco[/b] (Filippos) - word game... I hate word games. Broken for now. edit: fixed and PUBLISHED with gorgeos graphics as SłowoStwory
[b]Through the Europe[/b] (Filippos) - tight pick-up&deliver game in 60-90 minutes. Quite nice - 7
[b]Krzyżacy[/b] - it's nothing new, but it plays quickly, there're some decisions. It's not innovative in any way but I still find it interesting to play (as it's very fast): 7 PUBLISHED as Na Grunwald!
[b]Lodołamacz[/b] (ja_n) - cooperative game with a traitor. Not my cup of tea but can work. 6/10
[b]Rozbicie[/b] (Witek) - area influence semi-wargame about history of Poland. Nice ideas, some of them need to be refactored but it's pretty decent game. I don't know if I would like to play longer version (it will have couple of scenarios in different years)
[b]Kolejka[/b] (Karol Madaj) - a game about queues in communistic Poland. Decent game, too chaotic for my taste 
-- edit -- After playing production copy - this chaos represents theme very well. It's not a balanced-you-can-win-till-the-end eurogame. There is a lot of screw your neighbour actions. In a right crowd a very fun experience. PUBLISHED!
[b]Reglamentacja[/b] (Michał Stajszczak) - another game about queues in communistic Poland. Very random, very light game with almost no decisions. It's ok for kids, but the theme won't probably work for them. - 4.5
[b]Czufut Kale[/b] (Draco) - something like a mix of carcassonne with race for the galaxy. A game has some problems. There is a working engine somewhere in this game but requires some changes and a lot of testing
[b]+/-[/b] (Filippos) - abstract game with nice core. Some work to do but so far the gameplay is very interesting (7)

And mine:

[b]Magnum Sal[/b] (with Filippos) - PUBLISHED!!
[b]12 Colonies[/b] - nothing interesting, I'll redesign it in future I hope (abandoned)
[b]Bieszczady[/b] - train game? not really but it's about trains ;) abandoned for now.
[b]World League[/b] - Card game about volleyball. In development. [-]Doesn't work the way I would like it. (abandoned for now)[/-] Second version is something I was thinking about from the beginning. In progress.

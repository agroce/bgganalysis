Dont' really like the gambling portion of Wits and Wagers (poker chips), but I can see how it is necessary.  Our group has a tendency to clump onto the same three answers in a six player game.  The chips make it so that there can be a decisive winner.  Hits my meh scale.  Not my favorite, but also not hated.

Northstar keeps making Wits & Wagers better, and this is my favorite by far.  Some will not like the loss of the odds table that is included on the board of the original game, but I like the simplification of the scoring.  I'm not particularly enthusiastic about the artwork in this version, but it is kind of funny sticking certain players with the little old lady or the bride.  I think this is the most popular version of the game I've ever taught to others, and with the simpler scoring I don't have to be the bank all the time.  I highly recommend this version to party gamers, however if you're more of a gamer looking for a strategic party game, stick with the original.

Wits and Wagers (whichever version you may have) is a great trivia game, because knowing answers will give you points, but you can win just by consistently betting on other peoples correct answers. All questions have a numerical value that most would not know exactly. Everyone guesses and puts their answer in the middle, then everyone can bet on which answer they think is correct. 

The party edition simplifies and streamlines the betting aspect so as to speed teaching. Works well individually or in teams and is great for large groups especially.

I like the normal version of wits & wagers a little better I think, but this oen is easy enough to just pick up and go. I do like the components a little better in this version though! The markers w/ the erasers on them are nice and the poker chips are much better. W&W is a great game to play with the family and it is my favorite trivia type of game ever!

I really appreciate Dominic hosting the contest and providing the game (and for signing my copy!)

I got this game to play with the Tracy family at Thanksgiving. At first they were a little iffy on how the rules went, but after a round or two everyone was really getting into it. The best part is it's specific numerical trivia and we play it so infrequently that we will probably be able to keep reusing the cards since no one will remember the exact answers. It's a good game for familys and laughs and I'm definitely keeping it around.

A streamlined version of the original article: the betting is a little less interesting because there's no odds other than the single "all answers too high" paying 2:1, but the answer boards make up the betting layout, the game comes with nice chips instead of the plastic ones.

Points off for fewer questions overall and only two questions per card, but it's such a great game you won't care. Highly recommended.

This game quickly became one of my family's favorite games. The fact that you don't have to know the exact answer and that you can bet on someone else's answer lets everyone play and have a chance of winning. All answers are numbers - dates, length, weight, total, time, etc.

I love how two people have already rated this game, although it is not yet available. I don't think either of these people were testers either...  weird.  


--- Update ---
I decided to geek mail Etienne Lessard to figure out when he played.  

[username=pentadude]
It turns out he hasn't played yet!  But he has played the original W&W, and then he watched Tom Vasel's review.  I let him know that Tom Vasel got one of the rules wrong, but I don't think that changed his opinion of the game.  It's a 3.7, which means he "likely won't play again although he could be convinced."

A trivia game my six-year-old beat us at by making very savvy bets, despite not having much of a clue about his own answers. To me that's a good thing, but it makes me feel dishonest if I describe it as a trivia game. It's really a betting (and trivia) game, only that doesn't sound fun to most people I know. And that's too bad, because it's good, light fun. Also, the art in my edition is atrocious, but the player-specific chips are nice and chunky.

My comments on the original:

Great idea for a game and well executed. Components are cheap and flimsy and a decade on, some of the questions have become a bit dated. Accommodates large numbers of players quite well, and works great in teams. Easily the best trivia game ever, and one of my favorite party games. Main drawback here is the no-limit betting, which can get exponentially out of control by the end, especially if a question comes up that a player is relatively certain of the answer to. 

Wits and Wagers Party attempts to solve that last concern, with some degree of success by limiting the chip betting to only the last round. While this does solve the out-of-control amounts that can occur in the original game, it also means that the final round in Party is much more important than any other round. It's only a very slight improvement for that reason.

I'm not a social gamer, and I don't enjoy 99% of party games because of it, but this is probably one of the best trivia games in existence since it mitigates the uncontested-skill(memorization of mostly useless facts) aspect of all the other standard trivia games. Adding a gambling mechanism may heighten the drama for some, but I don't enjoy betting/wagering games much either.

RATING: 5.8
The original Wits & Wagers is one of my favorite trivia games, I rate it 7.8 (which is a lot for me for a trivia game).  The Party version I just found "meh".  In trying to make it more fit for "mass consumption" they have removed two of the three things I found most fun about the original - the differential pay-out curve (I'm fascinated by the "wisdom of the crowds" concept and found this pay-out feature a really clever way to integrate the idea), and being able to make a wager of the amount of your choosing on each turn.  (The third thing I really enjoyed in the original, which does remain in this version, is betting on other people's answers.) I did like the different "characters" and their thematically-tied betting tokens.  But in the end, the original game was intuitive and really did not need any "dumbing down" (or is "streamlining" the more PC term ;-) )

I love trivia games, and I enjoy betting. Combine the two and you have an amazing game. I have not yet played any of the other Wits & Wagers games, but I assume they are similar in nature, and just as good. A player poses a question to each other player. Everyone writes down their guess in numerical form. Responses are sorted in increasing order. Players then have chips to bet on each response, maintaining Price is Right rules. Players then score points based on how many of their chips were on the correct answer /if they had the correct answer themselves. Ultimately everything concludes in a Final Jeopardy where all chips can be bet. The game takes two of my favorite childhood game shows and combines them together. The only problem I see with this game is replay-ability as certain cards can easily become memorized after several plays.

Good implementation of Wits & Wagers.  The artwork is fun.  However, the gamer in me misses the board with the different wager amounts and the ability to bet chips every round.

A fun lite game that's super easy to learn.  We played this with a group of 6 people which worked really well.  The interesting thing is, each game played differently with the outcome.  The first game I was obviously winning, but due to the all out betting at the end I lost my butt and a guy who had one coin throughout the entire game ended up winning.  The second game we had two people with massive stacks of coins.  The third was decided on the next to last wager.

This version is better if you are playing with only 3-4 players. The reason is that you are paid 1:1 on most of the betting options. In the standard game, you get paid at higher odds (anywhere from 2:1 to 6:1) and it is to easy to end up with a runaway leader at low player counts. With 6-7 players the standard game is superior.

A simplified version of the game for those who don't like to gamble. More than anything, it's a bunch of new questions!

Not a bad party game- in fact, I like it better than most. I'm evidently alone in that regard, however, as the exclusively number-based answers are a turn-off to many I know.

I'll admit, this is on purely because of Wil Wheaton. Would be a good game to open on Christmas day though in front of family (who are not averse to the odd board game - we play Settlers, not Monopoly, every year)

Probably my favorite party game at this point. I enjoy trivia games, but this one actually rewards you for being close without necessarily being exact. Throw in the neat, thought-provoking questions, and this game is always a fun time.

Nuova versione del gioco Wits & Wagers. Questa edizione è stata pubbliata anche in italiano, non cambia molto rispetto al suo predecessore se non la possibilità di giocare fino a 18 giocatori (molto forzata come alternativa). Il gioco è sempre simpatico ma le 250 domande a disposizione mi sembrano un po' poche per poterci fare più di qualche partita. Sarà necessaria sicuramente qualche espansione. Il gioco rimande un ottimo party game semplice e immediato da preferirsi al classico Trivial.

(10+ plays)  This is easily my favorite party game.  All the questions are based on numbers, but knowing the actual answer to the trivia questions is not nearly as important as knowing your opponents.  This version hits nearly the perfect set of rules for this game.  We combined all three versions of Wits & Wagers, plus Say Anything, and grabbed the best components from each, kept all the cards, and discarded the rest - put the remainder in this box with the Say Anything insert.  The 8 player set of Say Anything tokens and boards (so now we can play with ALL of our usual group), plus the bid one from the W&W Family Edition is the perfect component combo.  For me, the best rules are:  7 rounds, two 1 point chips per player, 1 point for correct answer, 1 point for chips on correct answer.  Use Wits & Wagers Party Edition poker chips for points.  Allow bidding only on the 7th round "final jeopardy" question.

Odd questions. Less trivia and more take an educated guess. It works out well for the game, but it gets boring quickly if your group doesn't have a lot of energy.

Guessing the numerical answer to random and usually obscure questions gets old after awhile. The betting wasn't interesting either as it was usually hard to put much confidence in anyone's answer.

Do people really keep buying all these new editions of Wits & Wagers? They're basically the exact same thing with some minor cosmetic changes and a few sentences added to the rulebook. You could literally play any rendition of Wits & Wagers with any single copy. I like the game, but what a lousy marketing scheme.

Bought in excellent condition from Salvation Army.  Didn't like this nearly as much as the regular version.  I like being able to bet the odds and bet chips every round instead of just the last one.  I may keep it to see how the Vegas expansion plays.

We like the scoring better than the original because it doesn't slow down the game after every question to figure payouts. And you don't have a runaway leader problem so everyone has an interest in the game up to the very end.

A lot of people I play party games with are very casual players where the betting aspect of the original game is too much. This version streamlines Wits and Wagers into just guessing an answer and then guessing a close answer from all the guesses. This goes faster, doesn't take a lot of thinking since many of the questions are things like "how many libraries are in the U.S.", and makes it fairer for people that don't know things to just guess someone else's answer.

This is a fun and simple trivia party game that I like to pull out on occasion.  The questions are interesting, and I have actually learned a lot of interesting facts by playing this game.  The best thing about it is that you don't have to know the answers to do well (most people won't know most answers), you just have to estimate well.  I do wish the bidding was a bit more involved, but overall it is a great party game.

This party game is great for everyone even non-gamer types. Betting on answers means that nobody knows the exact answer.

One of the better party games I've played - not my favorite, but part of that might be that I'm mildly allergic to dry erase markers (I didn't even consider earlier versions that didn't have erasers). It's perhaps the easiest game to explain I've ever played that's still fun, and more than that, it's the only party game that comes to mind that's fun and social for a wide age range and people who don't know each other as well, and I think I'll keep it around for that reason.

Probably the better version to play with non-gamers (than regular Wits & Wagers).  No odds or betting to worry about (although you can bet on the final).  Only real downside I see to this game is the dated information (for example, "As of 2011 or 2010 or whenever" when the game is being played in 2017).

I quite like Wits & Wagers, but the casino style betting doesn't always go over well... while the family edition is really best suited for small people.  Party seems to be the perfect combination of family rules and grown up questions for when we're in the mood for W&W!

Trivia Game with a twist. You don't NEED to know the answer to the question. You have a question, you write down your answer and then everyone's answers are reveled and then you bet on which answer you think is closest to being correct without going over! Even if you are not a trivia game buff, you'll enjoy this game.

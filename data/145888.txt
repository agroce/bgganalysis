RANK: 3010

RATING: 8
My rating of 9 is provided in the context that this is brilliantly themed entry level board game, with the high score pertaining to the incredible 2v2 team play variant. As a 2 player or more free for all, this is still great fun and up there with the original DC Deckbuilding Game, but as a team game this is astonishingly good fun. Worth the five Bison Dollars fee.

Average, very average deck builder but with for me a nostalgic theme.  I like the attacks just wish they could have implemented something better than the victory points method they built into it.

1st play: This game uses the same system as the DC deck building game. The system is very simple and easy to play. Seeing the street fighter characters and the signature moves is fun, but the game is very light. Very much a "hang out and play" game.

No 2nd play: This is almost the same game as DC deckbuilder, but with a better theme and slightly more complicated mechanics. When you strip away the IP, there isn't much game left. It's not bad, just hard to earn table-time.

RATING: 10
The first deck-builder I have played, and still one of my favourites. 
The personal marketplace and targeted attacks are gameplay aspects that really stand out for me.

I am a Street Fighter fan, and have yet to play this with anyone who isn't.  Still, I think the game is solid enough mechanically and is not defined by its theme.

RATING: 2
Utterly dreadful. The theme is applied as a thin veneer to some of the most rudimentary deck building mechanics. High level strategy is almost entirely unrepresented. Avoid this game.

Standard "meh" deck builder, but I love the theme! It's nice how a little theme can liven it up. The game was a little long with 3, maybe some of the deck could be culled with less than 5.

Another in the long line of Cryptozoic Entertainment's fill in the blank deck building games, Street Fighter lets you play as many of the iconic characters from the Street Fighter II game like Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, and M. Bison just to name a few. It's like any  ordinary deck building game but I love it mostly due to it being a deck building game based off one of my favorite fighting games of all time. If you like deck builders and Street Fighter I recommend picking this up.

RATING: 6
I'm a little bit of a street fighter geek.  While I am awful at the video games, I do enjoy them, I've got a couple of fightsticks, etc...  I once saw street fighter cologne and considered it, even though I don't wear cologne (I guess I didn't truthfully consider buying it, but I would've if I was 10 years younger and single).  I had played the DC deckbuilder (which uses the same engine as this game) and was non-plussed.  I had some store credit burning a hole in my pocket, so I took a chance on this game.  I like it.  It isn't the greatest thing ever, and I don't see the appeal for people who are unfamiliar with the street fighter franchise, but it worked for me thematically, whereas the DC deckbuilder didn't.

I can feel how my deck represents my fighters repertoire of fighting moves.  Each boss needs to be fought in their arena.  When you win, you get to keep the location.  Each fighter has a unique move, which isn't automatically available to you at the beginning; you need to obtain (learn) it during the course of the game.

(2014 Novembre)
ENFUNDAT (Ref.7041 de MayDay/Homoludicus/Zacatrús)
Another Cryptozoic card game with the Cerberus Engine (like DC DBG and LOTR DBG). 
The mechanics in SF DBG are similar but not the same as in DC DBG (Ultras, attacks and counters, and players can be selective targeted for attacks, Weaknesses work a bit different), so you can't say you are playing the same game with different theme. In SF DBG Power is not so easily collected, getting hands of 8+ Power is quite difficult, what leads to longer games*, which may drag in some groups being a drawback if compared to DC.
*It is a bit harder to pull out combos, but you can, specially if you have cleaned your deck and your buys are coherent.
With 3+ Players, the one on the Lead can be stopped from running away by selectively attacking him. In our first games, the first runaway leader has never won.
I only miss some of the most known attacks in the Street Fighter video-game, like the powerful Shoryuken, which is not present on any card :(.

In DC DBG your Super-Hero has a special ability that may give you a clue or a strategy to start building your deck, but in SF all Heroes are the same (only the Counter/Ultra attack is different and is not that frequently triggered) so you don't have a "starting" strategy to follow, so it takes a while to speed up.

Cerberus engine deckbuilder.  Plays a bit slower than other cerberus engine games with all the additional attack, defend, and counter-attack options.  Plays quick once familiar with each hero's signature cards and counter-attack abilities.  Handles the runaway leader problem the best amongst all of these style of games.

Can get a bit clunky and drag on for quite a while if no one can fight the stages well.

Scoring can also be cumbersome with some of the equipment cards.

Really the main issue is just how long the game can drag out since it can overstay its welcome in a lot of cases.

Rules can be slightly hard to follow when dealing with reacting to attacks and using your ultra and the mechanic where you can "hold" cards to buy on later turns.

Overall while I do enjoy the theme the game just seems to last way too long and the end game scoring is complicated by cards that are worth variable points based on other cards in your deck so you have to look through your deck a couple of times to determine your score.

Another Cerebus game, another theme slapped onto an uninteresting system.  The game is simply buying cards that give you the power (the game's currency) to buy more cards.  Power, power, and power.  Honestly, that's it.

The theme is just pasted on since you have your characters use other character's moves.  I'm sure it makes sense for Zangief to use Guile's Sonic Boom while wearing Chun Li's bracelets in some weird alternative timeline.

I can't believe Capcom gave the license to this game but not Yomi.  Insane.

Another Cerberus engine deck builder designed by Crytozoic, and definitely one of the better ones. As far as new rules go this doesn't flex the rules as much as the Naruto version but the unique character special move card that can be purchased and used to counter attack is a nice idea. Fighting over countries with a random opponent instead of a villain deck is also a cool idea that fits thematically.

I had played the DC deck builder a few months ago and liked it well enough. It was an okay deck builder with a pasted on theme in that Batman can end up hanging around the fortress of Solitude playing Canasta with Kid Flash while fiddling about with Aquaman’s trident. The game play itself was okay but nothing I found myself pining for after playing a couple of time now.

Street fighter is made by the same folk and very much the same thing , down to the formatting of the cards, except for a new ‘attack’ mechanism which was fairly nonplussing. I’m not  a video gamer so can’t say how well it related to the theme, but fellow players who knew something of Street Fighter were distinctly unimpressed.

Not one I’ll beg to play again and definitely not one for purchase.

Video Review - https://youtu.be/aBBDIle1YP8

As a deck building game this works mechanically, and is enjoyable to a point. The problem is that it takes far too long, and thematically it doesn't make a lot of sense. You rarely directly attack the other player which for a street fighter game makes zero sense!


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Taken as a standalone set on its own, I think this is Cryptozoic's best deck building game. There are a bunch more attack cards than in their other games, but this is both thematic and a welcome addition. It's just too bad that we probably won't see any expansion content for the rest of the characters in this universe. Not ever having Mike Haggar as a character in the game makes me pretty sad.

My love for the theme carried me through the first few plays, but it's still got the non-interactive, slippery-slope gameplay as the other Cryptozoic deckbuilders.  Sometimes you play what feels like a really involved combo only to find that it generated a paltry amount of power.

RATING: 7.25
Pretty good game, but possibly a bit too simple.  There may not be enough ways to either draw extra cards on your turn or to thin out your deck.  Also, perhaps I have been spoiled by the complexity and the constant game-created (as opposed to player-created) sense of progression (and suspense) found in Legendary: A Marvel Deck-Building Game.  This is more on par with Dominion, which I own, but have not played in several years.

Edit:  After a couple of games, I was able to use some combos to get more card draws and card "pulls" (i.e., taken from the discard pile) to build more effective attack hands.  I've moved my score up from 6 to a 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Doesn't change the landscape of the Cerberus engine at all, but it's a nice addition that captures the thematic material very well, while still being within the confines of the engine.

People should be aware that this is not a Street Fighter game. But rather a game with a Street Fighter theme.
In fact, you'd be hard pressed to find much connection between theme and the game mechanics.

But if you take it for what it is, a very simple deck building card game with cool artwork. Then it's a pretty decent game.

In my opinion the best Cerberus engine deckbuilder, the aggressive nature of the game and the mechanic that attacks are directed to a certain opponent and not everyone on the table makes a fast game that diminishes the leader runaway problem many of the other Cerberus deckbuilders have.

I think Street Fighter may be my favorite of the "traditional" style of competitive deck builders. I like how quick and easy it is to set up and teach. I like how direct and transparent the deck building is.

I prefer it over the DC Deck Builder for a few of the tweaks that have been made and for kicking up the competitive element with more attack/defense cards.

For competitive deck builders, I think this one is my go-to game.

An interesting game. I like how it plays, though our first game took 2.5 hours. It certainly fills the Deck Builder requirements of my collection.

My two complaints:
-- the text on the cards is too small for my wife to read, so she can't play with us
-- as we saw it, counter-attacking never happened, and ultras are super rare to occur, so I didn't feel like what character we chose really made any difference

Beautiful art, board and components. The game to play when you want to casually hang with people. 
There's a lot of space to be cutthroat if you want (which is cool) but that's not how the game was meant to be played.

I don't think it's a game to play often, but it's perfect a couple of times a year when you get the craving for something visually gorgeous and laid back.

[I]tl;dr - gorgeous, relaxing artwork and a super-slim ruleset, along with a genius movement mechanic, make Tokaido a perfect-10 gateway game for me.[/i]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

First off, Tokaido is gorgeous; secondly, it's peaceful and enjoyable to play; and thirdly, despite a simple appearance there are a lot of decisions to make along the road. 

Players play as travelers along the famous Tokaido road, from Tokyo to Edo. As we progress throughout the game, we stop at souvenir shops, visit temples, enjoy hot springs, meet strange characters, paint beautiful panoramic pictures, and eat delicious meals. Each different experience is a way to earn points and add to your set of cards in front of you. 

I've tried a different specialty each time (temple, panoramas, souvenirs), and have not walked away with a victory every time. It's possible for first-time players to win this game, but there's also a lot of strategy underneath the movements as well. 

I enjoy Tokaido most with 4+ players, when the secondary slots open up. In 3-player, things are very constrained and strategy is even more important. 4-player is great for introducing people to the game. I've not yet tried 2-player.

There's something for everybody in Tokaido, though. Aside from describing the eight ways of earning victory points, this is an incredibly simple game to teach and explain. New players get hooked easily, and it's already become one of my own favorites.

This is a light, non-confrontational game that plays well with four (haven't tried with five). The interaction primarily consists of option denial, but oddly enough, it didn't seem at all mean or nasty. 

It's one of those "relaxing" games. I can't describe it any better than that.

Finally got around to trying this and despite the beautiful art it is pretty meh. Not too much to the game. Simple can be good if there are interesting decisions but the decisions in this game aren't that interesting as they boil down to picking up points and possibly picking up 1 more point than an alternative move. Small optimization can be fun sometimes but in this game it seems that 90% of the time the smart move is simply to move the minimum number spaces you can.

10/8/17 - Relaxing, tranquil, set-collection game. I actually prefer playing the app to playing it in person, because I like how much faster it flows in the app. Rated only a 7 because it's a fairly light game (at least without the expansions), but the many characters do give it good replayability.

RATING: 8
Just one 4 player game of this today. I really enjoyed it and am very pleased I purchased a copy at Essen. it looks lovely and it's a pleasurable stroll across the board. Lots of tactical decisions but we will need more plays obviously to get a feel for which decisions are important. My only clear complaint is that the depth of the box could have been half of what it is - an annoying trait for those of us who really haven't got much room left at home to store our boardgames! So, highly recommended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
This is the only game that I can think of off the top of my head that I actively dislike and will refuse to play. For my kind of brain, it's hugely frustrating. You are expected to make decisions so I keep trying to calculate and optimize but there's no point - there are points for everything and tonnes of luck. Then, why make decisions at all? ...and yet the game still seems to want you to. I feel unwell when I play this game.

RATING: 6
*Rating based on one play.

This is a very light, quick-playing game that is short enough not to overstay its welcome.  It feels a bit like Candyland for adults, but rather than moving ahead a random amount, the players get to choose how far ahead they want to go.  It's a clever idea and is well executed, but has some drawbacks that I think keep it from being much more than a decent game.

First, the fixed nature of the board seems like it would restrict replayability.  The different roles and random card draws might help mitigate the sameness between games, but I don't see this as a game I would want to play more than a few times.

Second, the board and component design leave something to be desired.  The board itself seems very sparse in appearance.  The spots on the board are very small and the various icons for the different actions are too similar to be easily distinguished.  There were lots of instances where players had to ask what a particular icon did.  There is a lot of white space on the board that makes it feel more like a prototype than a finished product.  And the score tokens are tiny!  We're talking about the size of pills.  These are seriously a swallowing hazard for children (though, on the plus side, they would probably go through quite easily without doing any harm) and would be very easy to lose.  The scoring track has a staggered layout that likely makes scoring errors very easy to make.

Finally, the last thing holding the game back for me is more subjective, and that is the theme.  I'm not much interested in Japanese culture, so the theme was quite "meh" for me.  However, my friend who owned the game is quite a Japanophile and seemed to really enjoy the theme, so take that for what you will.

All in all, the game plays quick and is interesting enough to be worth a few plays, but I don't expect it to hit the table all that often.  It's a decent filler, but not one of my favorites.

RATING: 7.5
Beautiful art design on the board, cards and pieces. People who appreciate aesthetics will be immediately drawn to the game to explore what it represents. 

Gameplay is incredibly light and mellow, but lengthy for as simple as it truly is. Great gateway game as the decisions and strategy are simple and few, but there's a very light layer of them to keep this from being ultimately mindless. For instance, if you're trying to collect a full panorama or the most hot spring cards, you have to choose jumping straight to those locations based on how many more stops are in the future, and risk bypassing other things you can collect. You also gamble if a spot further down the road will be available when it's your turn again, or if another player will have camped it out and forced you to bypass it. 

Plus, with the variety of ways to earn points for your final score, the winner isn't always immediately obvious, which can make for a fun surprise. That said, people looking for something deeper may find this too simple and therefore boring.

Something that's a great compliment to the game is I played it with an American friend who lived in Japan for three years as well as someone born and raised there who moved here in his twenties just six months ago. Both of them loved the contents of the game, and the native Japanese guy was delighted to see all the clothing, food and uses of Japanese language. Several times he said it made him nostalgic and maybe a bit homesick! 

Positives
- Beautiful art and graphic design
- Multiple ways to get points
- Easy to teach and play

Negatives
- Almost a little too light
- Takes a lot of time for as light as it is

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I've heard so many good things about this game, about how it is "zen" and how it doesn't steal the focus from the conversation. In my first play, I don't know if Tokaido accomplished any of those things for me.

It's a cute set collection game with a very beautiful graphic presentation, but it's not my style of game. It's way too light for me. I guess the reason why people say this game allows for conversation is that the choices are so straight forward. In that case though you need the right group of people to play it, because this atmosphere breaks down as soon as there's a person who doesn't partake in it and looks like waiting for his/her turn. I guess that I would rather just have a conversation instead.

Therefore Tokaido is not a game for me. It is simply too light for my taste.

RATING: 6.5
It is not a bad game, another worker placement to play only one way line, like Egizia or Francis Drake. The difference here is the play order, that I didn't liked very much. It seems difficult to get out of a vicious cicle since you cannot go to far away from the ones behind because if so, you would not play for a while.

In egizia and Francis drake we have a different kind of approach that I like more, because the play order is fixed for the round and the only one way worker placement needs to prioritize the best places abdicting the first places and not the best positioned vicious cicle route.

Despite of this, I enjoyed the playtime and the rules are very simple, so good for teaching, but Bauza have other better games of his signature.

The minimalist art here is very beautiful.

Tokaido has a pile of cards and a line of action spaces you land on to... get cards. You collect cards. Build sets, get random effects, or just plain victory points depending upon the type of space/card you land on. There's also money that you need to buy certain cards and invest in the temple to get in on the ranking of 'most donated' at the end for bonus veeps. 

Overall, that's not very interesting and could maybe make for an okay or sub-par game. Where Tokaido tries to break the mold is by implementing a time track'esque movement mechanic. The person last in line on the board's path gets to go. So if you jump straight to the action you want to build up your set or make some money, you might get less actions. But if you take the action that lets you do the most, you might not end up doing what you want.

The only remaining problem is that the game's path is so short and simple, there's really only a handful (or less) points in the game you have to make any particularly hard decisions. Usually the most beneficial next placement is quite obvious. 

However, there is also a pile of special characters you get to choose from (out of two dealt) each game that all start with different money banks and special abilities. This at least gives you a new situation to think through every time you play. And the art on the game is very pleasing aesthetically.

A game that reminds me of Knizia's Tutankhamun.  There is the same progression along a path, collecting sets of different things, judging whether to sprint ahead to be sure of that thing you most desire or take lots of small steps at the risk of missing out.  Tokaido adds a chunk of luck in the form of characters you meet along the way, who provide benefits of varying utility.  I did like the concept of the inns, at which everyone is obliged to stop, with those arriving last paying more for their meals.  The Japanese theming is quite nicely done too.

I found the artwork strikingly different and quite pleasing.  Production quality is good.

Kinda boring family game. Players are travelers in Japan and they gain VP by taking pictures, try local food, vising temples and such. The main mechanic is the turn order. The player who is last on the trail on the board is playing next. The thing is that the game doesn't offer you many options since it is almost always better to just choose the first free spot on the board, since everything you do gives you points. The box is way larger than it should be, but the components are cute.

This is a light, simple game--but it is such a great experience. If you're strictly playing to win, you're probably not going to enjoy this. Bauza has made some crunchy, strategic games--Tokaido is not one of them. However, it is really something special, since your journey across the board really does tell an evocative story about your character. 

The artwork is gorgeous, the souvenirs and panorama are stunning, and your end-game tableau says so much about what you did over the course of the game.

RATING: 7
The first word that comes in my mind when thinking about Tokaido is 'cute'. It's a game that never punishes, which aims to make everyone feel better and succeeds. There'snot a lot of strategy but win or lose you'll feel good in the end.

A very pleasant medium-weight game which seems to have "grown on me." The games are always close (I lost recently because I didn't have any money to buy food at the last inn), with the lead going back and forth. There are just enough choices and ways to score points in the game--and some chances to hinder your opponents. (No  runaway leader issue here!) If I win, great, but it doesn't really seem to matter if I don't. Good game.

Peaceful journey, meandering and milling. It's like playing a game where you sit around the airport for a couple hours doing nothing waiting for your flight.

Okay, the idea of having a game being "zen-like" with clean illustrations and charming goals like "taste all possible foods" is interesting. Very thematic, well made.

Sadly, the game was a mess without control. Is it telling me to achieve happiness I have to let go? Well, maybe it should not have been a board game then. ;)

Move your character one space, do that action, turn goes to next player to move one space to do that action. Repeat until the end of game, total up points from your random action to determine a "winner".

Calling it a soulless euro would be insult to soulless euro everywhere. Calling it a family game insults the intelligence and patient of families everything.

It's just boing rubbish. Play the panda game from same designer instead.

A chilled out experience. I enjoy the aesthetics and the general idea; This is essentially road trip the game. However, I don't think there's much strategy or replayability here.

Great board game!  It's easy to pick up, has the right balance of skill and luck to keep things interesting, and I *love* the "furthest back goes next" feature, giving you an interesting decision:  Do you jump ahead and claim what you want, or hang back and potentially get to take more turns?  The theme is pretty fun, too.

My only reason for not ranking the game higher is that some of the travelers have much more useful abilities than others, with some being easy to block while others have abilities that are unblockable (the one that allows you to get a friend anytime you are at an inn comes to mind; that means you're guaranteed 4 friends).  This can lead to a bit of an imbalance, but it's a minor concern.

This is less of a game where you are playing to win and more of a very nice way to pass the time. You collect things, you build up a tableau, you eat food and vie, usually in good humour, for the best bits.

Needs more hot spa monkeys though ;)

Finally got to play this one. I love how laid back it is. It is only slightly cut throat, in that you can block others from getting what they need. Other than that, you just take a stroll on the path, look at some great views, relax at a sauna here and there, stop and work at the farm to make a little extra money, do some shopping for souvenirs, and meet other travelers along the way for some nice surprises. Great game. Now I know I want the expansion.

Similar to Bauza's 7 Wonders, Tokaido is a simple set collection game that is easy to teach and plays quickly. Also like it's card-drafting big brother, there also isn't much strategy to be had. Take an available action and see how it plays out. There's far too much luck here, but it has it's advantages over heavy euros; you won't be investing much time or energy. Find it on sale and it's a winning addition to any collection.

RATING: 6
Cool little game, but nothing deep at all. The argument could be made that the game plays itself, as your choice on your turn is always fairly (blatantly) obvious. HOWEVER, it's chock full of cool mechanics (like the panorama cards that form a picture as you stop and admire landscape), and the zen style theme of taking a stroll though ancient Japan has everyone feeling strangely calmed when all is said and done. Worth playing, but not buying if you're strictly into more strategic fare.

Tokaido is a set collecting game with an interesting theme.  In Tokaido each player is simply taking a walk from Kyoto to Edo (now Tokyo).  It is the player who has the most enjoyable and fulfilling experience walking this legendary path who wins the game.

As card draws are random, fate plays a large role in the game.  It is the player who best accepts (manages) his fate who will have the most fulfilling journey.

Played at Essen. Beautiful game with a design and rythm of play close to its theme.

I would have like to play more but Funforge booth was crowded. I looked also other people playing to determine the balance of the game. It appears that the players have to carefully determine their movement depending of the character they play. As the players can move exactly as they wish there is few luck elements. The events during the game are always positive, therefore, most of the gameplay is based on the movement, yours and the movement of the other player who can block you sometimes.

Real cool game from Antoine Bauza and gorgious artworks. Deserve a 10 for sure

Four plays at a friends game night. I don't personally understand the hate from some people saying it has no strategy; I won a game by deploying a strategy, worked around a couple of obstacles my opponents threw at me, made some tough decisions, and was victorious for it. The game isn't heavy by any means, but it isn't brainless like some have suggested.

Good little game, Worth the low cost I have seen it listed for ($30 seems about right here). Recommend if you are looking for a simple game for anyone, but still has enough meat to please veterans (for a game or two anyway).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
In this game, players are vacationing in the countryside of Japan; collecting paintings, taking baths in hot springs, and meeting new people along the way. This is somewhat of a point-salad using a simple "rondel", meaning players can choose to go to a spot nearer or farther but cannot go backwards. Players move from one end of the map to the other, and the spaces they choose to go to can either let them work on a painting, take a hot spring bath with some monkeys, collect some souvenirs, or maybe even collect a little spending money as needed. The balance here is whether to go a little farther to get what you need, or to slow down and try to hit as many things as possible.

The decisions are interesting and there are many paths to victory, but this game's theme and artwork give a very relaxing and enjoyable vibe. Also, it's simple enough to possibly be a gateway game for those that have played some big name games like monopoly or life as well. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While the imagery is quite remarkable, and the game seems well-balanced, I don't think there is enough strategy to keep my interest over several plays.  Your character pretty much determines your strategy, so it just comes down to getting to the good spots before anyone who is using a similar strategy (ie, using a similar character).  Or else, lag behind to clean up on what others have passed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Paraphrasing a popular meme, you don’t play Tokaido as much as Tokaido plays you: there’s really little to do in this game apart from shifting your pawn to the next free location each time your turn is up, in the attempt to grab as many cards, items or whatever else means victory points as you can.

Initial Impressions:
-------------------------
The Glen More turn order aspect of the game is interesting, but not as cool as Glen More since there doesn't seem to be many times when you would make a significant jump up (except late).  The components are beautiful, and the painted mini's i thought came out nice (although they are totally unnecessary).  Player aids needed to be included in this game, and its shocking to me that they were not and made the first play kind of annoying.  Overall fun game, but doesn't do enough to make it a great game.  Would play again for sure though.

I'm a sucker for a good Japanese or Chinese themed game...this game truly is a beautiful production.  I love how you can move as far as you want...but you really need to think about what's the optimal move.  This can be a really cutthroat game.  Pretty much everything you do nets you points...and it's easy to explain.  This is a fantastic family weight Euro game.  I wouldn't be surprised to see this become a hit on par with something like Ticket to Ride.

The rules:fun ratio is a bit off with this one. You have to explain what all the spots do as if their is a strategy to each, then players just get pigeon held into doing whatever spot is in front of them currently. However, the experience of this game is great. I recommend you put on some traditional Japanese music, maybe pour some sake, and get into the theme.

BUT it's light enough that it facilitates good conversation and there are some interesting decisions, so I don't think I'd ever turn down a game!

   While the box seems unnecessarily large and the pastel panoramas incongruous with the rich artistry of the other components, the game itself is a simplistic pleasure.  It is a game best played with a higher player count, and probably best with people new to board games.

   The best feature of the game gas to be the colored disks you use to personalize your character.

It is rare that a Euro can deliver a theme and  an experience at the same time. 

Tokaido does  right that,  you do not play a game. You travel a journey. 

It is so good.

Tokaido is a pretty light game, but I had a lot of fun playing it. It really reminded me of Egizia, but in a more simplistic way. I'll agree that the strategy isn't too heavy, but I had a lot of fun playing this.

With the pleasant theme and the simplicity of the rules, I believe this is probably one of the best gateway style games around right now.

It's not complicated, the best move is usually but not always 'the next available spot'. It's not a deep strategy game and nor does it claim to be, but it's still fairly good. Sadly not as good as I had expected, but it's definitely worthy of the pedigree that is 'designed by Bauza'.

I wasn't fond of the tempo in this one. If you get in a bad groove early, the game will punish you the whole time, especially in a game with four or more players. Also, the winner seems to be determined well before the finish.

Tokiado goes down as the biggest disappointment of the Essen 2012 crop in my book.  Extremely cool graphic design, with just no game behind it.  I'm actually surprised this game was submitted to a publisher; I would not have been able to shop this design to publishers with a straight face.

Basically, in Tokaido, you advance down a track of actions, which allow you to do such exciting things as set collection, set collection, set collection, draw a card that will either give you 2 or 3 points, etc.  There's just nothing novel about anything here, and all actions are roughly equal.

Truly a case of the graphics selling a game, as this thing would have never sold with a different graphic treatment.  I'll admit the game looks absolutely gorgeous, but unfortunately, it's tough to hang on my wall.

This is a light game, designed to be as enjoyable as a vacation/travel journey with an agenda.  I think the execution of this game is superb in terms of creating gameplay that matches its themes ridiculously well.  You will still be doing the math in your head and making small decisions that affect the leaderboard.  

While it is easy, mechanically, like many vacations to a new place, new travelers could always use a guide.  I am loving the game as something to play with family and non-core friends.  And yes, the game is absolutely beautiful ^_^

With the Crossroads expansion.  Well, this isn't a game...  It is a thing of absolute beauty (and I can't wait to look upon my Collector's Edition when it come through) but there is no actual game present.  Might be a great contender for worst game of the month, at this point.  I don't know if we had made ourselves familiar with the base game before adding the expansion that we might have enjoyed it a little more, but this game took way too long for what it was.  Go fishing for these super powered cards.  I liked that my character sort of focused how I played the game, but then that just made me not focus on anything else and my power wasn't enough to balance out the points I felt I missed out on.  Maybe coming back to the game, knowing it isn't a game and just experience it might make it better, but I don't know how I will ever be able to convince my wife to play it again.

A very good looking game of moving your pawn and getting points, nearly every turn, no matter what you do. Eat some food. Get some points. Take a bath. Get some points. Look at the scenery. Get some points. And those points are so finely balanced that in one of my recent games we had a tie, seventy to seventy, broken by tie breaker. After an entire game, with high scores, all of our well thought out decisions, led us to the exact same score.

Almost enough to give one the impression that their decisions don't matter at all.

I wanted to like it. The art design is great, the kind of clean adult look that I wish were more common. And the idea behind the game is interesting, that you can either move ahead for potentially better spots, but then get fewer turns. 

In practice though, the best play is to hit as many spaces as possible, so everyone stays very bunched up - this is the 4-player game I am talking about. 

So it winds up being a game with no decisions, and little differentiation between the players. As for blocking, by the end of the game, there is so much information in player tableaus that it is too much of a chore to keep track of. Meh.

This is one of my favorite games in my game collection now.  It's a very tranquil sort of game, in that the players aren't necessarily working so much against each other, but more for their own goals.  The game is designed so it plays out a little differently each time, which adds a good spin on it.  It's very easy to learn and everyone always has an equal chance of winning, regardless of whether it's their first time or 20th.  Definitely worth picking this up.

An incredible game. Great for gamers of all ranges, inexperienced and hardcore players.

The game is both relaxing as well as simultaneously strategic and competitive, encouraging you to plan out the risks and rewards of playing quickly for the rewards you want, vs trying to block other players in their goal strategy. I've seen the game end before with the player who was in last result in being first due to end game rewards.

Simply put, from the games I've played the game is incredibly balanced.

Rated 7 after one play.

I traded for this specifically with my lunch gaming group in mind. I really like that mechanic of "choose your spot along the road" from Egizia, Francis Drake, etc. so was curious to try it with a game that plays in an hour and is approachable.

Tokaido is an odd blend of relaxing affair but just enough shortage in resources to cause some tension. It's easy to learn, ideal for the lunch group one hour time frame... time will tell if this has enough legs to generate some requests for additional plays.

lovely game that is very easy to introduce to fanybpdy that does not usually pay board games. the theme and artwork create a really nice atmosphere, keeping the action competitive but not overly so.

After one play, I won't be rushing back to play this game.  It appears to have multiple paths to victory, but in reality there are only one or two things worth spending your time and game currency on.  Add to that the log-jam that players' pawns are constantly in, and there are very few actual choices to be made.  And you can see fairly far ahead what things you won't be able to do by the time your turn comes around, and why there's pretty much nothing you can do about it.  The game is nice looking (although I'd hesitate to call it "beautiful" as many do) and has nice components.  But as a game...  not for me.

RATING: 4
I became interested in Tokaido because of the prevailing mechanism: a time track where the last player on a road is the one to move. This opens up several neat dilemmas on what to do on a given turn as you not only have to consider your own gains, but those of others as well. It can very well be the case that a seemingly good move is actually very bad because it increases the point [i]delta[/i] to a greater degree. Tokaido is a family version of this principle as there is nothing more to it than that: what you can do on the road is basically score points in a variety of ways: a constant but small amount, a triangular amount (in several ways), an investment for later (in several ways too), and obtaining cash; all of which (save the income action, of course) may or may not cost you money. It's not a complex puzzle by any means, but it's not totally for simpletons either: all in all very decent family material. Between experienced gamers there is far too much emphasis on playing defensively, which means that the players never let each other stray too far ahead, at least not in the 3P-game. It is simply too costly in terms of VP deltas otherwise. I found this to be a somewhat disappointing characteristic of the game; perhaps that with more players there is more competition and thus more 'risks' taken in moving ahead of the pack more. As I said, proper characteristics of family material.

In my collection there is room for games such as this, but I'm afraid Tokaido won't enter the collection just yet. For one thing there is the alluded simplicity which detracts a little from the game itself. Second is that although some of the artwork is stunning, it's not actually very user-friendly. Meals and village-collected foods are nigh indistinguishable. The icons for scenes along the road are too small to easily indentify save by their colour, which becomes a problem in poor light and for the colour vision-impaired. The point tokens are really mind-bogglingly small, to the point where one has to wonder which moron at FunForge okay'ed that idea. Related is point three: the price of the package. I am very much inclined to pay more for the artwork in itself, but not to the point where it reaches the €40-mark. That is really too much. I'm very much inclined to wait a few years and see if this game ever goes on sale and [i]then[/i] secure a copy. For €10 to €15, it would be nice to own.

Game-technically a meager 6 in the hope that there is more conflict at higher player numbers, if not a 5; with the current price subtraction by another point.

Players are trying to decide when it's worth moving ahead to grab a crucial bonus, versus hanging back and collecting items for a bigger payoff later.  This is all combined with a turn mechanism like Thebes, where the player furthest back on the road moves first.

Cleverly, the game has intermediate inns which force players who are out ahead to wait for others to catch up.  This keeps the number of available spaces on the road small in each section, adding some great player tension.

It's essential to mention the production values which are great - stunningly beautiful art, bright colors, and the cards and board all have clear symbols to make gameplay clear.  While this game isn't a must-buy, it will go over very well for casual gamers, family, even kids.  I'm really glad we bought this one.

Very family, light game. Some nice mechanics where last player always plays first so if others are not smart and make some bad moves you can play 5-6 times in a row. Game is very fun and quick to play. If you are in for euro-ish family playstile games go for this one, you will not regret it.

Components: Attractive, minimalist board. Fun artwork on the cards.

Experience: Too simple and restrictive for my tastes. The only real choice of the game seems to be whether to skips locations, thereby giving free moves to the person lingering behind, or not. Resolving locations is mostly straight forward. The character powers differentiate the players just enough to at least confer different values on the locations.

The components are beautiful, but this is not a game. I've heard that it's better with 2 players, but I've played this several times and none of the players did anything other than move to the first available slot. Preventing your opponents from taking multiple turns seemed to be a much stronger strategy than moving to the spot that would be best for you.

The idea that player position determines turn order presents an interesting decision making opportunity that involves trading increased actions (turns) for specific goals. Unfortunately, jumping ahead seems insufficiently incentivized due to how minor the differences are between different point scoring actions. More turns and therefore more actions tends to be more points.

This game is all about kicking back and enjoying the journey. And I guess I admire that. Thing is, according to Tokaido, "enjoying the journey" means not really thinking or making choices or competing on any meaningful level. All of which are why I play games and what makes a game a game. So... yeah.

7 Is preliminary rating. I really admire this game's design. It is truly remarkable. And, while fun, and light enough to teach noobies, so it would make a good entry game, I wonder if it will get to the table enough to justify an 8 or if it could conceivable drop to a 6 once some flaws present themselves. Seems like it might require a certain mood to play.

The subtle, but pointed, conflict moves one can execute in the game, can really be counter to the overt mood it is trying to (mostly succeeding in) elicite.

But certainly a jewel of design: mechanics and graphics, and theme.

Not much strategy here, but it's a very "relaxing" game. No stress to be found while playing this.

This makes it a welcome game in my collection.

Not a "gamer's game", but a fun game nonetheless.

Edit: this aged badly. We played it around 30 times, and the winner is almost always someone who went for souvenirs. Played the app version after those 30 so plays, and it was still the same thing. The game's not balanced enough... the expansions don't really help with that problem.

2-5 players, 30-45 minutes, light medium, travel

Played a dozen games with two-five players and had a lot of fun. What I like about Antoine Bauza's games is that they are very easy to learn, play naturally, look very good and that there are several ways to score points and thus several roads that lead to victory. Tokaido is no different. The board looks a bit dull at first, but has more to it than meets the eye at first.

I think of Tokaido as a piece of art. But not much of a game. It belongs framed on the wall, not on the table.

I love Antoine Bauza, but this may be one of my least favourites of his designs. I have played this game scores of times. More than many games on my Best Games of All Time list. But I have never figured out why people think it's so good.

This game always feels like it plays itself. Every play feels basically just like every other play of it. The game is straight forward. All that changes is the tiny random changes of card draw at locations. There's never anything interesting to decide while playing.

I love games with great art. But this just feels like great art with a game pasted on.

A general feeling of harmony while playing this game.
At games end, looking at the picture landscapes provided by the locations visited, the different types of people met along the way and the different dishes of food tasted, one  feels a bit like really having taken a journey...even because often wins the player who arrives last (the one who has made more points, that is, the one who has best taken profit of the voyage).
The board is also visually very nice, however, there seems to be very little "science" in this game: Just trying to get behind to be able to take more itens with you, keeping an eye on the different set collections.
It is also too much overpriced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Interesting game with good design. Ultra-light gateway game as a base game. Expansion adds more interesting decisions that make the game much better. Love the artwork on the game. Slightly better graphic design might be needed though; sometimes I can't see the second spot on the track because the first meeple blocks it from sight.

Players are travelers on a journey from Kyoto to Edo.  Simple, beautifully presented game, where players move up a linear path as far as they like, and interact with the space they end on.  There are eight different spaces, each offering victory points, with bonuses awarded at the end of the game.  The rules are easily taught, and the game play is so soothing the result barely matters.  The chaos factor in the game increases with the number of players, but I found it a bit like Ticket To Ride - the result barely matters, it's simply fun to play.  

After seven plays it moves on.  Knizia does the micro turn game so much better.  We'd much rather play Africa over this.

This game is like nothing you have ever played before. I love the art of this game, it is truly beautiful. You are on a vacation, traveling across japan. You gain points as you visit different shops and destinations. You are not racing to the finish like most games, but on a mission to have the best vacation, making it feel non-competitive until the end as you scramble to pick up those last few paintings and souvenirs. This mechanic allows for a relaxing, unique experience.

Cons: set-up and tear-down take some time, can be a bit slow for some.

RATING: 8
This game is surprisingly evocative of its theme.  You really feel as though you are on a quest to have a fulfilling journey, and fulfilment comes from completing your sets.  I suppose there may be is an interesting lesson here about depth being more satisfying that a wider variety of shallower experiences.  Players tend to naturally diversify from each other, so there is generally only mild and coincidental interference between players.  I certainly find Tokaido to be a pleasant experience, but I'm not sure it is terribly satisfying as a game.  Perhaps it would lose its other charms if it was.

The topic is very interesting, but the artwork? It is fine. However, it seems to me a very bad match when applied to Tokaido, a topic important to Japanese tradition and art.

"Tokaido is an elegant and refreshing new kind of game."
With so little information given till now, this statement is just arrogant.

The game is known for it's beauty, and it lives up to that reputation, but it comes at the expense of functionality in terms of the scale of the game.  The board is just too small, and the dots are too tiny.  The meeples are crowded and block lines of sight to the spaces.   The hobbit cards aren't a big problem, but I wish the board was about 50% bigger.    It's a simple time track game, using a "point salad" approach.   There's not a lot of incentive to spread out, as everything pretty much gets you the same amount of points.   Special characters provided some much-needed variation, but also tend to pin you into to prescribed strategies.   It's a little disappointing that the gameplay doesn't quite live up to the presentation.   Takenoko is like that, too.   However, it is a pretty approachable "casual" game and good for non-gamers.

Tokaido is one of those games that looks amazing, has a fun theme, and is an instant family favorite. This game has good strategy, a screw the other guy factor (great in any game), and artwork that is simple yet beautiful.

A simple game of moving along a path, selecting positions that grant VPs in a number of ways. The player who is furthest behind always takes the next turn, so there is some decision making as to which spaces to leave open and which to rush ahead to for a needed action. The expansion is necessary to provide enough decision points, but all in all this is a very relaxing game for all ages.

This game is gorgeous.

Now that that's out of the way, let's discuss. This has the time track mechanism that is now in many other games (Patchwork, Olympos, Tinners' Trail, Glen More, etc) which always seems to work pretty well. The decisions are pretty light, but I think this is mainly intended for a gateway sort of experience. I've read about the expansion, but haven't played it yet. I think it will make the decisions of the game more interesting. In terms of the base game experience, I don't think it would be worth owning for my tastes.

I didn't find a lot of game here. Out of the choices available on your turn, which choice is the best one seems obvious and unchallenging.

The art and theme come across well, though some of the iconography is confusing and the player track is very tiny and compact (in relation to the size of the board) when compared to traditional game board path layouts (i.e. H&T, Snakes&Ladders, PayDay or even Monopoly).

Tokaido is diceless, so a player can freely move his token forward up the board.  Choices and strategies (mainly around set collection and token placement) do exist, but are limited since tokens cannot share the same space (though some locations have two spaces), players' movement choices are very much dependent on the previous player's decision. Although this exists to some degree in any game, players do not have the option to pass or go back, and can in effect be blocked out - which is part of the game's strategy.  As such at higher play counts, the game may be too prior player dependent and poor play by one player will heavily influence another winning. This too could happen in most games, but I could see it particularly more of an issue in Tokaido.  At 45mins though, does it matter?  It’s not a gamer’s game and games are quick, so maybe not then.  However, the game may not have the meatiness and depth to be played more than occasionally.

I haven't tried this 2p and that may offer a somewhat tougher game.

RATING: 7.5
A game that is all beauty and serenity on its surface, but is a gauntlet of sharp elbows and stepped on toes at its competitive core. Gorgeous artwork and a game design that fits aesthetics to theme so very skillfully. Enjoyable to play!

RATING: 4.5
Beautiful game lacking in interesting strategy decisions.  A tactical game, with some tension each turn between scoring and denying scoring opportunities to opponents, but I found it to be a snoozer.  Low replayability could be a problem.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The elegant art and board design helps draw players in, but the rest of the game is too bland to maintain interest. Choosing and exploiting the various character abilities offers most of the game's intrigue and variety, but there is a lack of meaningful decisions throughout the remainder of play. The pervasive card drawing also provides too much unmitigable luck for my taste.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Beautiful artwork (although it seems like the printing was 25% smaller than it should have been).  Unfortunately, the praise ends there since there isn't a whiff of tension as the scoring is designed to keep points close no matter what action space is chosen.  The result is a feeling that decisions don't matter all that much and I didn't like the central mechanic enough to justify the lack of stakes.

This is a easy-to-play set collection game with a meandering pace, which nicely captures the theme of travelling through Japan and seeing the sights.  I've been to Japan, and enjoy the culture, so that might inform my opinion of the game a bit.  It's just a nice game that leaves me hungry for Japanese food.

Like a pleasant walk in the park, Tokaido is lighthearted and fun.  I love the gameplay arc and the artwork / ambiance of the game is just fantastic.  

However, there isn't much tension and your decisions seem pretty obvious.  It's sweet spot is zeroed in right at three players as too many more just clusters the board and blows the zen-like experience.  

It's a great choice when you're looking for something light and not too brain-burny, but not one that I personally reach for first.

If someone said, "Hey!  You've got twenty minutes and I need to you to meditate for those twenty minutes AND play a thoroughly enjoyable board game.  Haha!"

I'd say, "Tokaido," in a definitive voice, as if I possessed an inner understanding of the word but all I would really mean would be, "Bring me Tokaido, the board game and for crying out loud do not forget the expansions, lest boredom drive me to my doom."  Or something similar and less dramatic, anyhow, all I'm saying is "Tokaido."

First few plays of this game can seem a little....simple...stick with it.  It get's much better.  I like Tokaido.  

Update: You must have the Crossroads expansion to truly enjoy all the game has to offer.

This game has the opposite problem most other games have; it's got amazing theme and artwork, just not a particularly good game underneath.  Okay, maybe that's unfair, but I just don't find it compelling.  I've heard the argument that you have to decide whether to help your own cause, or block an opponent, but it still feels like there are very few decisions to be made.  That's fine for some, but I prefer a little more substance.

It's still a gorgeous game, and I'll play if someone really wants to.

In Tokaido, each player is a traveler crossing the "East sea road", one of the most magnificent roads of Japan. While traveling, you will meet people, taste fine meals, collect beautiful items, discover great panoramas, and visit temples and wild places but at the end of the day, when everyone has arrived at the end of the road you'll have to be the most initiated traveler – which means that you'll have to be the one who discovered the most interesting and varied things.

The potential action spaces in Tokaido are laid out on a linear track, with players advancing down this track to take actions. The player who is currently last on the track takes a turn by advancing forward on the track to their desired action and taking that action. So, players must choose whether to advance slowly in order to get more turns, or to travel more rapidly to beat other players to their desired action spaces.

The action spaces allow a variety of actions that will score in different, but roughly equal, ways. Some action spaces allow players to collect money, while others offer players a way to spend that money to acquire points. Other action spaces allow players to engage in various set collections that score points for assembling those sets. Some action spaces simply award players points for stopping on them, or give the player a randomly determined action from all of the other types.

All of the actions in Tokaido are very simple, and combined with a unique graphic design, Tokaido offers players a peaceful zen mood in its play.

The limitation on options made me enjoy the game less on the first play.

I still enjoyed the quick paced decisions that the game facilitated overall, though.

I think this game would be best with 3 or 4 people. I have played 2 player, which was rather dull. I have played 3 player once or twice and enjoyed it a little more. I have not yet played with the Crossroads expansion, which I own, and have hopeful hopes of it improving the game experience. This is a game I want to love more and require more plays to figure that out. It is a light game, so not something I would play with my gamer friends, typically.

Tokaido is a fairly light set collection game with a beautiful board and anime type artwork. 

My observations are that choices during a turn seem quite limited, so most of the decision making comes from deciding how far to "jump" ahead on the track to get what you really want.  Also, the characters don't seem entirely balanced.  My other comment is that the scoring markers could have been implemented better as they are unnecessarily small and fiddly.

All in all Tokaido is an enjoyable and visually appealing game that will work if you need a light and relatively short game that scales well from 3 to 5 players.

RATING: 7
A light to medium walk through type game with limited player interaction, but absolutely beautiful artwork.  With more players there is a bit more strategy, but really, this is just a nice light filler that looks very pretty.  And sometimes, that's just what I'm in the mood to play.

This is not just a game of move to the next available space for optimum play.

Pretty set collection game.

Played with 3, which seems, along with 5, to be the most restrictive due to fewer stops.  It was a learning game and I ended up picking a person that only gave me a potential for a free meal, whereas my opponents took people that always game them stuff.

Overall, a short set-collection game, that has some varied strategy based on who you decide to play and where others make their stops.  I like the mechanism where the last place player takes turns until they are not the last place any more.

I think I've played this twice as of this writing. It is a fun game that has a different style than most games...I can't say that I've seen another game that is like this. And I think that the different game style may not be for everyone. Some of the people in my gaming group like it, but a lot of them don't much care for it. So you'll just have to try it out and see. But if you think it's fun to go along on a journey and see what happens, instead of just killing monsters or fighting etc., then you'll probably like it.

First week with the game and I've played it four times, with three different groups, and everyone loved the game.

It is extremely light and choices are very limited.  The game does tend to play itself to a degree so I can easily see the criticism that it is receiving.  That said, there is some strategy and timing is very important.  Do I push my luck and try to get the extra action, or do I push on, take the action I really want, and lose out on an extra go?

Initial rating is based on the four plays.  This is likely to go up or down by 0.5 - 1.0 depending on how we perceive it after a few more plays.

Régóta várt kipróbálásra. A szerző és a gyors játékmenet miatt nagyon érdekelt. Hallottam már rosszat is róla, és sajnos ez a rész igazolódott be. Gyakorlatilag nincs egyáltalán döntés a játékban. Lépkedtek egymás után. Nagyon előre menni sose éri meg, így egy-két akció közül választhatsz, de hogy melyikek közül azt szinte lehetetlen megjósolni egy körrel előre, mert nagyon a többiek lépésén múlik. Lehet hogy az is gond volt, hogy öten próbáltuk, így aztán tényleg nagyon fájdalmasan imba volt. A játékossorrendre semmi kiegyenlítés nincs, pedig piszok nagy hátrány utolsónak lenni. A karakterek sincsenek egyáltalán kiegyensúlyozva.
Mindenhol a design istenítik, de én ettől se voltam elájulva. A kártyákat szinte képtelenség megkülönböztetni egymástól, és engem a tábla se nyűgözött le. Persze üdítő a mai színkavalkádban egy ilyen szinte teljesen fehér tábla, de pont ennyi ami érdekes benne.
A téma szokta még lázba hozni az embereket, de én azt se éreztem ki annyira. 18 féle set gyűjtögetés nekem kevés.

This is a pretty good game and not too difficult to learn. It can be played 2 to 5 players. You travel the Tokaido road earning points along the way by stopping at villages to collect souvenirs, having encounters, donating to temples, earning coins, collecting panoramic photographs, and eating expensive meals at the Inns.  

After playing my first 2 player game, I realized this game is amazing for what it is. It has a lot of depth and a lot of choices to make along the way. The depth will increase in complexity with more players, because you need to carefully consider your choices based on your powers, what your opponents powers are, how much money you have, how many achievements you and your opponents have, etc. Amazing design! You have to concentrate and stay focused or you'll lose your rear.

One very nice touch I really like about this game is the fact that you collect everything along the way which is essentially your score. So if there's any disputes about who won (or because someone might of made a mistake), you can literally count up your points right off the cards you collected. The proof is in the cards.

I totally get what people mean by this being a relaxing game. While there are opportunities to block/screw your neighbor, there are no bad cards/events that can directly happen to you. I remind my opponents there is no bonus card for making the first jerky move.

A very relaxing, beautiful and simple game. The choice of being able to go as far as you'd like, but having to wait longer for your next turn the farther you go is an engaging choice. I'd sometimes like it to have some more meat, but that would limit its appeal to non-gamers. Its chill and easy vibe may not be for everyone, but it does it very well.

Rating based on one play at Essen 2012. Sold in October 2012 (for a loony profit!).

I may have judged this too harshly, because I've since played a lot of [thing=300][/thing] which is kind of a simpler version of this and I love it. And the Tokaido board and cards are beautiful. So, yeah, I'd willingly give this another chance but meanwhile Tutankhamen does the job for me.

Beatiful game. Love the theme. Unfortunately the gameplay just isn't that much fun and is often frustrating. Can get quite cutthroat with the right players, which makes it more interesting if not more enjoyable. I suspect the expansions improve matters, but have yet to try them.

That said, Tokaido works quite well as a family game with younger kids. Playing with my 3 and 6 y.o. they both enjoyed playing a character with a special ability and collecting stuff as they made their journey. The last-moves-first mechanism for determining turn order teaches kids that not all games are races and discourages them from running ahead. Simple scoring allows them to start calculating the value of various actions. Playing with kids doesn't much interfere with adults playing aggressively against each other. Would definitely recommend for families!

Very light thematic family game with excellent aesthetic value. Easy to play, easy to teach, very original and unique. Mainly tactical, not strategical game.

RATING: 9
I only give it a 9 because game runs are too short. The game is super fun and really easy to learn, with more strategic ways to play the more you play (and with more travelers). The price is a tad high, but I guess that's self explanatory Tokaido being one of most beautiful games out there.

RATING: 9
Relaxing trip from Tokio to Osaka in which you buy souvenirs, eat at inns, collect panoramas and have the occasional bath. Tokaido, an easy to learn and relatively simple game, is stress free and very well-balanced. The way players advance is original and effective: the last player always goes first. The base game is very good, but I prefer to play with Crossroads, the first expansion, which gives you some great additional choices, such as betting and collecting cherry trees. The cards are beautiful as is the white board, which instills a sense of relaxation and calmness. A well worth trip.

It honestly feels like taking a stroll through the countryside, which is, I suppose, the point. Highly recommended!

Tokaido is a fun game and fairly quick. It isn't one where you gain much by over-thinking your strategy. In our group the game is at its best with 4 or 5 people, which tends to encourage a more casual style of play. And the art and themes of the cards are terrific. Someone always makes a point of how cool it is that the hot springs bath with the monkeys is worth more points.

Quite possibly the least stressful game i have ever played.  I'm really competitive yet somehow I never take this game seriously.  Which is a compliment because it speaks to the strong theme and art.

It's essential a resource/set collecting game.  

Big fan of this one however less than 4 players isn't as fun in my opinion.

Continues to be a goto game with occasional gameplayers as well as family jaded gamers. The art/theming is a big draw. The art is beautiful, the theme very gentle but intriguing, and the gameplay decisions interesting. The "last in line goes first" mechanic is an interesting one to exploit.

Can get a little tedious, and doesn't have the energy or mind-blowing decisions of many other games in our cllection. But it's a very well done "snack tray" sort of game.

Some games use a time track to define turn order, with the player who is further behind taking the next turn. Here, the time track is the game. You decide where to stop along the road, but most spaces you just give or sell you cards of one type or another. It basically comes down to scoring various shades of set collection, with bonus points for having the most cards or being the first to complete a set. Nothing special, but it works as light family game. The "Crossroads" expansion makes it a little better. I'm not a fan of the bland artwork, which sometimes is also confusing.

 An extremely straightforward and simple game. You start to walk in a straight line which consists of several stops until you reach an inn. Depending on the type of the location, you get some points or gain a card which has a point value. The players who reached an inn wait the rest of the players to reach the inn. At the inn all players convert some money to 6 points, if possible, and continue the journey in a similar fashion. At the 4th inn the game ends and the player with the most points win the game. 

 The game has extremely pretty visuals and can be played within half an hour. It is too simple for serious gaming and too straightforward for casual playing (compared to Ticket to Ride and even Rattus). Therefore I didn't like the gameplay experience.

This is a classic example of a decent game with excellent artwork which elevates the experience.  At it's core, this is a zen version of the classic "move forward on a path" game (ex: life, candyland), but the gameplay choices are interesting and result in defferent point-gathering opportunities: taking photos of a panorama, collecting souvenirs, donating money to the temple, eating delicious food, etc...  

Gameplay is a bit flat, but fast and fun. The neatest mechanic is turn order, with the player furthest back in the path always going next.

I liked Tokaido. It doesn't really offer much mental stimulation, but has interesting/relaxing mechanics. Basically, you get points for everything. Primary player interaction is blocking and a little bit of racing toward a few point goals. My main concern is that although I actually like the game's play style, there also isn't much variation in the overall experience from game to game.

In the end, I believe Tokaido is worth playing once or twice, but it certainly isn't worth owning. There just isn't much game actually in the box and not all that much of anything else with major staying power either.

(06/22/2013) Comment based on one play.

Very light, yet very elegant and pleasant game to play with non-gamer friends and family. The movement is reminiscent of Glen More, where the last player on the track moves first. Move too far ahead to get the space/action you want, and you sit and wait as the others catch up. Move too slowly, and you may be giving up valuable spaces just ahead of you to the other players. There is some blocking in terms of spaces and cards drawn during meals, but other than that, the theme and the game play fit well together--take a leisurely stroll along the Japanese countryside and collect varied, but wonderful memories.

The artwork is very nice and well done. The unfolding panoramic views, as the players visit scenic vistas is a nice game mechanic that contributes strongly to the theme. Rules are pretty straightforward. A pleasant little game, that seems to have come in bit oversized box. Initial rating: "7" with room to move up a point.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Where do I start? This game is simply great, I love the thematic and the turn order is easy, as in the real world you are waiting for the slowest player hahaha. The game may be look a bit confusing at the beginning but it is simple. As many games, you must score the most points to win and every stop on the game helps you a bit in scoring.

The down on the game that I found is when you play it with 5 players. The thing is that sometimes you may never stop on a certain type of stop because other players may block you, even the 2 players stops may get full. So, it may be a bit frustrating.

Anyway, I like the game, it is good and I recommend it, just I don't play it as often as I may like because when we gather to play we are 6 players.

----------------------

¿Por donde comienzo? El juego simplemente es excelente, me fascina la temática y el orden de los turnos es sencillo, así como en la vida real, estás esperando al jugador más lento jajaja. El juego puede parecer un poco confuso al inicio pero realmente es sencillo. Como en muchos juegos, el objetivo para ganar es obtener la mayor cantidad de puntos y cada parada te ayuda proporcionándote puntos.

Lo que no me gusta del juego ocurre al jugar con 5 jugadores. El problema es que a veces no es posible que te detengas en un determinado tipo de parada ya que los otros jugadores las ocupen, incluso las que tienen capacidad para dos jugadores. Lo cual puede ser molesto para el jugador al que le suceda.

El juego me gusta, es bueno y lo recomiendo, solamente que no lo puedo jugar porque nos reunimos 6 personas y ya no es posible jugarlo.

[b]After 12 plays:[/b]  HUGE hit with family, semi- & non-gamers; several people have run out & bought their own copy after playing—most probably because it's a simple, gentle game that is simultaneously spare and gorgeous, and enormously evocative of its theme with the little scrapbooking project you get to monkey with (the arrangement of the record of your travels) as you go.

First, this game is gorgeous. Second, we have (too) many non-gamer friends and relatives, so Tokaido comes out often as a gateway game.

There's strategy -- deciding how to maximize your total movements -- and tactics -- deciding how to make up for ruined plans.

Yes, this game can be played as a simple hop-and-collect journey, but we find it becomes a cutthroat experience where you hate-block your opponents at every move, or try and quickly gather up a certain resource -- card, item, visit, etc. -- before your opponents.

I don't always wish to play Tokaido, but I don't mind it when a new guest prompts it to hit our table.

A light point salad game; good for non-gamers. More interesting decisions with more players.

The components are over the top for what they are designed for, but grabs the attention of non-gamers in a good way. A pleasant experience.

It looks like a roll and move without the roll.  A simple one track board game where everyone chooses how many spaces they want to move.

The play at the back moves next and a limited number (usually 1) player per space.  Lots of ways to score points and a tight economy.

Neutral - on occasion

The almost linear scoring system combined with great art creates a very strange bipolar feel.

Tokaido has a surprising degree of depth and complexity that's slowly revealed through multiple play sessions. There are multiple paths to victory, which make no two games exactly alike. I like a large degree of player choice in board games, so Tokaido is an automatic favorite.

Played it once, like it, should go back to it. El juego representa una peregrinación de Tokyo a Kyoto. (Es una ruta histórica que realmente existe.) Durante el trayecto el jugador debe competir para obtener artefactos, objetos, etc, también para formar un paisaje con piezas que se encuentran en el camino, o comer la mejor comida en los hostales. Los oponentes también compiten por lo mismo y se pueden bloquear entre sí mediante el uso acertado de la mecánica de movimiento. Juego bellísimo!

This can either be extremely cutthroat or extremely peaceful and enjoyable, depending on who's playing and how. Either way, it's a fun journey with absolutely gorgeous artwork and themes.

Inoffensive game that is indeed perfect for kids, but I have no intention of playing with kids. The fact that this game does indeed exist in hardcore gamer circles despite its kindergarten-level strategy curve is all about obsession with pretty things and the cultured theme. Nothing wrong with that necessarily, but those qualities do not compose a complete game by themselves. At least it is over quickly.

Played in a tournament 10-12-17 with Anna.  I won the first round by 8 points (scoring a total of 82 points). Anna finished in a 2nd place tie, but didn't advance to the final because of tie-breaker rules.  In the final, I made one mistake and took 4th in a very close game.  Brandon Wright won with only 10 points between us.

Walking from inn to inn in a Japanese countryside with alot of stops where you meet ppl, take hotspring baths, visit temples, enjoy the Japenese panorama, Buy gifts along the way... yes it's an easygoing game. 

The expansion comes with the option of gambling (this includes a die else the game has none), legendary items to buy, the occasional stop at a Cherry Tree, ect...

A lot more fun than I had expected.  Many have said this is more of an experience than a game, but our (2 player) plays have been competitive and have required some strategy.  I like the art style and theme. While I prefer heavier games with big decisions - this is nice for a change of pace.

This game does set collecting right. Player interaction is limited to stopping other players from going to certain spots so they can't complete their collections.

Light set collection game with players' movement along a track ordered by a variable last-player-on-the track-goes-next turn order mechanism.

One 4-player play only so far, which everyone enjoyed. You're competing for resources and blocking rather than clobbering each other, and while on some turns your move is pretty obvious, the canny player will recognise that reading what the others are likely to do and planning a few turns ahead can pay dividends.

Very attraactive aesthetics suit the mood of the game very well, and while it may not be the main attraction on a games night it does make an enjoyable change from confrontational wargames and dry, efficiency engine Euros.

Played my first game with a full table of 5 players.  There never seemed to be any big decisions to be made, and I won on a missed move by another player.  Near the middle of each round the game almost started playing itself (at least that's how it felt).

I think that this would be best with two or three players... at least then there would be more strategic decisions to be made.

TL;DR 7/10 because the random mechanics make it nigh impossible to strategize for at least 2/5 of the players every game no matter what they do. The bonuses are not worth the effort made focusing on doing ONE THING to complete the tasks that reward them, when you could just try to do a general mix of things and screw other people over more by blocking their moves. You'll likely be blocked out of doing that one thing quite often anyways depending on what you go for, so strategy and getting bonuses both are quite broken and should've been made better in beta testing...

OTHERWISE: it's a very neat game!  We end up being QUITE silly while narrating our games in my apartment and we do enjoy the game overall. It is quite fun even when you're not doing so well, but I would like some sort of shift in rules (maybe not randomly choosing a traveler would help heaps?) to make it more fair, as losing 3 games in a row really sucks (it feels like the economy or the card game asshole, where if you get stuck in the bottom 2 early on, you're stuck there the whole game).


----------------------------------------------
1) some travelers powers are constantly screwed over by the obligatory, complete and utterly random way the travelers are chosen and what your friends will choose to do each game, on top of the randomly chosen starting order (there's no rule on this, we draw meeples from a dice bag as house-rule) and how everyone but the free temple donations traveler tries to skip temples and screw other people over. Also the person who gets that traveler can pretty much not give a crap what they do as they're likely going to get enough points from the temple and doing whatever is available for who cares amount of points to easily out-earn everyone (after seeing two different roommates play this character in different ways).
If there was more balance to the abilities/bonuses and the ability to actually benefit from them (most times you're just plain screwed and no amount of strategy will save you) I would enjoy this game more. It's too damn unfair/broken because of the luck of the draw. It feels like the card game asshole, and whoever gets the first few "good spots" is like the king and queen and will likely stay on top (or at least top 3) all the game.

2) With the randomly chosen travelers, you're very very likely to constantly get screwed over by other people landing on the spaces that your travelers benefits from, depending completely on the order in which you began. I wish I could suggest starting first, last or somewhere in the middle, but this is honestly a crap shoot and even when you try to make a plan, you're pretty locked into your position in the game by the time you hit the first inn/hotel. There is no way to strategize outside of "what can I do next turn based on what everyone else MIGHT MAYBE POSSIBLY do". you can really only predict that people will probably paint and take the banks immediately, and anyone not painting is going to be a hot springs whore.

3) Getting a hero based on "meeting a friend" seems to suck the most as most people, when not painting (and NOBODY shops [much] in my experience after three 5-person games) will automatically choose hot springs and meet a friend (instant points in most cases and not having to hit up a temple). Travelers that get to buy things at the shop (villages?) for cheap also seem to get screwed because unless you have a ton of cash from banks, you can't afford food AND shopping (and food is more worthwhile overall for the price per points [1 coin for 6 points? yes plz!]).

4) Buying things in the shops seems utterly useless unless you have tons of cash and also are lucky enough to get every bank space and meet the "noble" friend once or twice, on top of having one of the people who has a nice buying ability (get second cheaper item free if you can afford both when buying 2). After playing this character, watching a roommate play it, and seeing a third roommate play another shops-based traveler, my opinion is they're USE. LESS.

5) This utter imbalance in the game is possibly why it has only 7.1 on the site. It has great reviews and I do like the game, my roommates also like it even when they don't do as well. I'm sure we will get better with time (we've had it for about 4 days and have played 2 times so far) but as geek veterans to board and role games, it was a bit disappointing that the inventors didn't beta this a bit more and try to balance it so that no matter what you chose, you at least stand a chance by strategizing to fuck over other people by taking what THEY need. At this point, even trying to do that wont work for every traveler because then you're probably not doing anything actually useful to help yourself stack points/get bonuses.

6) BONUSES? Yeah... right! The bonuses for doing the most of something? 3 freakin points! That's it?!! You should get at LEAST 6-10 for being the person to have the most friends or most expensive meals. GOD DAMN NOODLES FOR 1 COIN GIVES YOU MORE POINTS FOR THE EFFORT THAN PAINTING. And from my experience, nobody can finish 2 different paintings first (for the 6 points that would be worth) anyways, unless your friends are seriously uninterested in it and are buying items and food and hot springs/friends-ing it up (but in my experience everyone paints at least a bit to avoid spaces they dont want like the temples or to try and "count cards" to get to a space they need).

7) The shopping and food buying can really put you out if you dont start with 6-9 coins and hit up at least 2 banks. The bonuses from doing it compared to the amount you waste letting other people finish their objectives instead of screwing them over to get ahead just to get those measly 3 stupid points.

Tokaido is a very "zen" experience.  Traveling down that long, winding road, stopping at temples, farms and inns along the way...it all feels very nice.  There's no real confrontation and everyone is free to do their own thing, long as a space is open to do so.  Everything flows so well and builds up so beautiful, especially in the way of gaining those panorama cards.  I really dig this chill game.

RATING: 6
I was interested, in a detached intellectual way, about how simply moving to one of the next available spots on a path constitute a meaningful game decision. The game is easy to explain. Players are on a big path. The player in back moves to one of the available spaces in front of them. Spaces involve collecting cards of various types in order to get points and/or build sets of cards in order to... get points! There are essentially two things to think about as you play - do you skip spaces to ensure you get what you need most or to block people from getting what they need AND do you have enough money to purchase the upcoming cards that you need. There are only a couple of ways to collect money and it is pretty important to have some throughout the game as a number of cards or actions have a cost to perform. Players take on personas that give a unique special ability which creates some differentiation.

The game feels pretty unique, and I give it credit for that, but game play is one-dimensional and not terribly fun. It's not that I dislike it, but I'd rather play most any of my other family games.

Almost no game here. It looks like a Guardian info-graphic, but that is sadly the best thing about the game.

The movement / turn order has no tension due to obtaining points for everything.

luck will decide which end of the 10% variance in score you come out on - will you draw a useful villager? Will you get a 2 point or 3 point hot springs card? Will you draw items that make a set when you visit the shop?

This game is flaccid and my friends who played rated at 7 initially, but it has dropped a rank after every subsequent play.

The most fun to be had was doing ironic drum-rolls followed by cheers/jeers when a player was drawing a hot spring...

Absolutely gorgeous to look at and a unique game for the right group, i.e. gaming with family and other non-gamers. For half-experienced gamers, there's nothing strategic on offer in Tokaido, even if it calls itself a zen-like strategy game. If players don't play stupid and jump far ahead, there's nothing extraordinary to decide. Skip a spot here or there to focus on a few areas of set collection. Otherwise, it's draw of the luck which should more or less average out and lead to close results. Still, worth playing in its niche.

While not necessarily a work of art, I do enjoy the style of artwork used in Tokaido. It is refreshing to see something a little different from the norm. Even if usability may suffer a little bit, I still would prefer something original like this.

It doesn't seem like there are too many options on your turn, and so I wonder how much replayability there is here, but I think I actually enjoy that aspect of the game. When there aren't too many choice to be made I call a game "relaxing".

A beautifully designed game. The artwork and the components are stellar. Unfortunately the gameplay is extremely mundane. This is a game with nothing unique or original to offer. Effectively just set-collecting or draw cards for points and see who has the most points at game end.

Knowing when to block and when to skip forward are a huge deal in this game. You get more turns if you never take big leaps, but you may also not get the items you really want.  The board doesn't look all that interesting, but it is actually quite thematic and reflects a Japanese style.

A very friendly game. Actually sometimes it feels that points are not the most important thing in the game. On the other hand, it is interesting enough and has several exceptional features. For example, player turn order changes in a very interesting way: you may go wherever you need, however, if you go too far, you'll wait for you turn for a long time.

Labai gerietiškas žaidimas. Iš tiesų kartais net jaučiasi, kad taškai netgi nėra pats svarbiausias dalykas. Kita vertus, jis pakankamai įdomus ir turi keletą išskirtinių savybių. Pavyzdžiui, žaidėjų eilės tvarka keičiasi gana įdomiai: gali keliauti ten, kur tau reikia, tačiau jeigu per toli nukeliausi, gali ilgai laukti savo ėjimo.

The most beautiful game I own. Besides being a cool piece of art, it's a simple but engaging and even cutthroat game, depending on who you play with. I like that you can take the road back to make it a longer game. Put on some cute soundtrack, make some tea, and the game turns into a real trip.

This game is incredibly easy to learn, quick to pick up. There are a lot of simple mechanics that when put together create a deceptively strategic game.

After several plays with a few different player counts I can honestly say I don't understand the appeal this game has.  It is pretty, but other than that __________?  I just don't see it, if I have a decision it's always painfully obvious which choice I should make, there is virtually no player interaction, no interesting theme or story... I don't even think it's balanced well, the last time I played I had the person who paints while they eat, so obviously I concentrated on painting... I painted all 3 paintings and was the first to paint 2 of the 3.  I finished a distant third because the set collection (buying stuff from the market place) is just WAY more valuable. It wasn't even tense or interesting, I knew by the halfway point who was going to win and there was nothing I could do about it.

This game is solid. Gameplay is fun and varied, really a "make what you want of it" style game. I really enjoy it as it's a nice break from heavy games. The subject matter and depth is lightweight. Your greatest strategy comes in figuring out what your best possible move is for you, but also to inconvenience your opponent, or stop them from getting the points or activity they need...

Definitely looking forward to playing when i need a light hearted and refreshing break from other more intense games...

Tokaido, определённо, выделяется своим стильным оформлением. Радует глаз любого эстета :) Игровой процесс, к сожалению, не слишком разнообразен, и не нагружает мозг.

After getting my first Antoine Bauza game for my birthday in 2016, in 2017 I got another one, namely Tokaido. My brother got it at an inflated price, since it is unfortunately not available in germany. I wanted this as another "gateway game" for people who usually don't play too much. I think this might work better at an introductory level than Takenoko, but still depending on whom I play with, this still turns out to be a little harder to grasp for some people than I would have thought. Overall it left a good impression though and the first two plays were mostly fun experiences.

In Tokaido, each player is a traveler crossing the "East sea road", one of the most magnificent roads of Japan. While traveling, you will meet people, taste fine meals, collect beautiful items, discover great panoramas, and visit temples and wild places but at the end of the day, when everyone has arrived at the end of the road you'll have to be the most initiated traveler – which means that you'll have to be the one who discovered the most interesting and varied things.

The box insert is a disaster. If you take it out you realize that half you're storing a box of air with a little game at the bottom. The slot for the charactercards is too small and they don't fit in there.

When I opened the deck of cards 4 cards were stuck together. Trying to get them loose damaged the front of 2 cards and the back of 2 others. Really disappointed about that.

Played once, 2p.  Beautiful game, with great bits and illustrations.  The form hides a fairly shallow game, though.  In general, the only decisions in this game are how many spaces forward to move.  I was fairly disappointed, as the ultimate winner was clear from just after the 60% mark.  It is possible that this game will be much better with more than 2, but I doubt I'll ever find out for myself.

As a board game for kids, maybe it could be fun, but I am still not really sure. This game simply lack of adventure.

The movement mechanic is interesting but that's it. In the end, all the actions you do will give you victory points in one way or the other so that at the end, every body has in average the same amount of points.

There are a few events that are OK, but collecting pieces of land scape, I just don't understand it. Not only it's not fun but it makes no sense at all.

I know it's not a kill monster game, but give to my character some interesting adventures to do. For me to plan getting protection to pass certain hasard ahead. 

So yes, the idea to travel and the movement mechanic is very interesting and new. But what you do is simply boring.

Another important thing: THE BOX IS HUGE. Seroiusly, I don't think the game components takes more than 20% of the box's space. I would be curious to see if somebody could measure that up. It might not be the best wasted space box game, but it's surely in the top 10.

This is a pleasant, friendly game about just taking a nice tour of old Japan. It plays surprisingly quickly, and presents a lot of play options, and is beautifully rendered. There's not a whole whole lot to really dig into here, but it's a nice diversion.

The interesting thing is, it seems like the 3p version plays very different from the 4p version, as a lot of spots are closed off in the former. So I think playing with four might be a completely different experience.

I really like the Glen More movement mechanic.  Relaxing game, plays quickly and works with 2.  Would be very interesting with more.  I wish the track was longer or maybe the setup more random, as I can see the game getting "samey", though maybe the role cards mitigate that.  Beautiful board and cards.  I love the tiny little pieces for the score track, but i'm certain i'd lose them if i owned this.

A relaxed set collection game, Tokaido is a good starting game that introduces interesting game systems without being overwhelming. Featuring gorgeous art that enlivens its medieval japanese setting, Tokaido seeks to capture the feeling of being on vacation and it does so surprisingly well, accenting the game with failed itineraries, memorable unplanned encounters, good food, and a lot of troubles with parking. Plays up to 5 players.

If we have newbie's over and we ask them what they think they'd like to play they all gravitate to Tokaido because it's so brilliantly beautiful.  And that's cool because I think it's a great gateway and yet also has just the right amount of strategic thinking hidden in it that it lets us transition them right into a more gamerly game without losing them.

A stressful game to determine who is the most relaxed, Tokaido is another absolutely gorgeous game that I love looking at. It's simple but still has some meaningful decisions, and it's solid at all player counts. Plus, there are monkeys (or not)!

Tokaido is a beautiful game. It relaxes me just looking at the board! There are a lot of things you can do in the game, but the strategy isn't very deep. It's a nice game to play when your brain needs a break from something heavier!

A fun little game that is very simple to pick up on, light and quick to play. It is very unconfrontational. A VP game that once all players reach the end you tabulate VP totals. Very easy game to look at. Simple layout of this excellent looking board. Has many different ways of scoring the VP's, making it easy to play, not boring you with the same old same old.

Il gioco rilassante per eccellenza.
Ci si muove a turni su un percorso lineare partendo sempre dal personaggio più indietro sul percorso. Ogni casella consente di fare determinate azioni e raccogliere carte che a fine partita faranno fare punti in modi diversi.
Molto adatto ai neofiti

Game by Antoine Bauza, designer of 7 Wonders, Ghost Stories etc.  Quite a light game about travelling across Japan along the Tokaido road from Kyoto to Edo. There's some set collection and jostling for limited positions along the road to pick up points, collect souvenirs and meals at inns. Not a particularly deep game, but fun - and the artwork is superb.

After 1 play (learnt from excellent watch it played video series) had fun with it. I don't really understand other people's replay-ability comments. It is not as though you are just playing to see the cards and that is your only option. Wondering if it is a little bits "on rails" there are options but they are fairly obvious ones. The character cards were difficult to use to guide yourself because often blocked.however the winner won by 1 point which could have been attributed to the 1 time he got a free card from ability. 

Enjoyed it though.

PLayed again with 5 players and it is subtle and beatiful. Easy to explain, great to look at, understandable goals and strategies, competition for places. A great game.

Such a beautiful game. I play a lot of competitive games where you sometimes (always) need to sabotage other players to win. But this game is so peaceful and fun. Don't get me wrong, it is still a competitive game and you still can plan your moves to stump others but you can instead focus on the things you gain along the way: the scenery, the people, the souvenirs, and the food!

A good game that I break out with the wife and kids.  Non-gamers tend to like it as well.  It's a very pretty looking game.  The rules are very simple and the goal is clear.  Once everyone knows what they're doing, a game can be knocked out in 20-30 minutes.  I'm kind of over it but I'll oblige to playing it for my wife's sake ;)

Cons: Someone who doesn't know what they're doing the entire time can play randomly and still win.

Not a bad game at all.  Pretty light.  Beautiful, colorful board and components.  I really like the idea of deciding whether to jump forward to the ideal spot to secure it, or get more things along the way that offer fewer points.  That specific element reminds me of the placement of boats in Egizia.  But yeah, not bad.  Fun, light, beautiful.  One note.  If you breathe in too heavy you might accidentally swallow one of the point counters.

I expected to not like this, but instead found it pleasant and agreeable. It doesn't seem wildly strategic, but there's more strategy than I expected. A clever play in the right moment, playing to your character's strength, and capitalizing on board opportunities can all swing the game. It stays interesting until the end, too, which I always like.

"Have the most 'Japan' experience possible" in board game form is the perfect description for this chill game.

A light game that is pretty much you being a tourist and doing touristy things.  The art is beautiful and despite it being a "zen-like" experience, you and other players can intentionally block another player from reaching places that they want/need to go to, causing them much anger and stress.

Essen 2012 with dedication from Naïade

Played it with my parents: first thing my parents said: what a beautiful game! And this is the first game my mother immediately said she really likes playing the game.

It's a very accessible game, very easy to understand. It's beautiful to see and the idea of 'zen' is worked out very well. At some time I think the novelty will wear off: I might not want to play it too often. There is a bit of tactical thinking (blocking spaces) and strategic thinking (money management) and getting the most out of your character, but that's it. It's mostly a game to, just, ...do.

Edit: my wife (again ;)) also says that the game is very beautiful and that she isn't yet done playing... Also a gaming friend commented that this is a beautiful game and it is really nice to play it. Not to win, but just to play: he said it has simple rules, simple decisions, so... very Zen!

Edit 2: my wife requests this game a lot (more than 7 Wonders) and she wins a lot. That's good! My opinion about the game is starting to change: with some characters you will win, with others you won't... I haven't played enough to make this a hard statement, but the hardness of the statement is growing. Winning is of course not the purpose of this game and there is never a feeling that you are the loser, even if you lost. Playing this game after a hectic game is very satisfying: it really calms you down.

Edit 3: my gamer friend even requests it (I didn't bring it to our movie/game/pinball night) and wonders why there isn't much written about this game in the gameing media. He still requests the game regularly because of the beautiful art of the game alone...

Edit 4: the 'new' wore off. The game gets played only now and then if we want something relaxing on the table. Otherwise the game doesn't really provide a challenge (it gets better with the expansion, but not by much). These are my wife's words.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Absolutely love this game. It should really get a lot more love than it gets. For a zen-like, relaxing experience, the base game is perfect (the art contributes to that for sure). 

For a more involved, strategic game, add in the Crossroads expansion. This "10" rating is contingent on using the expansion. Without it, the game is still probably a "9". It is wonderful.

I think it's a lot of fun at 4 players(9).  3 players is more strategic but not as much fun for me because you don't seem to accomplish much(8).  2 players you do more and see more and can have more fun with it(9), except the dummy player has no goals or purpose except to be punitive to your opponent.

I'm not sure if its the art, which is very good, or the overall play of the game which attracts me to it but I've had a chance to get a number of plays under my belt and I've enjoyed it each time.  I have to say it doesn't work well with 2 players, three at a minimum would be my recommendation.

Quite pretty but perhaps a bit too comical in the art of the characters.  Pleasant enough game of wandering down the ancient Japanese road.  Never felt much stress nor any real theme connection, but still enjoyed it well enough.  A lot of air in that box, however.

But then it quickly passes because now it's your turn and you get to do something pleasant. Such a lovely game, truly.

RATING: 9
A very different game - a "zen like" game as was pitched to us when we bought it. This game is still competitive but at least we're not attacking one another. LOL -- probably best played with three or more players but that was just my initial feeling after playing it first. Gameplay takes about an hour - but will get faster I'm sure as time goes on. Very pretty game with a great mechanism of buying and collecting.

RATING: 7
A very beautiful and simple game.
Would say it's too light and luck-based to provide much replay value, but has really fun variable player powers and is a great gateway.

I spent some time looking at the actual set collection mechanisms and found them to be shockingly boring when looking at the raw gameplay of them. Interesting that this is one of the more popular set collection games.

Strangely simple, light-hearted and fun (in its own rights). If you're expecting a adrenaline rush, tons of strategies, complex logic and rules, then this isn't the game for you or for that particular moment. 

I love games that are challenging, full of twists and strategies, thick theme genre and complex but at certain moments and with certain audiences/players, games like Tokaido fit perfectly.

Set the expectations right and go with the flow...

This might be the only game I rate favorably that has no strategic merit at all. This will probably be the 3rd easiest game of your life after Chutes & Ladders or Candyland. It's is so terribly simplistic. 

But god damn it if the production value isn't on point. I love this game for what it is - an incredibly light break from life. It's so hard to capture in words why this game is a delight. It just is. Games don't have to be difficult or complex or have high strategic value to be FUN.

I tried this at Cancon and really liked it. The theme is rather fun and the gameplay is reminiscent of Jenseits von Theben with the last player moving until they are no longer the last player. This yeilds some pretty interesting decisions in a very entertaining game.

The pieces are well produced and the variety of characters are also quite nice and would, I imagine, add a fair bit of replayability to the game.

The only very minor quibble I have is the super-tiny score markers that don't suit my clumsy paws.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Tokaido is an appealing production, but not much of a game.  At 3 players, there are no significant choices.  At higher player counts, when more than one meeple can occupy a location, there can be actual choices - but even so; at the end of the game, you do not feel like you accomplished anything.

I think people are turned off by some linear choices where you aren't really the author of your own story, but it's really about making hard choices (efficiency vs. opportunity) to advance further down the track and get what you want now and passing up on other things or take what is in front of you and diversify your experience, but maybe allowing others to block what you ultimately desire.

Everyone I've played this with so far thinks this game is weird. It kinda is. The rules are extremely simplistic. The board is, in essence, a straight line. The goal is to have the most pleasant journey. Make some good friends, see some good sites, eat some good food.

And yet it *can* be a bit mean. People blocking your spots. How dare you paint that picture! *I* was going to paint that picture! Oh my gosh! Do you really need another friend! I need a friend... look at me, I'm friendless!

It's that combination of meanness and serenity that makes it an interesting game. 

Good art, interesting theme, perfect playing time, and simple rules that provide just enough meat to keep you interested throughout the game. 

Played: 12 or so times with many more online plays.

This is a strange beast. Very chill and simple, but it's basically a time-tracked point to point racing game with set collecting.

Most people prefer Takenoko to this, but I like this one better. The game is deceptively simple, in that it requires a little more forward-planning than you might imagine, and the set collection is interesting. Like Takenoko, it can feel a little derivative with each game played, but it still offers a solid, dependable experience. Really needs more players to keep it tight though.

UPDATE: Played this again recently, and my reaction was far less favorable. There just isn't much here to see after a few plays.

On design this is an absolute 10. 

Gameplay: Since every move offers you points, I've found what works best is to have a mean little mindset and try to get your opponents to play suboptimal moves, like running them out of money for one.
With 2 players, there is definitly something there. The dummy-player that you get to control adds a lot of this kind of screwage.

With 4 players, I do agree it needs something else, as the game plays itself to a good degree.


Either way, it's a very light gateway game. But since it plays quickly, lightly, and looks pretty, it's definitly something to break out at the start of an evening.

As a traveller in Imperial Japan, you go to different locations to build up your collection of cards. The trick with this game is that the board is one straight line to finsih points, and you can never go backwards.  So you have to trade off leaving things behind to get what you want.

It's a set collection game of panoramas, people, meals and so forth. It's a fun game, and a bit hard to analzye. I've only played 3 player, but I think it may play better with 4 or 5 players, as some areas allow 2 travellers. It's a neat mechanic, and some of the choices are really tough.

After playing this game many times I still enjoy it every time.  There is technically a winner, but each player travels their own path (although what that path can entail is influenced by your co-travelers), having their own experience.  A beautiful, meandering game that leaves one feeling refreshed and happy if you play with the intention of experiencing the journey and even periodically allow for a co-traveller to gain something they were hoping for, or perhaps incredibly frustrated and angry if you play to get the most stuff (it is after all a set collection game). 

Perhaps a bit of a metaphor for human life?

Absolutely gorgeous looking board. The art and feel of this game are unparalleled in my collection. The game is relaxing and wholly unlike anything else I own. However, this game is not particularly good at creating stories as each game plays very similarly to the last regardless of which character you play. Really hard for me to peg this game down. I am willing to play it every occasion I have to play games, but no more than once or twice.

Relaxing.  A bit too relaxing with 5 players, although there was a lot going on in the house during that game and so downtime between turns was perhaps longer than it might have been with a focused group.  

The artwork is stunning.  Everything about the design in this game is spot-on.  Can't wait to try this one again.

Easy to understand no-stress game.  I enjoy this one.  There are just enough decisions to make you feel like you are part of the game, but they just feel less stressful for a game like this, perhaps because of the theme?  I used this for some non-gamer friends and it was quite a hit.  

Great theme married to the mechanics of this game.

I kinda want to play this one again to try out a new strategy, but really I'd rather try to go back in time and to have tried those strategies out already. The game incorporates an interesting turn order mechanic from Glen More, but the point-scoring opportunities are a bit samey-samey, and overall the experience is a little boring.

Molto di questo gioco lo fa la grafica molto accattivante, snella ed elegante. Il gioco invece risulta molto semplice, ai limiti del ripetitivo, e le dinamiche strategiche non sono complesse. L'autore di Hanabi, 7 Wonders e Tokenoko presenta questo gioco adatto ai babbani che però si lascia giocare volentieri tanto da farmelo considerare un piccolo gioiellino. I punti di forza sono la mancanza di tempi morti, la durata giusta (contenuta), la tematica della passeggiata ben rappresentata e lo spirito meditativo orientale. A livello strategico il gioco è poco profondo anche se non manca una sufficiente interazione. Eccelso lavoro di marketing che offre un gioco con poco materiale, in alcuni casi nemmeno funzionale (i segna punti microscopici) in una scatola sproporzionata ad un prezzo abbastanza alto. I disegni e l'elganza però rendono questo gioco invitante come molto simpatico è lo sviluppo delle carte paesaggio. La versione base è un gioco rilassante adatto probabilmente ai meno competitivi. La mia valutazione sul gioco cresce se gli si affianca anche l'espansione Crossroad che a mio avviso lo completa e lo rende più fruibile anche da giocatori più assidui senza sconvolgerlo ma regalanso un po' più di interattività rendendo ogni scelta meno ovvia e banale.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Dropped my rating because after reflecting on my one play I realized that as awesome as the artwork is and zen the play experience can be there just isn’t enough going on to entice me to play it again. The decisions seem too straightforward which, in my opinion, would make repeated plays somewhat boring. Not a game I’d refuse to play again, but also not one I’m seeking out. [/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I really had a great time playing this game, it was completely laid back and chill. We played with the Crossroads expansion and to be honest I think I would enjoy just playing the base game. I wouldn't go into a game of Tokaido looking for depth of strategy, in my opinion it is an experience game. You truly feel like you are walking along this path and experiencing the journey. 

When you are looking for a game to play after a particularly stressful day and you need to relax take Tokaido off the shelf, sit back and enjoy a sublime experience.[/i]

Great lite traveling/journey and card collection game. This is a great gateway game as the choices are laid out visual for the player to follow and the scoring system is straight forward.

RATING: 4
After one play, I didn't see much depth to this game. I tried to find some strategy but you really just go the next closest space that gives you the most points.  Even blocking other players from their optimal spaces isn't a good move as this causes you, and the blocked player, to land on a suboptimal space while the other players land on optimal spaces and get ahead of you.  Maybe more strategy emerges with more plays.

RATING: 6
"Gorgeous production, and I love the time track mechanism. But it's quite cutthroat with 2-3p. Ignore those who say there are no decisions."

What I like:
- I love the elegant simplicity (of the game and the art)
- The "time track" mechanism is one of my favorites
- The game only lasts about a dozen turns (45-60 minutes)
- It rewards specializing, but makes that hard

What I don't like:
- Some icons can be hard to understand
- Some majority scoring, which isn't my favorite
- Official 2p rules allow for "mean" play, so I'll use a random variant
- It's a bit of a "point salad" game
- The insert looks good, but doesn't quite work as designed
- I wish the box were a standard size

It seems that the serene atmosphere aligns well with the gameplay. Each turn, you basically have to decide whether to take the next available spot, or to jump ahead just a bit to get something you really want.

2p is quite cutthroat, and 3p is somewhat cutthroat. It's probably most open with 4, and still fairly open with 5.

I think the BGG-voted 1.7 weight is reasonable.

You could describe this game as 'relaxing', as you're all travelers going down a path of sightseeing.  You get points for souvenirs, for panoramas, for dining at the inns along the way, for having encounters with interesting people, etc.  It's almost a vacation!  Then you remember that you've got to keep your neighbor from completing that panorama, or there's no way you're going to win... then the stressful decisions start.  Still, a GREAT game.

First off, beautiful game. Really lovely art and bits. 

The game play isn't quite as good, but it is very good as well. We played 2x (both 3P) in a row.  Initially concerned as outside of playing to character strengths, it seems you are really walking the footsteps the game has set before you with limited choice.

I DO feel this would be better with 4-5, as you get multiple player places on some of the destinations.

Tokaido is a casually-paced game about sight-seeing in old world Japan.  Players leisurely make their way down the game's path, stopping often to visit the various types of sites.  However, you can't go backwards, you can't go where someone else is, and you're constrained by money, which adds a little bit of urgency to make sure you can visit the sites that are important to your strategy.  On the whole, though, this is a very relaxing game that's not too deep, but has enough strategy to satisfy.

A fun "game" but I seriously question the amount of replayability this has. Looks nice, but not really a whole lot going on. Seemed like staying at the back of the pack was the key and led to people just taking the next available action.

Prententious presentation, but this game is boring. All moves are worth about the same. Making daring moves is punished, and so the game trudges on.

My rating is further lowered by the art of the game, which is beautiful, and not functional at all. Irrelevant art is more important than game-related iconography, and the pastel colours of the different actions have little relationship with the associated cards.

Haven't really played this enough to get a solid opinion of it.  Loved it when I bought it, but then have not played it much.  I can say I do not like the two (and maybe three? it has been so long) player version where you don't get to use the extra stops at the landmarks along the road, because then it just becomes a strategic game of blocking the other player from the spot that would trigger their special ability while making sure you get yours, but usually means both players sacrifice and skip far enough ahead to block the other and it is more luck than anything that wins, and at any rate its just no fun.  I do want to play this game and think it is beautiful, but refuse to play until I have at least 4 players (or three if that opens up the extra spaces I forget, but I think it's 4).

This was in Games Lore's 'damaged box' list, and at about half the usual price. It was described as badly damaged but with contents unaffected so I thought I'd take a chance.

This game is often described as "zen". However, I find it can lead to lots of aggressive blocking of your opponents and taking suboptimal moves to keep them from the spots that benefit them most.

A competitive point-scoring game with a clever lead-and-follow system.  You and your opponents are travelers in ancient Japan on the famous Tokaido, a scenic route across the country.  Your goal is to sample the cuisine, see the sights, buy some souvenirs, and make your trip the most memorable.  An ingenious rules mechanic allows you to move as far as you wish on any turn - with the caveat that the next turn is ALWAYS taken by the hindmost player.  Be as greedy or as cautious as you want, it balances out very neatly.

Journey across Japanese road.  Mechanics: variable player powers, worker placement, set collection, turn order/time track, multiple vp point generators. Beautiful artwork
'Zen like journey' but has modest interaction and few compelling decisions. Suitable gateway but some replay durability concerns. Ultimately too light, neutral traveler feels too mean; Crossroads xpac adds dice in a negative way, makes the problem of not having enough money to do what you want feel worse.

A beautiful but unsatisfying game. The art is very nice, but the gameplay is not terribly interesting. There are some hard decisions to make about whether to make sure you get a spot you really want or take an earlier spot and hope no one else takes the one you want before you get to it. This encourages the kind of "stop and calculate all the possibilities" way of playing that I really don't enjoy, and it slows down what really should be a fast game. The scoring is also very fiddly and calculation-heavy for a game with fairly light decisions. It's trying to be a beautiful, laid-back experience but the scoring breaks that. However, even if it had succeeded in being a laid-back game, that just isn't what I'm looking for in a game.

25.04.15: First game played in very slightly sub-optimal conditions (table too small for the number of players/length of board; playing with not 100% compatible (personality-wise) strangers) but enjoyed it nonetheless.

I imagine needing to be in a particular mood to want to play this game, but also that it will suit that mood extremely well, hence my overall score.

I tend to enjoy playing Tokaido but I have my concerns about how deep the strategy and tacits of the game actually are. Then again playing on BGA I tend to get trounced by the experts so there must be something more than I am seeing here. Still not sure I find the game interesting enough to explore to find that depth, and without doing so I usually feel my decisions are fairly meaningless within the game. Still it can be a rather relaxing stroll down the path which is a nice marriage of theme and gameplay.

What a gem. This is a work of art. The game is very calm, beautiful and mellow. The theme it's integrated superbly, you can even learn few facts about Japan from the manual.

Rules are relatively simple. You're just a traveler on your journey, and your goal isn't to be there first, but to amass good amount of great experiences and items - be it panorama views, encounters with locals, souvenirs from a village, or a bath in a hot spring. All these things grants you points during the game and you have resources (money) that are needed to control some of them. The game itself is just going forward, and the only mechanic here is to block others and realize your plan. You also have to adjust during the game if someone blocks your next desired visit destination. You'll learn something about Japan on the way, too - the names, meals, items - it stays with you.

I was quite surprised after the first play. I expected a child's play, judging from photos and manual, but it turned out to be a very nice, peaceful and aesthetically pleasing experience. This is not a game to play over and over, but once in a while, I suppose it's great. You play it not to win, but just for the experience. If counting points during the game is too troublesome and causes some analysis paralysis, then don't do that. All the things generating points stay with you, so you can as well count points by the end of the game, turning it into a possible surprise and anticipation.

It costs a little bit too much.

And last but not least, I absolutely love the minimalistic design of the box.

RATING: 7.5
I just don't think the gameplay or the art design/theme is as strong as people make them out to be.
Gameplay: a) While the simplistic gameplay is accessible to new gamers, the point valuation of each move isn't very understandable until after they've played multiple times. I guess as long as they don't care about losing, it could be considered a gateway game. 
b) The actions and character abilities are supposed to be roughly equal from each other, but I don't agree. Getting a weak character to start with puts you immediately behind another player, easily 5 points-worth by the end of the game.
c) The random element of the gift shop pisses me off. Spending 5 precious actions during the game, thereby seeing 15 cards, and not even being able to make one set (of 4) is a colossal game design mistake for a strategic game. It's very similar to Thebes' mistake, where it doesn't matter how many resources you strategically invest, you can easily come up empty.

Art design/theme: While the minimalist pastel color/art scheme invokes ancient Japan, there's something missing. It's just so flat and card-based. If they could have incorporated some figures or other 3-d elements it would improve greatly.
While the gameplay does suggest a trip, wandering from location to location based on what's crowded or not, I just felt I was optimizing points. Especially the art locations, it felt solely a point/set-collection exercise, not a vacation/trip/journey.

Tactical take-aways:
Don't fight other players for locations if you can help it. Like so many other games, if you are competing directly with someone else, you will be expending too many resources for those points.
Try to focus on the locations that aren't being fought over.
I believe the monkey pools are a more reliable source of points. Typically 2.5 points per visit, plus the achievement for 3 more.
The art locations are 2 points per visit, 2.5 points per, and 3 points per and require 3, 4, and 5 visits each respectively.

Oh, and it simply doesn't make sense to score as you go in this game - just carefully add the points from the cars at the end of the game.

I want to love this game. I really do. The artwork is fantastic, the laidback and "experience beauty" theme is so so clear.

But it is boring. So so boring. And for that matter it seems that the rules about initial coins are never enough to garnish points past the second village. It seems on a "to win" point of view, the best way to win is to just visit every damn scenery you can as the most points given is through such.

A very slow, but beautiful game though - and to be fair, the objective is to enjoy every artwork and a relaxing time to not worry about the points. It does that well, but it is very little "game" to Tokaido. It is like "The Game of Life" but easier, and less interesting, with better art.

Great game. It seems easy and playing by itself , first impression couldn't be more wrong here. You can plan many moves ahead and you have all imformation exposed. Beautiful art and easy rules make it easy to learn and hard to master game.

I think the main reason it is not as well recognized as it should is a common missconception about how light this game is. And for light gamers who don't like to plan ahead not only for yourself but also for your enemies this game seem very luck-driven. In my opinion they just missed target of their otherwise great and beautiful game.

RATING: 7.5
It's odd, but this is the kind of game where you're actually a bit surprised to get exactly what you're expecting. The whole thing really is just a relaxing walk to Edo with your friends.
There's a small amount of strategy to the game, and yes, there will be a "winner", but Tokaido is almost more like background "music" to a social event. It will probably be over before you know it.
Overall: It's really more of an experience than a game. It feels weird storing Tokaido on my game shelf because I never want it judged as such. Very neat.

I have only played this once, so maybe I'll change my mind with subsequent plays.  My initial impressions are below.

Pros :
Very nice artwork

The board is very "clean" and looks inviting.

The theme is very original.

Cons :
Despite looking great, the cards seem made of lower quality materials than I would expect.  I was worried the cards would crease if I tried to riffle shuffle them.

I felt the game kind of played itself.  I won the game, but I can't explain how I did.  There is some strategy in blocking an opponent, but then you often cause yourself not to capitalize on your own advantages.  Typically I just tried to take what was given and move along the board as slowly as possible to get the most turns.

I felt too limited in what I was able to do... Constantly.  The theme is great. The art is fantastic. 

You end up being locked out of so many places that it's pretty obvious what your best option is each turn.

You can end up having little to no currency for the majority of the game because other people will inevitably take those locations before you can get there.

I won't ever play this game again.

I bought this game on sale. Then I heard Wheaton was playing it on Tabletop, so I dusted it off and opened it up, only to be disappointed. It's a good game, but not a great game. Very nice artwork, but the atmosphere of a gentle journey through Japan was ruined by the competition. But even the competition was a let-down, there was so little strategy. And little luck. The more I think about it, the more it seems like grown-up Candyland.

At first the game doesn't seem to have much meat to it but there are really interesting push the game and defensive decisions that you must weigh your options.  There is a decent amount of luck in this game but it is rules light so it fits very well in the family game category however, it doesn't seem that the luck factor is too powerful unless you are just really unlucky.  Fun game with great artwork and style that combines set collecting with economic management of coin and time with a little sight seeing.

I was skeptical before I ever played Tokaido and it kept me from playing for years. I'm sad that I waited so long, because it’s as beautiful as everyone said. Yes, it’s technically boring. No, there are not a lot of critical choices. However, even with those strikes against it its exactly what it sets out to be – an enjoyable shared journey. We’ve decided that Tokaido is a vacation simulator. There are a ton of things you want to do on your vacation but you can’t possibly do all of them so the way to have the best vacation ever is to focus on just the right activities.

BEAUTIFUL artwork in this game. This game was actually much better than I expected. I thought it was going to be too simple with no decisions, but that wasn't the case. It definitely benefited from playing as a 5 player game. I think the higher the player count, the more interesting the game plays. A decent, fun game that would play well with non-gamers. Experienced gamers should only play this with 5 (or maybe 4 players

I played this for the first time after a three hour beast of a game and felt refreshed enough afterwards to immediately tackle Kemet.  The heavy gamers and new gamers in our group all like this very much.  Plus, it is easy to explain to non-gamers.

This does not feel like a "filler" even though the play time is short.

I already kind of hate games that incorporate turn order manipulation heavily into their actions. Especially in worker placement games. It's just so ubiquitous as to feel cliche, and I'd rather spend those workers on something more immediately satisfying and awesome. Can't we just pass turn order around, or something?
Anyway, maybe that's why I disliked this game - a sort of knee-jerk revulsion to the fact that this game is one long turn order competition.

It's tough to say... but I think this may be an Antoine Bauza Opus. I love 7 Wonders... and I didn't know if there would be a game that I could as heartily associate him with. However, slowly but surely, I am more and more and more enamoured with the flow, balance and strategy of this game. I think Tokaido goes toe to toe with 7 Wonders, and may even be better. I love all of the expansions and I love the game at all player counts. Really impressive, beautiful, and it holds a permanent spot in my collection.

Once the basic movement and scoring rules of Tokaido are explained, it plays very quickly and easily. This makes for a great introductory game for those new to tabletop games. The theme stands up well, and surprises you with its immersion (or, at least I was surprised!). I'm neither a Japan-ophile nor a history buff, but I found Tokaido provided a great sense of walking the road from Edo to Kyoto.

I play my friends copy all the time. It is for me the most enjoyable game to play. Beautiful, strategic but peaceful. I highly recommend this game to 'gamers' and 'non-gamers' alike. As an added bonus, the two player variant makes for a great game, something that is not always the case! Antoine Bauza is a very skillful creator of pleasure and fun!

This game plays like a Sunday afternoon walk. It's laid back, competitive but not in a head to head way, and has beautiful art and a unique theme.I like that the winner is the one who has the "best journey" and if I want to play something but not be too serious, this is the game. I can't say enough about the artwork...truly amazing.

There's only 1 rule: the time track (last player takes an action), and everything else is just scoring madness + artwork. Problem is the spaces are so balanced that there isn't much point to jump ahead, which makes things less interesting when players are competing at being the slowest. Spaces are always the same, hindering replayability.

Played with 4.  Everyone (except me) liked it.  Easy to teach, great aesthetic, sort-of-satisfying set-collection.  Actually think it would be more interesting/competitive with 3 or 5 (not sure why people say it's best with 4, except that with 5 it might drag a little between your turns?).

Update (May, 2014):  played with 2 and it was pretty dull (using the "dummy" player does throw some screwage in, but it's not very fun) - there's really not much to this game, but I'll give it a few more go's with different groups since I suspect it can serve a function as a gateway game in my collection (however, I'd *probably* prefer to play Ticket to Ride over this)

Update (November, 2014):  Have now played this 4 times, and I've decided it's just too boring to pull out.  The aesthetic and theme are refreshing, but the gameplay is horrible.  No significant choices to make.  Would rather play Ticket to Ride, and that's saying something.

RATING: 1.5
I won't lie that I expected anything good from this game after reading Martin's [thread=874185]excellent review[/thread], but my experience confirms his points more or less exactly. As everything you do give you 2-3 points, I felt the game plays itself as most choices were obvious and the choice which mattered the most was which of 2 character to choose from before starting. So, it's a low interaction game, some tedious blocking, as samey as it gets, but with cutesy art which is abused for promoting such uninspired game. The whole theme and approach, I feel,  would deserve a more adventurous designer than Bauza(travelling around was an important feature in 18th, 19th century Japan), someone who could blend it with some story telling. Something more TotAN style. A missed opportunity for something truly original. 

Expansion is just more of the same. Or: the same, but more.

RATING: 3
Everyone already knows this is a beautiful game with an original and lovely theme, etc. What matters is the game play, which has been - fairly - compared to Candyland. On your turn you go to the next available space that makes any sense for you (i.e. if you have money you go to the next space, otherwise you go to the next space you can afford), draw a card and do what it says. The only clear decision is whether to gamble spending money now for a few points against the possibility that you won't have enough for a few more points next round. That's it.

Defenders of this game say that the other decision - whether to skip forward more a few spaces to get something special (in exchange for giving your opponent extra turns) - is where the heart of the game lies, but from what I have seen I call bull. In the comparable game - Glen More - that decision makes sense, because you are getting something very highly valued in exchange for the turns you give up; sometimes 18 or more points, and each additional turn you gave up is also -3 points for the person who takes it. In this game, the MOST you will get by jumping forward a few spaces is 3 extra points, and EVERY turn nets you 2-5 points, so it is NEVER worthwhile to lose turns.

I would be happy to be proven otherwise, but until then this remains a thing of beauty that will I hope to never play again.

RATING: 5
Played once with 3P. Tokaido is an oppressively pleasant game to play. It revolves around a [thing=66362][/thing]-esque turn order track, which is great, except that every single location gives you VP of some sort. (Well, the Farm is an exception since it gives you coins. But coins are eventually converted to VP anyway.) Consequently, there is no incentive to jump too far ahead on the track to scoop up points, because opponents who lag behind can pick up just as much VP. 

To be fair, there are opportunities for interaction under the veneer of niceness. It is worthwhile getting into the Inn early if your opponents lack coins, or taking up a coveted slot to deny an opponent a point or two. The trouble is, most casual Euros can accomplish the same thing and still offer a deeper experience. Tokaido has a niche as a family-friendly game, but there's not much it can ultimately offer beyond its amazing aesthetics (not counting that glitch of a score track) and gentle aura.

Get this game. Period. 
It became my personal favorite the moment I opened it. This hidden gem is all about the journey. The winner is the player that has had the most fulfilling experience traveling between two historical cities in old Japan. Hot springs, souvenir shops, and other wonderful experiences are waiting to be had. I would describe this as a mellow mood game, but if players decide to sabotage (most commonly by occupying spaces other players get perks for) it can escalate to Mario Kart levels of competition. 

I cannot stress enough how beautiful the art is. The characters are so memorable and distinct, the meals at the inns look delicious, and the panoramas are gorgeous. The game board looks deceptively bare compared to most games but the wide expanses really instill a sense that you're traveling a great distance. 

I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this game, except maybe if you somehow lost the rulebook you might not be able to identify the effects of certain cards. None of them have text written on them, but rather pictures of what they do and those can be hard to decipher sometimes.

Overall this is a must have, go get one, like right now.

The best thing I have heard about this game is, "The artwork is beautiful."  There never seems to be much said about the actual game play.  Now I know why; this isn't a very good game.  On top of that, I don't think that the artwork even that appealing.  To each his own, I guess...  At any rate, this game seems to play itself.  There are not really any significant decisions to be made.  It's obvious that it's best to stop at as many places as possible along the road in order to maximize the amount of options taken.  As a result, this game is simply and exercise of leap frog.  Very rarely does anybody not just take the next available spot at the front of the line.  Although the game moves along fairly quickly, it is BORING and not very engaging.  If you are attacted to the LOOK of the game, be sure to try PLAYING it before committing to actually buying it.  Doing so may help avoid some disappointment later...

Simple yet engaging, very easy to teach and quite addictive. If you've got the right kind of friends to play with, gets surprisingly competitive as the denial strategy pops up. If you've got more laid back friends, the game also works just as well. It's really versatile. I just wish there were a few more character options in the box. As is, the core game shows how unbalanced the character roster is rather easily.

This game is a bit different, which I like. You are a traveler on a journey (the ancient Tokaido road in Japan), and you make stops along the way to do "touristy" things. You do score points and there is a winner, but the game has a more relaxed feel similar to Agricola/Caverna where you can sit back at the end of the game and enjoy all the things you did and collected along the journey.

1 play, all newbies

Yeah, it's kinda pretty, but it's not at all what I was expecting based on all the hype! I thought I'd see something more simple, more like Japanese line drawings or something. It has a nice board, but I'm not nearly as enthusiastic about it as others seem to be. The icons are also kind of on the teeny weenie side!

Game play, too, is just okay. It didn't seem to any of us that there were a lot of choices, really: mostly, you chose based on turn order, what your special power was, and what few spaces were available before the next inn. Clearly more choices may appear with repeated play as we might learn more nuances in the game, but I doubt any of us are excited to play this one again. Too light for its own good! Maybe it would be better with fewer players, and with a different audience.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
This is a set-collection game with a Japanese theme.

The board shows a road with several types of stops (some with multiple places, for use with larger player counts). Players start the game with a unique character, which will generally give them some kind of bonus associated with one of these location types. Players' meeples all start on one end, and will be moving one way down the path. The player furthest back always moves next, to a free spot. Each spot can only accommodate one token, so people will be skipping different spots. The inns, though, are required stops -- people will pause there until everyone else has caught up, and then begin forward progress again.

Each of the stops has an action (donate cash to the temple) or a different deck (most) associated with it. The decks have different types of cards: 
- collect parts of 1 of 3 types of panoramas, gradually (hopefully) finishing it; earn VP with each new card. There are bonus VP awarded to the first player to complete each panorama.
- simply earn some VP right away
- buy souvenirs, for different costs and worth different VP
- etc.

At the inn, players may buy food cards (must sample different type at every inn); the earlier players get more choices (draw n+1 cards; earlier to arrive choose first).

Once everyone reaches the final inn, there are end-game bonuses for having the most of each of the different card types, and for rank of contributions to the temple. Most VP wins!

This is a pretty accessible game about players going on a tourist vacation through Japan.  I have taken one trip to Japan myself and loved it there, the culture, the food, the atmosphere, it was all very unique and enjoyable.  This game does a pretty decent job of mimicking that and making a game out of it.

The gameplay itself is very simple.  Each turn players move as many spaces as they like and choose any available space and take the action for that space.  It can be many different things, most of which provide points, such as buying souvenirs, visiting a temple, or painting a picture.  Gameplay continues like this until all players have reached the end of the map and then tally scores.

The simple gameplay itself is what soured me a bit on an otherwise very pretty and interestingly themed game.  There is no benefit to finishing first.  Getting to each inn first gives you more options of which food to buy and you can't buy the same food more than once but it seemed like there was enough of a variety that this wasn't that big of a deal.  There was a little bit of pushing and shoving with taking spaces other players might want right before their turn but for the most part you want to move as short a distance as possible each turn to get the most stuff making the decisions not very deep or interesting.

I've played similar "move as far as you like" games such as Francis Drake but there is always an added benefit to skipping spaces, such as in Francis Drake where the first person to most spots gets greater benefits (or sometimes even the only benefit) out of that space and finishing the entire action track first gives you better turn position in the second phase.  Here the actions are always the same no matter when you get to them and the only benefit of getting places first in a greater selection from an already pretty large pool.

The game does look very nice.  The artwork is stylish and pretty and does evoke a Japanese aesthetic.  It is probably a very good game for very casual/simple gamers but not something I'm over the moon about.

A game about traveling, yay. At first I wasn't sure if this was anything more than good looks but I really enjoyed playing it. Sometimes simple can be so satisfying, I think that is what Tokaido does. It is fun to collect souvenirs, panorama shots, encounter cards, etc., and the turn order rule where always the player most behind makes the next moves really has something going for it. I'd love to play this more, it is such a calm yet engaging game experience, really nice.
After a few more online games I have to say I am almost addicted, totally enraptured by this simple game right now.

Puts forth some interesting ideas on how far forward do you want to push in order to get the spots you really want vs just straight up hitting more spots along the way.  Basically a game of quantity vs quality.

Had I not been forced at pointy stick-point to play this with 4 players some time after my first 2 plays with just 1 opponent, I would have probably rated this game a "1" based on my 2-player experience.  However, playing it with 4 at least helped me to see that there actually IS a game in here.  Not a terribly fun game, mind you, but one that is easy to play, provides a decent amount of tension in an otherwise serene setting, and includes several different paths to victory.  I don't like the sparse design of the game board at all, and find it to be visually boring and functionally difficult to locate the available spaces around the players' pawns.  Which is a shame, because the artwork on the cards is quite nice.  I'd play it again if someone pointed that stick in my direction, but otherwise would be happy to give it a pass.  Game design: 2.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 1.5/5  Total: 4/10

Quick filler, nice artwork. Not much game -- move down the track, land on a space, probably get points. Just enough luck of the draw that any thought you put in is probably wasted. You can just see the potential for blocking if you squint, but it's all about taking away 5 points here so they only get 3 points there. 

The standards for 30 minute fillers are pretty low, but there's nothing remotely interesting about this one.

Beautiful set collection game that is pretty constrained in strategic and tactical options, even for a lightweight non-gamery game.

RATING: 3.5
That's 3.5 points for the artwork - the game itself is awful.

I blind bought it for the great graphics but all that did was teach me to not blind buy ever again.

Despite what one might think it is not a good family game. It's too simple even for that (my mother wondered why I bought such a dull game which tells me a lot about Tokaido...). In my experience it's also significantly worse with 5 players than with 3. With 3 players, there are at least some decisions to be made, with 5 - nope, nothing. The board actually has more options in the 5-player variant but obviously that doesn't help at all - it just makes the game take longer...

I also have some complaints about the components: the pieces used to keep track of the points are ridiculously small. If one of those things falls off the table you'll never find it again.
The scoring track has the point values ordered in a completely unintuitive zig-zag way. Why would you do that!?
The box inlay is odd - the box is huge but the inlay has very small pockets, too small for all the cards for instance. Why!?

My impression is that Funforge wanted to turn the awesome artwork into a game asap and then rushed it. This game - both rules and components wise - was not sufficiently tested.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Light and pretty game. Not sure how many choices it really has, but trying to gather the various souvenirs and visiting places is fun. Can get a little vicious as players start blocking money areas. The board is a little annoying; the actual game areas are tiny, with lots of white space around it.

Nice feeling and good gameplay. Although cards and board is fine quality, it lacks some fundamentals to make it outstanding: Cards are difficult to organize - the missing obvious colors are missing. The point tokens are to small and so is the game board.

However I successfully played it with my 5y old daughter once or twice and she liked visiting the inns and looking at the nice food items, souvenirs etc.

So, good idea, good gameplay, nice design but to small items and missing some obvious designs to make it really good.

Tokaido is a lovely game. It is simple, light, and excellent for gamers who aren't interested in long, fiddly affairs.

Tokaido is a gorgeous piece of visual art, too, and there's a surprising bit of depth to the play. It is a game of competative math set in a fluid, carefree package that just whizzes by in a flash. This is a game that I could see being easily overplayed as the depth of play isn't matched with a depth and variety of experience. But it's so short and delightful, I'd expect to play it twice everytime it hits the table. :)

Unique, well thought-out, incredible aesthetic design, exceptional merging of form and function in the components ... everything about it is top class.

Note: I hate some minor component issues with the coins. They didn't punch out very nicely as the cardboard was too pliable and not cut-through enough. Two of them ended up ruined. The other components all faired well though and I don't anticipate running out of coins in the bank so I'm not going to bother replacing the broken ones. Also the insert is a little befuddling but I've gotten used to that by now and am instead surprised by an insert that both fits everything well and makes organizational sense.

Meh, I was really excited to get this game based on the reviews here. I have played it with 3, 4, and 5 players so I cannot vouch for 2 player game. Each game it almost seems that you just move to the next spot or sometimes the spot thereafter. The game winner can almost be calculated by start order and character cards. Each time we play, and I have played 10+ times because my kids like it, it is like reading a formula novel. (The first chapter tells you how it will end with very few surprises in between.)

Disappointingly dull, with the decisions you make having very little outcome on the final result; unless you do something stupid like jumping ahead 5 spaces from everyone else. In which case you'll guarantee that you'll lose.

Each space is worth, broadly speaking, the same value, so the key to winning is basically to take lots of micro steps and move forward as few spaces as possible and hope the hot springs or the people you meet on the way don't screw your chances.

It's hard to hate because it's just so inoffensive and it *is* very pretty (if a little infographic-y), but I saw nothing of interest.

This is a beautiful game concept. Art is gorgeously on theme and an appreciable amount of research went into most details. A wonderful noteworthy aspect of Tokaido is: even if you don't win, you feel like you have a story to tell about your trip. Although, for a game about a leisure vacation trip, most plays devolve into upsetting your opponent's route more than following your own.

A fun game, I could see this really working well for families.  Basically you are exploring Tokaido to collect things and have a better traveling experience than the other players.  When I last played this the min-maxer in the group absolutely dominated the score.  I am a bit fearful this game is easy to have snowball but other than that it has great art, theme, and fun.

Update: I am decreasing this game score a bit.  If you play with someone who maximizes the move mechanic and other player's are not competitive the player maximizing moves is going to win this game hands down.  It is unfortunate such a specific strategy can win so frequently, it seems like the move mechanic in the game is effectively broken.  The game is at best a 7 for me now, I think with the right crowds this can still be enjoyable but with serious board gamers you might find this frustrating.

We have enjoyed this game in the first three plays.  we put some Japanese folk music on, get some tea and play for about 40 minutes tops.  It's very smooth and rather thematic for what it is.  Beautiful game and we'll probably keep it for quite a while.  My daughter, at nine, never refuses a play and that's saying something.

Exceptionally pleasant game. I'd even describe it as charming. It's light, but it isn't trying to be anything but. Still, the ability to block other players adds a touch of welcome cut-throat, and you do need to be smart about optimizing your actions. For a meatier game with a similar action selection mechanic, try Egizia or Glen More. Yet if you prefer a game that goes well with families or socialization, stick with Tokaido.

I've heard it referred to as a 'Zen' game, and that it is. There are points everywhere, and therefore scoring isn't a tricky feat. Money however, is a bit tighter, and there is enough difficulty in trying to work out how far down the track you should go to either block opponents from getting good actions (such as money, a favourite trick of mine particularly in the two player variant) or whether a later action is more valuable to you than smaller ones along the way. And there is always the risk you might get blocked, too. 

Sure it's a borrowed mechanic, and I have a suspicion I would like Egizia more, but this is a nice rendition of the system also.

Set collection game that almost plays as a worker placement game.
You are a traveler walking from Kyoto to Tokyo and want to have the best journey out of everyone. Player the furthest from the end moves, but each space can be blocked so  players may find their selves passing stops along the track trying to reach their own goals, but moving too far forward gives everyone else more options or even turns.

Pretty chill but features some nice decision making.

Also it looks freaking so sweet. That art style man.

A pleasant tactical game where the "take that!" moments still never feel all that harsh. It's obviously a bit on the light side, but is easy to teach and beautiful to look at. What makes the game great is how pleasant it is to play which can't really be seen from looking at its parts or the rules, I don't think I've ever played a game that felt quite so pleasant.

There are a lot of things to like about this game.  The theme is interesting... trying to have the best trip, see the best sights, eat the best foods, get the best souvenirs, etc.  And the board and cards are pretty.  

Doing things usually gives you points and being the one to do things first or most usually gives you a bonus.  There are only a set number of spots per round to go to and if you jump ahead to do things you really want to do, you'll have to wait until everyone passes you.  And at a certain point everyone makes a dash for the inn to guarantee a good dinner they haven't tried yet.

On paper it hit all the right notes... but it fell a little flat for me.  I think I'd prefer something a little deeper.  It's not a bad game, but it's not something I'll be trying to play either.

RATING: 6
[thing=123540][/thing] was severely criticized by friends with strong opinions towards games, and even though I wanted to know it for years, not even its release in Brazil was enough to bring it to a table I was in, considering the amount of distaste accumulated - with the main critique being that the choices in the game were obvious and, with everything being almost equality good, jumping ahead was seldom required; they didn't found the tough decisions in left things behind such as those found in [thing=58421][/thing].

Now, having played, I admit that, although the criticism was oversized, it wasn't completely misleading: [thing=123540][/thing] is filled with easy choices and does required few big steps forward - usually we kept just taking the first open space ahead, as there is no limit of places to stop (which pushes for prioritizing) and the places repeat often. Furthermore, there several random elements, due to the random draw of cards from several decks, in which players are often just hoping for the best. Finally, the special abilities of the characters don't seem all that well balanced, as there were clearly those better and those worst.

Still, with all these rough edges, the flow of the game is quick and pleasant, with small downtime between turns and a rhythm of constant advancement. [thing=123540][/thing] doesn't demands the level of strategy and planning present in [thing=58421][/thing], nor [thing=140603][/thing], going in the route of opportunism and tatical play, and, because of this, the time of play is reduced and the pace is faster, making it an option for a lighter and uncompromised, while providing several decision points, regardless of how easy these are.

In the end, [thing=123540][/thing] isn't the winner I was expecting, but with such a pretty art, a speedy resolution, the open eye for windows of opportunity, make the game pleasant enough for me to be willing play it on occasion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I like the time track (although it's not overtly presented as one) but as the game is a point salad, with little else going on other than collecting/doing things that can potentially result in scoring points, it's not very interesting or tense.

The only thing I really thought was interesting are the several mandatory stopping points along the trip where players must draft food cards that are basically all the same except for their cost. So if you don't prepare to have money for this, you risk being unable to score the considerable points for eating. (It's basically a punishment, but this game doesn't implement any way to lose points, so you just fail to get points.)

The game says to score everything as you go, but certain things are easier to score at the end of the game, so our group adopted a confusing mixed system.

It's very pretty. And there is a game there, but not that much of one. It's unfortunate for the game that it plays very much like a gentler version of Tutankhamun. This isn't a terrible thing, but I'd rather play Tutankhamun, and if I want a gentler or less AP-prone version of the game, I'd rather play Gelini Nightlife (which is faster and simpler).

I thought I would like this game; I really wanted to! It's beautiful, to be sure. And I've played only twice, so not exactly an experienced review. But the first game, as 2-player, was dreadfully boring. (However, note that the person I played with always sent the dummy player forward to the next inn, so she didn't have to deal with it!) The second game, as 3-player, was definitely better, but still too few real choices. This is just too lightweight and luck-based for me, apparently.

Unfortunately, I felt a little underwhelmed after playing Tokaido. I really love the artwork and components, but the gameplay just does not live up to the looks of the game. The "relaxed" gameplay borders on being boring depending on the group you play it with. It really is a pure set collection game with a "last person moves first" mechanic. Still, I would not mind playing it every now and then as a filler, if only for the fantastic artwork. And my 11 year old son really likes it.
UPDATE: With the Crossroads expansion, I rate the game a 7. The expansion really adds some much needed decision making.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I love the 'laid-back' nature of this game.  You meander down the trial taking as many stops as you would like.  The components add to this theme.  Soft colors for the meeples, and mostly white board, with beautifully drawn cards add up to a relaxing different board game experience.

Great artwork and components, but unfortunately there just isn't much of a game. With the rules essentially punishing players for jumping ahead to fast, there tends to be very little significant decision making, and ultimately the winner more often than not wins from lucky draws rather than from merit. All in all, Tokaido is a cute box of components that is too light for my taste.

Rated 7 for being very light zen-like and for 2 players.  

Surprised anyone has rated this as "not recommended" for 2p.  2p is where at least some light strategy is possible.  The dummy player acts as a way to block the other player.  Game will be even lighter with more than 2.

At 2p also view this as a far more enjoyable experience to Takenoko which is cute, but repetitive and lacks the zen feeling of Tokaido.

Not a game I want to play all the time, but it's enjoyable and pleasing.  It's the game I wished Takenoko was going to be.

I know lots of folks don't like this one because it's not as strategic and seems to meander.

The meandering doesn't bother me. I've heard it described as Candyland for adults, but I think it's Eye Candy Land. It's just so pretty.

RATING: 3
An interesting design and exercise.

However, I find the gameplay lacking.  For me this falls into more of an activity than a game.  The entire game boils down to an exercise in push your luck with the goal of set collection.  You choose a strategy early on in the game.  What sets (eating, painting, meeting people, shopping, etc...) am I going to focus on?  You do some minor adjustment early as you see what other people are going for.  Then the rest of the game boils down to a push your luck experience of do I jump straight to the best spot for me or can I get another free action along the way?

I enjoyed the experience but there is no meat here and nothing that calls me back for another play.

Pleasant and beautiful (Kathy's pick, so +.5) but a bit too simple for my tastes (but better than Hanabi, at least). Wondering what the expansions will add (and if I can even find them). [-]Have to get a replacement for one of the Traveler tokens (meeples)[/-]... our copy came with one missing an arm, and half a leg. Oh, and we also seem to have received the version with the botched insert; the Traveler tiles don't fit (the slot is too small)... and, then, the coins. Yes, it's all very "Zen"... rubs Buddha belly *sigh* A wonderfully beautiful box of disappointment.

surprisingly good with 2p (controlling the dummy is very strategic, allows to block your oponent's strategy or force him to move where you want him/her to move)

[-] scoring is often so close, game can be decided on 1 mistake or on some luck of the draw: UPDATE: increased rating from 6 to 7 after multiple play online (~20) with all player counts and clearly you have control and strategy is important (I won more than half of those games) especially the 2p game which is great!

Very pretty, but gameplay is quite boring.  Classic example of a game that plays you.  The method of moving along the track may not be roll-and-move, but it's barely more interesting.  Add in staid every-Euro-you've-ever-played scoring mechanisms with minimal differentiation in scoring efficiency, and it is interminably boring.  Even though the art is gorgeous, the game is too vapid to allow me to care.  No thanks.

2016-11-02 - Bought; boardgamebliss.com

2016-08-12 - It's a fairly simple game with the "last person on the track goes first". This can lead to a player with more than one turn in succession. Every spot on the board will earn some sort of VP. It's kind of a race to collect sets (of food, landscapes, onsen, etc.) 

For me, this is a no stress, gentle game; it "flows". You are on your way from Tokyo to Kyoto (or vice versa) and you can choose how to wander. Visit temples, make donations, chit chat with other travelers, buy trinkets, visit onsen, paint/admire landscapes and stay at ryokan to enliven your spirit. 

Different enough from my regular interests to play every once in a while.

I really, really like Tokaido for it's simple, almost relaxful game style. The game is competitive but not so much that you are ganging up on people and jumping around everywhere. You are just simply following the trail and competition shines through to an extent. Most of the time, the players are busy focusing on their own strategy and thus the competitive play only shines through near the end of the game and even this is very mild. It is set up so that if you played your turns right at the beginning and middle of the game, you can still win at the end of the game even with the extra competition.

It is a relaxing game to play with no analysis paralysis. In my first game, I could circulate among my other guests when not my turn. Although, it took a bit of time to explain the rules. We also messed up which points were scored immediately. This didn't actually affect the result.

It's nice to play with people who are mischievous, but not really invested in winning.

This is both a charming and beautiful game. For my tastes though, I think people tend to oversell that description. It's true, but honestly it is kind of boring when it comes to the play experience. There are a couple of moments from game to game that might demand a decision, but for the most part you just move one space and draw a card that gives you some points. It's pretty boring and utterly unchallenging, to all but the most inexperienced gamer...but I suppose there are plenty of those out there that give this game its  raisons d'être.

With beautiful artwork and serene gameplay, this game achieves something special: relaxation. Sure, it may in essence be a Euro racing game to grab the most VPs... but those who agonize over how to win are missing the point. This game is a lovely way to sooth bruised egos and tense minds after heavier strategy games.

To note: only play with a super-competitive friend if you want to see them nash their teeth over how relaxed everyone else is that so-and-so blocked the last trip to the hot springs.

Brilliant art and a playful tone throughout.

I was really disappointed with this. When I saw pictures I thought it looked gorgeous but in real life it all looked a bit small and similar. I understand that it is a long road and thematically it works with one long in a line road but it meant that everyting was (un)necessarily small which meant it was not clear to see and took away from the artwork and the playing. On top of that the game itself didn't exist for me: move to the next available slot left by oppenents and hope you turn over something good and then hope they leave you something better next time. Very disappointed.

The gameplay is very easy even though for the newbie to easily learn play it for the first time, wish that i have the collector edition also :D

Very enjoyable, solid family game. Very good theme, nicely treated, amazing minimalistic graphic. The idea of the landscapes is gorgeous!
Plays fast, it's interesting, you can follow different paths to victory and you can't follow all of them.
Played in 2, wrong rules (forgot the dummy player) and it was very good. I want to play it again soon with correct rules. Anyways, very good family game.

The art and graphic design in this game are great, but the gameplay is too shallow even for gateway fare. While the idea of doing actions to get VP and seeing who got the most after an hour or so is already the most uninspired approach to game design imaginable, this doesn't even do it well: players choose one of only two or so viable options each turn. To its credit, the turn order mechanic is a good fit and means having to pay attention to the actions of other players more than other games of its ilk.

Asian thematic travel along a path of stops to collect and score sets of the most interesting vacation culinary, thrill, and cultural moments.  Different ways to succeed with variable traveler powers and a last-person-on-the-path turn order.  The theme, humor and artwork warm my heart.

Good family game. Easy for young players to understand. Multiple paths to victory and variable player powers adds replay value.

Not all scoring options are balanced: a single set of souvenirs is worth 16 points, compared to 6 from the green panorama.

I enjoyed the game, but it was only minor fun.

RATING: 6.3
I really wanted to try this but it wasn't as good as I was hoping. While there is strategy I felt that it was very limited and my choices were more determined by what was left rather than what I wanted. I played it with 5 players.
I do think it would be a very good game for maybe trying to get people into the hobby of board games and/or for people who don't like heavier games.

RATING: 3
If I got points for daydreaming I would have won. 

The earthworm-style group movement - where one player jumps ahead a few spaces (not too many!), and then everyone quickly catches up and crowds the area - creates very few choices and very little entertainment.

Overall, the most pointless game that I've played in a long time.

RATING: 7
This is a beautiful game. It seems like it is very evenly balanced. You are traveling across Japan and stopping at various places along the way. It is puzzle-like in getting to the end in a winning position.

Simple, family style euro game (hunting for points) with some strategies (different for 2-3 and 4-5 players). There is something strangely pleasant and addictive in moving pawns from dot to dot and collecting sets of different things. 2 players game is clever and surprisingly competitive.

I really love this game. The only reason why I haven't rated it higher is because it's so simple and I just wish there was more complexity to it. The artwork is simply stunning and shines through in all the games components. A game where the true essence is the journey you take and the things you come across along the way.

RATING: 5
GORGEOUS and interesting in its "laid back" theme.  Two things detract from its appeal for me.  One, all the iconography and such is too much for a gateway.  Two, it's too competitive for a "laid back" game.  I am constantly blocked when I play this- it gives me all the frustration of a medium-to-heavy worker placement with none of the "building something" reward.

Simple, eloquent, self-proclaimed "relaxing zen-like" game. I don't think I'd go with zen-like, but it is exceedingly easy to play and who doesn't love set collection? Whomever is the furthest back takes a turn and each spot offers you points in different ways. Love it, great gateway or game night starter.

Tokaido is an excellent gate way game, and just a pleasant time in general. It's simple enough to where most people will have no issues learning the rules, but still allows players to make clever moves which can deny other players things that they really want. The art is gorgeous, and this one has hit the table more than a few times. Fun, novel game!

RATING: 7
Although it is mechanically simple, the feel matches the theme, and it's overall pleasant to play.  The Tokaido itself being a time track certainly helps make the game more strategic, and forces you to make some interesting choices and sacrifices along the way.

It's also a bonus that you always choose (or are assigned ;)) a character to play, with his or her unique ability in the game.

Cute little filler from the maker of 7 Wonders.  Not something that I'd be inclined to pull out all the time, but not that bad for a close to the night.  Heavily luck driven.  An interesting variation on worker placement.  Played with 3, but I think it would be a better experience with 4 or 5.  Actions are basically a direct rip off of Glen More which is a vastly better, but longer, game.

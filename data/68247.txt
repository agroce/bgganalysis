GAME: The Mines of Zavandor
RANK: 2009
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Played twice, don't find it particularly engaging.  The choice of spending cards on upgrades rather than at auction is usually very easy since many of the cards are total crap. The trade phase is obnoxious as no one wants to help each other out, so at least 90% of trades are with the bank.   There really isn't much strategy apart from increase your income, then use that income for upgrades or for auction.  Mediocrity, thy name is mines of zavandor.

This is a fabulous set-collecting, auction game, with nice artwork, lots of positive player interaction, and a great puzzley element to it. The inclusion of basic and advanced variants (both of which work very well) is a real bonus. Easy to explain, and a lot of fun. An under-rated gem.

Good auction game. Materials are poor and cards tend to consume after a few games. Interesting mechanics, but a more upgrade cards were needed. Play 2 and 3 players games with the variant suggested by the author.

Two cheers for one of the few German games since Settlers to allow trading between players.  Unfortunately, Mines of Zavandor doesn't implement it very well.  There are none of the surpluses that helped to drive trade in Settlers; I may have more blue gems than I need this turn, but I'll surely find a use for them next turn. Add the option to trade two for one for exactly what you want with the supply, and trading isn't very dynamic. MoZ also has blind bidding, which, for my taste, sometimes works and is sometimes horrible. In this game I find it acceptable because gems used in failed bids are not lost and none of the auctions appears that critical.  

Around those two mechanics, MoZ builds a  game in which engine building and vp harvesting need to be balanced carefully.  The cards that you're bidding for offer a decent range of engine component and vp scoring possibilities.  Putting together the right combinations is critical. It all works fine, but there's nothing very compelling; there are no tough decisions and there's no tension.

Production quality is fine, the artwork is mediocre.  The biggest disappointment in that department was the slimline Fatgut clan.

Nice resource management/bidding euro. Also, one of Klemens Franz's best works! I like the many different cards. The game doesn't last that long so abilities/vps importance is balanced, which I personally don't prefer, but that's irrelevant. I also would rather have the Clans in unlimited slots outside my board and I prefer a variant that gives me more control over my upgrades.

RATING: 5
MoZ is a well put together game, but seems to lack any originality and spark.  

Strategically the game is dead simple, purchase income clans early to propel yourself to late game points.  Unfortunately, there are usually not enough income clans so one person gets knocked out of the game fairly early.  

The other main point of interest is a trading phase.  However, a 2:1 trade ratio with the bank limits how important it is to trade with other players and overall this phase isn't as interesting as say Civilization or Settlers of Catan.  Either there is too much hidden information to really gauge how much you need in a suit or you know from a previous failed attempt that someone else has it wrapped up.  The gem auctions are not nearly as exciting for the main phase of the game.

Good for a couple plays though.

An okay game of technology trees and blind auctions. It has the flavor of Scepter of Zavandor without the painful bookkeeping of adding up gem values, and it's shorter than SvZ. The game with 10-12 turns felt *too* short since many cards take 3 turns to fully complete, but we messed up the order of cards so we need to try again with the correct setup.

First play: EQ 2010
Initial Rating: 7

A game that will take a few plays to get your head around.  trading is not understood in the first play and gaining control of a specific gem type and then moving towards upgrades that require that gem type is the key to success.  Controling the king is not entirely necessary but can determine the length of the game at critical junctions.

RATING: 7
Simple trading/auction game where the person with the most victory points at the end wins. Quite a bit of strategy packed into a little game. Gameplay is simple to understand, and the game flows quickly. Most games can be played under an hour which is very nice. An all around great game.

RATING: 6
I thought this was a pretty decent little engine building game.  The economy here is tight; almost too tight in the early goings until you have a decent engine going to draw cards (which allow you to bid on stuff).

It has simultaneous hidden auctions as the major mechanism, which I generally hate, but there are few enough cards in the game where they're somewhat predictable, making it feel less random to me.  Also, you get to keep your cards when you lose a bid, so it's a little less harsh than many games with the mechanism.

Overall, nothing earth shattering or particularly new, but a solid game that I enjoy playing.

I quite enjoyed this game. It is a euro style economic game which I would place at the lower end of mid-weight. The theme isn't particularly well executed, but it is still a solid game with a reasonable amount of depth. Can be played in under 2 hours, which is a real plus.

Not much like Sceptor of Zavandor, but interesting nonetheless.  As with Sceptor, the currency is gems.  The object is to buy victory points and improvements that provide victory points.  Along the way, it's necessary to purchase improvements that increase income.  On the standard boards, players are limited to six improvements.  As the game continues, income generating improvements are often replaced by vp generating improvements.  The game is timed by the movement of the king along a path.  The user who wins the sapphire bid chooses the next step of the king along the path.  His steps determine the cost of some items.  Paths vary in the number of steps which becomes important to watch late in the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
On the surface it seems lighter than Scepter, but there are more cards to possibly acquire, and more ways to combine them (I think--it's been a while since I've played Scepter). I think I like it after first game. There is a good tension of getting more stuff, but also developing what you have, all the while not letting others get stuff they need, especially for cheap.

I have no idea why the average rating is below 7, nor why this is currently $13.50 on Prime. This is Alex P.'s first game, I think, but his talent was already unmistakable. He takes familiar mechanisms, adds twists, trims the fat, and concocts pure fun. In this case it's blind auctions that get the Pfister treatment, as in Isle of Skye, but here they work much better above 2p due to the narrower field of items on offer. 

With official solo and 2p variants available here on BGG, this purchase should be an easy decision for Pfister pfans!

Edit: The official PNP mini-expansion for 2-3p completely fixes the only knock on the game (scalability); we don't play without it.

A game of semi-blind bidding and engine building on your own personal development board.   Ideally, requires four players.  The dwarven theme is a near miss but I give it credit for trying.   The trading phase is a bit clunky, as others have commented - I agree with that.   The improvement cubes seem much more important than getting higher card incomes.   A pretty simple game, with a good variety of cards.   The bidding system comes down to knowing when to "go big or go home".   Decent.   I'd play it some more, but don't need to own it.

I raised this rating up from a 6.5, because while not my favorite kind of game (auction, heaving bidding), there are a lot of varied mechanics working together in this game (hand management, bidding, trading, a bit of resource management) and I think they all work well - even though I am not very good at any of them.

I just thought about the theme -

I was in the Works with partner last week. This is in their sale. 
This will be a Christmas gift for me I am sure :)

This is an interesting concept with different gemstones in different frequencies in different decks used to purchase different upgrades.

Initially you are limited to an income of 6 gem cards but this rule is easily broken and can lead to a win more situation with one player drawing so many more cards than the others that they therefore win more auctions and therefore gather more improvements thus drawing more cards.

Gameplay is simple and the improvement cards are very easy to interpret. The art work is good and the kings board is nice if a little confusing on the cavern side but the alternate stylised side is must easier to follow if not as pretty.

Traded in a math trade (2014) for Parade.

Once again Z-man has a winner in this fine family game.

The graphic artist Klemens Franz fooled me--the art looks like Doris Matthaus' pleasing art in Aladdin's Dragons & Elfengold.

Rules easy with the a well written rule book, and aided by good graphic representation on boards & cards.

The interactive part of the game involves simultaneous bidding and possible player trading.  Re-playability interest, especially with the advanced game.

Interestingly, we thought one player was a huge run-away winner, only to discover at the end of the game it came down to the tie breaker.  Who is ahead can be deceptive unless you really pay attention to points each player has accumulated on their boards.  It can come down to actions performed on the last round.

If Scepter of Zavandor was "too hardcore" for you then this might be a better fit. Here you have an economic snowball in which the snowball effect has been dampened down by shortening the game, decreasing the benefits of each single step on the upgrade curve, and adding in free-form trading and a blind bidding component.

The game certainly works fine as a small-scale snowball although I would have liked to see more of a difference between the 4 gem types that can be mined. It is, however, clearly not the real deal.

RATING: 8
The Mines of Zavandor is a light-to-medium game of bidding and economic engine building. It uses many of the same concepts as The Scepter of Zavandor, but in a much more compact, much less intense, much more interactive format. (Note that the two games have different designers.) Once players learn the flow of the game, The Mines of Zavandor only takes about an hour to play. It does a really good job of packing a lot of mental and social satisfaction into that hour.

To me, The Mines of Zavandor feels like a gamer's version of The Settlers of Catan. MoZ features much less luck and greater scope for planning, but retains the trading and the unpredictability the makes The Settlers of Catan appealing. There is also an additional psychological layer of trying to predict your opponents' actions that makes MoZ even more interactive than The Settlers of Catan. You have to strike at the right time, with the right amount of force, while also withholding the right resources for future use. Personally, I'd much rather play The Mines of Zavandor than The Settlers of Catan!

Note that The Mines of Zavandor does make heavy use of blind bidding. I actually think it's the perfect choice for this game, because it allows you to bid on four auctions at the same time. No fussing, no equivocating, no slowing the game to a crawl while the analysis paralysis guy decides whether to raise his bid.

The games that give blind bidding a bad reputation are the ones where everyone has to pay their bid, even if they didn't get what they wanted. In Mines of Zavandor, you can recover your losing bids - although you do have to set the cards aside for half a round. Also, bidding way more than necessary isn't as harmful here as it is in other games, because there are extra rewards for large bids.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good game, which works well even with the trading and blind bidding. There is a good chance that you have an idea what the other players want to do and it often turns down to quick and good tradings.

This game has nothing, except the theme, to do with my favourite number one game Scepter of Zavandor!

RATING: 8
An economic game with blind auctions is a queer mix. It’s not as severe as it looks like though as only the winner pays the bid and you can get bonus when bidding more. You bid on several items at once and then resolve the bids. In your turn you can then upgrade your cards to make them better and worth more points.

A general problem with both bidding games and economic snowball games are a runaway leader problem or even more common a trailing loser if you are new to the game. The outpost series of games have the same problem with this. It’s a nice little game which I would love to play some more to get a solid opinion on.

Not bad but just a lot of "been there, done that".
The main mechanism is blind bidding which makes the outcome arbitrary. Either you don't get what you bidded for or you overpay it. Rarely you get something cheap and you enjoy yourself making a deal. That's it. It works but there's not much fun, just a little optimizing after the bidding phase for your developments.

This could move up to an 8, maybe higher.

This game isn't terrible but really conforms to a lot of people's negative stereotypes about eurogames. Thin theme, really just felt going through the motion of converting one thing to another to get VPs. Hours after playing it, I'm already forgetting the details of gameplay. Also I'm tempted to knock down my rating because of the terrible decision to have red *cubes* as upgrade markers and use red *squares* to denote rubies on the cards.

Played with 2, it was fun! I think I'm going to love this game with 4. Nothing wrong with the two player game though very tight and lots of great decisions. The trading breaks down but that's okay that's why you can do 2:1 with the bank. We still traded a couple of times during the game.

The family ties to the Sceptre of Zavandor are visible both in theme and belonging to the genre of economic engine games. If you're like me and have a split opinion on this whole snowball thing, be careful with Mines of Zavandor. It needs multiple plays to shine - or to sink.  
The tradeoff between simultaneous blind bidding auctions and the need to retain gems for developing your acquired cards is a clever mechanism. Mines of Zavandor offers enough different strategic possibilities with four types of specialization and various mixed strategies. The trading phase is a pleasant diversion although it falls short by a mile compared to real trading games, i.e. Settlers or Bohnanza. But as a whole, it is lacking for me. There might be the Saint Petersburg effect that I start enjoying this further up the experience curve but digging for gems in a fantasy setting with dwarven clans, dragons and unicorns doesn't hit my fancy and the this time inept art by Klemens Franz doesn't help the case. Enough other stuff out there.

While I like this game (a fair amount actually), I am sad that it has no good way to work with only 2 people.  3 was good, but I get the impression that 4 would be much more exciting.  As our primary gaming group is 2-3, I doubt this will see much (if any) play.

I still haven't played Outpost.  I tried Scepter once (which was definitely not a full experience, since I played with 2).  I also have played Phoenicia.  I'm not sure how much Mines of Zavandor is attempting to mimic or simplify the whole Outpost engine, but I like the simplicity of the system and the playing time feels just about right.

I still find the different currencies a little clunky, especially since the card backs look similar and no there are no naming schemes that make sense.  I also don't like how trading works, since it rarely seems advantageous to trade with another player, and trading with the game also slows things down.

But in general I like the blind bidding, I like the track that you move down to determine the number of rounds in the game as well as the costs of upgrading (though the first time it is very hard to read).  I also like the variable starting positions.  So I like the game, but it still seems to lack a hook that elevates a game to a higher status beyond "enjoyable" for me.

Three rounds into my first game, I wanted to tear out my hair and quit.  The experience was extremely painful, largely due to the fact that no income cards were available in the auction the first few turns so the game got off to a very slow start.

LIKES:

* Once you learn the cards, I would imagine there would be several viable paths to victory as you seek to put together different combos.
* I appreciate the diversity of uses for gems between winning auctions and upgrading cards.  The different levels of reward for winning auctions is an interesting twist as well.  
* Combos/special actions on the cards add an interesting twist to the game.

DISLIKE:

* Learning games can be brutal.  This game almost requires several plays by the same players to understand the cards and the nuances of the different cards.
* The trading phase is clunky.  I almost hate it.  I don't mind the 2 for 1 with the bank but waiting around for people to decide what 1 for 1 trades or 3 for 2 trades they are willing to do can be a pain.

What we have here is a 4 player game.

I've read the variants and after having played with less than 4 players I really have no interest in ever doing it again.

That being said, Mines is a very neat little game of blind bidding, efficiency, and combo building. There are some interesting choices to make and a few tactical maneuvers to be had.

There is stiff competition in the form of Furstenfeld here; it both scales better and plays just as quickly.

I will give this game at least a couple of more plays to see if it will sink or swim. I think if it could get down to the 30-40 minute play time range that it definitely has a place in my collection, otherwise it will likely find a home with someone else.

Update:

An extremely simplified and streamlined version of Outpost/Mines, but not as lobotomized as Pheonicia.  It's lighter and feels more complete, and is a great entry into the Snowball/Economic genre that is good for the whole family.  There are meaningful choices, and it scales well (with the variant rules for less players).  Best with 4, definitely.

I generally like it when games force an overarching structure onto the round-to-round proceedings - Industria or Amun-Re are outstanding examples - so the overall plot of a dwarven king making his way through the mines certainly appeals, and it appeals all the more for the opportunity to gently steer his royal stuntiness along the path. The auctions and the tech-tree for developing your mining fu are very well done as well, at least as far as I can tell after a single game.

On the whole, I like this a whole lot better than its Scepter sibling, and if some rematches indicate good replayability, I might even consider buying it.

Not a bad game. Really confusing rules though. Good game components. I was hoping this would be a simpler version of it's brother game, "Scepter of Zavandor" that I could teach my simpler friends. It was similar, in confusing rules and game play. although I think the theme was lost with the childish, and the funny type graphics. In all fairness though I will give this another try, and update my review accordingly.

good new twist on an auction mechanic.  for a blind bidding game, the constraint of the currencies make it somewhat accessible as blind bidding for me is an immediate "no go" for only fairly experienced gamers.  
potential addition to a gateway game, but I think vegas showdown still probably more accessible.   

can easily see this getting to 60mins as a 3p game and maybe close to there as 4p.

Players are dwarves accumulating four types of gems, then using them to bid. Each round, 4 cards are up for bid using a specific gem for each card. Bidding is done by blind bidding. Losers of the bid do not lose their cards. Players, then upgrade their cards or tableau to gain more abilities or income. The winner of the sapphire bid moves the king token closer to the final spot on the map. The king token acts as a timepiece for the length of the game, and the location of the king specifies which gems are required to use for upgrading. 

I've played this with 4 players and looking forward to more plays. I like the fact that losers of a bid do not lose their cards.

Play a series of 10 or so rounds, each round collecting gems using your the income engine you've developed, then blind bid the gems to win cards which will enhance your income engine or variously improve your abilities to bid or score VP's. But keep enough gems in hand to fulfil the "upgrade" requirements of each card you've bought to ensure they're operational and will score at end of game. Repeat, repeat, repeat. Game ends. Score. There's no real sense of competition. You can't tell exactly what gems your opponents will have because they're drawn from decks with mixed gems, so bids are either won or not. The real decision's on whether to bid for a card or not and whether you'll have enough gems to be able to support it, ie upgrade it enough to score and make it worthwhile. The game works, there's some limited card variety and options to explore I guess, but it just wasn't engaging enough or the decisions' interesting enough to want to explore.

Mines of Zavandor is a blind-bidding game where you're trying to acquire cards to improve your income and score end-game points.  Like Scepter of Zavandor, your income is in the form of cards drawn from various stacks that have differing value ranges, but the similarities between the two games end there.  Each turn, you're blind bidding on four cards simultaneously (each one requires a different currency), and once you get those cards, you need to spend additional money to build one or more stages of the cards (that often have stepped benefits).  There's definitely a bit of a snowball effect if one player gets out to an early lead.  I'd play it again, but the game does have its flaws.

A very nice auction game - light Euro. All about trying to maximise your production, and select the right moment to move towards victory points - whilst, at the same time, trying to work out which special powers are worth bidding on.

The limiting factors of income restriction and four separate autions do a nice job of stopping runaway winners- but it is still possible to have fallaway losers if they don't invest in their infrastructure effectively. The clans own production does some mitigation, but if you don't get a subsiduary clan then you're pretty much out.

Bidding, engine-building, set collection, resource management, and trade negotiation are blended together to create a tight little game.

There were questions as to how balanced the "special" family clan sheets are in comparison to one another, but due to the fact that we only had two plays (so far) it may have been simply poor planning to optimize their unique abilities effectively.

Nevertheless, I highly enjoyed it.

I was kicking myself all game because as start player in turn 1 I had 3 each of 2 different gems and wanted the cards from them, and at the last moment I thought "hey, I win ties, I can probably just bid 2 of each!" forgetting that I need to bid 3 to get the card.

Had I bid the 3rd card of each color, I would have won both auctions and had 2 income cards from turn 1. Instead, the next round I lost an auction on tiebreak(because I was last in turn order now), and I didn't get additional income until like turn 4. I ended up losing by 9 points, but I was 1 vp coin away from an additional 6 point bonus from a shrine thingy... I feel like I lost myself the game on turn 1, making a stupid error (forgetting a rule) when I had everything set up right :(

This is not a heavy game, it's a bit on the simple side. my new favorite blind bidding game though! (A genre that can be somewhat problematic at times.)

Reasons why think the blind bidding is handled in an excellent way:
- you have the 3 levels
- losing bids aren't paid but the players don't get them back immediately either. They only get them back after the end of the round. A very clever idea!
- there are multiple currencies (/sorts of gems) so you can (to a certain extent) remember how many the others have of a certain type.
- money (gems) ≠ VP

The big question is if it is strategic enough for its duration in the long run. Keeper for now!

RATING: 6.5
It's a pretty neat little game. It has some of the flavor of Zavandor -- similar gems, gem card decks with different value cards (here different gems, not different value of same gems), auctions to buy cards -- but only kinda-sorta. Game play is actually very little like Scepter! Still, it works reasonably well despite all the blind bidding (which I normally dislike). 

Players start off with one spell on their board (6 slots), and 2 built-in abilities (basic board). There are 4 groups of cards (spells), one for each type of gem draw deck. Also, start with some gem cards from the sapphire deck (which has mostly sapphires, some emeralds/diamonds, no rubies). The spells/abilities usually have several levels, requiring some combination of gems in order to advance; different advancement levels provide different benefits (e.g., greater income, bonus VP at end of game, etc.). Also, completed spells are worth VP.

Each round, players first earn income (based on their personal spells/abilities). Then, there is an open trading phase: trade any combination of gems with each other, and/or any 2 gems for a specific gem from the bank, repeating as needed until everyone is done trading. Next, players simultaneously bid on the 4 auctions by selecting any combination of gems to bid; each group of similar gem cards is a bid for that card on the display. High bidder wins (VP, the card, or the card and VP) the card and loses  their bid; the rest set their bid aside so cards are not available until start of next turn. After bids resolved, sapphire-winner moves king along path to next stop (which determines cost for advancing certain spells, and also acts as game timer; game ends when King gets to end of path). Then players use any remaining gems in hand to advance whatever spells they want (max 1 advancement per spell). Any cards on the central board not won are removed from play, new cards become available, players pick up their previous bids, and you do it all again. At game end, calculate end-of-game bonuses; player with most VP wins.

The heart of the game is the simultaneous multiple blind auction. I don't generally like blind bids, but it works pretty well here because you kind of know what people can bid on (from their income and what how traded), and because bid losers don't lose their bids. But given the theme, I would MUCH rather play Scepter (if only that hit the table more often!)!

RATING: 6
A light game of economics and trading.  It hits that sweet spot of weight where it's not so light that it doesn't challenge you or present you with interesting enough decisions but is still light enough you can get anybody in and playing quickly.  This works well for me since most heavy economic games scare me away.  I would probably be fine with a more medium weight game but this one still works very well and is engaging enough for me.

The game plays across ~15 rounds (you can add or subtract from that number depending on where you move the king's pawn which determines the number of rounds and game end) each consisting of 4 phases.  1.  Earning income in the form of 4 different gem cards spread across 4 different decks.  2.  Trading amongst players or 2:1 with the bank.  3.  A blind auction for improvements that earn you victory points and improve your income.  4.  Upgrading your improvements using your remaining gem cards.

Everything is super simplified which gives the game a good flow and where I wanted a little bit more.  But it was still enough to present me with a good game here right at the complexity that appeals to the most number of people.  For example, all trades with the bank are any 2 gems for any 1 gem.  Even though some gems are "rarer" than others and even if there are none available in the discard (you just draw from the respective deck until you get one you're after) you always only pay 2 for 1.  This also makes it so ALL trades with other players are logically 1:1 since you can always get anything you want 2:1 with the bank without helping your opponents.

I really like the blind bidding.  It is handled excellently in this game and provides a lot of tension and the most interesting/difficult decisions.  First of all, you are bidding on 4 different auctions (each corresponding to a different gem) simultaneously and not just any bid will get you an improvement card.  You have to bid at least 3 of a gem to win an improvement card, otherwise your win only earns you one victory point (and if you bid a huge number of gem cards you get a bonus 4 victory points).  So it takes out that opportunity to get a commanding lead by bidding low at opportune moments which can sometimes ruin blind bidding games.  Also, losing bids are handled perfectly.  They are not lost by the losing bidder (which can be devastating in games that handle them that way) but they are "set aside" so they can't be used during the upgrade stage.  This strikes an excellent balance of making the bid an important decision without being too punishing.

I think because of the games simplicity and lack of variety (there are only enough improvement cards to fit into the maximum number of turns so you can't have very dynamic a setup) it definitely has a certain shelf life but it is a nice, quick game and an excellent introduction into more medium or even heavy weight economic, trading, and bidding games if I choose to add one to my library in the future.

I didn't enjoy this one all that much, but it was at the end of a con, and we were all strung out and cold learning from the rules.  I'd give it a shot again in the future, but won't be seeking it out actively.

This came highly recommended, but I was very disappointed in my initial play. The game is very fragile: opening moves are scripted and any player who doesn't follow the mandatory dance moves (getting a clan card that produces more gems right away) will quickly fall behind. The game also is very unforgiving: any player who does fall behind is completely screwed ... there is absolutely no way to crawl back into contention for the win. Or, put another way, the rich get richer in Mines of Zavandor. The game has some interesting things going on, and I do need to play it a few more times to lock in a true rating, but I absolutely have some initial concerns about both game balance and whether players have all that many viable options leading to victory. Stay tuned ... Update: After several more plays, my opinion hasn't changed much. An OK game with several flaws. Not awful, by any means, but not good enough to justify the space on my shelf ...

The Mines of Zavandor is the first blind-bidding game that I've truly enjoyed, but it might be because there's so much other stuff to do!  This is fast, low-stakes, simultaneous bidding on four different cards.  Losers keep their money and can still trade for better currencies.  There are also tech trees and a path board that modifies market pricing and game length.  Whew!  This is a LOT to learn and monitor. Although The Mines of Zavandor is engaging, it may be too dense for most gamers.

Very nice blind bidding game with quite a huge element of interaction and interesting choices wether to take a card when winning an auction or a victory point. Especially later on when it's uncertain wether you'll get all your cards' steps developed.

Not sure I understood the game that well, but it didn't seem that complicated. I think I need to play it a few more times to see if maybe my lack of understanding is the problem or poor game mechanics. 

Edit 11/19

I think the problem is that the instructions were not detailed enough which caused confusion. After clarifying the rules and playing it the correct way I am giving this game a bit of a rating bump. There is not a great deal of strategy. Get gems, bid on the improvements that give you the best synergy and upgrade as rapidly as possible. It's pretty fun, but the gem cards are a bit fiddly.

Nice game. I like auction games and this is a cool combination of build your engine/auction game. Interesting choices. Fun. 

My first attempt at a 2 player game saw this one dull but the new rules for 2 players posted here on BGG make the game a lot more fun for 2.

Provisional rating, one play with the basic player boards. More approachable than Das Zepter (or Outpost), with less calculation and more randomness, but definitely of the same family. Not knowing the cards was no great handicap, unlike in the earlier game.

I had no idea what this game involved when I agreed to play it, afterwards it was no surprise that it wasn't my type of game at all. My least favourite mechanic is trading, followed by auctions and blind bidding, and that's what 90% of this game is. I got outbid on income cards every single time, and those let you draw cards that you need to bid with in future auctions. So, with no source of card income other than the start level, I was literally dead in the water the entire game. Late in the game I finally managed to complete a shrine or two, just to avoid ending up with 0 as a score. But at least the company was fun.

Fun hidden-bid game with excellent artwork and engaging mine upgrade system. However, it does suffer with less than the full compliment of players. Sold because we could rarely get enough players who wanted this to hit the table. Kind of a shame.

In this third game in Lookout's Zavandor fantasy setting, it's all about dwarves. And mining. And gemstones. And other enhancements for the mines that need to get developed further during the game to have full effect.
\13\\13\
4 different gems are the currencies in this game. However, when collecting income you draw cards from 4 different mines (card stacks) with each having its own distribution! The number of gems you earn depends on the upgrade level of your dwarves. Gems are used to either win new objects for their mine through simultaneous 4-way auctions, or to enhance their mines, objects, and victory point count. Another innovative part is that each object has to be upgraded to fully use its benefits, e.g. a level 1 dwarf only gives you 1 income per round, some level 3 dwarves give you 3 income.
\13\\13\
On the King's way through the mountain, the requirements for upgrading some special cards always change, and only the player who wins the sapphire auction knows where the next turn will lead to. There are shorter and longer paths to the Coronation Chamber, where the game ends. The game lasts between 10 to 12 rounds.

Not sure about this one. I like it but it seemed like one did not have enough control, so it was quite difficult to fulfil one's intentions/plans. Therefore it felt more frustrating than fun. Maybe a second game would prove me wrong but then there are so many games out there I may not get round to it.

An ok economic engine game.  Not sure I really need to play it again though.  Retreads ideas we've seen many times.  I think I'll just play Phoenicia again.

Feels like there aren't enough resources in the game to make auctions and other decisions very interesting.  Consequently, tension is pretty limited.

Nice blind bidding, auction and engine building game. Like many of these games with special powers that you acquire to build your engine, knowing the powers makes the game more interesting. It also means that it is a better game for a group that knows it rather than all new people or a mixed group of experienced and unexperienced. More plays required.

Works best with 4. Has potential.

Oh, this game is really cool. So much to think about for such a light game. Though, if you think a lot, the game will progress really slowly. All plays were with 3 players and they lasted around 45-50 minutes.

Searching for the opportunity for making cool combos while trying to deny other players from finding them is the core of the game. Sliding tends to change the board a lot, but that's the only flaw I can find in the game. I need more plays to develop better strategies.

Sold on 5/2017.

An entertaining area control game with a refreshing frog theme. There are quite a few of moving factors in the mechanics, giving depth to the game once the player is well acquainted with the rules. The scoring of the log card in the end of the game can turn out to be quite decisive. So far I've only tried this as a two player game but I imagine Bullfrogs is even more fun with more players. Duration with 2 players appr. 25 minutes.

This game will have you mad at the other players. It'll cause hurt feelings. Nice area control game that comes in a small box but has BIG strategy. It's heavier than you would expect. The colorful art and painted cards hide a much deeper game. People will only understand once they play. 

The most frustrating thing about the whole game is the sliding of remaining cards once you win/take control of a lily pad. It's not fully explained and fleshed out in the rule book and even here on BBG.

This is a rather interesting area management game.  You are "fighting" other player's bullfrogs for control of the lily-pads in the swamp.  Each card indicates how many frogs you can place and where you can place them (orthogonal - in straight connected lines).  You have two limited warrior bullfrogs who are out of the game if lost.  Easy game to teach; great with kids.

An excellent two-player game - a must have for every collection.  It provides quick play, medium-deep tactical and strategic decision points, a nice level of gotcha, and although an "abstract" game in its roots, doesn't feel dry or detached.  The production values are excellent.  Easy to explain and definitely a game for both beginners and seasoned gamers.

I haven't tried a three player session, but I could see that would be enjoyable.

Plays quick with very straightforward, simple rules. Every game will be different. I look forward to playing with 3 and 4 players. Should change the game considerably.

Well-written rulebook. Beautiful artwork. I like the theme.

Wow! What a game. So much to think about. Where do I place my card? Should I sabotage or deploy? Never put a bullfrog on a card with more than 4 spaces and only if it is surrounded by 4 cards. How can I win more of my own color of cards? How can I get the most of my pieces onto the log card? Where should I slide this disconnected card to?

Such a small game but a lot to think about!

I'm not normally a fan of abstract strategy games, but this one was rather interesting.  The idea is you play a card with some spots for your frogs on it, the card will give you a number of actions and each action is to place a frog on a card that is in the same row or column as the one you just placed.  The points on the card go to the player with the majority and then all the frogs jump to adjacent cards.  

Very simple mechanics that create a light but fun game with some difficult decisions to make and some nice combo breaking.

This is an interesting majorities game, where players add a card to the map, and then can use a number of action points as printed on the card to either place or displace frog tokens along the row or column the card was placed into. Each map card has a set number of spaces to hold frogs, and when a card is full, it's removed and a certain number of frogs starting with your opponent get to escape to neighboring cards. This can create chain reactions where multiple cards might score through escape movements. There's a relatively short playtime which is nice. There's enough to think about on your turn, so I was happy with the depth. It's a little chaotic with four players, so it's probably better with 2 or 3? I would play again, but I'm not planning to buy this for myself.

A somewhat clunky abstract game that overstays its welcome. The rules are fairly simple, but a few unintuitive bits can be hard to remember and they prevent the game from achieving that immersive logical flow that good abstracts have. It is also at a level of complexity that I really dislike, where you can't quickly see all the results that a given move will have on your opponent's next move, but you can stop and calculate them all out if you want. This makes people (including me) want to stop and calculate for a few minutes every turn, which is wearisome in such a small, simple game that feels like it should be pretty fast.

One of my wife's favorite games. Bullfrogs is extremely strategic but is not difficult to learn or play. It can take a little getting used to, because it is a bit different than most area control type games I've played. It has lots of depth of play, and we're still playing it even after owning it for a few years.

On your turn, you play a card from hand somewhere on the table. This determines how many actions you have and which cards already in play that you can affect. You have only two types of actions available: Deploy and Sabotage. Deploy allows you to place your frogs on a card. Sabotage allows you to move your opponents' frogs from one card to another, but you can't move your own frogs.

When a card fills up, some frogs jump to adjacent cards, and the rest sink with the overburdened lily pad. This can cause chain reactions, which is honestly the most satisfying part of the game. Cleverly setting things up to cause half the board to be wiped out in a single play really feels like you've accomplished something and allows you to reset the cards and mess up the strategies of the other players.

Overall, we really enjoy this game and keep a copy in the car to play whenever we expect to have a bit of downtime.

A solid and short game.

It was much less random and much less spiteful than I had expected from reading the rules -- so I was pleasantly surprised.  There is actually some reasonable ability to plan ahead, predict others' moves, and predict how they might move you.  And best of all, the game makes steady and clear progress towards completion so there is no stalling or lagging.

Quite fun area control game with a neat mechanic of frogs jumping off after scoring a card, which could lead to completing another card, and scoring that one would send frogs off that could lead to scoring another card, in a nice chain reaction of points, allowing for big plays and big turns. Excellent at two players, haven't played with more yet.

Very cute game, but can be frustrating at times. I still like playing it, but sometimes people take way too long on their turns! It should only last 45 minutes a game. xD

Great for roleplayers as the mechanics suit the feel of the game extremely well. Hopping these toads will delight even the most reserved leap-frog enthusiast.

Solid abstract game. 2 players is fun and strategic. More players is a bad idea.

Frogs and axe wielding bullfrogs hop onto modular placed lily pad cards in the pond to establish area control. Light strategy filler.

An interesting little game that has simple mechanics but good choices to make. The components in the second edition are also very nice little wooden frogs.

Quick, fun and also with a good amount of strategy and decisions. It really clicks after a play or two.

West of Africa is a very fun, strategy based game with no aspect of luck. The game was really well thought out and can be played with 1-3 friends in a reasonable amount of time. Also, the board is the perfect size to play on most tables. Highly recommended game.

RATING: 7.5
Although there is nothing much new here, the game does have certain pluses that make it worth owning: it holds 5, it plays quickly (90 mins for a 5 player, less for a 3 or 4), the pieces and board are very attractive, the rules are simple to digest and elegantly done, the theme is kind of cool if you are European (as you will have probably have been to the Canary Islands).  There are elements of Kreta (resources and area control) but without so much AP.  It's lighter than Kreta - not necessarily better, but not far off.  I like the fact that your workers have to disappear back to the starting space if you use them to cultivate, which means that they can't be used for area control and the choices you make about card plays are edgy for more than one reason - there's a few tight choices like that.  Many things you do have 2 or 3 rather than one consequence and yet it remains simple rule-wise.
I got mine with the expansions free, which will make it more replayable.

Es hat durchaus interessante Spielmechanismen. Als gutes Familienspiel darf man es wohl ansehen, auch als ein solches mit Potential zum Spiel des Jahres. Es spielt sich gut, da hakt nichts, es macht Spaß. 

Auch für Vielspieler ist es nicht uninteressant, wenn man das Grübeln nicht übertreibt, das Spiel im Fluss hält und kein abendfüllendes Programm erwartet.

Mir gefällt's, ohne mich euphorisch zu machen.

This is a great game. The rules are elegant and the game flows niceley at a good speed. The game is fast and scales well. The main mechanics are 'area controll' and 'programing actions'. If you like those mechanics while reading other players intentions and act on those whit some chaos as a result then this game will apeal to you. The game feels more tactical than stratigic after one play but there are some hidden depth. I was supriced that argentum verlag dident pick this game up. It reminds me little bit of elegans in games like hansa tetonica, yunnan. If you like 'area controll' games like Royals and programming games like glass road and wallenstein and prefer games that have little to none engine building and plays fast this game is for you.

RATING: 4
I did not find a lot of redeeming qualities in this one, it seemed quite a lot like work. If you want to play well, you need to calculate the best play for each opponent and this seemed tedious for the payoff you eventually get out of the game. Highly tactical, yet not interesting enough to appeal. The rulebook is quite verbose and too much for what it is. 

Nothing new to see here, unfortunately.

West of Africa seems like a game that leverages some rather simple mechanisms to a great effect. There has been some rumbling that the game is broken based on an optimal first turn move. I just don't see this as true. Game play can be subject to group think which presents a problem for a game where going early in the turn is almost always preferable. I'm looking forward to a few repeated plays.

West of Africa is a euro game based on resource gathering and transportation. Basic mechanism is called action selection. The mechanisms are similar to room service but a bit deeper.

I like it, but maybe not a classic one. It might have been a bit better if you could build settlements even without owning the island tile (but instead giving the owner a discount for building there). It felt a little locked sometimes.

RATING: 6
In West of Africa simultaneous action selection drives a game of area majorities. The choice of cards to play at the beginning of a turn often forces some agonizing decisions, especially since choosing more actions will put you later in turn order and turn order is extremely important here. The system feels pretty clever but it seems like it would have benefitted from a little more development.

The most pressing issue is that it is very easy to have your turn completely destroyed through no fault of your own simply because somebody else chose to do the same things you wanted to do. This is more likely to occur the more players you have, and therefore particularly severe with 5, but can happen with any number. Then, scoring is heavily centered on building settlements. I'm not entirely sure whether the costs for building them are balanced, but that the game doesn't end when settlements run out and there are no more major scoring opportunities available is certainly a mistake and makes it drag.

The game works, it looks good and it's a very solid game, BUT it feels strange and has a good amount of chaos in it.

I ended the game in only 5 turns and won, which all came from my very first move. All at the table were pretty suprised and didn't see a way to change that in further plays, unless you sacrifice yourself to stop the first player doing so.

May be to early to draw any conclusion from that, but it leaves a bad taste for sure.

Absurdly misleading title. There should be something connected with Canary Islands in it...

An interesting game although somewhat arbitrary and restricting.
I've played only once - with 5 players - and it was a bit uncontrollable experience too.

I would need to play with any number less than 5 to have a better judgement.

This game is just beautiful. Everything from the box art to the game board and cards are just a thing to behold. Harald Lieske hit this off the ballpark with the artwork on this one. But despite being nice to look at, the game is very mean and punishing. The simultaneous action selection aspect of the game, while brilliant, could be punishing if you're just at the wrong side of things. Even on turn 1 you could be screwed from doing anything just because you picked to go to the same island as someone else. Just too punishing and hard to recover for my taste.

[b]Card play:[/b]
The action selection system is very clever, it was definitely my favorite part of the game. There are 7 islands on the board and you have 1 card for each island. There are also several types of actions, again 1 card for each. At the beginning of the round you chose 4 cards (you can spend 4 points to include a 5th card), this is done simultaneously and secretly. Then players take turns. On your turn you can perform the actions you chose on the islands you chose. However, turn order is important since you can be blocked out of some actions if your opponents do them first. 

I have always loved this type of mechanism. [thing=14]Basari[/thing] is one of my favorite games of all time. As you might imagine having 5 people jockeying for limited actions and trying to double think one another is not the epitome of strategic gaming.

[b]Multi-player chaos:[/b]
With 5p is was simply too difficult to accurately predict what people were going to do. The consequences of choosing poorly are dire, you can easily waste your entire turn if you are unlucky. I would never play this game at 5 again. I would be interested in trying it at 3p where you can more easily assess what each person wants and what you are likely to be left with given the permutations of your opponents' turns.

I would rate the 5p game a 4. Which is harsh, but I basically never want to play it at 5p ever again. I suspect I would rate the 3p game 7. For now I've rated the game 7 erring towards the positive.

One game with 5 players.   Very tight and vicious.  Just felt frustrated.   Seems like in a 5 player game, at least one person will get hosed on their turn.   Pretty simple game, but design choices (especially with the selling of goods) seem clunky.   Don't ever want to play again.

A highly cutthroat action selection game where initiative matters heavily. Your plans can be foiled if players are doing the same thing you are. This one really rewards forward thinking and guessing where your opponents are. Stay adapting and out in the lead. This one can go fast. It's ok, but the feelings it evokes for me just leaves me wanting to play an equally cutthroat action selection game in the form of Food Chain Magnate.

Schöne Idee, klasse Design und gutes Material, leider zumindest im Spiel zu fünft total unausgewogen. Es kann schnell passieren, dass ganz ohne böse Absicht und ohne, dass es bewusst planbar wäre, einzelne Spieler keine sinnvolle Aktion mehr ausführen können, da durch die gemeinsame und geheime Planungsphase keine spätere Kurskorrektur mehr möglich ist.
 
Auch die Anzahl und die Steuerung der Hütten die ins Spiel kommen, scheint doch zumindest verbesserungswürdig. Ohne das Bauen der Hütten besteht keine Chance auf einen Sieg. Daher wirken sich die ggf. unabsichtlich vergeudeten Runden doppelt schlimm aus, da es so passieren kann, dass es gar keine Hütten mehr gibt, bis man an die Reihe kommt.

Schade, das Spiel hat in meinen Augen viel Potenzial, hätte aber einfach noch eine Zeit durch erfahrene Spieler austariert werden müssen.

Maybe this is just sour grapes from my first turn of the game being a no-op, but I sort of hated this game. Sore spots, for me, include lost turns and high penalties on simultaneous selection/secret bid, and this game has both. Especially unfortunate is that that is the interesting mechanic in this game; everything else is very dry chit shuffling. Turn order should be important in a game, but I don't like the way it's handled here. Oh, and accidental screwage. Lots of that.

Beautiful artwork (that's how the ocean in Nippon should have looked like ;)) and the base card mechanic is nice, but somehow i felt the game was missing something. No tension, ends mostly after 5-6 rounds pretty quick, you don't feel any big advancement over the course of the game. It also felt a bit broken (but i would have to try again, to be sure), when one move in the first round goes through (see h8man rating). But it wasn't a game i really need to play again.

A very dry game ...made slightly less dry by the card play mechanic ...plays a bit too quickly ...I / we sense it needs something else added to it ...not sure what ...maybe a small amount of luck or another scoring method ...

We don't like that the player with most gold gains one VP each round ...

Settlements if colour coded for each player may add a more competative struggle for mayor and serve more than just awarding VPs ...and would add an area majority aspect to each island ...thus creating more interest in each island ...I am surprised this mechanism was not put in the design of the game ...

It works well in Mombasa ...could work well in this game ...

Will keep as its okay ...but just okay ...

The title is quite confusing, just call it Canary Islands or so. 

The game itself: the way the player order (and how many actions you will do) is determined is quite innovative and let there be no doubt about it: player order is important in this game!
I quite enjoyed playing my 1 game so far, but I can agree with Surya's comment that the last round just felt a bit like a surrogate that hardly has an impact on the outcome of the game (especially with 5 as all settlements are gone) and it would have been a better idea to just finish the round when 1 of the 2 end of game conditions is met.

We have broke the game in the first turn. Only one logical move and first player gets to do it and wins the game by quite a land slide. Really not a game for the group. We did finish it. Some interesting mechanics but ultimately the island set up is not balanced and the game board is not good. Maybe better with 3p I am not sure. Not a game I will ever play again.

A beautifully illustrated game which centers around a rather interesting system of simultaneous action selection. Multiple actions are selected at once, but each action comes with a value. When the values of each action are totaled up, the player with the lowest value moves first.

The issue I have with West of Africa is in the way it straitjackets players. Almost every resource seems to be in short supply, and so it is difficult to catch up if you fall behind in tempo from the rest of the group. Adding to the difficulty is that you might be unfortunate enough to have selected the same island as another player, but fall behind anyway when that player goes first and grabs the available resources. Not a terrible game per se, but the constraints here are a bit too much for me.

tl;dr: pleasant but too long

And by too long I don't mean play time, but rounds. In the third last round of the game it was clear how the game would end and what the outcome would be, so the last rounds we went through the motions to finish the game and get an extra point here or there, but the result was the same. So that was less then stellar. Which is a shame, because what came before that was quite enjoyable. The mechanisms are nice, the choices feel like they matter... but once the building opportunities run out, there's no real extra room for scoring big. So my biggest quibble with the game is that there's only one real strategy to pursue: build as much as possible. All other ways of scoring are vastly inferior. I prefer games where there are different ways of scoring and winning.
Maybe the round issue was the result of playing this game with 5 and maybe the game is better with less, but that won't take away my other reservations I have about this game. But I enjoyed playing this for the most part.

I like simultaneous selection if it speeds up the game, like in La Isla or Roll For The Galaxy, but here it's just a way to screw up. After the rules explanation I went to play something else and it was a good choice. I heard constantly how people didn't get to do anything on their turn due to selecting the same island. This was supposed to be the interesting part of the game but it was outright bad and the rest was uninteresting.

A "Solid 7" Euro with resource placement, cultivation for storage and selling, and construction.  Don't oversell when you can't get a full price value, build when you can as locations are limited to certain islands, shoot for first player when you have the -4 cards when you can get a full payout.  Anyone who says they "broke" the game on the first turn is either wrong, or played it wrong and probably only played once at that.  Overall nothing new in terms of mechanics that we haven't seen in other Euros but it works fine and plays well in under 90 minutes with a full compliment of players.  Don't get too caught up in min-maxing as someone might play a lower hand than you and get first choice screwing up your plans.  Worth it for the right price but expensive at MSRP for what it is.

RATING: N/A
At first this appears as another dry and sleepy land exploit euro BUT this game has a lot of subtle things that make it an interesting race of goods conversion and area control challenge. I dig the simultaneous programmed action and worker placement of each player using identical decks of cards. I like how the action cards have different costs and how they determine initiative order. I like the time value of money tradeoff between shipping goods to a better market (West vs. East Canary Islands) for more cash in a future turn versus some quick cash now--great! Another time value of money decision that I like is choosing to pay for an extra action (I would like to see more games have this). I dig the competing sub plot of out foxing and influencing mayor control of each island using workers, ships and goods of the islands for those critical (and accumulating) round end points.  You can' just go balls-to-the-wall cultivating and selling grapes, sugar, and wheat.  I like the thematic game element where developing settlements reduces acres for growing crops. I also like that this game always ends before you want it to. Game board map of Canary Islands is beautiful.

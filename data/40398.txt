A mean-spirited but mercifully fast card game based on the awful board game.  The winner will likely be the one that draws the best action cards, some of which are back-breaking.  Not at all strategic.

Good and fast. That's the two words that come to mind with this card game. The game is a nice extension of the Monopoly theme and a solid rummy variant. There's a few different tactics to employ depending on the hand dealt to you. The game allows for some creative use of wild cards as you can reorganize (Chapter 13?) your properties. The two person game loses much of the "bankrupting" that can occur with more players (simply too much money for only two players) but that's a minor gripe. There can be some big swings in fortune but hey, that's in keeping with the Monopoly theme! Since two player games last about 15 minutes, I don't feel bad if I get some poor draws. Nice to see Hasborg can still create a decent game.

My wife and I really enjoy playing this - winning depends both on luck (the cards you draw) and skill (when and how to play them).  There is a neat offensive/defensive balance to the game as well, since if you don't have enough cash you must give up properties.  Highly recommended.

We like this game, especially with five or more players (shhh, don't tell HGEA!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ee1CntEVyU). Like the Monopoly board game, this cards-only game is mostly a lot of luck, but it is much quicker and can be quite dramatic in how fast a player goes from rags to riches--and vice versa! Our 7-year old (HGEA is really going to bust me on this one) mastered it after playing it twice and often wins now, much to the chagrin of her older siblings. I am giving this an 8 for now because we really do "enjoy playing and would suggest it."

So happy to have this in my collection. Plays great with two, and easy-to-grasp rules make it a good choice to play with the kids. It can be turbulent -- there is a lot of card churn, and I really like that anything on the table counts as cash in-hand. Great, fast little filler.

Simple game that is fun for the family, but makes little sense for monopoly fanatics.

The fluid fluctuation of the set collection makes this game, both hilarious and frustrated to play.

There are better filler games than this. Play this for the sake that its monopoly themed.

I can't resist the sound of a great little filler card game.. Played this with 2 players, very decent. The only problem is the rules discrepancy between the quick reference card and main rules: (a) you can pay fines from your bank or your properties OR (b) pay from your bank, and then your properties. We play with (a). The other negative is that the cards are super warped. Other than that, fun and fast in around 10 minutes! 2015 UPDATE: The reviews reminded me that this is a quick and easy card game. Keeper!

Some nasty cards can make this a mean game.  The main problem I have with it is how quick it can end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2.3
First the very few good points: 1) it's quick, although playing standard Monopoly with the original rules should never take more than two hours. 2) Given that you're playing with the cards you're dealt, you have a lot more decisions to make rather than doing what the die roll tells you; but Monopoly Deal is much worse than the original.

Why? Far too many of the cards are far too overpowered, making the game actually MORE luck dependent than the original! Yes, in standard Monopoly you may be hoping to roll a 5 rather than a 4; but that 4 will rarely kill you. In this game, what the opponents are dealt may very well kill you in one fell swoop. So any strategy you've been working on is a waste of time, whereas the strategy in standard Monopoly comes in the auctions. Yes, there's no player elimination in this game; but you'll wish you COULD be eliminated!

If you want a short Monopoly game with cards, play the far superior Express Monopoly.

Be the first collect 3 full property sets of different colors, and you'll win the monopoly deal card game. You'Ll pick up cards when it's your turn and play action cards to charge players rent, steal their cards or demand money for your birthday. Build up property sets, gather piles of money and keep wheeling and dealing until you're the monopoly deal winner!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
A game, which much like it's big brother, simply is not fun at all.  

If you can't already tell - Monopoly is anathema to me, so I was dubious from the outset and the game certainly lived-up to my low expectations.

Draw 2 cards, play 3, to your bank or to create sets of properties.  Get 3 complete sets to win, but many cards in the deck are 'take-that' style  attack cards that allow players to steal money or properties from each other.  Yuk!

Far too much luck and chaos and far too little enjoyment.  It may be small, accessible and light, but appalling graphic design of the cards only makes it worse, along with too many pissy little rules.  

The only saving grace is that it's done in 10-15 mins, but beyond that, it has absolutely no redeeming qualities.  

This may be the kind of game enjoyed by Monopoly players, masochists or those ignorant of how good gaming has become over the past 15 years.  

I'd rather flay my own skin off with a vegetable peeler than agree to play this again.

bad game, designed so bad that quite a number of important points could not be found in the rule book, which makes the game confusing

I think people are dumping on this because A) it's Monopoly and B) you can buy it in Target for like $8.  To be candid, I bought this years ago and never played it for that same thinking.  But, my game group broke it out on a lark and we're more than surprised.  This is a MEAN game.  I'm not just saying mean, but MEAN.  Total take that and you make enemies fast.  The good news is a game takes maybe 15 minutes, so the pain doesn't last long.  Very swingy, but I think in a good way.  One round, you are flush with money and property and then you just get crushed by someone.  But, come around to your next turn and you can snatch it all back.  If you've played it, you'll understand the beauty of me saying "Just Say No!"

Surprisingly fun for a mass market MONOPOLY game.

Hasbro really seems to be turning things around with the express series of games, remakes of classics, and apparently stuff like this.  Friend picked it up for about $5 at Target.  Fun, quick, and familiar (unless you've managed to never play Monopoly) interactive take-that  set collection game.  Seemed plenty lucky and not particularly deep but it ended in perhaps 15-20 minutes, well before it could wear out its welcome.  Picked up a copy and it hasn't disappointed, even with 2P.

RATING: 6
Enh...it's OK.  Your strategy is almost entirely dependent on what you draw.  There is at least one entirely too powerful card that allows you to steal a complete set from someone.  When you only need three complete sets, that's too much power from a random draw, especially with only two players.  The best I can say for it is that it's fast and at least interesting for five minutes.  Maybe it's better with more.

Surprisingly good game! Sure, there's a lot of luck involved. There are going to be games where it's pretty much impossible for you to win because of the cards you draw. But you know what? It's fun! It's light and easy to explain. The luck factor allows people of different skill levels to compete, making it a good choice for a family game.
There's also some interesting gameplay. You have to be able to defend your properties (with bank money and Just-Say-No cards) and choose which attacks you're going to defend against.

Best of all, it was on sale for only $4!

This is a fun card game based version of Monopoly. It features set collecting and cards that do many various things (give you money, properties, screw with the other players, etc.). It's very light, though. This would work well as a "next step" game for kids or non-gamers. Just make sure they know that there is a large amount of take that in the game.

Interesting combination of set collection and a take that style card game. Fits with the monopoly theme and works pretty well. There are some meaningfull decisions to be made while still allowing smaller children to play competitively. Good filler. Rules leave a lot to be desired as they leave some issues open for different interpretations. The shaker is a horrible device which will destroy any cards you shuffle in there. Don't use it.

This game is what everyone wishes Monopoly the board game could be like.  It moves lightning fast and is so much fun to play.  There are some great action cards that allow you to do some nasty things.  I love the fact that you have lots of ways to use the cards.  This may be the best Monopoly-based game I have ever played.

What makes it work is the way that things grow as the game progresses.  Players start the game struggling to pay even the smallest rent.  Then they build up their banks and their properties and nothing seems too expensive.  I also love that, in most cases, a monopoly is locked in place and protected.  This keeps the game moving and can cause a sudden and unexpected finish.

More strategies/"rules" to this game than most people know (limited but still fun).

- Always put property down as the winning criteria is to have 3 full set of property 
- The only exception not to put property is when you have no cash and only top tier property 
- Save top tier property (green, blue and brown), multi-colour wildcards, sly deal, force deal for one-turn, 3-combos to win. Never put them into play unnecessary
- Save sufficient cards for a one-turn, 3-combo abrupt win to prevent "gang-the-leader" problem
- Count and predict which player will have the "just say no" and avoid targeting him to upset your one-turn, 3-combo win
- Never have a full set of property due to deal breaker (unless both are played)
- You can switch a bi/multi-colour property around without spending a turn (most people played this wrongly and spend a turn)
- Time when to gang a cash-depleted but property-rich player
- Try not to open up (deplete cash) of a player, for another player to take his property
- Debt collector is useful to take another player's properties or hoard cash when you need money to protect your properties
- Do not use "it is my birthday" when only one other player has something in play
- It is better to target a player with small change than another with big notes when renting
- House and hotel are useless and better to be used as cash
- Always put cash into play unless you have no small change ~ 2-3m (including properties), it is better not to put big notes into play

Fun little rummy-like game.  It's quick as you draw three cards each turn.  To me, it has the feel of Monopoly in about 15 minutes.  You still want to gather properties, collect rent, etc.

Interesting concept, but it's luck heavy and the "Deal Breaker" card is too powerful (it lets you steal a complete set of properties... which can be an automatic win, just for being lucky enough to draw that card... this is lame!!!).  It would have been fine if the card let you steal a property card from a complete set, but they had to go and make an uber-powerful card.

Teriyaki Donuts says: 

Pros: Good parts of Monopoly.
Fast and easy to learn.
Fine strategy for 2+ players.

Cons: Cardstock is weak.
Too much luck involved.
Some cards are too powerful.

Conclusion: The Monopoly Deal Card Game takes all of the good aspects of Monopoly and compacts them into an enjoyable, light card game. There is quite a bit of tension involved when making a decision on whether to help yourself out or hurt others. I wasn't sure I would enjoy a game like this but Monopoly Deal was a nice surprise. 

Gypsum says:

Completely imbalanced with 2 or 5 players. 

ZackStack says:

*2 player note - modify the aptly named "Deal Breaker" cards to: "Steal a property that is part of a completed set" unless you like someone to win based on drawing one card... 

Another person says:

The only problem is the rules discrepancy between the quick reference card and main rules: (a) you can pay fines from your bank or your properties OR (b) pay from your bank, and then your properties. We play with (a). The other negative is that the cards are super warped. Other than that, fun and fast in around 10 minutes! 

Others say:

Chaotic, too much "take that", and mean spirited.  Why collect a set since it will just get stolen from you?

Tom Vasel says:

Wow, oh wow. This game is so terrible that I just couldn't believe people enjoy it so much. NO strategy! Why work for anything when someone can get better cards than you!

Surprisingly compelling. Feels arbitrary due to luck of the draw, but there's enough room for strategy and game theory that it stays satisfying. Fortunes can turn very quickly, and gameplay is simple enough for my 4 year old (with some coaching), so it gives enough of a chance to beginners.

Very easy to take off the shelf and play.

I really dislike this game, but my wife and her friends enjoy it. For me, it suffers from heavy dependence on the card draw and a VERY strong tendency of the rich getting richer. In addition, in larger groups (and we almost always play with 6-7), it is nearly impossible to hold on to property or cash as the turn goes around the table, unless you build up a MONSTROUS position.

RATING: N/A
For the record, Monopoly Deal involves no trading or deal-making. It's another rummy-like card game. This was sort of an impulse buy from Target that I got cheap thinking from the name it might be more Pit-like than Rummy-like. Alas, no. The "Deal" in the tile appears to mean dealing cards, not making deals.

It looks OK. But rummy games are a dime a dozen.

There are some interesting ideas here, like deciding whether you want to play a card for an action or money, but the rest of the game just blows.

[What it is not, I am compelled to point out, is anything resembling Monopoly, for better or for worse.] I will further shake the cape in front of the bull and state that this little game, while not something I would make a ton of time for, is every bit the game that, say, Love Letter or Coup is.

What an absolute surprise!

This card game is, as everyone else has already commented, everything we wish the board game was: fast and furious, it sometimes "feels" like "Munchkin on Wall St" due to the amount of backstabbing when someone looks like they're ready to win!

Yes, some of the cards are a bit too powerful (such as "Dealbreaker - steal a whole set"), but that can be countered with some house rules. 

I love this game - it doesn't take long to setup and play, and is a good standby when all you want is a quick game of something.

I have played this game SO much that I will only ever play it with 2 players AND against an opponent who is well skilled in the gameplay.  Otherwise it's just not fun for me.  Under those ideal conditions; however, lies an excellent game of set collection, timing and take that!

Don't let the m-word on the cover fool you. Spouse-approved, my wife played this with me 8 times in a row the first time we got it out. Very positive experience with my family. It mixes a great deal of luck with strategy. This is going to hit the table a lot for quite some time to come...

...I'm still amazed at how excited my wife got over this game.  She even started thinking up her own card ideas (I thought only I did that for games).

On the positive side - this game has a serious leg up on the original game in that it takes very little time to play.  Set-up is minimal, and even learning the rules doesn't take long.

On the negative side - the randomness of the card draw is a big factor here, especially when someone gets one of the more powerful cards.  Perhaps a few more "Just Say No" cards would add some balance?

This game is definitely OK, but not one I'd actively ask to play again.

A surprisingly speedy game of Monopoly! Seriously, I think the longest a game I've played has lasted is maybe 10 minutes? It's still extremely luck based, but with such a short game time it works well as a filler or an intro for people who have literally only played Monopoly before.

RATING: 7
Quick game.  The overall idea of Monopoly exists--get a a monopoly and charge as much rent as possible.  

The pros:  Fast version of Monopoly.  The fortune of events can swing pretty fast.  It brings back a lot of Monopoly memories without all the time committed.  The game is quick.  

The cons:  When you get pretty far behind, just like Monopoly, it is pretty close to impossible to win.  You watch your life drain out of you with each successive turn.

I used to rate this game a 6, but changed it to a 4 after playing it so much.  It was a wonderful little game for my 70+ plays, but I just don't have any desire to play it again.

This is an relatively enjoyable and light card game.  There's some planning involved, but a lot of it relies on the luck of the draw.

My favorite aspect is that games take such a little amount of time to complete that screwage never leads to hard feelings.  You just shuffle the cards and start again.

Monopoly condensed down into a fast and, more importantly, fun, game.  You can play a game in under 15 minutes, so it makes for a great filler.  Plus, it's highly competitive, so if you like games where you can pull the rug out from under the other players' feet, you'll love this one.

This game even advertises that it only takes 15 minutes. Random card game where you try to set collect without worrying about rolling dice and going to jail. Money is used to prevent others from taking property from you rather than buying property since you simply play cards in front of you. Highly luck of the draw dependent. Filler version of Monopoly.

[thing=40398][/thing] has been a huge hit with the family.  I was really surprised as there is not a huge amount to it.  Set collecting with some wild swingy cards.  I played this and Flower Fall one after the other with the family.  And I was surprised which one they liked and which they didn’t.  I’d called it the other way around.

So, 8 from my 13 year old daughter, just 5 from me.

This card game version of Monopoly is extremely luck-based due to the cards dealt and drawn.  The game play can be very swingy with many "steal" type action cards that cannot be countered unless you are lucky enough to have the right card.  The saving grace is that it plays a lot faster than the board versions of monopoly.

2017-07-30 : First play. I had heard that this was ok for a Monopoly flavoured game, but found out it has a very high take-that level. You have some decisions to make, but whether they turn out to be good or bad is almost entirely random. One player had already won, while another actually had less than what he had started with - the difference being luck of the draw, not better play. The bright points are that indeed this retains the Monopoly flavour in a card game, and that it indeed plays in 15 minutes.

Unlike the full Monopoly game (which I abhor), Monopoly Deal is actually fun! It's a quick and crazy card game that's not designed to be taken super seriously, yet it is a great filler.  I especially like this multilingual version because instead of the standard property names (Boardwalk, Park Place, etc.) it uses famous Chinese street names! I think that makes it kind of different and unique.

My son's game, received as a gift.  Proof that "Monopoly" in the title doesn't always mean bad.  It's a half-decent card game that's quite fun to play.

There's a slightly dumbed down version that seems to be regarded as worse, although arguably better for just 2 players:

This is a great little filler game that is easy for all ages to play. It plays quickly, and has all the fun parts of Monopoly (collecting sets, taking stuff from other players) without all the tedium and length. It is rapidly becoming my family's favorite game to play together. My five-year-old can play very well with just a little help with some of the more obscure actions (he can't read much yet), and my 7-year-old plays completely by himself. It's fun, it's fast, and is by far the best way I've found to play Monopoly.

Played 1 time with 3 (kid) players and one time with 3 adults. The game looks nice and is easy to play, but is really only a 5. Thing is, non-gamers will play it because it is called Monopoly and a "5" game that is short and others like is a game I can agree to play, so I will give it a 6. I wish you could scale the game down for less players by removing property sets, but I think it would be impossible as the many cards are color-interdpendent. Also, there is too much text on the cards for younger kids, so 7+ (or 8+ as recommended on the box) is about right. [BuyWM. Sold.]

Hate monopoly?  That's actually ok.  This game doesn't last forever like monopoly and doesn't end with table flips half the time like monopoly. Its a nice cheap game that can be played quickly.  Good for camping or taking on vacations to play in the hotel room while you and the family or friends wind down at the end of the day.

Fairly brainless filler card game. Some basic set collection (Rummy, anyone) plus ridiculously overpowered event cards (e.g., take a complete set from an opponent).

Ultimately, there are many better card games to play with gamers, but a good game to play with non-gamers to introduce them the wider world of card games - so, rated a 6 (23/10/11).

Easy to learn and pretty fun to play for just a little deck of cards. There's a lot of luck involved with the game, but you can hold cards back so your hand goes over 7, and dump the ones you don't want. Or you can hold them back for later as defense, or when the timing is right. I enjoy it when I play it. It is a "take that" sort of game. It's good to build up your money bank to protect your properties from getting used up. Hitting your opponents early with rent can snag a few properties too if they don't have a bank account to pay for the goods. One thing I noticed was giving up your big bank bills first was better because the bank account is useless as far as any sort of win (maybe other than a tie breaker I suppose). Keeping smaller bills around allows you to pay off some of the smaller debts and you can combine bank notes to pay out, and hopefully avoid having to pay in properties. Build up a house on a full set, and snap a Hotel on there, then you can hit for big rent. If you double that you can eat your opponents bank account and maybe even snag some properties.

Fun and quick, but the balance of the whole thing relies on the constant awareness of the deal breaker card, and that means that for people who have played more than once it has a weird, unpleasant tension to it, and devolves into a game of stall-tactics where everyone tries to delay placing properties until they absolutely have to, or until they are lucky enough to come up with a great combination of cards, or multiple no thanks cards to counter the deal breakers, forced deals, and sly deals that their opponents will inevitably fire off at them. In the end it just falls apart. Still, a reasonable filler, and it plays just as well (maybe better) with two people as it does with 3 or more.

A card set collecting game based on the classical Monopoly properties. It works well as a fun and light card game.

This is a great and fun game, quick to learn and easy to master.

A card game where the winner can only be one turn away. Cards like deal breaker make this a game of tension, do you really want to out all your properties out, or will they get stolen from you?

This is such an easy and quick game that you can teach it to people easily. 

I put this as a 9 because of the geek rating system, but my girlfriend LOVES playing this game. I find myself sometimes not wanting to play simply because there are other games I would want to play instead of Deal. 

But upon playing one or two hands I do get into it.

Ingenious for what it is:  a ubiquitous license slapped all over a not-bad set-collection game with heavy "take that" elements.  It's [i]Monopoly[/i] as played by the masses who don't bother to read the proper rules and learn it instead by way of ritual and oral tradition—far less a proper trading game and more as a set-collection/bleed-'em-out death march—compressed into 10 minutes.

So, is it [i]Monopoly[/i]?  No, but it is the distilled essence of how most people play the game.  And that's where this thing is weirdly perfect.

[b]BECAUSE CREATING AND PROMOTING AS THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD A WORTHLESS PIECE OF CARDBOARD WITH A FEW SHINY BITS AND DICE IS NOT ENOUGH; WE MUST ALSO MAKE A CARD GAME BASED ON IT![/b]

I hate the crappy commercials Hasbro produced for TV as a promotion of their lousy board games (Ok, ok, Clue is not a bad game and Risk is a good choice for every person wanting to have alternate means of entertainment available, but those are astronomical exceptions), but I especially hate those that put Monopoly under some sort of “holy light”. People, deal with it: Monopoly is a piece of sh*t game, if it can be called “game” at all.

With that in mind, when I saw at the supermarket (Not the best place to go when looking for good board games) the Monopoly Card Game deck, I felt that a chance had to be given to that game, because maybe the guys at Hasbro realized they own the patents to a game that had given a bad name to the entire community of board gamers for many years. Also, I didn’t think it could be half as bad as the board game itself. Plus, it was not too expensive. I took the risk.

All I have to say about this putrid example of paper waste is the following, and I will not continue this review, since it really annoys the hell out of me that I lost an hour of mine and my ex-girlfriend’s time learning how to play this thing, only to throw back in the box it came from, never to take it out again: If Monopoly Is a bad (And I insist, I am being polite and as civil as I can be) game, the card game it spawned is a lot worse.

You are warned.

[b][i]II. Sliders[/i][/b]

Abstract [b]________[COLOR=#FF0000][9][/COLOR]_[/b] Themed: The whole idea of the game is to have the players act like monkeys, much like it happened with its predecessor. Sure, there is a theme in this game, a very strong, evil theme.
 
Simple [b]_________[COLOR=#FF0000][10][/COLOR][/b] Complex: Unnecessarily hard for a card game, amazingly plain and boring, it really amazes me that this game was ever meant to be played and not meant as a fancy glass coaster set. There’s no real strategy behind it, but it’s still not simple enough to call it a filler. Just play your cards, protect your money, wait for the perfect moment and attack your opponents, hoping they don’t have other defenses and can’t really hurt you afterwards.

Strategic [b]__________[/b] Tactical: I will appeal to the feeling I get when I play Monopoly: If you have the right cards and start with enough money, you may get lucky, but the constant need for buying and investing in properties you won’t actually get to use if you don’t keep a certain plan in your mind is silly. 
 
Luck [b]_______[COLOR=#FF0000][8][/COLOR]__[/b] Skill: There’s a lot less luck involved in this game than in its daddy’s mechanics, but the right set of cards, the right amount of defenses and money doesn’t make up for the fact that the game is broken and tends to be either bland with 2-player games or amazingly ruthless and pointless with more than 3 players. 

Fiddly [b]_[COLOR=#FF0000][2][/COLOR]________[/b] Elegant: A bad game usually means a bad set of rules. To much loop holes. It lacks consistency and purpose and it fails to determine if the players win because they’re the best or because  they reach their goal first..
 
Indirect interaction [b]_________[COLOR=#FF0000][10][/COLOR][/b] Direct interaction: Meh, it’s a very interactive game, because you’re actually trying to steal money and properties from the other players. 

Cutthroat [b][COLOR=#FF0000][1][/COLOR]_________[/b] Friendly: It’s Monopoly; Of course it’s going to be a cutthroat game.

Heavy use of language [b]________[COLOR=#FF0000][9][/COLOR]_[/b] No language needed: At least there’s not much language involved, since the game relies mostly on color schemes and sets… There are a few lines here and there, but nothing that will be impossible to understand..

[b][i]III. Number of players recommended[/i][/b]: None.

Monopoly Deal is a quicker, more fast-paced set collection version of the original game. It includes a fair amount of strategy with a dash of 'take that'. All that being said, it's very fun to play and probably more enjoyable than the original, too. The Monopoly theme isn't really necessary here, but it adds to the game play because it's so gosh darn nostalgic. If Monopoly has left a bad taste in your mouth, then give Monopoly Deal a try. I think you might like it!

Simple. Fun. Fast. As advertised. The game has a lot of "take that" style cards that make it frustrating at times but this is redeemed by the mild depth in the hand management. Play the right property cards at the right time so you try to think around your opponents' cards. I recommend this game for casual play with a monopoly theme that won't ruin friendships or be mind numbingly boring. Keeper.

Not too bad card game with some nice ideals.There are a few cards that seem pretty powerful and like most card games you can get lucky with the cards. 
 Also you could get ganged up on and have no shot of winning if your opponents choose to do so. The game is short enough though so even if you get unlucky it will end soon anyway. My wife enjoys this so I am sure we will play it pretty often.

A card game spin off of the original monopoly that is extremely luck based.  For example, I was losing a game and with a lucky draw of 2 cards I was able to steal enough cards to force players to trade with me and win in a single turn.  A win without any gratification hardly counts.

RATING: 2
The backs of the cards are not reversible, meaning they have a definite up and down, but the faces of some, but not all, cards are reversible. Most people will, when receiving cards, will turn the face cards that aren't reversible the right way up so they can read them, but will leave upside down reversible cards the way they are. This means that if you look at another player's cards and see that some are upside down, you know roughly what types of cards are in their hand. Normally, causing players in a card game to unintentionally reveal the contents of their hand would be a catastrophically bad design decision. Monopoly Deal is so lacking in strategic or tactical decisions that knowing what's in another player's hand doesn't matter.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (April 2013)

This game is way better than its parent game Monopoly, still it is a regular game with lots of luck and obvious decisions. The only redeeming factor (for me) is that it can play (relatively ) quickly. It is also very easy to teach making it perfect to introduce new people (or family)  into our beloved hobby.

I feel the game is too light for my current gaming tastes, I would play it again mainly due to the short playtime.

Current Rating: 4.5

This game is certainly quicker than the base game of Monopoly. Although the cards are mean (stealing properties from your opponent, demanding birthday money etc), the game is so quick and light that it doesn't bother me. Will consider playing it occasionally.

I wanted to like this one.  I really did.  For some reason though, it just didn't sit too well with my group.  It definitely works as a game and the mechanics fit in with the cutthroat style of the original Monopoly game.  Maybe it's just that I've never been a huge fan of Monopoly anyways.  I don't know exactly what it was, but it just didn't work for us.  I'd be willing to give it another try, I just wouldn't ask for it.

Don't expect much from a monopoly related game. That being said, it's much more fun and much quicker than the normal monopoly. Almost all luck based.

I'm not a fan of the board game & this card game is played in less time (minutes, instead of hours) than the  original--which is a plus.  With that said, I can't really get all enthusiastic about a card game--though very simple--that is Monopoly.  It is fast, it does take skill but is also comes down to the luck-of-the-draw in my opinion.  To be fair, it's good for game night filler--for when you're done with the epic game & no one is ready to go home yet.  I don't like it & I don't hate it--it's just... there.  Meh.

Not a fan. Very dependent on who draws a couple of powerful cards (that can allow you to take sets). Not a huge amount of strategy involved because strategy gets you nowhere if someone else draws the right card.

I was happy to try this game. I knew that it probably wouldn't be for me, but I can definitely see what people like about the game.

If you like Monopoly, even though the cards are extremely unbalanced, this actually does a god job mimicking the feel of the original game. The properties dry up and then all you do is cycle through the action cards. This produces some incredibly annoying swings (steal someone's complete set!), but actually feels similar to regular Monopoly, where you just roll and hope to avoid the big ticket properties.

That said, I don't like regular Monopoly, so this is not a feature I enjoy. The stealing is really annoying, and the fact that you can steal a complete set is completely broken. But at least this is tied up in 15 minutes. It knows that anything longer would be excruciating.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Not bad, probably worth the five bucks I spent.  If the cards wear out soon, which it looks like they will, I don't know if I'd buy it again.  There's just a little too much luck and randomness. 

That being said, it's not too fair from rather complex game and I could see some interesting variations come up.  (Ie card purchased from the middle, action-style, etc).

Probably the biggest advantage of this game is that it is quick. There is no need to think a lot and a large role in the game is played by lack, so the quick end of one game and start of another one is a very large advantage. On the other hand, the game is interesting enough for 15 minutes.

Tikriausiai didžiausias šio žaidimo privalumas - jis greitas. Kadangi galvoti per daug nereikia, daug lemia sėkmė, tai greita pabaiga ir naujo žaidimo pradžia yra labai didelis privalumas. Kita vertus, 15 minučių žaidimas tikrai įtraukia.

This is game is a bit random and encourages cutthroat game play.  The fact that someone can steal one of your completed sets if they have the right card seems to take the cutthroat nature of the game a little to far.

This game surprised me. It isn't that bad. It does, however, seem to rely a lot on getting rent cards. I've had a terrible run with the deals recently which has just highlighted my frustration.

I think this game also works better with a gaming group that is happy for hard and fast inanity. My group tends to strategies too much which really slows this game down.

Great representation of the monopoly game on a card game!
Even though there are too many cards.
I'm used to play faster card games, this one takes a while for each play, but its play time is waaaay shorter than a standard monopoly game.

For what it is, great game. Gives you the feel of Monopoly with some set building and cool cards. That said, I wouldn't say there is terrible too much actual strategy you can do. Mostly tactical decisions that are almost spelled out for you.

Monopoly that is not tear your hair out frustrating.   Games go by quick so you don't get the opportunity to get angry.  The action in game is a bit too light for 2 player games and seem unbalanced.  Prefer 3 to 4 players to keep everyone on their toes. The game also suffers from the luck factor.  Players that draw an initial bad hand will have a difficult time pulling from the depths.

RATING: 3
Painfully slow with 4-5 players who are learning the game, it also feels quite broken due to the two cards that let you steal a whole set from someone.  There is little point to playing those cards until you can make the move to win which stagnates those cards and makes it difficult for anyone else to win.  Money is useful in this game, but not ultimately the game winning condition as the top two in money in both of my first two games did not win.

played one on one with my gf a few times and found that luck played an important role. Not much strategy involved in the game and most of the time there are plenty of left $$ in the bank. So in the end it boils down to who can draw the action card to finish the game. MAybe it is better in the multiplayer game??

played with multiple players today, much more fun and strategy than 2 players. the rules are not v.clear and need to refer online for guidance...

Monopoly Deal is a pleasantly short card version of the classic board game Monopoly. If you've ever wanted to satisfy the need to play Monopoly but don't have the patience or the time to end up in a stale mate with a friend, Monopoly Deal pulls through and some! This should appeal to most lovers of the classic and also entice the card enthusiasts. While it's complexity is non-existent it still allows for great use of strategy and competition for those wanting a little more. But most importantly, being friendly towards any age group and skill level, Monopoly deal works well for any family or friend occasion. One game to have on hand at all times! 7.5/10.

Pretty good. Some of the cards are very swingy (like the one that steals a whole set from someone) but it's a case of knowing about them and mitigating with a cancel action card. Fun little game

I understand why they wanted to make a fast-paced card-based Monopoly game, but other than being mercifully short, it's worse than the original in almost every way. Much as I can't stand to play the original Monopoly board game, it has its charms, which are more or less absent from Monopoly Deal. Besides that, Deal is chaotic because players can steal one another's sets. I won't play this again.

Not a bad little card game with something of the feel of Monopoly (both good and bad). Some nice mechanics using action cards for money. The aim is to collect 3 sets of property of different colours (I have the UK edition). However, there are several powerful cards that make the game a bit random and nasty at times, and the winner will mostly be determined by luck.

This is actually a good bit of fun. It's a very quick game, and has a neat little mechanic of cards having multiple uses (a la San Juan style). They can be used as money, property, houses, etc. The only weird part about this game is how it ends. It can end rather abruptly, and surprisingly. "Oh, it's over now, that was fast..." Overall, I'd say definitely give it a try. It captures a lot of the good feelings you actually want from playing Monopoly, and packages them in a tight, fast card game.

I don't mind playing Monopoly once in a while with family. It's fast since everyone gets bored with it in an hour; actually I don't remember if we finished a game ever. 

Monopoly Deal gets the theme perfectly, but it's a much faster game. If you've missed it's title it's a card game; naturally a fairly random one, yet it has much more strategy than the board game. Quick, mean, portable and has everything, and much more that Monopoly could offer.

Game in a Nutshell: Card game version of Monopoly where the biggest differences are you draw cards and keep them instead of rolling around and buying what you land on; and you play cards that let you steal or trade from people rather then real negotiation. 

Played as: 3,4,5 player

Pros: Non-gamers game... check. Quick, cheap, easy, familiar. I have to hand it too the designers, they really have lumped almost the entire essence of Monopoly down into a simple quick card game. The only thing missing is the negotiation... something that always felt broken in the board game anyway.

Cons: While smart play might make the difference between winning and not quite winning, luck of the draw is going to determine whether you even have a chance or are just plain dragging your butt. The thing I find most annoying is how real trading and negotiation has been replaced with playing a card. For all Monopoly's faults, one thing it wasn't, was a quiet game. You could essentially play this without so much as a peep and not much opportunity for meta-gaming either.

Other: Ok, so maybe I missed the point... it's supposed to be light and fun. But unfortunately, it falls in the same exact category (quick, light, and easy) as several other great game, No Thanks! for example, which I enjoy immensely more and would choose to play 99 times out of 100. 

Best Use: Maybe not a bad pick-up if all you have to choose from is something off the wall at Walmart.

Surprisingly, pretty good! The rules are simple, and despite some initial confusion over the function of the bank, the game is fairly fluid. The card game is a bit more cutthroat in ways than the board game, and plays a lot faster. Not for players who suffer from analysis paralysis though, as although the game is short, turns with AP players will surely feel like a lifetime by comparison.

All in all, a surprisingly good little filler, made better by an incredibly reasonable price.

My opinion is that the take that is a bit too heavy and somewhat deterministic on who will win the game. The cards are too overpowered to steal other people's sets.

This game is not as bad as the 'Monopoly' monicker and the Hasbro badge may make you initially think.

It really has nothing to do with Monopoly and simply uses the original properties as card titles (theme of sorts) and the concept of collecting sets of Monopolies. 

Each turn you are allowed to draw 2 cards and play up to 3. The key mechanic is to play money into your bank as players can demand money from you in various ways and if you have no cash you will be forced to pay with Property (which you need to form 3 sets in order to win).

There are a series of action cards that do different things and one or two are way too powerful and can swing or win the game quickly...so it isn't perfect.

But in the end what we have here is a good. easy to learn and quick to play card game that is perfect for families, especially those with kids under 10.

Being quite easy to play 4-5 games in an hour, this would be ideal for a family holiday and it is most likely very cheap anywhere in the world.

Monopoly deal is great game that costs 5 bucks, takes 5 minutes to explain, and takes 20 minutes to play.  I think that it is great fun in the right group, especially with people that don't play board games often.

An easily-grasped, lightweight and quick-playing game of chance, where a definite loss can turn into a strong win in a single turn (proven) depending on the draw of the cards.  There is a degree of strategic depth to the game, however it can all be blown away by an opponent's lucky draw.
The Monopoly chrome makes set collection easy to explain, providing a possible bridge into more interesting card games.

Played this a fair bit with a friend in HS and a little at college. Its a much more appreciated improvement over Monopoly.

Its faster, its relatively simple to understand, and the gameplay is good for family/children/nongamers. I personally didn't rate it higher because the amount of strategy/my control isn't high and its a little chancey, but its still a nice game for the right audience.

This game did not go over well with my full group. When everyone is there, things can get competitive and there is a great deal of AP. In this game thinking over a move may feel like it helps but if your opponent draws a deal breaker there's nothing you can really do in my opinion. We stopped playing after our third game annoyed and bitter (Absolute randomness is a killer for our group though). With the right group I could see this being a fun game, especially for a light party game. Just not for me.

Much more fun than my nostalgic classic monopoly board game. Action packed and always can't wait to draw more just to see what you will get next. A great party game for everyone.

Qualms: 95% Luck and 5% Skill. Sometimes your luck is just rotten and it will be impossible to win regardless. It will be better if there is an action card that allows you to take an opponent's player cards so that they can't hoard deal breakers and any other combos that are just waiting for the luck of the draw.

I must admit I thought all of these "classic" Parker Brothers games that were coming out in card game and other formats were a little dubious at first.  But so far I've really enjoyed Sorry Sliders, Scrabble Slam, Yahtzee Free for All, and now Monopoly Deal.  Fun, fast set-collecting filler.

Update:  A Transformers version?  Really?  Now that's just not playing fair!  Of course I had to own one, but found it nearly impossible to obtain.  Fortunately I knew someone who was going to Tai Pei.  Now I gots one.

It's fun to play. Easy to teach. 15 minutes game time. But very luck dependent like as other short and easy games. Suddenly you can use all your cards. Game includes 110 cards but they need to be redesigned again or number of some cards need to be change(+/-) to decrease luck factor a bit then it's score can be above 7 or maybe 7.5. But I liked finally a game which includes Monopoly text in it's name.

I bought this for the same reason I got "Sorry Sliders" and "Yahtzee Free-For-All": to hopefully influence my family to give up playing old standards. Plays like its board game parent, but in about 15 minutes. Excellent!

However, this is not a game to play with people who don't like screwage, because, like unrestrained capitalism, there are no holds barred in the play of the cards. That is, just about anything goes, including outright theft of sets of cards. In that regard, I didn't count on first, my wife storming out of the room when I stole her stack, and the next day, our 11-year-old son (2010) doing the same, for the same reason. ('Oops'.) 

First one to collect 3 sets wins. I like this game because it takes "Monopoly" and boils it down to what it should be: a quick-playing card game that takes maybe 15 minutes to complete.

Epilog on game play: although my wife and son remain bitter individuals about me stealing their properties, my sister, a total gamer, visited and played this with me and had no problem with either being stolen from or stealing card sets. She carried through to victory against me with more than a little 'up yours/take that!' verbiage thrown in.

I purchased this in late July 2010.

Much better than Monopoly.  A lot of luck and swinginess with the low number of powerful cards that let you steal properties and complete sets of properties.  There weren't enough rent cards to make that a significant factor that would even out some of the swinginess.  

I've seen suggestions of adding the rent cards from a second set.  I think that would make it better, but I don't know if I want to buy a second copy of a game I won't play a lot.

RATING: 6
A very light take-that game which lasts exactly as long as it should ... not long! Draw 2, play up to 3. The aim is to be the first to get three complete colour sets (the cards replicate the board locations) but the deck also has a bunch of money cards and take-that cards, the former usually the victim of the latter. So play money cards into your bank, play colour cards into sets, and then watch the take-that cards circulate them all around until someone stumbles into a win. And some of those cards are very powerful, so don't get emotionally invested. But the play is fast and can be fun, and it finishes in the right time frame, 15 mins or so, so it fills a nice niche.

It's simple, easy to learn and even easier to teach. You play it in 10 or 15 mins and it's simply a game to screw the other players and where you need to be lucky with the card draw, so if you need a game when you're on the road and just want to spend a few laughable minutes with your friends, why not have a go in this one then?

RATING: 6
Don't run away, it's actually not bad! It's a fun little filler that you can pick up for $5, and is easy enough to get non-gamers into thanks to the familiarity of Monopoly. There are some ambiguities in the rules (mostly resolved by an online FAQ) and some of the cards are overpowered (hello Deal Breaker) but it's still a pleasant enough way to pass half an hour.

Interesting variant with the Monopoly theme. At its heart it is a set collection game. Yes it is highly random, but you ample opportunity to interfere with and raid your opponents.

It is fairly light - but provides decisions to keep your interest.

A lighter, faster game of monopoly with cards.  It's not a great game, but it's a decent filler.

Just bought this recently, as the youngest has been asking to play Monopoly and - as it takes HOURS - we've been a bit reluctant. This card game has much of the same appeal of the board game, but takes - literally - ten minutes to play. Even got the teenage son playing, and although the rules look complicated, he picked it up in minutes. Some very familiar Monopoly elements - property group collecting, rent collecting, the random factor - without the interminable trips around the board, and a few extra bits of nastiness as well (beware the Deal Breaker!). Great fun.

Fun little card game plays in about 20 minutes.  I'll give it a rating of 7.5 with 3 or 4 players.  With 2 or 5 players, the game either suffers for lack of opponents or property cards become too spread out.  With 2 or 5, I'd rate the game as only a 5.

A vicious and chaotic take-that style of card game that is more or less an exercise a retaliative chaos with a popular them woven around it. Apart from some limited push-your-luck, I don't see much game in here, but it is silly fun nonetheless.

RATING: 7
This one is a surprise: It's a take-that luck-fest card game, almost devoid of strategy. What makes this work and not torturous like Fluxx is that hurting an opponent helps you at the same time.

In this game, players are simply trying to complete three groups of property cards. In your typical take-that game, there would be special cards that would force opponents to discard these property cards. In Monopoly Deal, this is not the case; property cards are never discarded, simply stolen by other players. This means the game will eventually end by the time the draw deck is empty.

Let us get this straight - I HATE Monopoly. I find it to be by far one of the most boring and pointless boardgames on the planet! Shockingly - this quick play card game is tolerable and a decent filler. Don't get carried away though - plenty of better fillers out there too!

Atendendo ao lugar que ocupa no ranking e às boas criticas que tem recebido, esperava muito mais deste jogo que, na verdade, de Monopoly tem pouco... Enfim, alguém viu um bom tema para colar numa mecânica acabada de criar e conseguiu fazer de um jogo medíocre um jogo com vendas astronómicas; ainda assim, supera o original, pois não proporciona uma seca tão grande e também me parece ser mais fluído. Evitável!

Great, quick game for the entire family. If playing with more than 2 players, a good start with lots of cash to buffer your properties is crucial. If your properties are vulnerable, you will be targeted.

RATING: 7
Great filler game as well as family night game. Easy to teach and learn but learning the game tactics takes a few plays - which is a good thing.

Plays best with 3 - a little longer but still good with 4. Too long with 5 or 6. 2 player is good also.

Players: 2-5

Players win by being the first to collect three complete property sets. All cards may double as money for the bank, and there are various action cards which allow you to steal properties, charge rent, build hotels, collect debt, etc. to interfere with your opponents.

Possesses interaction through take-that mechanisms (okay), unremarkable gameplay (bad), completely devoid of strategy (bad) and unmitigated randomness (very bad). It's under the guise of monopoly because you are buying and selling real estate properties, but if that experience is what was being sought out, For Sale is, unquestionably, the superior experience.

with proper rules alternation (Monopoly Deal Money Run) it is a very good game (otherwise I would give it 5.5)

When we've tried Monopoly Deal first time we were disapointed a lot (we have many board/card games), there was no reason to collect money/rent, unbalanced play (very quick without necessity of any strategy just to collect three sets which was very easy with wild cards).

As a last chance I changed the rules quite significantly. And....now we are playing Monopoly Deal a lot, our friends started to play them too (with Money Run rules of course).

So I suggest to promote these rules somehow and help Monopoly Deal receive better repute then it currently have.

These are 'Money Run' rules/changes to original rules:
- there are no multicolored property wild cards for 2/3 players game
- winner becomes the player with most money collected
- game ends when
    1. four collections are completed (2/3 players)
    2. three collections are completed (4+ players)
  or
  when stack is empty (no restocking with discarded cards)
- value of moneycards of players are not shown (even though player should have their money cards stocked on the table)
- if the game ends with wild card rearangement (to make last collection), this is considered as one card move (so it is not possible to use three cards and then end the game in the same turn) /VARIANT: It is always (during the game) considered as an one card move
- payer which ends the game (completes required sets of properties) receives 10M bonus.

There is a lot of strategy involved...how and when and if to end the game, or to choose if you pay with money or land cards, etc.

To sum it all, REALLY NICE game it is now. :-)

Hál' istennek köze nincs a táblás változathoz. A mi társaságunkba nagyon bejött. Egyszerű, pörgős, kicsit lehet benne fricskázni a másikat. Tény ezek mellett, hogy jó adag mázli kell a sikerhez, de pl. strand játéknak ideális.
Maga a pakli minősége lehetne jobb is (fényes lapok...). Nem egy stratégiát igénylő játék, de a taktikázásban észnél kell azért lenni. 2-5 fő között a játékélmény szinte változatlan.(Kisebb létszámnál érdemes esetleg saját szabályokkal játszani, pl. nem 3, hanem 4 ingatlancsoport megszerzéséig).
Fontos, hogy egyfolytában összefogásra van szükség, hogy az aktuálisan megerősödő játékos folyamatos nyomás alatt legyen.

There's a real irony to this game being in the Monopoly line, as I feel there's no control over the end game, and this game can overstay it's welcome.  However it's welcome is about 15-20 mins, so if it sticks around for 30, I don't feel miserable.  A pretty simple set collection/take that game that can eat a few minutes here and there.

The best thing this game has going for it is that it's a Monopoly game, and therefore VERY accessible to folks who don't play modern board games.  It's really just a rummy game, and at every number of players there are rummy games I prefer more, but some folks will just be drawn to the Monopoly name, and it's by no means a bad game.

OK card filler. It takes 15-20 minutes to play. But, it suffers from that same fate that monopoly does: to do well you have to hurt the other players, in a game where it doesn't really make sense to do so.  For instance, in Wings of War, you realize you have to shoot down the other players in order to do well. It makes sense thematically and with how the game works. But, in monopoly... I don't know, I never liked that aspect of it.

A Monopoly card game! It's simple, quick (20 mins max) and easy. I feel the ideas of property trading could of been expanded, but my kids seem to love it, why? Maybe because they have as much chance of winning as an adult with some heavy leveling  cards and they understand the theme from the board game. Money gathering seems lop sided after a few rounds to the point of over supply. Maybe some taxation cards to the dis-card pile on people with a stack of cash would of have made for a tighter game?

Looking at games for kids workshop I said to myself - dang, what we would need is something like Munchkin (accessible, silly take that game), but in Slovene. Monopoly Deal Card game came pretty close. It's cheap, it's in Slovene, the theme is attractive to people even if cards don't really scream "excitement". And it's a take that game that finishes in 15-20 minutes. Which is: :wow: 

Certainly one of the better pure take that games out there if not the best - it shows that they had a development/design team who knew what they were doing. And the Monopoly theme works. As much as it can - you collect sets (properties), you "steal" money from other player treasures. And like in the parent game - the idea of bankrotting somebody is to get their properties. First player with 3 sets wins. 

A really cleaver reimagining that's short, dynamic, exciting. The only downside I'd say is that the theme of building one's portfolio is rather dull, but I guess it depends on the nostalgia value for Monopoly game. 
We were surprised how much kids got into it and figured out the game on their own.

RATING: 7
Simple rummy-style set collection game. Every round you draw 2 cards and play 3 cards which could be either cards for some of the sets, money or action cards (extra draw, steal other player cards or sets, swap cards, charge the other players to pay you some money etc.).
The trick is that your hand can't be attacked by the action cards, so, you need think what to play on the table. Also, if you need to pay and don't have enough money you need to pay with your properties (the sets you are collecting). The first player to collect 3 sets is the winner.
It's a very quick game, it is luck based, but the decisions are not always automatic. Overall a very good filler game.

This game is fairly popular as it is commercially available in toy stores. Unlike the actual Monopoly, this game actually has a definite end. As it is quite ubiquitous, I can rely on other people explaining the rules, which is a refreshing change.

Although more fun than Monopoly, and with clever mechanics like cards doubling up as money, you can be screwed by not having cards go your way. A number of card games offer ways to deal with such situations, but this game doesn't. While Monopoly Deal is not bad in a pinch, I'd suggest a different card game if possible.

RATING: 6
Painless enough to replay and surprisingly decent (can be nasty). Players start with a hand of 5 cards. On each turn, they draw 2 more (or back to 5 if they have none). 

Then play three cards. The idea is to meld sets of properties. First to three sets wins. There are plenty of action cards (most of the TAKE THAT! variety). There are also money cards to put out in case you get hit with a take that.

Offers some moderate challenge in timing the placement of your cards right. Do you put out your sets midway or wait till late game for fear of someone stealing key cards.

I purchased this because it was cheap and had decent reviews. I hoped to entice some people to play that enjoyed Monopoly.

Monopoly Deal is a quick interactive card game. Better than regular Monopoly but it still gets old quickly.

These card games are just another way to excessively market the monopoly/risk/sorry, etc. names. Boring!

A Monopoly themed card game that has very little to do with the original game, yet still fun! Although the game calls for three "completes" to win, when playing only two players we like to up the winning condition to 5 completes...

Very light and luck based, but since it plays in 10-15 minutes it's hard to get too upset if you lose to bad draws. This manages to keep the core mechanics of Monopoly (collect property, charge rent) but get rid of all the other terrible Monopoly stuff, and add a fun hand management mechanic to boot.

The only playable Monopoly iteration that: A. won't upset everyone involved, B. won't last three excruciating hours, and C. won't make you roll and move for absolutely no reason other than because the board hates you and wants you to give Bob money until you have none. 

It's a lot of fun because it's quick, easy to explain, and still maintains the thrill from stealing your opponents' money and properties.

Simple monopoly-themed set collection card game.  Back when I was getting into the hobby, this was totally awesome.  Even now, it's still a decent set collection game.  It's very luck-based, and can get pretty brutal (since the optimal strategy seems to be kicking people while they're down), but I'm happy to play it from time to time.

This is a great game for Monopoly lovers, as it gives you that Monopoly feel, but in a much, much shorter timeframe.  The luck of the dice has been turned into the luck of the cards, and the auctions are all removed from it.  It's not bad for a little rummy-esque card game with a Monopoly pasted-on theme, but I'm not much of a fan of either rummy games or Monopoly, so I'm really never going to play this again.

Quickish cardgame of building a portfolio of cash & property and using take-that cards to wreck other player's plans. Too much take that, not enough strategy (or fun) for my taste.

Strangely enuf, it actually works probably because it doesnt try to emulate the game so much as use some of the original's concepts e.g. a colored monopoly as a template. Plays very quick and actually there is a kinda strategy to it. The fact that it is more ruled by luck is acceptable once you realize; a) it's short, silly filler and b) you were actually thinking the whole time even though your plans didnt work out. So it works on that level. Play it during game night a few times as a breather before moving onto more meatier fare.

tl;dr: complete junk

We played this because one of the players heard it's actually pretty good. And a score of almost 7 on BGG sounded promising...

There are some awesome set collecting games. This is not one of them. The problem? The action cards of course. A good game with stupid unbalanced action cards is a bad game. This game might be acceptable at it's core (I wouldn't call it great), but the action cards completely screw the game up. I can live with stealing some of the money of other players. And even with stealing the occasional property card that is not part of a complete set. Fine. But stealing completed sets? Fuck that.
I must also say that I was amazed at how horribly written the very short and very simple rules where. Yes, they are very simple, but they tried their best to make it sound way more complicated and we had to reread most rules 3 times in 2 languages to figure it out. And this game is published by the biggest board game publisher in the world? Shame on you, Hasbro. You should know better. Putting out a shitty game is one thing, screwing up the rules is just adding insult to injury.

Score: 2/10

Have just played two player so far and seems designed for 3 or more players so I will update if my opinion changes.

Comparable to flux in some ways.

Some cards are just clearly better than others.  Despite the fact that this is lauded as a good filler, I think even a quick game needs to be a well designed and balanced game.

Played two-player three times, each time learning a little bit of extra strategy. As of now, I'm not enamored with the "Deal Breaker" cards, as I think they may downgrade the entire experience to pointless, but others on the Geek seem to think that a bit of foreknowledge and skill can overcome the card's power. In all, for what it's trying to do, I'd call the game a success. It's simple to learn, simple to play, but leaves just enough room for strategy to make it fun. Thankfully, the play-time is short. Games can become lopsided, but a quick defeat minimized the pain.

I'm curious to try this with more. I wonder if it wouldn't fit the bill perfectly in a situation where two couples are trying to socialize without too much thinking.

Conclusion: The Monopoly Deal Card Game takes all of the good aspects of Monopoly and compacts them into an enjoyable, light card game.  There is quite a bit of tension involved when making a decision on whether to help yourself out or hurt others.  I wasn't sure I would enjoy a game like this but Monopoly Deal was a nice surprise.

If rating this game an 8 kills my street cred on this site, then I can't help that.  It is fast, fun, and easy to explain.  I can play it with my kids.  It is always loud.  

Most of the time, players have little control over whether or not they win.  But it really doesn't matter--you are probably not going to play this game to strategically dominate your opponents.  You're going to play it for something mindless and entertaining.  So it's a heck of a lot better than television! 

I love it.

The Monopoly Deal Card Game isn't without some flaws, but I think it's an alright filler game. It's really inexpensive and available at Wal-Mart, so if you introduce someone to it and they enjoy it there's a chance they'll buy it even if they don't normally buy many games. If it gets out there and replaces Phase 10 or Uno for some people, that's a good thing.

PROS: •A fun little card game, easy to learn and light to play. Great to play with non-gamer friends. 

CONS: •The box is too small for sleeved cards, too thin, and it works in a way that you need to stack 2 halves of the deck sideways, which is bad; •Poor rule set - MANY things are left open and even Hasbro itself doesn't manage to provide definitive answers. Can be enjoyed if - and only if - some rules and situations absent to the rulebook are addressed and the winning conditions are adapted to a victory points system.

RATING: 7
Very decent game of the Monopoly family. Probably the best of the monopoly card games. It is fun, simple, and goes fast. There are many details not given in the rulebook (see answers in the Rules section here), but common sense can answer most of them. The cards are not very good quality (it is not easy to shuffle them) but they are OK.

This fixes up problems with original Monopoly and creates problems of its own. I would say this game is even more broken. 

The issue here is mostly the enormous potential for smashing up what your opponents have and taking it cheaply. There is a card that just allows you to grab someone's full set with all the additions, and this is a card you are merely dealt!

I gave it a better rating than monopoly because it is at least quick.

Nice, somewhat strategic, card game.  Your standing in the game could switch on any one turn. 
Luck can bring you down fast, but the next turn you could be on top. 
A little slow with 7 people, but it made for some exciting reversals of fortune.

you're making choices in this game,  but the margin between random choices and the best possible choices is very small,  and heavily outweighed by the random elements in the game.

After playing many other good games, I rather have lost my taste for it and downrated it. It's ok with larger group of friends and family, but with the two of us, I'd rather play something else. 

Great game. If anything could be against the original Monopoly, then it's the time it takes to play. Ages. This game does not have that problem. It's fast, fun and just as infuriating as the original. Fortunes can change hands in seconds! Play is easy and the main rules quick to learn. Main difference is in the winning - it doesn't matter how much money you have, what matters are the actual properties!

A fairly decent game, close games can be fun. However, I find that frequently 1 or more players end up with nothing in their tableau, and it is very difficult to build up unless you can get some cash with rent or birthday cards.

I keep coming back to this stupid little filler, enough to the point that it's a running joke in my group.  It's like playing the slot machines in Vegas, where it's not really a good experience, but you come back to it anyway, because maybe this time you'll win.  The short duration alone makes it better than its parent game, and much much faster.  There's no trading, which is a bummer, but also keeps the game short.  It's really a one-trick pony.  Keep enough money in your bank so that you don't lose your properties.  If you don't do that, you'll have to give away your properties, and you'll be left with nothing.  And sometimes, the luck of the draw will mean that even that is impossible.  Not really a brain-burner, but for the time and price, it's good for certain situations.

PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION

Ok. Let's get something straight. There's a lot of luck in this game, and take-that, and it's very silly. However, it takes five minutes with two. It's an action-packed five minutes, there's some tactics involved, and it brings back childhood memories of Monopoly with my mum. For anyone who thinks this sounds dire, my mum played with the 'Crunch' rules for Monopoly. You may steal from the bank when another player's back is turned, but can only keep the money if you're not caught. If you are caught, the banker will make the game harder by sitting on top of the bank like Smaug the Dragon.

As I'm always happy to play this game, and will happily play multiple rounds while waiting for a meal to cook, I have to award it eight. I would award it nine, but - if it was the only game in the world and I was stuck with it in a whitewashed cell - I'd probably want to kill someone after the first month. It's not anywhere as good as Blue Moon or another Kosmos two-player game, but they take longer than five minutes. With two, it's doubtless better than Love Letter.

Reasonably fun little card game. For Monopoly-themed card games, I actually prefer the older Monopoly: The Card Game (essentially themed rummy). There are enough decisions to keep it from feeling like your hand plays itself (like I do when I'm playing Loot) and it's not so chaotic that you can't really plan beyond your current turn (like Fluxx). However, it does seem like the cards you draw are more important than the choices you make, which puts this into my second tier of card games (though above the other two I mentioned, since at least the choices you make are not a distant second).

[i]Monopoly Deal[/i] plays quickly as turns require thought, but not too much. You have to manage your hand and decide what to play when: taking rent now, or waiting until you play a second property to squeeze everyone for more, at the risk of losing the first one; throwing a house in your bank, or keeping it in for the future; playing a wild property first to up your chances of getting rent, or playing it safe with a less desirable property in case you think it will be stolen.

It's Tilt-a-Whirl in a box, and as long as the components and rules don't make you sick, you're likely to enjoy the ride. For my [url=http://www.boardgamenews.com/index.php/boardgamenews/comments/game_reviews_monopoly_deal_solairis/]complete review[/url], head to Boardgame News.

I didn't think there could be a fast, or cutthroat, version of Monopoly until I played Monopoly Deal.  This game is Cutthroat and Ruthless!

In some ways, more fun than Monopoly (it's shorter, for one). In other ways, not as much fun (no board! no dice! no mass amounts of money and more chance in terms of property management!). On it's own, a cute little game. Putting all your money _on the table_ and having a limited amount of actions to take each round (you can't put down all your money at once, for example) makes the game more interesting: it's strategically challenging and ensures that turns are quick. A lot of the cards involve everyone, you can't really peace out during this game. Overall, I enjoyed it. The only complaint I have is that sometimes your hand gets stalled and it would be useful to be able to take an action to flush them. Because I was stuck with "rent", "double rent", and "no you didn't" for several hands in a row... useless until I had some property in my hand! Oye.

Een kaartspel van de aloude klassieker. Breekt met de volstrekte willekeur van zijn illustere voorganger.

Spelers moeten 3 voltooide steden hebben om het spel te winnen. Hiertoe kunnen ze van andere mensen stelen met actiekaarten en geld opbouwen door geldkaarten uit te spelen. Leuk hierin is dat actiekaarten ook als geldkaarten gebruikt kunnen worden, maar hierna nooit meer als actiekaart terugkomen.

Dit spel is zeker lang niet slecht, maar het biedt wel erg veel openingen om terug te komen van wat eerst een schier onmogelijke achterstand is. Hierdoor is het wel uitstekend geschikt als familiespelletje, maar voor de veelspeler zal het toch een paar wenkbrauwen doen fronsen.

A game that rewards walking firmly upon the faces of the downtrodden.

If any player(s) fall behind in property and money, the best strategic option is to target those same players - precisely because they don't have the resources to protect their meager holdings.  Well, unless these castrated unfortunates wise up and refuse to play cards for the rest of the game just to spite the potential winners.

Undoubtedly this all sounds like fun to someone, but not me.

I rate it only as a two player game as I didn't try it with more (and seems that it might actually be better with more people). 

I really like how you build your personal pool of money to defend your properties but this idea is then trashed by exceptionally strong take-that cards. I like hand management (you want to get down to zero cards to draw more) but again this is wasted by you having to hold onto cards that can protect you against those strong take that things. All in all I would like to see some of this elements developed into some different kind of card game.

Used to be our filler of choice. I think that we have outgrown it though.

Like: Easy to teach, easy to play. Monopoly Deal has many "take that" cards which target specific players, but I like how collecting rent targets all players at the table. None of the cards are very personal either, as they only target cards that a player has in front of them. I also like that your hand is safe from all attacks. You only leave yourself vulnerable to other players cards if you play cards yourself in front of you. There are also a few neat tactical touches within the game that get overshadowed by the luck of the draw and the power of some of the major attack cards. You can play action cards you don't want to use as money in front of you, which removes those action cards permanently from the game; you can also discard property cards if you are over your hand limit, which removes those cards from the game until the deck is reshuffled. Since the deck usually gets shuffled at most once, this can be quite significant. Like I said, the overall randomness of the game makes any tactics you might try regarding these game elements mostly useless, but they are still neat.

Dislike: Tends to overstay its welcome as a filler, particularly if players discard properties (which makes it harder to complete 3 sets). It's very difficult to come back if you draw bad cards at the beginning of the game, or play your best cards and have them all taken from you, since once other players start playing rent cards, having extra money played in front of you is absolutely necessary. This problem gets particularly bad with five or more players, since collecting rent and the "Its my birthday!" card scale linearly in power with the number of players (as they take equal amounts of money from all other players, regardless of player count). I don't like that the rent cards are tied to specific colors; there are only two copies of each type of rent card, so once those two cards are gone, it's impossible to collect rent from all players for the corresponding colors. And it's all luck of the draw as to who gets those rent cards, since there is no mechanism within the game for cards to be transferred from one player's hand to another's. 

Overall: I would be fine never playing this game again. It's a good filler, but I think I have played it out, and games of Monopoly Deal have started lasting too long for my liking.

RATING: 7
Fun family game, takes the enjoyable parts of the original Monopoly (buying properties, building an empire and taking all of your opponents' money), combines them with the ability to steal from and swap properties with other players, and removes the slog that every Monopoly game eventually reaches (when two players are left in a back and forth of paying rent and everybody else has to occupy themselves until they're done). 

Quick-paced, lots of laughs and easy to play. Can easily play multiple games in short succession.

Amazing card game that takes the good theme of Monopoly and does away with all the garbage.  The "Millionaire" version is AAWWWFFFUUUULLLL.  This game was better with the original release of the rules wherein the dealbreaker and a couple other things functioned in more useful ways.

Nice little game. Not as quick as advertised (never finished a game in 15 minutes). Very luck based but fun.

1/2 set collecting, 1/2 take that card game.  Teachable to anybody in two minutes, and so far everybody I've introduced this to has enjoyed it a lot.  Great for kids, crusty old card players, and contemporary euro gamers.  Not a whole lot of depth, but just enough control to set this far apart from Uno and other similar family card games.

Not so bad, at least it's more fun than the board game version, an alternative to take it with you everywhere.

No tan malo, al menos es más divertido que la versión de tablero, una alternativa para llevar contigo a cualquier sitio.

Great little fun card game that gives you the fun of money and the fun of "take that" aspect instead of spending hours playing monopoly...definitely a lot of luck involved but still can be fun.  One of the original games that got me into this new/modern board game hobby

Very light game/filler type. I got the Hong Kong edition with the 20 extra cards. The dark purple ones are very difficult to read, and a lot of texts are small, but the game itself is very fun to play, and very quick. Takes about 5 minutes at most to learn the game. Highly recommend the Hong Kong edition! Price is also good (15$USD)

This is pretty cut throat as most of the game revolves around stealing cards from other players.  We liked how you could plan ahead a bit as your hand is safe but were impressed how tense it could be as your holdings are not.  Setting up mini-combos for killer rounds is a lot of fun (though having everying stolen from you between turns is pretty rough).  Add in the comforting classic Monopoly theme and you have a very solid little filler that I'm happy to play any time!

*2 player note - we usually play to 4 sets to keep the aptly named "Deal Breaker" cards from overly upsetting out games.

I really enjoy original board game Monopoly for the strategy, deal making, and critical thinking involved during the game play. This card game has none of that. You can literally win in 1 turn with "normal" cards. If this was poker or war or any sort of extremely quick turn-around time I would maybe enjoy it.

Perhaps I thought this game would have a more Monopoly the board game feel and it doesn't. Any time you can drop a "nuke" on all your opponents and win the game in one turn is ridiculous.

I’m surprisingly impressed by the amount that this game amused me. The wild cards are obviously instant plays, but every other card has a couple different uses. I like that the money and action cards are multi-function. The game can get very swingy and dependent on card draws, particularly near the end, but for a casual game it’s quite good.

This is a surprisingly good game. It's a shame it's associated with the board game, with which it shares nothing in common. 

Plays very fast, usually we finish in 10-15 minutes. Lots of nice back-stabbing and piling on the leader.

*Rating based on one play.

Solid game with some nice card combo building, but is nothing especially innovative or different. It's a decent, light filler with a pretty abstract theme. I didn't really feel like I was doing anything to alter the course of history. All in all, I'd call it a good, but not great, game.

Decent new Vaccarino game.  I see the potential in the mechanics, but it felt a little...closed to me.  Like maybe there won't be much variation.  Good race game, but it's light on engine-building.  Still, it should have good replayability.

Perhaps unsurprising from the creator of Dominion: the variable setup in Temporum IS the game. Figuring out interesting combo chains on the board is virtually the only interesting decision you make. The hand management is okay. But it is very light and very random. I like Temporum well enough as a decent filler, but I was surprised that there isn't a bit more to the gameplay.

The best part of the game is the theme, and the most exciting part of the game is setting up when you get to see the different potential outcomes. 

The actual gameplay, while not too similar to anything I've played isn't particularly interesting or innovative.

There is still a decent mix of focusing on your own strategy and responding to what the other players on the table are doing. I would play with someone if they wanted to, but after learning to play, there was never a time where I wanted to play this game in particular.

Still I love the theme, so I'll probably check out T.I.M.E

RATING: 7.5
Got a bit bored after the first few plays because to began to feel samey.  After many more plays it has become more enjoyable.  If you want to, you can always pursue the same basic strategy and do pretty well, but if you dig into what zones are there, you can usually puzzle out a way to get a slight edge by playing differently.  It's not much of an edge, but enough so that the more experienced player will usually win, but still small enough so that it still remains fairly competitive most of the time.  This makes it pretty good for players of different skill levels because games only tend to be won by only a turn or two and everyone feels they played well.

Another tight scoring family game.  It's not amazing, but it does involve some strategic decisions.  I will choose it on occasion for family night, but that's about the only time.

RATING: 8.5
Vaccarino comes up with another great game that will no doubt still be overshadowed by Dominion. Cut the man a break. Look past the deck builder and try to judge his subsequent games not by Dominion but by the game itself. 
Temporum is a game about traveling through time and altering history in order to gain power to lead to victory. As good as the game play is the theme (like Kingdom Builder) isn't there. That said it is still a great game with terrific art, ease of game play and good tactical decisions to be made. Each turn you alter history to change the route through time you travel then play a card. It's as simple as that. Each card allows you to do a few different actions such as gain money, activate a temporary (or permanent) ability or score. 
The game can be very random and at times it is hard to make a strategy but the before-mentioned ease of game play mitigates this. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's fine, I guess, but it's kind of dull.  I don't get a sense of theme from it, and that's something I really want from a time travel game.  I like the idea of the game more than the actual game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A card game masked as a board game.  The board's only purpose is to mark the time line and house the player's power tokens.  Of the former it provides an overkill.  Of the latter it provides a shortage.  As a card game, this is actually a descent game.  Game play depends on some luck of the draw for sure, but mostly it depends on taking advantage of what cards you have.  Combinations of cards can be enormously strong, but its really luck as much as anything that determines if a killer combo emerges.  The game does well in not over staying its welcome.  If anything, the game is a tad light and too short.  It could use an expansion that notches it up a step or two.  Fans of the designer will definitely see some common ideas with other games.  Non-fans may find a descent game.

First play rating:

There's plenty good about the game - Super simple to teach, strong evocation of theme and a tidy playtime. The big issue is that it seems a little thin. The main mechanisms work and the time manipulation rippling stuff is very clever, but there's just not much actually happening in the game, just an opimisation puzzle based on pulling cards from the deck. The massive, empty box indicates that there is expansions on the horizon, and they're needed. This feels like a proof of concept right now.

Not a whole lot of game here. Run up and down a track and take obvious options until you score enough points to win. Super light and unfulfilling. I liked that there were so many cards to vary the game, but with so few in play during a game, I'm betting more people will lose interest before exploring very far. Cool art makes me want to like this game, but it just didn't do anything for me.

RATING: 6
Temporum leaves me feeling like all of Donald's games have left me after a play or two. I always feel like they are a bit lacking in early plays. Then, once I convince myself to play it quite a bit more I end up really getting into it (Dominion, Kingdom Builder). In my view, replayability and power combos are his claim to fame. Because of the shared player deck that is the same from game to game, I think this one might have an issue with replayability. The time zone cards are kind of neat and were considerably more interesting in my second play than the first. I'm not sure if I'll be pushing to play this one, but at least one more play seems in order to make sure it's nothing special. After just 2 plays, I'm feeling like this is somewhere between Dominion/Kingdom Builder (great) and Nefarious/Greed (weak). Unfortunately, it's probably closer to the latter.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Time traveling stuff is cool, but the theme felt pasted on with this one.  There were a couple times that the game offered some tough choices, but for the most part it was pretty obvious what needed to be done.  There is some baked in replayability that looks like it could make every game feel different, but we will have to see. Not a bad game, but not something I would really ask to play again.

The card quality was pretty bad.  Maybe it is a bad idea they print these games in the USA...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very basic card game with a cool theme.  That cool time traveling theme is sadly mostly abstracted, but if you squint you can see it a bit.  Regardless, the game is still an enjoyable card game where everyone is racing to move all of their crowns into the Modern Age.  I like how each card can have a couple of different uses and there are some interesting combos to exploit in the different ages.  Another rock solid design from Donald X.  He isn't the flashiest designer out there but he consistently makes easy to play and fun games.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A light strategy game where things typically rather competitive right up until the end. Eke out tiny advantages over your opponents until one of you achieves victory!

The fact that there's never a runaway leader makes this a great game for new players. That same fact makes you wonder how much your "strategy" actually matters, though.

It's a quick game with decent replayability, but probably no one's "favorite"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
Good, quick, fun game.  I'm a big fan of modular set-ups and card games and this provides both.  When it was announced, I was hoping for a somewhat heavier game, but that hasn't stopped me from enojoying Temporum for what it is and getting repeat plays in.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Is there a theme here? I certainly didn't feel it.

Putting that aside, the game itself is 'ok' - shared deck and an action board which has 4 action spots 'active' (and you can alter them to activate different ones if you want), along with an interesting race/area control mechanic.
But it's nothing that really grabs me - most of the actions are similar 'play a card' 'draw a card' 'score a card' (or some combination). Add in the uninspired art and there's nothing here that screams 'buy me, play me' at least to me.

But I'd play it if someone else wanted to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A Donald X. design about time travel - ought to be awesomeness in a box.  But it is so disappointing in so many ways. 

My biggest complaint is that the game is mildly interesting if you choose the right mix of Age cards - fail to do this, though, and the game is roughly the same complexity as Candyland.  Specifically, if you play with one of the Age I cards that lets you Draw, Score, or Play, then there's very little incentive to go anywhere else.  

Second, the game has a single currency - money - which you pay to get victory points.  And you get money from drawing cards.  So the game is mostly a sequence of draw cards, play cards to get money, and score cards to make points.  The game attempts to inject some subtlety in that the cards can be used for money or to score (convert money to points) - but this is never interesting because of the implementation.  There are also bonuses to be had for having the most scoring markers in a given era, but this also fails entirely to be interesting.  

The end result is a game that mostly plays itself, with no meaningful decisions and a relatively inoffensive 30 minute play time.

RATING: 8
This is fun, and thematically it's by far Vaccarino's best game. An extremely low bar, but still! (Well, OK, Infiltration was pretty good too). Still identifiably a Vaccarino game, it's a lot about intersecting special powers, but Temporum has much more of a chance to develop and breathe in interesting ways than his other games, all of which tend to be extremely front-loaded and decided by early choices. There are also real tactical choices about manipulating the timestream which is unusual for his games. Temporum has much more opportunity to adapt to a flexible environment. Nice that the game goes to 5, but it's a bit chaotic at that number and 3 or 4 is probably better. Like all his games, it makes a virtue of brevity. Still, if you actively disliked Infiltration and Dominion, this may not do a ton for you either. I liked Infiltration but am not big on Dominion.

I rate Temporum a 7 as of today; good but workmanlike. A couple years ago I probably would have given it an 8; today I like a game with a little more artistry. Apparently there are a number of movie references in the game that I didn't get.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A neat little game of finding efficiencies in order to win a race through time.

Several cards are laid out offering various abilities to advance you toward the end goal of the game, and your job is to navigate those abilities as efficiently as possible while thwarting others.  The trick is that not all the cards are accessible all of the time, as the links through time are constantly changing, making different cards active or inactive depending on what players do.

Seems like there would be a lot of replayability here, as it has the classic Donald X. "there are a ton of cards, but only a few are used per game" gimmick (which is admittedly a great gimmick!).  There will be a new puzzle to solve each game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It sounds like it should be fun. Like there will be a variable set up and I'll have to come up with the strategy that will lead to me getting the cards and money faster than everyone else. You know, a variable set up strategy game like Dominion or Kingdom Builder. 

Unfortunately, this isn't that game. Because of how much work it is to change the time line, every turn is more a question of just doing the best you can, and using time line switching to hurt others as opposed to helping yourself (because everyone else will benefit from time line shifts before you can if you are the one who causes it).

To make things worse, so many of the time line options are dull. The difference between card one and two so small that you don't really care which one is there. Don't really care. I guess those four words pretty much sum up this game.

I really enjoyed this one. You need to build a little gold engine to get gold and then you can score cards and move your crowns down the board. There is variety in the setup too as there are over 40 zone cards but only 10 are used each game so replayability on this one should be good. I'll be interested to see how the actions change with another play, but I really enjoyed the card play in this one and look forward to more plays.

I *really* want to like this, as the theme, concept, and components look absolutely ace, but the gameplay seems a little too light (and the cross-time money is a little bland). I would have liked to have seen randomly decided personal missions/goals relating to time periods and perhaps item recovery, but sadly these are not included in any capacity.

If a £20 release... I will still acquire for the collection, but that is the upper-limit.

Horribles componentes en esta edición. El tablero me parece feo, las flechas son diminutas, las monedas solo están ilustradas por un lado a pesar de que el dinero no es oculto y las cartas son de mala calidad.
No ha tenido tanta repercusión como otros juegos de este autor pero es un juego de peso medio bastante apañado. Creo que los malos componentes y el alto precio han sido determinantes para su poca difusión. Las partidas son rápidas y adictivas.

I'm always a sucker for time travel movies, especially when one experiments with the concept of changing the past to impact the present.

Temporum has that as a key element.

A closed system with little room for creative play. Every game feels about the same. Changing time makes little difference since you basically "draw, play, and score" in a repetitive, uneventful manner. I like the idea of the game and it's kinda fun, but I wish it was more exciting and varied and actually felt like time travel.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A neat paint job doesn't save this game from being far too bland & simplistic. Altering time only slightly changes what spaces are available to you, and the spaces themselves aren't that interesting. Time travelling should feel exciting, and there should be massive ripples and exciting events when the flow of time is altered. That's sadly not the case here.

Most of the time you'll alter time, just so you can get a measly extra 2 gold. I think I would have enjoyed it more if the theme wasn't time travel, as the game certainly doesn't live up to its lofty theme.

All that being said, this isn't a bad game. It's a fairly simple game that doesn't have much strategy, and certainly doesn't live up to its lofty ambitious theme of time travelling.

RATING: 9
This game is deeper than many of the comments give it credit for, presumably because it's new and people haven't logged a lot of plays.  Strategy can arise in subtle ways, not only in how to maximize your score, but in how to minimize others' scores as well.

Of course this is nothing new, but it adds some depth to the game in part due to the gameplay variability, but also owing to the time changing mechanic.  While at first glance it may not seem like changing the times significantly alters the outcome of the game (due to the fact that you progress in points primarily due to cards in your hand, and not on the board), it changes the actions that you will have available to you on each turn -- and more importantly to your opponents -- and it can often take multiple time changes to reach a certain desirable card.

The more players you add to the game, the more interesting it becomes as a result, due to the risk/reward mechanic involved in changing times.  

I've enjoyed the playthroughs I've had so far, and I think some interesting strategies can develop with the right board setups.

Simple, Dominion-like engine builder where you are trying advance pieces through four time periods.  Plays quickly and is pleasantly harmless.  Felt like a deck builder without a deck.

RATING: 7
A very enjoyable quick game from the famous Donald "Dominion" Vaccarino. I actually find this one more enjoyable than Dominion; there's a spatial element to the board and pushing the timeline to be favorable to you that you don't get in Dominion. That's really the most interesting part of the game for me -you can create great combos, but if your opponent can keep you from getting to the appropriate times you'll end up in trouble.

It's not a favorite game; the game revolves around optimizing small advantages in a way I don't find particularly appealing and you can end up with unfun boards. I don't recommend playing it with more than 3 players; you get more from fights for control of the eras, but the timeline fighting becomes much more chaotic and less interesting. But I still find the game an enjoyable jockey over the timestream.

It's an interesting game, but I feel like a lot of the fun hinges on the setup.  Some setups contain multiple cards that work well together and some don't (gee, just like Dominion).  I wish there were more actions on cards that require "control", because that mechanic feels under-used.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Quick and clever gameplay.  Teaching the rules and playing the first two player game took 15 minutes.  The second game was 10 minutes.  When we were done, both of us were like, "that's it?"  I can see this game being a lot more fun with more players as timelines will bounce around a lot more, making the game more challenging.  As a two player game though - it's a 5.

The actions felt kind of dry.  There are some intriguing age four cards, but the other age cards just seemed like they're there to make sure the game works right.  All of the cards in an age are associated with a type of action, and generally have a subtle second action attached to them.  Now that I'm thinking about it, with a couple of exceptions, I never really cared when the timeline changed, which is weird because the timeline is what drives the game.

The production is fine, but compared to the current games coming out, it seems behind the curve.  The meeples, while pictured standing up, barely do so and fall down easily.  The timeline markers are way smaller than pictured, and the money is only single sided which is annoying if you're dumping out a bag of it - each value has a different shape though so that helps sort it out.  

I only played the game twice though so I'm probably missing something here, or maybe I was overhyping the game in my mind.  I feel like I'm not giving this one a fair shake.  I'm a Dominion lover, and I constantly defend Kingdom Builder against my wife's attacks, but this one just didn't grab me.

During the game description, it sounded like we'd all be running all over the place messing with the "timeline" to thwart each other and further our own cause, but we all pretty much hit the same few spots to draw, play, and score. In fact, the reason I lost by a point was because I had even bothered to play a blue card (bonus power). I would've been better off simply drawing cards, playing for money as needed, and scoring. 

Now, maybe in another game a different blue card helps me win, but it's such a short race that I don't see how you could have time to move around a lot or play a lot of blue cards. Or maybe a different setup of action cards would provide a more interesting experience -- it's a variable action card tableau a la Istanbul -- which just reminds me I'd rather play that one. Or Kingdom Builder for that matter. I didn't sense any sizzle even for the modest meal the game offers.

Can't make my mind up about this; some of the pre-fab setups are definitely better than a totally random setup.  I was hoping for more here, but the game seems to play about the same each time in spite of the random cards.  Each age always has certain types of cards in it (so that a random setup cannot break the game) so much of the game play comes from the event deck and the choices you make there.

I love the idea of Time travel and the 4 time zone 'pyramid' mechanism really appealed to me.  Add to that the beautifully illustrated Zone cards and It has to be a winner. Right?

Well, no.  It doesn't ever feel like you are time travelling.  The action that each zone grants is completely arbitrary; Whether you are in ancient Egypt or the Age of Cats, there is no action that really identifies with the period or civilisation

We found that many players simply moved between 2-3 cards as they had optimised their 'engine'.  Not one I'd want to play again and I've since traded my copy on.

Nagyon ötletes, az időutazás mechanika. Jól hozza az érzést egy elegáns absztrakt megoldással. Ez az igazi tematika, nem az, amikor 1000 apró szabállyal akarnak valamit modellezni.
A kártyák elvileg nagy változatosságot adnának, de nem éreztem azt az átütő erőt, mint a dominionban vagy a kingdom builderben. Mondjuk az is igaz, hogy ez a kettő nagyon-nagyon magasra teszi a lécet. Nekem kicsit túl egyformák a partyk és úgy érzem, hogy szinte bármit csinálunk, mindig egy körön belül végeznénk. Kicsit talán túlzottan kiegyenlített minden, és nincsenek igazán B, C utak sem. A random kártyák kicsit változtathatnak az ütemezéseken, de az alap taktikán nem nagyon.
Mindenképp izgalmas, egyedi darab, de talán egy kicsit többet is ki lehetett volna hozni belőle.

The game is fun based upon the variety provided at each time era. Players can easily and quickly plan two or three moves ahead in order to reach their desired eras and use the cards there or to try to make other players take more turns getting wherever they are trying to go.
The modular board does not immediately wow me. There are three atoms of game play: Drawing cards, playing cards, and scoring cards. At least one of each must be present for the game to function. The designer chose the most elegant, but least interesting way to solve the problem: All zone 1 eras can score, all zone 2 eras can draw, all zone 3 eras can play. This design means that players can access all 3 atoms each turn, regardless of the real timeline, which possibly makes the game too easy to play. Blocking seems minimal because of this ease of play as players cannot choke off particular actions from each other.
It is light and entertaining for its quick play time, but it feels as though it could trivially have been a better game.

Ok lite euro efficiency resources gathering/VP conversion game - not much new here in terms of game mechanics. Additionally the game relies on you building your tablue of cards to enhance your turns but the cards are difficult to see in front of the other players just increasing the feeling of multi player solitaire.

Actually not a lot in the box for the dollars but the game is Ok.

I suppose if someone really wanted to play this one I could try it again but my own inclination is a hard pass. Players visit locations to take that locations action, which is  typically play a card into your tableau and earn money, score a card by paying for it and moving crown tokens, or messing with other players. In addition, players can dictate the "time zone" (a row of cards varying in length depending on where they are at in the time pyramid) below their pawn. The goal of the game is to move all your crowns to the 4th level before your opponents. 

The card locations are not that exciting and they never change. Meanwhile the tableau building cards seem unbelievably powerful. Most turns I felt like there was only one decent move to make.

When I played, I thought it was an attempt to rein in the craziness of Innovation that went too far, leaving a predictable game with no good way to stop somebody who takes a lead.

I played for a second time a year later, having gone from hating Innovation to loving it, and was surprised to find that it still felt like an Innovation without the crazy parts. I do see a little more player interaction, but basically don't like it enough to ever want to play again.

RATING: 6.5
This has the designer's variable setup trademark, but it doesn't work so well here because all the cards of each but one era give the same basic action. You draw cards in an era, play them in a different one, score them in another, and the fourth era has some combination of those. The game is a simple race to move your makers forward to the last era, playing cards to get money and using it to pay to score other cards. The time travel theme is very appealing, but notwithstanding some evocative card names and beautiful artwork, the game feels very abstract. The only thematic element is how you can change the timeline and cause ramifications, but even this is a simple matter of switching an arrow between two positions. However, the game is fun and flows well, not overstaying its welcome.

The production, unfortunately, suffers from a number of bad decisions and mistakes. I will not complain about the unnecessary board, but this game just didn't deserve the big box treatment, and there is a lot of air inside. The era cards should have icons, as it's always a nuisance to have to read cards on the board to remember what they do. It's nice to have players' pieces in both genders (instead of the generic "Carcassonne" follower), but they are cut too thin and are annoyingly knocked down by the slightest touch, so that it's better to simply lay them flat on the board. There is no reason (but cutting corners) for the money to be printed on just one side. And of course, there is the infamous mistake in the tiny size of the wooden arrows. (The latter two issues were corrected in the second printing, but early buyers payed the same for less.)

Nice little cardplay-focused game. Not a huge amount of interaction, probably best with 2 or 3. Not very thematic (and I'm not a person that pays attention to theme much!) but it doesn't really hurt the game. Could see this as a nice light-ish 40 minute game.

Meh. The time traveler theme is basically just pasted on. The basic premise is to chain the cards (one of the only half decent things about the game)... then cash the cards in and score crowns which then allow you to win.

It's very replayable but much of a muchness and thoroughly boring.

Simple rules, short gameplay.
In a limited time you need to find some advantages (sometimes, combos or mini-combos, or just 2 or 3 clever moves) to work out the final edge over the opponents.
It's not always exciting, but sometimes... really is ;)

The game is really short so there is barely time to build an engine (don't make it too far-reaching) and the rest is the race to finish the game as a winner.

Every game is different because of 10 cards drawn each time randomly to construct the board. Replayability and variability are well-known Vaccarino's trademarks...

This is a fun little game when we're feeling like something lighter. The mechanic of balancing the need to win the race with the need to stay behind and control eras is neat. It's also really fun when you string together one of those huge "I do this, which lets me do this, allowing me to do this, so that I can come over here and do this, resulting in me finally doing THIS" turns, much to the dismay of your opponent.

Full disclosure: I was a playtester of this game.  When I'm a playtester, my focus in these comments usually shifts to the production values of the published game, since I have absolutely nothing to do with that.  From that perspective, it's pretty well done.  The arrows are a disappointment, but you get used to them.

I do think the game Donald has designed is really cool, but of course I would say that.  I plan to hold off on giving it a rating until it's had a change to accumulate enough "real ratings".  Update (2014/11/14): CABS was lucky enough to get some of the first copies of this produced by the publisher.  Currently, I have the most logged plays of this, which only includes my plays of the published game.  Update (2014/12/22): I'm no longer most plays, but I still haven't included my prototype plays.

RATING: 6
In this one, you are time travelers traveling up and down the time stream to perform actions and alter the time stream to get access to different actions. The object is to be the first to move all of your 12(?) crowns from level 1 to level 4. You do this by playing cards to get money. You pay money to score (ie. move crowns). The actions on the board, which vary slightly from game to game, allow you to draw cards, play card and score cards, with other little bonuses depending on where your crowns and the other players are positioned. It definitely feels like a Donald X design with abstract scoring, card combos, and card-driven play variation. It has gotten some pretty bad reviews. While I don't think it is as strong as his other top designs, it's not a terrible game by any means. My first impression is that the combos aren't as interesting, the variation in the location cards is minimal, and the moving of crowns through a bunch of sections doesn't do much to excite the imagination.

Donald X's new Rio Grande game won't become the classic Dominion (or Kingdom Builder) is but it has a few fine (and maybe even novel) ideas and an okay gameplay with fine length for the luck factor involved. It just feels it is not as strong as it could have been – although I think I read somewhere that it is not the case, it still feels like the more interesting part was spared for potential expansions. Or... is it like the two award-winning Vaccarinos so it would get better with repeated plays? Or maybe too much depends on wat kind of cards do you have at the set-up? I don't know – I enjoyed what I did in the game, also I like the creative 'majority in point scoring markers' idea but was not enthusiastic about the experience.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

There is no doubt this is a Donald V. The variable setup will likely keep each game fresh and different. I don't have any problem playing someone else's game upon request, but I won't request it. Doesn't feel like time travel in the least bit - just mechanics and go here to do that being restricted by the current connection.

Clever resource management game with a pasted on "time travel" as people race to move their tokens through a variety of zones to the finish.  A variety of cards should keep the game fresh and offer interesting opportunities for combinations.

RATING: 7
So far, DXV doesn't seem to be a designer for me. I admire Dominion and Kingdom Builder, but I don't find them particularly fun or interesting. I wasn't expecting I'd be wowed much by this one. However, I really enjoyed it. I liked how the time travel and history-changing worked, and thought the flavor throughout it was a lot of fun. It was good with two, but I think a full compliment making it more chaotic will be even better.

RATING: 5
I got completely demolished. Part of it was that I just kept drawing shitty cards, but I also made a few mistakes early on that made it almost impossible to catch up. I had issues with one of the cards that basically completely invalidated the player position benefits ($0 for 1, 2$ for 2, etc).

I don't think I'd buy this game, but I will steal the timeline mechanism for a werewolf game that I want to run! I'd probably play it a few more times to see if it gets better, but I think it's one of those games that sounds really cool and has some great elements but falls flat with the execution.

RATING: 5
Another Donald X game. Would it be another dud? This one came highly recommended so I was hoping for something very special.

Temporum features highly variable setup, which is almost becoming a Donald X trademark (Dominion, Kingdom Builder). For my first play, we used the recommended beginner set up and the results were... underwhelming. The game felt like this: move, draw a card, move, play a card and get money, move, score a card, repeat. Moving the time line made very little difference, and where you were was mostly incidental.

We played the game twice more during the con: once with the "Riches" setup, and once with mostly a random setup. The Riches one was by far the most interesting: we got some cool cards in our tableaus, cool combos, and there was definitely a case of trying to score points early or coming in and scoring a bunch at the end. The random setup was mostly like the first one, but with a lot more of a "take that" element, which I hate.

The cards you draw and play end up affecting you a lot more than the cards on the time lines, so it's odd that there's so much effort in changing them. I would think changing the set of cards you play with would have much more of an impact.

Overall I wasn't too impressed. I'm either missing something, or there isn't much to this game.

Not quite as good as Dominion in my opinion, but then again, what is? This is still a fantastic game that is tightly designed, has tons of variety due to the setup, is simple to teach/play, and has relatively low-luck. Also, the implementation of the branching time travel mechanic is quite clever, and leads to some interesting decision-making.

RATING: 9
I picked this up because I love Kingdom Builder and hoped it would be in the same vein, and it's exactly what I wanted.

It plays very quickly, but feels much meatier and more satisfying than most games that play this quickly. It's easy to learn and teach because, like the other Vaccarino games I've played, it has simple rules and derives its depth from its variable setup, card-based exceptions, and the interactions between those three elements.

Every turn offers hard choices, which I love, but because the number of default actions --  stuff you do every turn -- is limited, it's difficult to fall into analysis paralysis. Do you play a card or score it? Do you try to march into a different branch of the timeline, a time-consuming task? Do you build your strategy around a particular zone, or is that too fragile?

The balance between wanting to rule as many times as possible and wanting to reach the fourth zone as quickly as possible is delicious. I never make a single easy decision about crown placement.

Like Kingdom Builder, the game constrains your initial choices (and, differently, subsequent ones) in a way that guides your strategy without dictating it. For example, in my first two games I drew very few permanents while the other plays drew plenty. They built engines around those permanents, while I exploited zones to advance crowns quickly. I won one game and lost the other.

Graphically, this is a gorgeous game. The cards and board look great, and they're easy to read and understand. The wooden bits are too skinny; they tip easily when upright, and are fiddly to pick up when horizontal. That's a minor quibble, though.

Every element of Temporum -- zones, crowns, and cards -- is superbly balanced to create tension in every turn. You want to do it all, you can't, and the game can hinge on a single really good turn or two, making it difficult to predict how things will turn out. All in about 30 minutes.

I really tend to enjoy this game.  The decisions aren't overwhelming and the limited action choices make turns move fairly quickly.  It's fun to try to find interesting combos and the variable setup really does help each games have a slightly unique feel.  The end game is always tight with every other player usually being within 1 turn of winning, which I think I like but makes me wonder if all the various actions are a bit too balanced.  With a consistent overall play time of about 30-45 minutes and the 5-player compatibility, this one will continue to see table time with my lunch group for awhile.

I hate "find a loop & repeat until someone wins" games. The variable setup does little to alleviate this because the tiles are all so samey. There's really nothing to do besides draw, play, score, or take money. The variations on that are so minor that they are disinteresting, and in most games you really only use 2 or 3 of the 15 tiles on the board. Just couldn't get into it.

I enjoy the time travel theme, although it seems a little pasted on.

The artwork is great and and the  themes is an exciting concept.I was excited in anticipation of the theme of time traveling. My expectations were perhaps too high. There is a disconnect in the dull game mechanics and the theme.  The card play is some of the most dullness that I have encounter outside of phase 10 or Uno. The game designer Donald X. Vaccarino is the designer for Dominion and is an experience designer to boot.  Vaccarino should have known better and let lesser product go onto the market.  Boring!

Dominion without the deck?

Lovers of mad combos will be right at home here, as you work out whether it's best to generate an engine or just slog for victory points. The time-travelling back-and-forth bit isn't quite as dynamic as I'd hoped, although obviously this is very layout dependent. Oodles of replayability, and some maths that is either rigidly formulaic or just very good guessing - I haven't quite decided which yet.

[i]Another game that was donated to the library from Rio grande. I was interested in playing this partly because most of Donald X's games do not click with me [i](Dominion, Greed and now this)[/i]. The one game I enjoyed was Kingdom Builder 

I though the game was mechanically sound, but it did not feel like a time travel game at all. It is another play a card, take some gold or points and move on. This game did nothing to stand out to me, and the whole switch time between 2 different cards felt very unnecessary since both locations allowed you to do similar things. On top of that I found the artwork and components to be quite blah and uninspired.[/i]

RATING: 6
The game doesn't really capitalize on the time travel theme. The mechanics are kind of there, but it's far too easy to ignore what's supposed to be going on with the various cards. Instead you work the puzzle to your benefit and other player's detriment. Oh, and the components feel sooo cheap. But the game is actually alright.

RATING: 8
It's true that the theme doesn't shine through during the first plays, and that it feels like a quite repetitive VP gain optimization game. Yet, the more I play, the more visceral the game has became. The potentially devastating advantage gained from using the right Time IV  card at the right time (I still remember this time when I won thanks to being able to score my only card - which gave me only 4 VP when I needed exactly 8 - twice thanks to Age of Cats...), the importance of age domination, how to screw your opponents with card effects or time manipulations... The more you digest all those little parts of the game, the more its experience coalesce from a multiplayer solitaire puzzle into a cohesive narrative, immersive for its players. Accordingly, the numerous interactions, due to their incremental nature, doesn't feel like much at first, but end up feeling quite cutthroat when you know the in and out of the game enough.

Not quite in love with it as I was with Kingdom Builder or Dominion, but I think it's solid. I'm only a few plays into it and I can start to see some of it's cleverness, but I'm unsure of how deep the game actually is. It all boils down to getting money and scoring crowns.

Update: Well, after playing this game with 3 and 4 players, I will say the games becomes much better with those player counts. 4 starts to get a bit chaotic, but it's still easy enough to plan. The game isn't quite a 9, but it's damn close with those player counts.

Update 2: After 1 5 player game, I have to say this gets a bit chaotic, but the effects on the cards become much more abused which makes some places so much better. I really like this with 3+. Bumped up to a 9. Still not 10 territory, but I enjoy it the more I play it. Deeper than it looks.

Same sidenote as with Rattlebones: on the box in mentioned 'Printed in the USA with Pride'. Really? The quality of the printing is really bad. Colours are flat and the board has the tendency to curl. This is awful quality, even the better Chinese like Panda produce better quality, so I hope this ain't the best the USA can do on printing :s

The game itself. No wow-factor here. Collect money and spent it to buy victory points (= move crowns). That's basically it. The timechanging is really artificial. At a certain moment the best cards in each time zone will be real and then nobody will change time anymore.

This is a game where you move your meeple around a series of cards, and either play cards to get money, draw more cards, or score cards by spending money and discarding a card that scores you however many points it says you discard. The setup is randomized every game, and the time travel theme thing lets you change which cards are accessible at different times, with the cards in certain spots being a little harder to make active than those in the center. Overall, the game is just ok, just not great.

Essentially a race game, where the track changes.  Each stop on the track lets you perform 1 or more actions.  Some good choices in the player's cards.  I was hoping for more than a pasted on theme

As with most Donald X games this is a game that has a very simple rule set but much deeper play and great replay ability that is wrapped in a quick 30 minute game.  Very simple mechanics: change time, move to a time and execute that time spot.  The complexity comes with the time cards mixed with cards in hand.  A great tactical time travel game that thematically make sense although isn't soaking with theme so if your looking for that this might not be for you.  Just another quick fun home run  game by Donald Vaccarino to go along with other great: Kingdom Builder, Dominion, Nefarious, Greed and this.

This is a game which I knew I wanted as soon as I read the rules (in around November 2014 iirc), and which I finally got in February 2015. My wife and I played several 2p games shortly after that, often playing twice in a row - which definitely says something good, even though neither of us think it's great. I've played with 3 a couple of times as well, and the reaction has been similar. What I was most excited by, when first reading the rules, was the seemingly limitless combinations of different "zones" in play leading to totally different games - one of the best features of Dominion, a masterpiece by the same designer, and here used again in an otherwise totally different game. But in practice the games, while certainly different from each other, don't feel as radically different as many Dominion ones do, and fundamentally the game itself is less compelling.

But having said all that, this game is quick, it's fun, it has interesting decisions, and I'll never be sad to play it. I certainly think it's way under-rated on BGG. But it's certainly not the next Dominion, which is what I had (foolishly, I know) really been hoping for.

fascinating mechanic.  Sadly, the game is often rendering boring by uninteresting location cards.  Too often, player just sit still and play solitaire and ignore the timeline's shape.  Maybe with just the right hand picked set of cards it will be good, but I was underwhelmed with random location setup (as the rules instruct).  This makes me sad, since it is a lost opportunity for something very clever.

Perhaps if you select only locations that interact with dominance there would be some interesting maneuvering.

update:  no, it's still boring.

To score points you need money, to get money you play a card, to play a card... Oh that's what the cards on the board are for.

I played a prototype copy at Gen Con, so this is a very provisional rating.  There are some neat ideas in this game, but overall it may be too simple when it comes to strategy.  I want to play again to see how it plays a second time.

A little simplistic in its minimal actions, a little lucky with card draws having major effects on early strategy, and though the time travel mechanism is very clever it's not used well. So, overall, a game I could play or not.

I really like the theme, and the card set up and time travel mechanics are great at first.  However, the timeline changes too frequently, so it does not feel like you are changing time in any meaningful way.  Card play mechanics are kind of boring.  I don't think this game lives up to its potential.

Donald X. Vaccarino card/worker-movement game with an ugly, superfluous board and enormous box: 10 cards are laid out in a pyramid with 4 levels (of 1/2/3/4 cards), representing one distant past and several levels of downstream futures (from the medieval at level 2 to distant possible futures like "Robot Uprising" and "Age of Cats" at level 4). Players are time travellers, moving their meeples back and forward in time, activating locations, switching which downstream futures are "real", and attempting to get all of their crown tokens to the final level -- i.e., ruling the future. 

The thematic fluff is, unfortunately, the best part of the game. It's a typical DXV design -- the variety in the location cards means that every game plays differently -- but the design is clearly less polished than a Dominion or Kingdom Builder. I'm naturally disinclined to like it as randomness of card draw in play as at least as strong as randomness of setup, but I expect that most players will feel that it is missing something.

Perhaps part of the problem is that many of the cards feel like base-set Dominion: the obvious, basic stuff required to ease players into things before giving them more dangerous toys in later expansions. Like Dominion, Temporum is an easy game to expand. But I don't think it's worth playing until it is.

tl;dr: solid design that left me cold

It seems [person=10525][/person] is defining his style as games with very simple rules and short playing times with great amounts of variation due to cards and a decent amount of depth compared to game length. But other than [thing=36218][/thing], none of them have been able to get my juices flowing with excitement. They're all solid designs, but somehow they don't stand out even though that mix of depth with short rules and playing time is something I quite enjoy. I can't exactly pinpoint why that is.

RATING: 8
A nifty worker placement game with the dynamic spaces. The spaces pay out differently each game, which makes it a different type of game.  You can alter that future which makes different times available to be played.  I like this a lot as a two player game, as it lets you anticipate what the opponent will do, and the ruling majorities game is more zero sum.  The less chaos in the timeline in the two player game allows you to have semi firm plans, and multi-turn maneuvers.  It is a game where you have to grind out small advantages to be successful.  It is always going to have a close finish due to the progress at the same rate lack of an engine, but its forgivable in such a short game.  If this game creeps to 45-60 minutes with your group, it won't be a very good game.

It fits nicely in filler space.  It isn't Dominion, and it isn't Race for the Galaxy, but compared to other light 20-30 minute games, it holds up just fine.

This is a nifty filler for three players. I don't care for the same general flow of currency introduced into the game creating tight games time after time, but its enjoyable to see how the ages will interact with each other with some player chaos thrown in.  I think 2 players is too tit for tat, 5 players is unpredictable as far as trying to set up double moves and I'm never trying a second game.  I've never played with 4.

This is a good filler game that has an interesting interaction between the cards on the board and the cards in your hand. If you like dominion i think you would enjoy this game as well. You have to play your moves to maximize your point game as fast as possible.

It's a card game from Donald X.... well technically there's a board too, but honestly you don't even need the board really. My first thought after picking up my starting cards was "Hey, these look like Dominion cards!"

Dominion isn't my favorite game so I went into this with tempered expectations. The game is about time travel. You've got a lot of wooden bits stuck in Age 1 that you have to bring back to Age 4 (present day).

Each of the four different ages has as many cards as it's level, one card in Age 1, two in Age 2, etc. They branch out from the past... so the Age 1 card can lead to either of the Age 2 cards. The Age 2 cards lead to three Age 3 cards, but from any Age 2 card you can only possibly access the two Age 3 cards that are adjacent to it. There are little arrows that show the "current reality" path. So while the Age 1 card could lead to either Age 2 card, there's always one that it's pointing to that is the only valid current card.

On your turn, first you can switch which way reality will bend from the age card you're in to the next lower age, switching between the two closest realities downstream. Then you can move anywhere in time in the current reality. When you stop on a card in a particular age, you take the associated action, which typically lets you play a card from your hand, score a card... which means you get some amount of movement points (which lets you move your wooden bits closer to present day) or get some special benefit.

All the cards can be used either as a play card or a score card. The play abilities typically get you money, or more cards, or some ongoing benefit. The score ability just lets you pay some amount of money to get some amount of movement points.

As a twist, while you're trying to get your markers back to the present day, there's a majority contest for having the most markers in any age. The majority is only important when some card in play references it. But typically it can ding other players for money, give you cards, or let you move your markers.

While there are ten age cards in play each game, they are chosen randomly from a larger deck. So every play will be different and there looks to be a lot of replay value due to that fact.

The game was a lot of fun. It's a fairly quick game, but there is enough going on to make it interesting. It's definitely on the lighter side, but given how long it takes to play, that's appropriate. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun, but seemingly one's ability to win is dependent upon too much luck of the draw. Some cards seem significantly more powerful than others (especially the "continuing" ones that let you draw a card after playing or scoring a card, thereby refreshing your hand without having to dedicate another turn to do it) and if one player gets a lucky draw and the other doesn't, there not a whole lot one can do to counter it.

Huh... Really regretting putting this on my 10x10 list. I thought it would be good to have a game I wasn't sold on. It's so tempting to play a game once, have a lackluster experience, and trade it away. However, I've played the game 3 times now. It's not painful, but it's not anything interesting either. The tactics seem rough around the edges. You flip the time, and you watch your competitors go flying around through different possibilities. But you don't know what cards they have, so it's hard to know whether your're hurting or helping them. You can set up an engine but only if you manage to draw enough blue cards. The real question is in the engine. Time II gives you a bit of guaranteed card draw. Maybe you try and get some blue cards going and then look to see which zones help you capitalize. Even then the time stream mechanic is just set to ruin the fun. All the fun cards are in Times 3 and 4, but, if you head down there, you get bounced around like crazy by those above you. I'm really worried that I won't get 10 plays in before I move from ambivalence to active dislike. Well before that point, however, I'm going to trade it away.

Bought January 2015

Draw two cards, play a card for money, score the other. Wash, rinse, and repeat. Card differences except for age IV are marginal, so the variety that is typically the strength of Donald X games is only superficial. 

The scoring track that doubles as an area control mechanic is the most interesting aspect of the game, but it just doesn't make a difference as the majority benefits are so marginal. 

Feels underdeveloped, a real missed opportunity.

Ugh, this just didn't engage me at all. I'm not a bid fan of Dominion, but I'd much rather play that.  This game is kind of like Dominion, but with less cards, and half of the cards are on the table and you can only use ones available to you at any given time.  Sounds like a neat concept for sure, but I just didn't even really care to win, dull.

Really, this is an average of two ratings...I'd give this a 9 as a 4-player game and about a 6 as a 2-player game.  I think this might be a game that seems light, but will almost always be won by the more experienced player.  Efficiency seems to be a huge factor here.

This is a good game. I really like the theme and artwork. Hopefully this is something the expansion will fix: It seems like there is only 1 really good strategy. The cards in each time zone are very similar (I suppose this is necessary because if not, it would probably be possible to get stuck in a time zone). So it becomes a short game of just selling your cards, paying to score your crowns, and hoping you win the race. There are some very cool card combinations which can put you ahead, but it almost seems like the game isn't long enough to be able to use them normally. Maybe the game should be longer.

I think the idea of the game is great, but the execution is mediocre. It's easy to learn, quick to set up, and fast to play, but it just isn't as addictive as Dominion. Also, despite the creative names on the cards, it doesn't really feel much like a time travel game, which is disappointing.

RATING: N/A
A light to medium sci-fi time traveling card game. Pop about the four eras of time, purposely causing butterfly effects to force alternate realities with the aim to strategically build and channel power into the future where you need it most. It is a race to move crown tokens from the first era to the future. Randomly seed the reality cards for each era, each providing a special effect. I like how the board visually aids our grasp of the alternate reality paths branching from the start of time. I like the area majority for control of an era. Point to point travel to different eras for specific actions; play a card, get a card, score a card. Wow, a time travel game that doesn't make my brain hurt, is not heavy, and is not confusing and complicated.

I love this game. The board is beautiful, and the variety of cards makes it super replayable, and the meeples are adorable, and the game is super easy to learn and quick to play. 

However, I have some issues with it. The currency tokens are fiddly little pieces of card that there just aren't enough of if people are playing more cards than they're scoring. AND they're only one-sided, which is infuriating.
Also, this game came with a handful of currency, 5 meeples and 50 little influence tracking crown pieces, two decks of cards and *zero* bags. I had to turn the box sideways to transport it, and now it's just a complete mess in there.
UPDATE: I bought some little ziplock bags from Dollarama, but how is that not a thing someone realized should be included?

Also also, the box is more than an inch wider than the folded board, and it's only that big because the sprue for the currency was that big. Two smaller sprues would have reduced the box size. It's also at least four times as deep as it needs to be. It only has to be as deep as a single deck of cards and the board, and yet it's a full size box. Madness.

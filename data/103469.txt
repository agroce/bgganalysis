RATING: 7
This Risk: Legacy, Risk 2210 AD, and Risk Star Wars Original Saga are among the best Risks.

Objective based play with rewards on your way to capturing 3 of Major/Minor Objectives.

Takes care of turtling a bit, and keeps everyone on their toes as a separate piece that can travel around the map can be controlled by a player and make surprise attacks against enemies.

Also boss characters provide unique flavor to each battle and make for great lil storylines when fighting each other.

I'm a big fan of the series and this Risk variant hits up a lot of thematic elements both in terms of presentation and gameplay.  Has unique bosses to help you bend rules and shop cards which similarly offer you various advantages.  A lot of fun, and since it's Risk, isn't as itimidating to introduce to new gamers as other world conquest games are.

What I love the most of this game is how it perfectly blends the best of the best. The debrin cards (action cards), debrin points (money), bosses (commanders) and mobile territories, cities, objectives and rewards have been taken from the most remarkable Risk games such as 2210 and Black Ops, spiced with a touch of one of the best video game series ever, which they managed to capture the flavor to perfection. Everything in a game that you can play in less than 2 hours! This is the Risk version I play the most now.

I'm not a huge fan of RISK, but I liked MGS enough to get this. About the only real reason I have it.

A very fun variation of risk, even if you don't like Metal Gear Solid. Tons of fun and lots of strategery abound, and the drebin cards and bosses add a ton of fun and variety to the experience.

Pretty good, for a Risk variant! The leader powers and economy make for some interesting changes to the standard formula, though the "floating continent" gets rather OP.

Note: This was before Risk Legacy.

O, first I must admit that I am a rather big fan of the MGS video games/universe so that helps in liking this game.  Those unfamiliar may want to brush up on a Wiki first since well that's what sells this game.  Absolutely lovely board and bits.  The cards seem a bit flimsy, so do take care.  Love how they incorporated the aspects of Objectives and Awards in this, similar to the RISK:Factions video game to speed the flow of the game and incorporate some major changes in gameplay.  If you hate dice rolling, pure, utter, dumb luck, or Metal Gear Solid, then do not buy this.  If you're looking for a bit of light fun with some other MGS geeks, give it a go!

Good Risk variant.  I like the Outer Haven and bosses.  Would have preferred to see more of a departure from standard Risk rules, but I know that isn't always an option with re-themed games.

Have played 4 times, and each time had a blast. This was the first non-standard Risk variant I had played, and overall felt that it is a much stronger game than regular Risk, with more opportunities for tactics and counter-play.

Great for both Risk and Metal Gear Solid fans alike. Mechanics such as a moving continent and occasionally rolling d8s freshen up the classic Risk experience.

The rule variant for this edition brings in a travelling continent in the for of Arsenal Gear. Other than that, it's basically standard Risk.

Everything you hate in games in one place, too random, without diversified strategies, player elimination, bad components, long drawn game and generic art. Terrible

Another 'Risk' but this is a decent one.

Concern so far is the balance of the bosses - some seem too powerful and some of the cards are a bit odd... Would be nice if they had multiple uses like in some other versions. 

Also, the map is the standard world one from the classic version. This is ok but not thrilling - shame they didn't mix it up a bit.

Lastly, the 'outer haven' ship rules are pretty poor and we aint found a working system for it yet.

All in all it's okay but there are better (legacy, 2210, both star wars, halo, lord of the rings)

Some of the leader cards are better than others.  Bit unbalanced.  Plays pretty much like Risk.  I bought this game because I am a Metal Gear Solid fan but I never play it.  Kinda regret buying it.

By far one of my favorite Risk variations, takingnthe formula of Legacy and, in essence, covering it with a nice coat of “Metal Gear” veneer. Utilizing the war economy setting of MGS4: Guns of the Patriots perfectly suits this game of global domination and including Drebin Cards which have some cool abilities and quirky homages to the series adds some unique flair to an otherwise pretty drab smash and grab wargame of control.

I have never played any of the Metal Gear Solid games so I approached this from just a board game view. Risk:MGS is a lite version of 2210. It employs the Black Ops rules for Risk but adds leaders and tactical cards. This is much better than the Halo edition. The leaders and cards add a dynamic to the game that only appeared in 2210 and Godstorm. They alter strategies and can change the course of the game if used properly. The game feels more cohesive than Godstorm but does not offer quite as much as 2210. (However it plays in significantly less time than 2210.) it is a great variant of the Black Ops system. Hasbro might consider an expansion for the Black Ops Risk that utilizes these ideas as their inclusion makes for a better game. 

I am usually not impressed with the output of USaopoly as it seems, so often, to be just for fan boys. Risk:MGS is the real deal; it is a good game. I would like to know who designed this version.

I got it because I'm a huge fan of both Risk and the MGS series. Theme is of course entertaining. It's difficult to recommend this game if you aren't a fan of Metal Gear Solid. Get Risk 2210 if you want a more in depth version of Risk.

A pretty solid Risk Variant... less a "new" game so much as cherry picking good qualities from other variants... Use famous series characters as commanders to give powerhouse effects to armies, use strategy cards to turn tables, go for sneaky wins... It all works together quite well. Maybe not the best, but definitely a better variant, if you're the sort who wants such a thing.

3-5 players.

I guess its risk but it also had a shop and a FUNCTIONING OUTER HEAVEN mechanic. And you can play as Campbull.
Lasts for 2 long hours and its essentially vanilla risk, it has its limits on fun.

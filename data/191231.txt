LIKE: Finding efficient routes and trying to get them quickly was pretty fun. Stealing goods was fun, especially if it was the last one. Placing factories to leech off your opponents was fun, too.

DISLIKE: I feel the point distributions are too well balanced, but creates a more relaxed game, but lacks in tension. The text on the cards was very tiny. Not many ways for bigger combos.

OVERALL: Good gateway game, but still something here for gamer fun. Needs more plays, as the timing strategies seemed a bit more hidden than usual. I wonder if an expansion map or some twist of mechanism to the game would really make this game even better.

Got a single play in, 3-player. This is a simplified version of Wallace's Steam which I very much love. But don't take that as saying it is a simple game - the route building is quite challenging to sneak in plays against your opponents. There are shared objectives as well as private ones. The two actions per turn limit makes the game very snappy and gets of the table in a hurry. The production values as expected from Space Cowboys are amazing in all regards. Loved this one as lighter fare that would play well with all gamers.

Quite a nice, fast pseudo-train game.  The art, bits, and box insert(!) are amazing.  Nice paring-down of mechanics to make a smooth-playing connection/delivery game.  Not incredibly original, but still a good design.  I'll definitely play again, but I won't buy it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It is a very nice pick-up and deliver style game. The graphics are awesome, the mechanics are streamlined with few options (action selection) but needing heavy thinking on how to optimize the delivery paths and trying to benefit from the opponent's plans too. The only bad thing is that lacks the diversity of contract cards: there are few types, but each with many exemplaries. Still, I am highly recommending it as a party game, as the rules are simple and the visuals high class.

LOVE this one. Very simple, but with a lot of hard choices.  Surprisingly interactive due to the tightness of the board.  I love how every action you do in this game is in some way HELPING the other players, so the game is to always optimize moves so you are always helping yourself more than your opponents and putting other players in spots where it is better for them to do something that will help you than your other opponents. I have played this one a lot and I still get that new game itch every time I see it on my shelf.

Pretty solidly meh. Pick up and deliver, so not really in my wheelhouse to start. It's just a strange little game. You're building routes that anyone can use; you have limited actions; points are hard to come by and buildings can be taken before you can afford the action to claim them. Not a fan.

This game has largely been ignored- which is an absolute shame. The theme and art are extremely charming, even if they didn't particularly lend to the train game mechanics.

Unfortunately, the pieces were a nightmare to punch out, and needed trimming when I was done. Even after that, many of the grass tiles are misshapen, not quite matching one another or the hexes.

The Brass/AOI parallels honestly didn't occur to me during play, even though they're obvious in retrospect. Colorfully-produced, quick-to-play game around resource and board management. Thought it was decent, thought about it a lot after playing, played a bunch more, and fell in love with it. Really really solid game, and it stays level or improves with every play for me. 3P and 4P work great, and it looks like they've at least put a lot of thought into 2P. Wish they put more thought into turn order, which is my only knock, but easily house-ruled (snaking, even number of turns). Experienced players can BANG out a game too, and the rules are easy to remember. A total winner.

RATING: 7.5
This could become one of my preferred "gateway" weight games. It sits comfortably on the medium-light side of the weight spectrum, but provides, for its weight, greater than average depth of strategy. The components make for an attractive table presence, and the graphic design on player board doubles as a great player aid (should you need it). You won't need the rule book after the first play through. 

Via Nebula is a stripped down route building game that, at 2 players, can play in about 30-40 minutes, which is perfect for quick game sessions (e.g., when an infant is napping). The optimization puzzle varies, in multiple ways, a bit each game (but only a bit), which is another plus over other "gateway" weight games (e.g., K2, Pandemic) that my wife and I occasionally enjoy. Additionally, the game can be played in a solitaire style where each player stays predominantly on their own side of the board, or it could be played more cut-throat, where you compete to use your opponent's resources and utilize their meadow tiles. This changes the game play up, too, as the former feels like a building race (though the first player to build all 5 is not guaranteed to win), while the latter feels more like a battle for resources and certain contracts.

Edit, Oct 2017: Though I feel I should bump this down to a bit in rating since I want the contract cards to have a bit more variation, I will keep it here mainly in view of the thoughtful production and role it can fit into the collection.

A solid, fun and unique super filler (under an hour with experienced players) that employs pick-up-and-deliver and shared incentive mechanics while still retaining the Martin Wallace stamp. There could be a small amount of a luck element in the way the contracts come out and are fulfilled by players, but nothing that detracts from the overall experience. Family friendly (simple rules and quirky theme) while maintaining a gamer's interest.

A "lighter" Martin Wallace where players are "helping each other" as they go. That almost doesn't sound realistic for a Wallace game, but I've played it and it's true. Wallace does seem to have gone some different directions lately and I've mostly played his heavier stuff and this won't be considered one of his best games, but it isn't bad. It's pick up and deliver made easy and it's true that when you clear paths, you tend to help others along the way. I enjoyed it way more than expected and I'd play Via Nebula again. It is a race game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Surprisingly enjoyable for an euro, Via Nebula relies effectively on one of the very few mechanisms that make cube pushers acceptable to me: short term tasks or missions that you do and then forget, with no need to plan your strategy several turns ahead.

It still requires a little too much cerebral titillation for my tastes though, which prevents players from bantering while playing as they need to focus non-stop on finding the solution of the same basic problem: how to carry efficiently a number of resources from their points of origin to your most suitable building site divided by two actions per turn, while making sure of not helping your opponents with the same task too much.

This translates into zero interaction (just to be sure, thereâs not even a way to slow your opponents directly or hinder what theyâre doing): nonetheless, Via Nebula turns out as an enjoyable game overall and even a fun one at times.

RATING: 9
One of the best Wallace games.
Honestly speaking, I was disappointed by the latest games from Martin Wallace (London, Study in Emerald, and especially Mythotopia) and was very sceptical when we sat down to play Via Nebula. However I liked the game immediately, and purchased it after few plays.
First thing which catches your eyes is the theme and design. The graphics are fantastic, it's a real pleasure to play Via Nebula. Even the insert in the box is customed. where everything has it's own place, and it makes you think, why other publishers don't make such nice inserts for other games...
The rules are simple, but the game is deep enough. Surprisingly I find it even better, than Steam (and I liked Steam a lot), as it is more streamlined, easy to learn, nice looking and complex enough. 
The replayability is really high and together because of the gameplay, the graphics and theme and relatively short length you want to play this game more and more ;)

------------------------
Really solid pick up and deliver game.  All the graphic design and art look fantastic, and it might be the best looking "train" game I have seen.  Need to try other player counts, but wondering if the game is too short.  The game does have good interesting choices, even with its simple rules, but again just wondering if it ends before it really should end.  Definitely going to check this one out more.

"Steam for beginners" with a quirky theme.

This is a pick-up and deliver, route-building game with simple rules, interesting decisions, short playing time and a stellar production from Space Cowboys (again). As an introductory game, I think Via Nebula is a resounding success from Martin Wallace.

Full complement of players recommended for maximum enjoyment.

Via Nebula is not likely to go down as my favorite Martin Wallace game, but it is interesting, and I liked how it looked on the table better than I thought I would from the front of the box. The tabletop aesthetic is rather Terra Mystica--actually, you could consider it Wallace's streamlined, non-asymmetrical riff on TM.

This is a light to medium game (more light to me).  I played it a couple times and really enjoyed it.  It is probably just a tad more complex than a ticket to ride.  The art work is fantastic and the components (specifically the resources are great).  Who doesn't love a little pig meeple?  The game is quick but I did notice some analysis paralysis near the end of the game in myself and opponent. I will keep this in my collection because it is so easy to teach and does have interesting decisions.  I will say that they could definitely release an expansion to provide more contracts to build and perhaps even a new building.  I also like how each player has a totally  different shaped building.  They went the extra mile on that and it looks good for it. My only criticism is I am not sure I totally get the overwhelming feel that I am in this fantasy world.  You could exchange this with a train theme. But I should be clear, a boring train theme would be worse.
Perhaps in an expansion they can add a neutral evil player that gobble up resources or spreads poisonous fog.....or something.  It just needs a wee bit nudge to fully immerse me in this gorgeously illustrated world.  I want to know more about this fog world with monsters and peril around every corner. A new map in a expansion would be good too. 
Definitely a good gateway game with a cute theme.  Also, I think this is the first pick up and deliver game I have ever played.

After 2nd play, it's a good quick pick up and deliver. Can be thinky/strategic but is also easy enough for non-gamers to "pick up", though the better player will win all the time. Also, I play with a variant where the deck is face up so you can better strategise for the next building that comes up. Rating may stay around 7.5 or go up to 8-8.5 depending on suitability for all gamers but for the length, it's been quite good so far.

RATING: 7
Strikingly similar to Brass/Age of Industry, but streamlined into a family-level game.

You're still placing guys on the board to unlock a cache of resources (like playing a mine cart or iron works in AoI), hoping those resources get delivered so you can get your guy back (like getting that mine cart or iron works flipped in AoI), and trying to get resources delivered to your building sites in order to fulfill contracts (like flipping a cotton mill, port, etc in AoI). You're also building common "roads" to make these deliveries on.

The main twist here is that the contracts vary in both the resources they require, and a special one-shot ability they grant you when you fulfill them. Plus, the game is much much simpler than either Brass or AoI. If you've played those games, you'll easily see the connection between this game and those. If not, you;re in for a pleasant pick-up and deliver style game with some decent decisions in a very easy to learn game.

good game but I won't buy it .
one party: I thought I have failed but the final scoring put me the winner !!!!
Yes , it would be more chalenging to follow our score during the game !!! is is needed to wait the final scoring !
So it is a miss for me ........

at 4 players, the final scoring were : 25 - 24 - 24 et 21

the final scoring is too compact !!!! with no possibilities to change strategy while playing .... blind scoring ....

Light Euro a step deeper than Ticket to Ride. Kind of fits in that Five Tribes area for the type of experience it provides, although it does so with much less downtime and annoyance.

It's a beautiful game of exploration and route building with a race at its heart. Thinky without being convoluted or aggravating, and inviting due to its veneer and simplicity.

A quick playing game that looks to be another good one from Space Cowboys. As usual the components are amazing. In this one you explore resource sites making resources available, build paths so you can move those resources to building sites, and then build buildings that give you special actions. Because the resource pools and the paths are shared among all players along with only taking 2 actions per turn the game moves along at a brisk pace. I did not think I would like the penalties for having extra resources, but it was not too bad.  We got a couple small rules wrong, but those will be easy to fix for the next game. My only complaint with the game is the tedious setup with setting up the player mats and the board, but if you get at least 2 people helping out it goes quickly. After a few plays now I feel the game is losing my interest because the game just feels too basic.

Middle of the pack family game, with route building, set collection, and some parasitic elements. The theme is non inviting to me, and I find the art design non functional and too rich for the game. I would have preferred cubes insteas of different resource shapes, and less illustration on the board. There is quite a bit of luck of the draw, and the points from the resource chits seem a bit too large. Also, why the hidden goals? On the positive side, it has forward planning considerations and near zero downtime. A decent game.

Keeper. 2nd game played much better than the first. It's a game about "you scratch my back, I scratch yours", but pretty straight-forward. Somewhat of a pickup-and-deliver game, except that pickup/deliver are combined. You need to bring resources to building sites to build buildings, based on a rotating shared set of available buildings to be built, each with separate requirements of materials. It's not super deep, but there's enough variation to make it replayable. It's a good game for the 1hr slot.

NOTE: During first game misplayed one rule that is VERY easy to miss.  All resources remaining on board at end of game are moved to owner's player board and count as -1 point.   This makes game much tighter and more interesting.   My rating is based on playing with correct rule.

This is filler material with amazing art and clean mechanisms. I don't LOVE games where the whole game is about avoiding setting other people up with big turns, but this one was short and I played with fun and not super cutthroat people so it was fine.

This one REALLY surprised us!  I had heard numerous complaints that it was too light, that it was a gateway+, but we're not really seeing that.  Sure, it's somewhat light (and definitely light by Martin Wallace fare), but there's still a lot of intertwined and interesting decisions to make.

Where you choose to open up an exploitation, where you place your tiles, where you clear a path, which resources you take, and which buildings you construct are all challenging decisions to make.  Invariably, anything you do helps your opponent, and vice versa.  These interesting situations pop up in 2p, so it will be interesting to see how it works at a full 4p.

This will stick around, hitting the lighter end of the sweet spot, right alongside Quadropolis.  Both games have simple rules, but emergent, interesting, intertwined decisions. 

EDIT: Have played it 4p now, and it performed as expected.  The game really is all about what your opponents are doing, and how you can anticipate and pre-empt their actions.  Where are they going to make goods available?  Where will the meadow go?  What buildings are they going for?  Use this to plan your sites, and gain advantages off the backs of your opponents.

This should be a good training exercise for Brass

A pick-up-and-deliver, positional abstract that is easy to explain, and provides lots to think about during the hour it takes to play. The way the board is 'seeded' means the game will offer a fair amount of variety on each play. So, a really nice game but two minor niggles - 

- It's very nicely produced, but the wood and wheat resource pieces could do with a little more differentiation.

- There is a little bit of luck in terms of when a new contract (building) card is turned - a player may already be half way to building it and it simply falls in their lap. Might try playing with the next contract to be added to the track of those available being visible - that would give players forewarning and some chance to affect it's arrival by when they build available contracts.

Overall, very good.

Via nebula. Very good pick up and deliver game with tiny rules overhead. Almost wrote there that it was simple, it's not age of steam or brass - but what you loose in complexity and to lesser extent depth you gain in play time and ease of teaching, if those things are important to you. So yes it is simple but who cares. It's fun. Of Karubaesque complexity. Straining for an analogy here, you can tell it's a Wallace game - or at least I can (having already known makes that process easier) but it's as if he was collaborating with Reiner Knizia, who binned everything that he deemed to be extraneous, which was most things. Still has a surprising amount of depth. Will adjust rating on repeat plays. Game plays well with two, though isn't best at that number. 

Components are nice. I like that one of the resources is 'pig', which you use with stone and bricks to build buildings, perhaps you bind your mortar with their blood? 

I am not too fussed by the art design, but it's vibrant and eye catching.

The insert is both great and annoying. The slots for the resources are great, (a pig shaped well for pig shaped tokens) but the board doesn't fit well on top it and in fact was slightly damaged by it in transit.

Addendum: a solid game no doubt, with simple mechanics, though I couldn't imagine this being anyone's favourite game.

Not normally a Wallace fan, but I appreciate this design which distills down many of his familiar mechanics and refines them into a quick, approachable family game.   Didn't think it would work, but it does.   In general terms, this is like AoS meets Transamerica (in that everybody can use all of the global network which is being built).   There's a lot of back-scratching, which is often a turn off for me, but it works here.   Really nice presentation and production, very easy to grok and teach.   Very good.

Age of Steam redux redux redux.

There is a family of Martin Wallace Games which began with Age of Steam and carried on with Railroad Tycoon, Railways of the World, Steam, and now [thing=191231][/thing].  Although the railroads have gone to be replaced with clouds and meadows the game is the same: create a network (in this instance a shared network) then pick up and deliver along that network.  

Here that original game is stripped down to its bare essentials, with a rule set that even a light gaming-minded family could understand.  This is not a lot more complex than Ticket to Ride, and lighter than Stone Age.

The interesting twist in the game is the idea of building this shared network: by opening up routes you are helping everyone else to help themselves.

It is a good solid Martin Wallace game, giving the same feeling as playing Steam but in half the time and with a much simpler rule set.

Martin Wallace meets elegance. Simple to learn / teach with lots of surprising depth and tough decisions. I love how every decision you make to help yourself will ultimately help your opponents as well in some way. The artwork is also nice and whimsical without being in the way.

RATING: 6
The game of competitive cooperation. Since all goods and open paths on the board are communal, players are forced to work together, though in an indirect sort of way. If you sequester yourself in the corner of the board your won't stand a chance, but if you scratch too many backs, you'll likely be taken advantage of. This sense of tactical cooperation is the game's flagship quality. It perhaps plays a bit too quick, as a group of four could easily learn and play in well under an hour. Also, the decisions are a bit too thin. Optimal moves are fairly easy to identify and leave me wanting more to chew on. Finally, the big miss for me is the lack of potent building powers. Strong building rewards would have gone a long way, but instead they are disappointingly weak, and often go unused. But for those in the market for an introductory Euro game, you should shop here.

This is a deceptively deep game that looks light and is easy to teach but turns out to be quite the brain burner. You only have two actions per turn that you need to split among route building, resource gathering, and VP card claiming. The catch is that youâll inevitably have to take actions that benefit other players. Resource spots on the board have to be âopenedâ and tiles have to be placed on the board to move the goods (think âtracksâ). 

Do you open up some goods or create a pathway that others can use or do something else and hope they do? Itâs a race to claim those VP cards so you canât dawdle. All in all, I think itâs quite a clever game and a good option as a super filler a la Palaces of Carrara.

A sort of route building optimisation type game with a spacial awareness element which I completely suck at, but still really enjoyed.

If you strike out on your own you are going to fail, you need to open up resources near others routes so that they take the goods leaving you free to open up even more resources. Because of this an interesting sort of "you scratch my back, I will scratch yours" atmosphere develops between players where we are sort of helping each other, but secretly(or not so secretly) attempting to get more out of it that our opponents.

The cutesy family friendly artwork belies the harsh, oft times quite cutthroat nature of some of the game play here. 

It's definatly interesting and I have not played any other game quite like this one before.

Via Nebula is a family-level pick-up-and-deliver game with beautiful components and some parasitic elements. So even though I should like this on paper it fell a little flat in play. The path-building is maybe a little too simple, the extra building actions are all a little dull, and the end game can easily go a little wonky if there are no more resource sources. Okay game, but sort of disappointing considering the pedigree.

I am becoming more tolerant of the cutesy artwork if the gameplay is rewarding and doesn't demand a more serious theme.

This one has fast and fun gameplay and definitely not solitaire or spiteful really but quite interactive.

Great at the two player count and quick but satisfying to race to the finish.

Some decent components for sure, but forcing a higher price may be too much to overcome for this game, much in the same way Mayfair sabotaged Murano's popularity with a higher price point.

I had originally passed on this game when it was released (cartoony look, bizarre theme), but when I did a little more digging and found that this was essentially Brass & Steam Lite, I decided to give it a go. I wasn't disappointed.

This game is opportunistic semicooperation, like Brass, but without the economy and finished in an hour. Is it as good as its older brother? Probably not. But I'll have more opportunity to play this one, which I'm excited about. I just really wish it had less out-there window decoration.

Somewhat reminiscent of Kings of Air and Steam, in that it's a "train game" in which players share resources etc. Nice game with lots of tricky decisions to make, the only downside for me being that it can be a little too political for some people given that each action you make will help at least one other player as well as yourself every time.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (August 2016)

Martin Wallace is one of my all-time favorite game designers. All his games are an âauto buyâ for me. Having saying that, many of his games are âugly but greatâ(Treefrog Games) so Iâm always suspicious when one of his games looks as great as do Via Nebula. Some of his great looking games werenât right for me (Railways of the World, Discworld: Ankh-Morpork) and Iâm still undecided on Via Nebula.

The gameÂ´s production values are very high as is usual from Space Cowboys. The art is great as are the gameÂ´s components. The theme is barely there though. The insert isnât very functional!

The rules are very easy to teach, you can do it under 12 minutes. Gameplays is very quick as well, you can play the game under an hour. It has some similarities to Age of Steam, but it is much lighter.

The decisions needed to play the game arenât very hard, but arenât trivial either (generate resources, construct a building, make a new path, fulfill a contract). I like that you need to make temporal alliances of sorts to quickly make buildings, but I expected a game with more meat, a deeper game. 

There is a high degree of luck of the draw, Iâm still undecided how I feel about this issue.

Best with 3 players.

Bottom line, Via Nebula is an ok game, but I expected more from a Wallace game. It is way too light for my current tastes, I prefer WallaceÂ´s heavier games. I already sold my copy of the game, but Iâm open to playing it again to see if I missed something, It plays fast and thatâs an important advantage. It can be a good family game.

RATING: 6
The game is set up like a reverse rail game, where you build connections by clearing out fog and forest and only delivering resources over completely empty tiles. Potential resource pools are distributed randomly and each player has two craftsmen they can use to open up a resource pool. Once opened, you cannot take your craftsman back until it is emptied. Not only do you need to clear fog and forests, you can't deliver over resource pools, building sites, or any tile with anything on it whatsoever. So the most challenging aspect of the game is not so much clearing the fog, but using resources in a way that they don't sit around blocking delivery of other resources. It's a bit of a puzzle and a pleasant one. The resources to build a building are determined by the contract card chosen, either from the display or the two private contracts you start with. You don't need to choose until you are ready to build, so the contract you are targeting can remain flexible until you build. If you have extra resources on your building site after building, those go to "storage" and count against you at the end of the game. You get points for buildings, opening resource pools, clearing fog and forest, and for building all five of your buildings first, which also triggers the end of the game.

I like it! It's a good intro to connection-building games that is not too long and has enough going on to interest the veteran gamers. Replayability comes in the randomized placement of resource pools, which is adequate, but ultimately this is likely a game with a limited shelf-life.

UPDATE: Limited shelf-life indeed. Lowered rating from a 7 to a 6.

RATING: 8
This was quite a surprise for me. I have not enjoyed very many games by [person=6][/person], I think the only other one is [thing=35570][/thing]. Admittedly, I haven't tried them all, so perhaps there are others I would like. 

Via Nebula is a very simple game. It takes less than 5 minutes to explain everything. In the game you are claiming building sites and finding resource caches with the goal to transport those resources to your building sites to fulfill building contracts. 

At the start of the game it's impossible to transport resources because paths have not been built. As players place meadow tiles the paths start to take shape and resources start flying around the board.

What makes this game for me is the positive player interaction. I love me some good positive player interaction. First the paths you place and the resource caches you find are available for all players to use. Secondly, there's room for two buildings on each construction hex (not true for 2p) so you can double up with an opponent and align your interests in extending the path to that hex.

Of course you are trying to win so you need to help others as little as possible, but you can't help helping them. You need to stay extremely vigilant about which of the public contracts your opponents are attempting to fulfill and how your actions help them. You need to choose the contract you want to fulfill carefully, and try to ensure it doesn't get snagged by someone else.

You are constantly asking yourself which actions must you do now, and which ones can wait for later. Prioritizing your interests is extremely important. This can lead to some tense decision making. This is by far my favourite thing about the game.

A possible downside is that playing the game with someone who is not putting in the necessary effort to play at a high level will ruin the game. It's very easy for someone to king make if they just focus on their own goals without carefully considering the impact of those actions on others. 

The game does play fast, maybe 45 minutes with experienced players. That places it in the filler category. As a filler this game is astoundingly deep. You get a lot of thinky-thinky for very little ticky-ticky (that's the sound an analog clock makes).

Great game, simple and quick but deep. It feels Wallace-y and anti-Wallace-y at the same time, which is intriguing. Large focus on not wasting, and making others use your stuff, a la Brass, which I like a lot. After a few plays, I can see multiple levels of strategy after, which is encouraging.

Interesting distillation of Age of Steam.  I wish the card powers were more strategic, and needing other people to help you is frustrating but the pick up and deliver does pose an interesting puzzle.

2017-10-21 - 6 - It's just OK. Pick up and deliver where you try to use other player actions and not help them too much with yours. That's a good concept but misses some spark. It looks like a good foundation for an expansion, where you can do more intetersting things with buildings and with variable player powers maybe? It plays pretty quick.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very beautiful game. That is it. Not for my taste (very light), the fast turns are actually a problem, because it goes around so fast that you start to playing in "auto-mode". After some rounds, the conections are meaningless because they are all over the board.

RATING: 7
Fun game of setting up resource sites and building sites then trying to connect paths between them in order to complete the buildings and score points and gain powers.  This is complicated by the fact that other players can use the paths you build often times taking the very resources you're trying to gather.  The game is fun and plays quickly.  I would gladly play again.  The artwork is too fantasy-cutesy for my tastes.

A euro-style placement game, with network building and worker placement mechanics, in a streamlined gameplay.
Could run for both family game and strategy game categories.
Theme is pretty thin, but is the support of a very pleasant artwork.

RATING: 6
Not bad. Yes this is a train game, but it's more lightweight than you normally expect coming from Mr Wallace. Quite abstract and full of luck & enough player interaction. What Via Nebula misses here is, that the tickets could be more complex: now everyone of them needs different kind of resources so it doesn't matter what resources to collect. That's a bit annoying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Crafters, builders and carriers â your help is needed to dispel the mists of Nebula! The people of the valley will reward you handsomely if you harvest and exploit our many resources, open paths through the mists, and help our settlers build new structures. Cooperate temporarily with other builders in order to create paths and share goods, but do not forget your own objectives. Will you have a statue erected in your honor on the Nebula City plaza?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is essentially a super streamlined & accessible brass/steam.  Play is solid but feels somewhat bland/generic and repetitive.  Production value is decent but the insert is simply bad.  Mine was so badly sized that it split open the 1st time I inserted the board in it.  Combine that with hard to reach buildings and general uselessness, it got tossed after 1 game.  It a good game to get to transition players from Ticket to Ride towards Brass and might actually be family friendly but it feels almost too plain/bare bones for a gamer crowd.  On the upside however, it really plays super fast which is nice.  Need to play this more to confirm.

An excellent straight middle weight euro that never really got any buzz. This one is essentially a train game in disguise (like most Martin Wallace designs) but much more accessible than his more famous games. I've pulled this one out with family and friends, and even used it as a gateway game, under certain circumstances. If you are a fan of classic euro style games, check this one out if you get a chance!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice graphics, simple rules, relatively fast turns, interesting "path" mechanics. 

But there is a flaw: the building costs look similar and it is hard to remember the costs of all the buildings while planning where to build. As a consequence, some turns can take too much time, with regular checks and re-checks of thecard costs.

Ajoutez Ã  Ã§a une Ã©dition visuellement trop pale, un thermoformage totalement foirÃ© (je sais, il vont en refaire un autre et le donner aux possesseurs des premiÃ¨res boÃ®tes, mais quand mÃªme.... !!!!).

RATING: 7.5
For me, this has a lot of things I look for in a medium-light game:
Simple to explain
Plays quickly
Have limited actions per turn, but you're left wanting to do more

A little worried this may have a shelf life.  I'm thinking maybe 10-15 plays before I'm done with it.  It has interesting decisions on what to do (risk/reward) and when to help your opponents, but there's not a lot of variety in each play though.

Love the art.

Sold 12/11/16 via BGG.

Acquired from BGG weekly contest.

While the mechanics were interesting and production was awesome, the game was ultimately way too light for us.  I didn't realize until after that it was marketed as a "family" game.  Something about the game just wasn't very engaging.

+ Beautiful art
+ Amazing insert
+ Unique route building (at least for us)
- Light game has relatively few decision points
- Low tension
- Feels somewhat scripted

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
After 5 plays (2-3 players):

There are some surprisingly interesting aspects with quite a bit to keep track of for a game of this weight - a good family plus game. It is well balanced with wins generally going to the most consistent player. 

I was surprised how much tighter it was on the more expert board.  I looking forward to trying with 4 players.  It is very easy to teach and plays at a nice pace, though I wouldn't want to play with anyone prone to AP.

It's essentially a lighter version of Steam. It's not quite family friendly as it's rather sterile and you can pile up penalties for excess unused goods (which isn't hard to do if you aren't keeping tabs on the timing of the endgame). It's also not quite a gamer's game as some of the one-time card effects are "take that" in nature (move a meadow tile) and there is a dose of luck in which contracts pop up next. This is somewhat mitigated by the private contracts, I suppose. In any event, this is a weird in between game that looks like it's for families, but isn't, kind of like Broom Service.

This game is excellent, although fast playing it gives you meaningful deep descions. It can also be easily enjoyed as a Gateway game by one and all.

Tenuous - probable removal

Nice, route building lite edition - with screwage, parasitism, incentive management - all things I like in a game.

I'm not completely sold though, I don't quite know why - but it's like it's missing that extra ingredient to bring it over the top. Like a dept spiral, or some sort of threat you have to manage - cause it doesn't feel like you ever suffer enough in this game, you just sorta get "out-optimised" and lose when you count up the points.

Initial rating is 7.5 after a single play (4 players), however I'm already looking forward to trying this again. That suggests my rating may go up a bit.

There's a lot to like here for a lighter game, and the presentation is [i]excellent[/i].

I have to say that this is an excellent game, Martin Wallace is returning to good form 

The game rules are very very simple and fast to explain... the game also plays fast but the decisions are many and are not easy... there were many times that we all were exasperating with the hard choice we had to make.

The interaction between the players is awesome, we try to do the less we can that helps the other players but it's inevitable that we are going to help each other out, like it or not.

A very cleaver and interesting route building and pick-up and delivery game.

A nice gateway-level game, where you claim resources and transport them to construction sites to build buildings. The trick is that once you've claimed a resource spot, anyone can use the resources from that spot, and transporting resources requires you to clear routes, which everyone else also benefits from. The rules are straightforward and clear (although the terminology is a little funny - the resource spots are called "exploitations"), the components are very high-quality, and the gameplay is fast and smooth. My wife and daughter picked it up right away and enjoyed it.

Having played once, I feel like I've explored it. It has some upsides. Components are nice. You're engaged throughout. Turns are quick and there's little downtime - even though the board provides a common source of resources where people will take resources you were banking on but adding others you weren't expecting, it's not a hard evaluation re whether there's a better option now at the start of your turn than the one you were planning at the end of last. Every option feels like it provides roughly equivalent points, so it feels like the player who gets lucky by being in position to easily fill contracts that appear in the common draft with the fewest actions should do best. There's little strategy seemingly .. take advantage of what gets points quickest now given the board state, and worry about tomorrow tomorrow. Making it gamer-lite fare, but it does pleasingly come in at the right length to satisfy that market.

If Brass and Steam met and had a cute baby all wrapped up in a pretty bow, that would be Via Nebula. It feels similar to both games and still has a good amount of strategy in it but is much simpler to grasp and the presentation is stellar. This will probably get more plays than either of its bigger brothers.

My first Martin Wallace game!  This game is 'tight' and keeps the tension on the entire game!  With only two actions each turn, you end every quick turn wanting to do more!  You have to share routes with other players, so deciding when to lay down route tiles is always important.  You also share resource locations, so determining when to open those spots up is also important.  Do you go for it?  Do you just wait for your opponent to do it?  It's a race to collect resources first, claim building locations first, build buildings first, etc.  Very tactical, but also some strategy.  And it's nice looking!  Great game!!

Via Nebula is a light pick-up-and-deliver game that I can't help but compare to a much heavier Martin Wallace game, Brass. Players can either place their pawns on a production tile for a token worth points, place a city tile on a designated spot, clear a path between production hexes and city hexes, or deliver goods from any production hex (including those claimed by an opponent) to their city. Once a production spot is empty, a player gets his pawn back to claim another point tile--so you actually want others to take your goods, most of the time. Once a city has all the goods that match either a contract in the offering or a private one from the game start, the city is complete and you earn points according to the contract. The game ends when a player plays all five of his cities, at which point any goods left over on either production hexes or city hexes count as negative points for the player that own them. While I appreciated the basic gameplay, I was a little frustrated that the game can devolve into a bit of a game of chicken. Stuff that doesn't complete is worth negative points, so toward the end people may not want to do things because they may be helping others while earning themselves negatives. This kind of soured me on this game.

RATING: 7
It's basically Steam that's super stripped down. Add in various building powers instead of cities and you have Via Nebula. I liked it quite a bit even though it was pretty light. It seems to play well with all player counts, but 4 is ideal. Not sure how many plays you could get out of it before it gets a tad boring, but I'd happily play it again. I thought some of the play could be vicious if you played cutthroat. Points are incredibly tight though which is not my ideal type of game.

I do wish that this game wasn't so over produced. Yes, the pieces are nice, but this is a $40 game, not a $60 one. Cheapening the buildings and the resources would have been excellent and would have shaved off 10 or 20 bucks, not to mention the insert is impractical as nothing fits 100% the way it's supposed to.

Lovely game with great production values and a classic feel. I prefer the whimsical theme of this over train-themed games.

Need a few more plays but my one concern is that the game may be a bit too sensitive to small errors - opening an exploitation or building site in a suboptimal space can prove to be unforgiving, and this can be exacerbated by the luck of the draw with the contract cards. In the late game it's usually easy to see who's best placed to win which takes a bit of tension out of the endgame.

A lot more fun than I was expecting. I don't like pick up and delivery games. This is more of just a delivery game- light. There is a fast play time and a lot of interesting decisions.

This is a very quick playing basic pickup and deliver game. On your turn you send meeples out to reveal resources, ship a good across empty spaces, clear spaces so they'll be empty, start a building, or finish a building by meeting the requirements of one of the recipe cards. The components are great, the gameplay is smooth, and interesting, as you are looking to see what recipe cards people are aiming for, and how many of each resource is left on the board. It's not going to replace other Wallace games like Steam, but It's a very solid family weight game that has a good layer of strategy and intrigue.

Had a good time with this one.  Simple to pick up with enough different mechanics working to develop a strategy.  Well thought out gateway game that is also fun for more advanced players.  Artwork is nicely done and the colors of some of the meeples were a nice change from the usual.  All-i-all I would play this more.

Tried to like it, but it's just way too simple. Almost no tension, scores varying by 1 or 2 points, 2-player variant less than good. Wallace games are really a hit or miss for me - and this is a miss, by a mile or so.

Maybe, maybe as a family game... but even then, the theme is not that exciting, and I could name many games better than "Via Nebula" to have fun with family. A little too abstract - and most of the time it's a no for kids.

I had seen this game on my FLGS ding & dent shelves several times, but was always turned off by the box cover. I couldn't seem to get excited about it. I was told that it would like it from a friend with very similar tastes in games as me. We opened it up and got things setup. I was surprised to have a completely different feeling about the aesthetics. They went from being a turn off to being something I actually liked. The action point system works well and I enjoy the route building and resource gathering. There's some cool balance of what you are doing and how it can help your opponent. The best part about this game is putting your meeple on a resource spot to make them available. Some of which you will want for yourself, but also you are hoping that your opponents will take some as well. Being stuck with resources on tiles you control at the end of the game will be negative points and lock up your meeple so you can't open up other resources. I liked it a good deal and bet it's even better with 3/4 players. This is one that I would seek out to play again.

RATING: 6
A pick-up-and-deliver train game not so subtly hidden behind tile and worker placement. These mechanisms are melded elegantly to make a solid gateway game. The building cards, though limited, are a nice touch to add some player objectives. This also implements a skill-based element to the game: to be able to evaluate the state of the board and the present goal cards and determine if or how you may stymie your opponent.You can be very, very mean in this game if you take the single resource that you know damn well someone needs, just to spite them. Be warned: what goes around, comes around.

(+) Well-made components. The meeples are shaped like their type, the insert is wholly functional, the art on the boards and cards is eye-candy, and the board is double sided to allow for multiple difficulty levels.
(+) Easy to teach and learn, but surprisingly tense decisions to be made in practice. 
(+) Very quick to play. I played a handful of 2-player games in less than an hour (not counting setup time)

(-) Somewhat lengthy setup time to allow variable starting game states. 
(-) The theme seems pasted on, which I am ambivalent towards but I understand others may have concern for.
(-) There are limited building cards and powers. An expansion would be nice to see.

first play: i really like the game
nothing novel, but the mix is very recommandable
after three 3-player-games:
update: i donÂ´t like the valuation at the end of the game:
minus points for own resources on the building sites and exploitations??!
Who wants to place a craftsman (-3(-4) VP minus 1(2) VP) or to move a resource to his building site, if you see, that one of your opponents is "faster" than you?
There are no possibilities to do actions, which forces this opponent to end the game rapidly, because you would get minus-VP

what happens, if no player can build five buildings? - there is no statement in the rules

So light, yes. But very entertaining and fun. Requires really good timing, and the person that gets their 5 buildings out the quickest + the extra 2 vp's, isn't necessarily guaranteed the victory as I found out. Tbh, I loved that it happened that way. There is a little strategy in which exploitation tiles to get. There's some that give you a lot of resources, but your dude will be posted on it for longer, if the other player doesn't assist you. And the higher they are in resources, the lower they are in vp's for end game. So, do you get a small one with less resources and more vp's? Interesting stuff tbh.  I also love that you can transfer extra resources to your building site, but then have to store the overage, which will give you negative points. You can mitigate them though with certain building abilities. The two player was fun and I'll play it anytime, but I can see this game shining with highest player count for sure. Everything about the design is executed to be with the highest amt of players. Production is top tier, rulebook is flawless, and it's one of the best gateway games I have played. I look forward to teaching this to new players and having fun playing it myself.

this is a really fun game...I usually don't like Martin Wallace, but here I do...with 2 people it can get kinda brain burney in a really fun way...not too long, mostly open information, you can set up some nice strategies. Cards flipped during game to replace bought cards adds a nice touch of randomness.

I imagine with more than 2 it would be more like ticket to ride level, ok but ultimately too unpredictable, as plan making would be almost impossible turn to turn. Which might mean casual gamers could get into it. Me, I would need to play it with 2 to enjoy.

Played once with 4P. A charming Wallace design with rules simple enough for the family gamer to pick up, but with some teeth to its gameplay. Opening up meadows and resource sites benefit your opponents as much as they benefit you, so be prepared for plenty of angst.

One major positive aspect of Via Nebula is that it provides the element of cooperation/competition without the usual faff of a bigger and more complex game. Plus, the pig meeples are a joy to behold. On the other hand, there is a bit of luck in the contracts that appear, but the quick playing time sort of makes up for that.

I want to like this more than I do, and this rating might even be a little high. I love the pick-up-and-deliver, and the building of routes. It's just that I don't quite feel the tension, as you often can do a bunch on your own, especially in 2 and 3 player games. I do like the shared resource mechanic, and it is interesting, but I haven't felt myself really drawn to it.

This is a simple semi-cooperative path-building pick-up-and-deliver(ish) sort of game. The board has a random setup where 5 building materials are placed at random locations. Everyone plays for themselves, placing build sites and opening up material supplies. They place tiles, creating paths between resources and build sites; but the paths can be used by everyone.  The game end when someone builds all their buildings. Each building awards a bonus effect, depending on building type (players start with 2 personal, random, buildings; there are also 4 face up buildings, from a deck of cards, always on display). When the game ends, everyone gets points for the buildings they built, the resources they opened up, and the path steps they spent.

Interesting route-building game, lighter than I prefer but still pretty good!

Quick to learn and explain this is an enjoyable game that while not really complex still challenged me enough. Managing the routes to finish your buildings/ contracts WHILE avoiding leaving extra resources on your spots behind (since they count against you) kinda stressed me out but in the best way.
60 min is a very generous time estimate, I think without explanations (which won't take long either) you can get this in at 30, max of 45 min. We played with 2 so maybe more players extend the time significantly? I will find out at some point. For now a good game that is not earth shattering, came a bit overhyped imho, but it is entertaining.

Quality gateway game. It's on the shorter is but is still highly rewarding. The turns are quick and the rules are very simple. The aesthetic is really what drew me in but I don't regret buying it, even though it's on the more expensive side.  I wish some of the contracts were more interesting but I can't wait to keep playing.

RATING: 6.5
Fairly light "pick up and deliver"-ish game. Not bad at all, but feels a bit cut throat and vicious at times with a lot of opportunities for king making to happen. Also, it seems like rushing all buildings is a dominant strategy due to the bonus 2 points for finishing first. Wish there was maybe more build up and progression in the game rather than just a mad dash for resources.

This game is GORGEOUS. Gameplay was pleasant, just didn't WOW me. I wouldn't turn down a play of it but I also own Whistle Stop - another tile placement/pick up and deliver game - and I just didn't think I needed both in the collection. Traded it away... let's see if I end up regretting that decision.

tl;dr: very enjoyable, light strategy game

Yes, one can never get too many Martin Wallance games, so to get a new, nicely produced one is always nice. Especially if the game turns out to be solid and enjoyable.
It is one of his more family friendly games, but it still is a strategic game with some nice tactical opportunities.
So, not a masterpiece (one shouldn't expect that from him every time of course) but certainly worth playing.

First impression is very good. The game combines quite interesting mechanics - pick up and deliver, network building and worker placement - and stays simple and transparent. Provides some interesting choices, is vell balanced and has quite nice game flow - even with 4 people. Good quality components, kids friendly theme and it's pretty fun. Definately a recommendable strategic family game.

RATING: 9
First play impressions: Really impressed! Not being a fan of the Steam-type games, this one distills the system down to a reasonable timeframe and streamlines it enough to make it fun.

My only small complaint would be that the luck of the cards can potentially cause issues. This is similar to Splendor where after a player buys a card then the next card to take its place might just work perfectly for the next person in turn order. Seems like I'll have to just adapt to it, or potentially make some sort of variant where you can see what cards will be coming up in the future.

Update: Played more, including using the "hardcore" side of the board and it's still great. One of the best games of the year so far, and 2016 has been a really strong year.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 4[/b]
They went through a lot of trouble to shoehorn in a variant for two players, but this type of game just isn't meant for two players. I could see it working okay with three, but it's clearly meant to be played with four. The interplay of creating supply and demand just needs more players to be involved.

RATING: 8
Bumping my rating up from a 7 to a 7.5 after playing my 3rd play, which was with 4 players.

I think I'm liking this game more and more. The rules are simple enough to make it a gateway game, but it feels tense because of the shared board space and race for contract cards. There is a bit of luck in the timing, but the game is short enough that this doesn't detract from it enough.

Updated rating: 8.0

I keep enjoying every play. As long as people know what to expect, other players enjoy it too.

The design notes in the rule book tout that this game was born from the idea of your actions help other players.  Neat idea.  So doesn't that mean with fewer players you are pulling further and further away from the core idea you built? Yes I feel it does mean just that.

The gameplay is complex enough to keep us engagedâand itâs really fast with just the two of usâwith a fun theme.

Played a 4 player game at GenCon and enjoyed myself.  This is a solid tile-placement game with some fun hidden objectives, a nice art style, and clever mechanisms to move things along.

My main impression is that the game has an incredibly intuitive design.  Everyone was making moves in minutes and I felt like I was playing a game that we'd played together several times.

Overall a great game, and this is not usually a genre I mess around in.  If you are a big fan of worker placement and/or resource games, this is probably a 8 or 9 for you.

Simplified family version of a pick up and deliver game like Age of Steam in a silly setting with childish artwork. It might work for some but not for me. The gameplay does, however. At least as long as it is played with more than 2.

Played it 2 times for the first time. Very simple and clean design but the cutthroat stealing of resources and spaces makes it a tougher game than I was expecting it to be. It had more depth than I was expecting, since I was looking for a Steam in 60 minute style game, and it's pretty good at being like that, but being at the same time fairly different. Liked it a lot, played it with good people which really helps any game.

Oct 2017: -2 rating.  This game was fun for maybe 3-4 plays.  After that it gets pretty repetitive.  It's one we can pull out now and then and even easily teach to a beginner, but not one that we find ourselves reaching for even once a month.  With so many better games on our shelves, I really can't rate it much higher.

Purchased Jan 2017.  Rules are simple enough once you sit down and start playing.  Enjoyed the "beginner" map and look forward to moving up to the advanced.

A bit of a toss up this game is for me.  It's super easy to teach, plays quickly, and is engaging.  It gives you some of that train-game feel of setting up infrastructure and profiting off of other people's work... but also doesn't feel as rewarding.

A light to medium Euro game that still feels like a Martin Wallace? I never thought I'd see the day. And yet, Via Nebula combines colorful and charming artwork with simple and elegant gameplay. The 4-player experience feels very different from a game with 2-players. In fact, I would say that I almost prefer the 2-player game, because it turns into a bit of a chess match. Highly recommended!

Family strategy route building pick-up-and-deliver on a misty land.  Connect production sites with building sites that are separated by the mists by placing meadow hex tiles. Share these paths to move wood, wheat, stone, and pigs to building sites which are subsequently spent to claim structure cards from the public display or in hand.  What makes the game interesting is the penalty for waste that can result from leftover resources after creating a structure at a building site.  This happens when someone snatches the structure you were planning to build or takes the last available type of resource--Doh!  A unique tension is created and the game forces some quick contingency planning to cut your losses. Not many games come to mind with this dynamic.

RATING: 8
Tile laying, worker placement and pick-up-and-delver mechanics are all in play here, but the game actually rolls by fairly smoothly. Lovely production on the meeples and brightly coloured boards, and the iconography was simple.

It was interesting how you had to lay down tiles in order to build routes, but those routes could be used (or blocked) by others. Nothing too mean-spirited, and the point distribution for exploring, building and collecting resources was very balanced.

Easy to play, and even easier to recommend.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A bare bones implementation of resource-shipping across shared distribution lines. Mechanically similar to Brass/Age of Industry in that regard.  

Players have an uphill climb if they build off in a corner by themselves, so there's a natural tendency for players to huddle together and leech off one another.

Really, the game does what it sets out to do. It works and it's not too long.  Though I'm not entirely keen on the randomness of the contracts, the contracts that award end-game VPs (too swingy?), and the possibility for analysis paralysis.  

Finally, why is this not set in outer space, which is what everyone assumes from the title?

RATING: 8
While I think the normal side of the board is great for learning the game a first time, the advanced side provides a whole lot more to think about. It felt a lot tighter and full of trickier decisions. I really enjoyed the game! A lot to consider, but simple actions and very quick turns. The game seems like it will scale very well at all player counts due to how the size of building sites and number of workers and resources scale at different counts. I really appreciate that touch. My one suuuuuuuuuper minor complaint is that a lot of the buildings make no sense as buildings. We built priests and shortcuts from the card plans, but put a building down to denote them. That makes me brain hurt a bit. But this certainly doesn't impact the gameplay at all. At 2P, this game is quick, but still it provides a satisfying amount of decisions. I love this combination, so Iâm very pleased that I decided to pick up Via Nebula.

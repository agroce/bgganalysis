Not quite sure how I feel about this one. Defeating the baddie seems too easily gamed. It's possible I'm misunderstanding some rules here, but I doubt that. This is just an odd one... and I LIKE VPG solitaires, namely Cruel Necessity and Nemo's War.

We'll see. I'll certainly give it some more time.

Beta tester, so owned both test kit and finished game.  Great game with lots of tension and replay-ability.  At first, felt very similar to Arkham Horror in several ways, but not quite so much now--except that playing either with all the expansions can get really crazy!  For anyone who likes co-op play, give this serious consideration.

A beautiful fantasy game in a dark setting. The laser cut game pieces are well done and the art direction is fantastic. The playable characters offer unique skills and there are multiple ways to defeat the necromancer. There are numerous enemies to defeat. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a cooperative or solitaire game.

Very nice fantasy game. Does not need special solorules and plays extremely smooth. Not easy to win. Atmosphere and story hold the theme together very well. Reminds me a bit of Talisman. Very cool for a little break from wargaming.

RATING: 6
Slightly fiddly, very luck-prone co-op fantasy game.

If you roll mostly 5's & 6's during the game, you'll win.

If you do NOT roll mostly 5's & 6's during the game (or, during clutch moments in the game), you'll lose.

The final battle was severely underwhelming.

Artwork was fine.  Not impressed with the game components, however.

Initial Impression: VPG has done a wonderful job creating a game with dark thematic components and back story. With the individual decks of abilities for each character there's so much potential to customize your character. Unfortunately in my playthrough of the game I found that not to be the case. What bothered me the most was the randomness of the event cards. Perhaps if one card was drawn each turn the game would seem less random, but with a draw at the beginning of each character phase it was just too much for me. Perhaps the expansions change this?

The artwork is nice. The rules are not too complex. It is interesting to build the Team and for each hero their Special Powers... but surely you depend a lot on the dice results, which can offer a lot Frustration.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Co-op that really seems best for 1 or 4, as you always have 4 characters in play ...

Art is nice, components are refreshingly different, if a bit small.

But gameplay is a bit meh :( For the length of the game you do surprisingly little on your turn, draw an event, take one action, interact with the blights ...
And as moving is an action you really don't want to do that as you won't be able to do anything else.

Like the idea of powers as cards, so there is some variety and incentive to 'level up'.

But the luck factor is pretty overwhelming, dice for everything and the key elements are combat and searching, both needing die rolls, usually a 4,5 or 6+ depending on the difficulty. Given you do just one action a turn it can be a bit frustrating if you roll low.

There's evade (no fight) or fight, but there doesn't seem to be much difference between the two (unless you're attacking) so just pick the one you have a better chance at.

Overall, was mildly disappointed. If I'm going to play a solo or co-op game I'd much rather play eldritch Horror, which has a stronger sense of theme (for me)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
:d6-1: Co-op so it seems you might need to play more than one character.
Epic sneaking around in the shadows trying to outsmart and fight the big bad. Art and theme is stunning. An expensive investment though (especially given I´d go for it for solo play only and the general opinion seems to be all expansions needed for good replayability) so I am interested in trying it first. I will also need to figure out the differences between the two editions to ensure I get the optimal one for solo-play.

RATING: 5
Decent game, but not on Arkham Horror's level. Seems like it will become repetitive.  Really could use "flavor text"  Needs more of everything, powers, event cards, locations, characters, and changeable Necromancer abilities. Wish the characters had longer back-stories and names! I can see how the repetitive searching could become boring and annoying.  Lots of promise, good design.  I like it, but don't love it.  Definite tension.  Failure is a real possibility.

After another play, I got tired of the repetitive searching big time.  Wanted to love this solo, but couldn't. Traded away.

The mechanisms work, but the narrative is so sparse it feels very mechanical to play.  Fighting a Lich doesn't feel any different than fighting a skeleton, or dispelling a curse -- and it should.  It's OK, but not up to the same standard as the better co-op adventure games like Arkham Horror.

A dark fantasy setting encased in challenging, easily modded co-op play.  Each hero plays differently and the way they combo skills and also add flavor on their own makes each game a totally different thing.  Played on hard-mode you could probably consider it the "Dark Souls" of boargaming.  

VPG chose a great game to help kick off their Gold Banner series but that really isn't the story here.  Darkest Night is a great game.

I have been looking at this game for a long while, but in the end the theme wasn't enough for me to want to add it to my collection as I already have a bunch of solo games (a couple are even horror ones).  The more I think about the mechanics, the more I am not as impressed enough.  It looks to be a good, solid game but in a world chock full of good, solid games and limited shelf space and gaming time I am passing on this for the moment.

Update 31.5.14 bought another copy along with Inner Light & Shifting Winds.
And I also now have the Nymph, Enchanter,Mercenary, Tinker,  From the Abyss & Tales of Old - all stored in the Necromancer big box with the dinky dice tower.



I love the artwork and graphic design in this game but found it a little dry. It probably suffered by comparison with Mice and Mystics that we were playing as a family at the same time whereas I was playing this solo. Sold my copy, but I'm now getting tempted again by the potential offered by the expansions.

Un très bon jeu de plateau qui comporte des extensions très intéressantes car elles relancent l'intérêt du joueur.

I haven't decided if I like this or not yet.

I will play it a few more times, but fear that it will just end up collecting dust on my shelf as I have many other solo games that I feel are better than this one.

RATING: 7.5
[u]The Good[/u]: 1) Presentation and aesthetics are a big part of the allure of this game, for me. But I've fallen somewhat for VPG's counters, so there is that. But also the artwork is fantastic, dark and moody and befitting a land under siege by the dark powers of a necromancer. 2) The interplay between Classes is fun and interesting, and there are lots of Classes to mix and match.

[u]The Bad[/u]: This game feels constricting in one major, fundamental way: you only have a single action each turn, and often you'll use that to simply move. This makes for a limiting multiplayer experience, but becomes much more enjoyable solitaire, when you are the one controlling all four heroes.

[u]The Bottomline[/u]: A puzzle game that features character progression and a dark fantasy theme. An interesting mix! Highly recommended for solitaire play.

(Final Rating for this game includes play with all listed Expansions - would be rated significantly lower if we're talking solely the base game experience)

RATING: 6
On paper, this game is almost everything I ever wanted. In reality, it's absolutely nothing I want at all. While people seem to LOVE this game, for me it's a poor attempt at being challenging and is way too easy to beat. The designer's attempt at ramping the difficulty is to drag the game out by giving only one action per turn (moving counts as an action, so getting to a timed quest and then deal with it takes 3 entire turns at the minimum, if you can even succeed, and most quests fail in 3 turns, so it's pointless), which is only frustrating, especially when adding in the With an Inner Light quests. However, not taking care of the blights or letting the quests fail doesn't have very drastic consequences, so it's no big deal to ignore the "problems" and spend all you time searching for keys to get the relic and beat the necromancer. Home ruling and adding a "one move AND one action per turn" rule would make me a lot more compelling to prolong the game, an deal with the problems.

I love this game. Most games when viewed critically do not seem to really tie the mechanics of the game to the theme, but this one really does. I find myself really trying to search with the rouge or scholar and fight with the knight or kill the necromancer with the dark adept. It's so nice that all of the characters fill a role that fits with the theme and the commonly accepted archetype. Also creates a lot of stress without feeling unfair. I wish I liked my solo dungeon crawlers as much as I liked this game. While this is not a typical crawler, it somehow scratches that itch for me.  Note that I play without any expansions.  I have kickstarted the 2nd edition.

RATING: 9
I like this game a lot. Since it always pits 4 heroes against the dread Necromancer, each play is enormously varied and exciting. In classic VPG style, endgame requires that you roll a 6, so luck will cause much heartache, but it's so satisfying to finally deal the death blow to the Necromancer - even playing alone I cheer upon victory! The theme in this game is pitch perfect, creating an atmosphere of frantic dread. Instead of cavalier superheroes smugly marching into battle, your characters are forced to work in secrecy, skulking around like guilty things trying to remain undetected long enough to gain the required holy relic that can kill the Necromancer. The heroes have a lot of different skills, and finding the perfect synergy of them all as a group is the puzzle. Winning is not easy, and you feel constantly harried, so you have a real sense of victory when you manage to win. I have all the expansions, and each adds a little something to the game besides a new set of themed heroes to toss into the mix.

Solid little co-op! I only have the first expansion, so there isn't too much problem with sitting in one place the whole game, though I wish I also had the expansion with quests.
The variety in characters and powers is FANTASTIC, although I wish the game had been designed to have each hero do 2 actions each turn. I often feel like I'm getting very little done, whereas in something like Eldritch Horror I always feel like I accomplish at least a little something each turn.

Really good co-op game!  You need more table space than you'd expect.  One mild weakness in the design is that you MUST play with 4 heroes, so even solo play takes up half a table.  On the other hand, the whole point is that these heroes need to work together to have a chance to defeat the necromancer.  

The narrative can be quite telling, if you give your imagination room.  The dark Acolytes motives were unclear for most the game.  Perhaps he only wanted to destroy the Necromancer so he could take the power for himself.  After nearly dying twice, he learned to accept the help of his comrades, but even them, he had been teetering toward the darkness.  As the final battle drew near, the Wizard entrusted him with the keys to unlock the second holy relic.  As he took the blessed item, he realized that he must turn fully from the darkness.  He and the Wizard turned to run from the Necromancer, when a blighted arrow stuck him square in the back.  Gasping, he handed the relic to the Wizard.  "Run, and tell the others... I have been redeemed!"

Own as part of the Necromancer bundle. Love the artwork. The components are good considering they are from a print-on-demand publisher. The characters and Necromancer could get more love, they're small. Really enjoyed my playing of this, the Necromancer keeps seeking your guys and spreading darkness upon the land, and it can get pretty bad pretty quickly. Need to try quests next time.

I gave it a 6 because I think the game has limited replayability.

It gives the player a certain piece of fun but the fun dies out after a few games since it is always the same thing.

With a bit of ingeniosity, I bet the designers could add a few things to increase the lifespan of their game.

It is not a bad game, I gave it a 6, but it is far from great or even excellent. I know I would never buy it.

There's some good stuff here, but 
a) You will perforce get into a fair number of situations where you're rolling a single die you cannot modify. This is unsatisfying, even if the rolls are low-stakes.
b) You do so very little on a turn--moving to a new location, for example, constitutes an entire turn. That, coupled with a), makes for a very poor play experience.
And don't get me started on the "skip a turn" atrocity.

This is a great coop and a great adventure game.  The heroes feel very different and if you want to win the game you have to use their abilities to their best.

Artwork is excellent, and the cardboard pieces feel like wood; I guess it was worth having my fingers stained by soot.

Darkest Knight has a flaw (that I won't mention for fear of spoiling your pleasure with the game) that is fixed by it's fourth expansion.  But I would definitely suggest to collect all of them.

RATING: 8
Game play is fairly straightforward, winning will require some planning, and a bit of luck (combat requires a success on a die, and is similar to [gameid=15987]).

Very nicely produced components!
(laser cutting does leave a bit of sooth)

Cards are of good quality (size: standard M:TG)

Love the board, as it lies flat.  It does require minor assembly (4 puzzle pieces).

Rulebook: Full color!

As with most games, requires one play through in order to grasp all the mecanics.  We had to remind players to draw an Event card when they were not at the Monastery.  Had to look up some rules, as players did not understand that you can only remove a blight when you are the one attacking it (your Action).  Further, there are two sets of numbers on each blight.  One if when you attack it on your turn, the other, on the back, is when it forces you to attack/defend (those numbers are usually lower).

Edit: 3 plays in with 3-Players, 4-Players and 2-Players, and this is a winner for me.  Already ordered the expansion, and looking forward to trying out the 4 new characters!

RATING: 4.8
The base game is easy to solve and then becomes scripted and VERY easy (even in "expert" mode). The game usually devolve into ignoring 80% of the game board while clearing out all enemies from a single location adjacent to the starting location, and then having all heroes stand there searching (rolling 4+ on dice) until three keys (which grants a relic) is found. Then the necromancer is lured in and killed with the relic. The game seems promising but in the end it's repetitive and not fun.
The expansion "With an inner light" is supposed to fix these problems by adding quests, but I haven't played with it. Rating is based on base game only.

Pros:
-Great artwork and components
-Quick to play, ~30min (when solved)
Cons:
-Too easy
-Very repetitive
-Seems to require expansions in order to be fixed (not sure if expansion will fix it).

Could be a nice family game, but I didn't like this much. Quite all the events cards didn't add anything to the game but more random component and took a lot of time to get rid of those. It's also quite static in a way that some characters could stay on the same spot searching for keys each turn for many many turns.

RATING: 5
Bleak and hard, especially since the only way to mitigate bad dice rolling is generally incredibly expensive (a whole turn, a few points of secrecy, a point of hp (out of 4 or 5). Rolling badly against an event and then rolling badly against a blight and suffering the negative effects from failing to succeed on top of the negative effects of simply ending your turn in the space with that blight is incredibly hard to overcome. Need more plays to decide if it's frustratingly fun or simply frustrating.

Initially you can feel overwhelmed with the limited actions (only 1 per turn) that you can take.  The games challenges does lack variety with all checks made against a dice role.  But the game comes to life with the diversity of all the characters you can play and how you balance your Grace and secrecy.  Unlocking some new powers and playing to your strengths is vital to success and the feel of the game is brilliant with what you face of againt despite not having any aditional fluff text.

Darkest Night is a fun co-op game that encourages individual thinking through unique characters with a host of abilities only the player will fully grasp. At first players worked autonomously gathering materials for the battle against the Necromancer, until we were confident enough to come back together and defeat him. In the final round, every player brought something to defeat him, and even then we barely won. Future games might not be so easy. I never felt like I wasn't contributing or being controlled by someone else.

KEEPER SOLO
A cross between SoS and Mistfall (without the brain-burn)  with a generic fantasy back story that works just fine. Each expansion adds characters and complexity. Risk of same-iness in the gameplay; but the Necromancer moves around the board through a cunning but simple bot; and although people complain that moving takes an action it is a tight board and the speed of each character's turn keeps the same-iness at bay; while the Necromancer's Darkness track ramps things up like a slow pressure cooker. A clever design. In particular, each character has a set of ten cards which provide its unique powers and - cleverly -
you start with three and add more but most of them do not get spent or discarded but remain in your hand available each turn (unlike, say, Mistfall). Artwork far superior to 2nd edition. With all the expansions (which mainly just add characters - a total of 29 of which you use four a game).

After a video review, this is a story less arkham horror style of game. Interesting, but only issue is that you must play with 4 characters what-ever the number of players. It could be possible to make variants to adjust that.

I really wanted to like it, but after a few plays, it was clear that it wasn't for me.
- The random nature of die rolling with very little to mitigate bad rolls doesn't make for very fun experiences.
- The events are mostly non-memorable blah
- Turns feel extremely limiting
- It's too long for what it offers (if it played in 45 minutes, it might be OK).

I love the theme and the dark/medieval art of the game. A remarkable point of the game is that it works well at 1, 2 or 4 players. The mechanics, despite being simple and dice-based, allows options and decisions. The characters are the most charismatic I've ever seen on a board game. The narrative, unlike other games, does not lie on illogical and heavy card texts, but it gets developed during the gameplay by the players' actions. It is tense and emotional until the final confrontation. The only flaw, in my opinion, is the length: 2,5 hours is too much for a game like this. With 1,5 hours or even 2 hours of gameplay it would have been perfect.

I like this game - it's like Defenders of the Realm, only there's more to do than just move to flavorless spaces and roll  fistfuls of dice.

The smaller scale and greater personality shines through here, and creates a much darker, more tense situation. The way different locations have different characteristics also make for a much better narrative than DotR, as do the varied classes and powers.

Recommended!

I like how the game looks. Very thematic and old school. The rules are quite simple once you start playing and the system works well. 

Yet, I was a little underwhelmed. We easily won our first game after we decided on the best strategy and the tension went out of the game quickly. I've since then added the 'With an Inner Light' expansion and this has mostly solved the problem by adding quests that give you more incentive to spread out. I will never play the base game without that expansion again.

I’ve played this game solitaire. It’s the choices that you make that are key. Timing and luck feature in the game but that just keeps it all interesting. No 2 games  play the same as there is a healthy number of variables, whether in Blights, Events, items found, the Necromancer’s movement. To a degree you have control over your actions but the fickle finger of fate will inevitably have a go at you. I personally like this as it avoids trying to find an optimum strategy.

The theme comes through very well although I would have liked more events to drive the story rather than just throw enemies at you. So this is not an RPG game. More like Defenders of the Realm than say RuneBound with increasing Blights popping up as you are under pressure to go after the Necromancer as soon as practicable, hoping to collect those Relics on time and in good number. I would say that this is a more compact and has more variety than Defenders of the Realm.

All in all I enjoyed Darkest Night. I would say that its one of the best games that Victory Point Games has published and should be a top seller. It ticks pretty much the boxes that you would expect in a fantasy cooperative game. The theme and darkness of the game come out pretty well, it looks great, the components are a nice step up. It moves along as a solitaire game, even as you manage 4 characters and so I can’t imagine loads of downtime with other players. The Necromancer and Blights are suitably menacing and the wide variety of variables in Events, searching, Blight placement, etc. all contributes to a game that keeps you on your toes. As I keep thinking that I want another go, I’d say that Darkest Night worked well for me.

With the expansions, this is one of my favorite games to play solitaire.  It isn't terribly difficult to learn, and takes little to recall the rules after returning to it.  Gameplay doesn't take all evening, and keeps you challenged throughout.  

I'm also a sucker for Variable Player Powers, and Darkest Night provides a large variety of characters, each with a different set of powers with their own flavor of strategy.  The power variety, and the huge amount of variance a mixed party of four different characters provides, is the biggest pro.  Not only does it promote better replayability, but the different character ability mix can also provide interesting synergies and strategies to pursue.  All without getting too bogged down in rules. 

My only complaint with First Edition is that the wonderful art on the monster tokens is usually face-down, during play, due to the relevant game stats being on the back of them.  I also think the board should've been larger in order to fit both tokens AND cards associated with a board location (or a designated space for each on the side of the board).  I dropped a star for these reasons, otherewise it would be a 10.  However, all these minor issues seem to be rectified in the upcoming Second Edition.

Brilliant little Co-op gem. Probably VP's best game out there. Puts a nice spin on a pandemic-esque design by adding fantasy-medieval themes and the idea of a board-controlled nemesis that moves around causing all the troubles.

As with most VP games the components are on the humble side, and the game does suffer from having a small board, but hey, It's worth it.

Neat concept with broken game balance and limited replay value.

There's not much incentive for the players to not send all four heros to the mountains on the first turn and have them stay there the entire game searching for keys. With moderate die success you can mitigate all blight effects until the Necromancer arrives. Tried it six times at home as an experiment after our group discovered this. (Using heroes with powers to boost the number of fight or elude dice rolled as tactics, E.g. Prince, Druid, Rogue.) Using this technique the heroes won by the end of fifth turn in three of the test games, the others three games were won by the heroes within 10 turns. The trick was to end the game with a "finisher" maneuver where the Prince uses his power card to add +3 dice to any roll on the Rogue, who has the holy relic, who then attacks or awaits the attack of the Necromancer. The Rogue is very efficient at burning secrecy. Just be sure to save at least one secrecy for the ambush attack. You can force an attack by passing the holy relic back and forth, moving inventory at the same location is a free action, reducing secrecy to zero.

This could have been balanced, and made more interesting by relating a questing narrative, by making only one of the four relic chests actually have a holy relic on the reverse side.

I picked up the Necromancer Bundle of the VPG website and I was amazed by the sheer amount of stuff you get in the box! The artwork is a very high standard and I love the theme.

I have been slightly disappointed with the gameplay, since at times you feel like you do almost nothing on your turn. Due to this I am hesitant to try a four player game, sticking with two players using two heroes each. It can create some pretty interesting narratives and the change of style from mid-game where you are frantically searching for keys and completing quests to the end-game, where you suddenly want to lure the Necromancer to your location in order to set up a final battle situation certainly make the game worth playing. I am often left wishing that it didn't take so long to play out, especially as I bought this as a shorter alternative to Arkham Horror.

I'd really only play this with 2-4 players. I can't imagine trying to actively control 4 characters each turn.

It felt like a mix between Arkham Horror and Defenders of the Realm. A bit more luck than either, but the way character powers develop in this game felt both unique and interesting. I'd like some more plays of this game and I look forward to the other 2 expansions I'm missing.

Great fantasy solo player. Rules are a bit fiddly, requiring frequent visits to the rules forum when learning the game. Setup takes time. Default one action per turn can test one's patience. Played base game 5 times in both standard & expert mode and won every game using the sole holy relic strategy, which left more to be desired. Heroes have great powers that if timed correctly usually result in the knockout blow to the Necromancer. Haven't tried expansions, but feel the game definitely needs more to increase the difficulty and to boost intrigue. Good theme, great timing & strategy, powers are thematically excellent for each hero. Solo play fun & intense when managing 4 heroes. Nice amount of mental gymnastics.

I wanted to like this a lot more than I did. Biggest issue, even with the expansion, is that moving is such a hassle and staying in place to attempt to get a necessary item so important that much of the game ends up being a waiting game. I will try some more solo plays to see how it holds up for that though.

RATING: 9.5
I've read some of the negative reviews for this game (relatively few of these), but I can't understand them.  This is a richly thematic and deep game with plenty of replayability.  There are many decisions to make, and the board constantly evolves due to random Necromancer movement and quest placement.  Further, it is in no way 4 player solitaire (as one review put it), as you frequently have to interact with other players to determine the most effective turn order and/or combination of powers, even more so in the endgame.

The only minor issue that keeps me from rating this game a 10 is that I have yet to see why you would choose the alternative winning condition (collecting 3 holy relics and depositing them at the Monastery).  This seems inherently more difficult than collecting 1 holy relic and giving it to the best fighter of the 4 heroes.

This game is currently seeing the most play in my 350+ game collection.

One solo game so far, but I think it has the potential to rise in score.  
The components are high quality (although I was inexplicably missing a token...), the rules are old school AH numbering system (example 1.1 - Heroes, 1.2 Equipment), which adds to the charm.  
I'm anxious to try it with my group.  Seems pretty tight/tough to win.  The characters are distinctive and interesting, while still following the typical fantasy archetypes.  
Glad I own it...now I've just got to play it some more. 

Update 04.15:  Played with a group, and, frankly, we found it boring.  Incredibly, I think this is a game that is better solo, mostly because the players do so little on their turns.  I mean, moving from one space to another is literally your entire turn.  Rolling one die to search at a location is your entire turn.  It's just dull with multiple players.  Maybe it is better with two?  Regardless, I bought this hoping it would be a less-setup-involved Legends of Andor, and it fails on that point.  And loses half a point for it.

I am really impressed with this one. VPG has taken a huge leap forward with Darkest Night. Not only is the component quality fantastic, the amount of components is notable as well. And with nine playable characters, each with their own deck of ten unique powers makes for alot of replayability. I love this as a solo game, but it clearly would be a great cooperative game as well. I see this being a favorite for years to come.

A very difficult dice-filled adventure. The art is gorgeous and the components are high-quality. The different roles each offer a unique experience, which will help keep the game fresh for a while even though the base strategy doesn't really change from play to play.

Overall: This game is very good, even when compared to some of the more big league cooperative titles, however I'd only recommend it to players who don't mind a fair share of luck.

I got this first without the expansions and loved it.  I love games that can be played solo and this was my very first.  I found a way to beat it easily so I got all the expansions and that made the game complete!  I have not won once since I got the 5 expansions, as it's very challenging and takes a lot of time.  Worth it!  

The theme is awesome.  Very oppressing and dark, but makes you feel like you're in the world even though the game board is smaller than expected.  Art is fantastic.  This is a keeper!  Victory Point makes solid games.  This is definitely one of them.

Whatever the market is for games with no real meaningful decisions and a lot of d6 rolls to see if you succeed at your meaningless action or end up having spent a doubly meaningless turn, VPG surely has it cornered.

I don't see any reason to play this over Nemo's War or Dawn of the Zeds, much less Arkham Horror, and I HATE Arkham Horror.

Far closer to those than it is to Defenders but Defenders also blows it out of the water.

Lowered to 2 after almost 9-10 games; the one enemy, the forced 4 heroes plays, the just one-action per turn thing, the one victory condition (always the same) and the still few locations and very very little map despite the 4 "expansions" are giving me more and more a sense of big boredom and made clear the poorness of this title that made me spend so much money for base + 2 expansions. At first I was distracted by the wonderful graphics and the well done heroes+powers.
The games are almost always the same...and in the meantime I discovered much more exciting and always different solo fantasy games.

Still wonderful graphics and heroes.

RATING: 9
Very good game! With extreme replayability and "story-like-an-RPG". Really fealt a smel of adventure and risks during the game. Moreover in the first play I did not visited 2 locations at all and in 1 I was just travelling through. That means that there are still few basic option, that I have had no chance to check and there are 5 more characters with unique powers (I did not have a chance to use or even see all of the 40 for 4 characters..)!

Definitely, will give it another few evenings :)

EDIT: After second play I still can see the theme and it is a positive. The problem is that killing Necromancer seems much easier than finding 12 keys and bringing Relics to Monastery. It takes quite a while to setup the game and clean it, play takes about 2 hours (only to kill the bad guy, though, I believe that finding keys would be even longer.

Darkest Night is a cooperative game where four heroes battle against an evil Necromancer. It plays like a much simpler version of Arkham Horror or A Touch of Evil. I really like the unique powers of each character because it makes the dice rolling much less frustrating. The mechanisms are also built to emphasize team work and the rules don't make working together a hassle. The game is moderately difficult, but I recommend using the Expert set up to really make things challenging.

What a brainless wonder this game is. One can get suckered in to all the expansions, which was the marketing plan all along of course.

When a review appeared on a gaming website that highlighted this design's shortcomings, the owner of VPG demanded that the review be taken down or he'd withdraw all advertising funding (hoping to kill the site). The review was thus removed.

That speaks volumes about the game and VPG in general.

If it wasn't for the catchy artwork, this game would be utterly forgettable.

[thing=128445][/thing] is a cooperative game set in a medieval fantasy theme. [thing=128445][/thing] shares many mechanics and characteristics with other coops games, mainly [thing=65532][/thing]. Both have:

- Heroes with special abilities;
- Kill minions by reaching a certain number in a die;
- Must gather itens (cards / keys) in order to win the game;
- If the safe heaven (Monarch City / Monastery) is overrun the game is over;
- As the game progresses it gets harder (more cards revealed in the Darkness Spread phase / more minions placed and thougher minions);
- If a certain number of minions are in a place and one or more should enter there, it happens an "outbreak" and the game gets closer to end in defeat for the heroes;
- Of course, the theme.

And this isn't an exhaustive list. The player turn is like this:
- Draw an Event (this doesn't happen if the player is in the Monastery);
- Take 1 action (move, fight, pray, search, use a ability);
- If there are minions in the place the hero is, they attack;
- Next player turn.

When all the player have had a turn, the Necromancer moves and creates new minions where it goes (and this place can be in the same place, as not always the Necromancer actually moves). There isn't an time limit in the game for it to end, only game end conditions: 4 monsters in the Monastery, the Necromancer being defeated in battle, or the heroes collecting 4 Relics and taking them to the Monastery.

The flow of [thing=128445][/thing] is good, as the 1 action per turn, per player, really makes the game going with little downtime (the battle against the minions is resolved with one roll of a die - or dice - for each, and some applies its effect directly, without any rolls). The game requires a fine amount of thought before the actions for the heroes (mainly because the players only have 1 action: so if the heroe moves, he/she won't be able to do anything else for that turn), so we talked quite a bit among ourselves to decide the best courses of action, and also the turn order of players, which isn't fixed.

Play time was around 150 minutes, but we were a little lucky with dice rolls, but we were also learning the game, so if the next games take more rounds to end, I guess that knowing the rules and the flow, will make the end time be basically the same, even a little less.

The art is phenomenal, a real treat for those (like me) that enjoy fantasy art. The game bits has its ups (the tokens, the card stock) and its downs (the board is as thins are the players cards, the heroes stands are really small and hard to tell one apart from the other) - this is valid for the Boxed Edition. And considering we are talking about [url=http://victorypointgames.com/]Victory Point Games[/url], it is major a step up, although, overall the quality is bellow the standard for Fantasy Flight, for example.

Replayablity is huge - many things in the game are made for this (random Events, 9 heroes - and you normally will use 4 in a game, if none of them dies - with a unique deck of special abilities, which you will see not even half in a game, random monsters and random treasures found, and the effect of the dice rolls), so, in comparison with [thing=65532][/thing], I'm guessing that [thing=128445][/thing] has the upper hand.

By the end of the game, we all enjoyed the play and I'm willing not only to play it again, but I will request it.

A coop adventure RPG that bares some resemblance to Arkham Horror, but streamlines the components to make it an easier game to get on and off the table.

This is an all time favorite.

My first try of this game was not really a success. First of all, it took about 3 hours with two players, which felt a little long for what it offers. Secondly, the heroes' turns felt incredibly limited ("Huh? Moving to e neighbouring location finishes my turn?"). Thirdly, the dice really make or break the best plans. And finally, there is very little in terms of a story. Still, limited turns also mean very little downtime (certainly a plus). And the atmosphere (mostly conveyed through the game's fantastic artwork) is very dark, different and appealing. Also, I have a suspicion that the game has good replayability because of its structure, and the interesting way in which heroes' abilities interact with each other. Ultimately, I cannot recommend this game just yet, but I am still looking forward to my next try.

A lighter and quicker take on "threat management" adventure games a la Arkham Horror. Ultimately this did not work that well for me. The game forces you to play with 4 characters, leading to increased fiddliness at lower player counts.

The game extends and makes a twist of the cooperative concept of Ghost Stories. You have 4 heroes and only have 1 action per turn, including the movement. Each heroe is unique and their actions have a thematic sense, so the puzzle is bigger and the pressure cooker feeling grows slowly. Maybe it's a bit long but actually it depends on the way you try to win. The short and easy way by slaying the Necromancer with a relic and the long and hard way, making the exorcism with 3 relics. It's a really good coop game and a great solitaire experience too.

My first play of this game was a rather quick loss and a sense that there wasn't much game here. I quickly put it on my trade list, but continued to dwell on what was wrong and whether I missed a rule or two. I read a few reviews trying to understand what I may have missed and people kept talking about how essential the first expansion's quests were, so I added those in for my next play. It was definitely much better, bringing the game from a 5/10 to a 7/10.

I think that this game may go higher with more plays, but I could also see it going down with more plays. It feels like a more puzzly, fantasy version of Eldritch Horror, except EH has much more story to it. I'll keep playing this one, but there's an equal chance that I'll keep it or sell it.

There's no reason for me to ever play this game again, since other co-ops do the same thing better. If you want quality storytelling, flavor text, and mechanics, Eldritch Horror is the clear favorite. If you're fond of die-rolling fantasy adventure, the Wizards of the Coast D&D line (Ravenloft, Ashardalon, Drizzt) is hands down the better option, with significantly higher-quality components.  And for the same price.

One problem is that Darker Night's generic gameplay won't vary from session to session, particularly with respect to key searching and the endgame. Eldritch Horror and the D&D line have variable scenarios/villains that maintain player interest across games, which means that those two titles have a much longer shelf life.  As in, you'll want to play them more than once.

It's also unclear how Darkest Night earned the label "Euro Game #9", unless one's definition of a Eurogame is "not a wargame".  No other gaming company would agree with such a categorization, but I guess VPG is striking out into the professional world with an air of blind nonconformity.  More power to them, I guess, in sticking it to The Man through casual wordplay.

And let's talk about the phrase that appears on 50% of all Darkest Night event cards: [i]roll one die and take the highest[/i].  I don't care that a handful of dice-adding modifiers motivates this semantic freakshow, and I'll apologize in advance for my culturally insensitive response, but the mere existence of such a phrase is f*cking retarded.

In the past, when a Hasbro employee introduced similar wording into one of their games, the executive board would exact punishment on the transgressor by having his wife professionally seduced, after which they'd paint him white and drop him off at a Black Panther rally for a proper beating.

At this point in their business trajectory I'd recommend that VPG revisits their mission so that their products become less retarded rather than more retarded, which will surely benefit them in the long run.

RATING: 9
Primarily, I was attracted to this game, because of the dark theme, cooperative aspect and eye-catching components.  After several sessions, I can say that I do enjoy this game, but maybe not as much as I had initially hoped.  The game does continue to grow on me with each session and I find myself formulating more and more strategies between plays.

Firstly, the components are nice, however, I do not feel they are of the best quality.  These are not likely to last many years of enjoyment.  At the price tag, I feel a little shafted, that's for sure.  The printing is a little offset and since the laser cut doesn't line up correctly, everything is off center.  Usually this wouldn't bother me, but I value production quality and this could have been easily fixed with proper calibration of their machines.  One more gripe of mine is the puzzle board included - it does not lay flat and is pretty much useless.  

Game play is where the game does shine though.  I would say that is is very enjoyable, but it did feel like a conglomeration of game mechanics/elements from other cooperative games in my collection.  This isn't an issue, but it would have been nice to see something new incorporated here.  

Sometimes, it does feel like the game drags on a bit.  This is due to the extremely limited amount of actions a player gets to make in his/her turn.  Turns are not very fulfilling, especially if a player continues to role poorly; in a highly luck-driven game, this is a major flaw!

I have not played any expansions yet, but I am really hoping that a player's turn is rounded out with either more actions and/or special actions.  That would be really nice.  As it currently stands in this regard, the limited amount of actions a player has does help to create a more intense game and uneasy feelings.  Each player wants to do more to prevent the evil from taking over the land, but small steps toward that goal is what the game is all about.

I do enjoy this game and love the artwork, but flavor text could have really spiced things up greatly, adding to the overall theme and story of the characters, necromancer, and his grip on the kingdom.  A story book expansion could definitely scratch this itch for those of us who want more background information.  A story book or card deck that does this would be awesome!!!

I do plan on eventually expanding this game in the hopes that the additional components add more variety to game play to spice things up just enough to entice me to play it more often.

[UPDATE]
The more I play this game, the more enjoyable it is!  I keep coming back, because not only is the theme highly appealing, but it seems the more one gets used to the limitations the game sets before a player, tension runs even higher.  In my opinion, this contributes to a very satisfying victory and makes for a very rewarding experience!

For these reasons, I am raising my rating from 8 to 9.

Somewhat amazed this is as underground as it seems to be. The game flows brilliantly with choices being meaningful and rarely forced. Yes, bad die rolls can derail even the best plans, but tell me that amazing plans never fail in real life and I'll try not to laugh too hard at you. Give it a play and spread the word; this game is for real.

Replayed this and wow is it boring. It's amazing how experiencing more of the medium alters original opinions.

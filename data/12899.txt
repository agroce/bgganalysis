RANK: 3981
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Bought it to complete my personal "La Bataille"-series. Haven't had time to play it for myself! - But I like the series at all, its wonderful Napoleonics on tactical scale!!

Check http://www.tactiquesnapoleon.com for "Tactique Napoléon" as a Spanish variant to these rules, by bringing together the best of both!

The rating is for the game series' system only; haven't played this one yet.

Questa serie della clash of arms ha il suo indubbio fascino per un wargamer. Quando ci giocavo più di 30 anni fa avrei detto che era un capolavoro

This is a real knockout! A tactical game which covers an entire Napoleonic battle. And Eylau is one of my favourites. A battle fought in a snowstorm, with a French attack torn to shreds beacuse in the gale the troops, stumbling forward into the blinding snow, came right up to the heay Russian batteries. Because he had too few infantry to cover his front, Napoleon resorted to a cavalry charge to buy time. And at what a price. 14.000 Cavalry went into the attack, fought its way through three lines of Russian infantry and managed to return. Although not all that went in! They managed to gain the necessary time, by the time the Russians got themselves sorted out, the troops of Marshal Davout had arrived. The Russians were saved in the nick of time by the arrival of L'Estock's Prussian troops, who could stave off a disaster. Marshal Ney arrived too late to exert any decisive influence. By that time night had already fallen.
You have every infantry battalion, every cavalry reiment and every battery that participated in the real battle. As well as every leader from Division upwards. 
Can you do better as napoleon?

A must have for the grognard. Old School War and Peace, you can hear the guns and see the snow and fog billow over the field of battle, has a grand feel to it and very atmospheric.

The best La Bataille game overall, IMHO- BUT: the map is god-awful horrible (I don't care that it was fought in winter- it looks like a 3rd grader drew the trees!). The counters as always, are nice. This would be a great reprint.

Bought 1990

This is the L'B game I have played the most and enjoy the most.  Lot's of units on both sides. Momentum swings, large numbers of cavalry units to make charges and grand charges with.  Counters and map are beautiful.

RATING: 7
A blood bath. A pirric victory for Napoleon against the russians. A good and colourfull hex&counters tactical wargame. The problem are the rules, they need patches and repatches. But i'm a patient and houseruler wargamer. Good for solo play.

RATING: 7
La Bataille Series. Recreated the romance of Tactical level Napoleonic Battles, Infantry with Column, Line, Skirmish, Square, Cavalry using charge or pursuit, Artillery fires. Each unit got their own morale rating. The best use of combined-arms-tactic in battlefield the higer chance to force enemy rout off from the battlefield. With the 4th edition cole rule added the command system and random activation, push it to a higher level of a masterwork wargame. I will give La Bataille Series Games a Rating of 8.

La Bataille de Preussisch-Eylau is a four 17"x22" maps(that is about two 34"x22" maps) game re-created the fight on Feb. 8, 1807. 

Russian Heavy Artillery on defend is not a joke! If the battle fight in Summer I don't know how to handled Russian Heavy Artillery. French with Imperial Guard Divison, 1 Cavalry Corp, 2 Infantry Corps, and with 2 infantry Corps arrival as reinforcements. Russian with about 4 infantry Corps, 2 Cavalry Corps, and large number in artillery. The Battle of Eylau can protentially fight for a 3 days. Bloodly Game.

Yes, the graphic is beautiful,yes the map is beautiful,yes the flavour IS Napoleonic.
Yes I always doubt about which rules I have to use in the future. For the plays I made I use the standard rules.
Now with a team of 6 players it was really a tense moment of fun. I remember 5 guys trying to pull out a French cav commander out of its lethargy ,shouting "LASSALLE,LASSALLE!" We had problem with the neighbours.

Really enjoy La Bataille. Beautiful games, great fun to play. The rules have come a long way. Still not easy games to play well, very intricate, especially the cavalry rules. If you don't mind the work, a truly rewarding game experience.

A great game on my favorite Napoleonic battle.  Each piece is rated for fire, melee, morale, etc.  The map is somewhat bland, but if you think about it the battle was fought in a blizzard, so the white board and scraggly tree symbols make alot of sense.  This is a freewheeling battle with cavalry charges, Russian advances on the French left, French advances on the Russian left, and of course the men stumbling around blindly in a snowstorm.  What a game!

Excellent Game - my first ever La Bat purchase. Played it several times but only ever solo back in the early 90's. Had great fun, hugely bloody. Graphics were great at the time but dated now, especially the map which looks rather bland. However, it does an excellent job of simulating the deep snow and winter lanscape.

I would love to play this again with the most uptodate La Bat rules - but there are currently too many other things ahead of it on my play list.

Update - I did play this recently. Three of us played and it reminded me why I love LaBat. Excellent fun.

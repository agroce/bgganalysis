Partygame. Friend had to include 'woof-woof' at some point. He, in his most retarded voice: 'I had two huskys- woof and woof.' We were dying. Fun as hell, if you are into it.

With the right group of players, this is the bomb. Very crazy and funny and one of the best communicative games I ever played. As Uwe already pointed out, it would have been possible to distribute the culprits on all agenda books removing the need to shuffle an redistribute the books after each cause. There is also an error in the german rulebook regarding the assessment of points (the wrongfully accused also gets +3 points!).

Very interesting party game. The idea is really good, the cases are fun and stupid, everything mandatory for a great night with friends. My biggest concern is about the books that you have to take care of, otherwise the spy is easily recognisable by his booklet.

RATING: 6.5
Ooh. Very small target group for this. You must be very willing to improvise. Probably would make a good filler for acting classes :) 
Strangely enough we felt there was a certain luck factor making your role tougher or more easy to play. Depends on in which order the inspector interrogates the suspects.

Finally got to play this (a 4-player game). It was fun but stressful, partly because I was playing in French which isn't my native language, and trying to sound natural while slipping improbable words into your 'alibi' can be challenging!

I wasn't entirely convinced by the experience at first, but it grew on me the more I thought about it. (A key ingredient is how the scoring system encourages all of the suspects to try to semi-cooperatively fool the inspector.) Like other social-deduction games, your mileage will vary immensely with your gaming partners. The longer we played the more we laughed, but I found it to be relatively cerebral and challenging, so far as party-games go. I suspect the experience would evolve in interesting ways as people became more proficient.

So, overall, not bad at all!

Surprisingly good!
You should go in knowing that this is not a relaxing game, but an interesting one.. the learning curve is quite steep. Since memory is combined with bluffing many considered this to be quite stressful but very enjoyable at the same time.
I would only play one round before guessing though.. so roles change quicker.

Had a blast with this once I manged to get this to the table. The made up stories are just hilarious as everyone is trying to improvise an alibi while trying to fool the inspector.

RATING: 8
Funny mix of storytelling and deduction. One player is the detective investigating a crime and the other players are the suspects. The innoncent suspects have a certain set of words which they have to incorporate in their alibis, the guilty suspect has a different set. The detective has to listen closely and try to find the guilty suspect. There's a scoring system but as in many party games nobody really cares for it.

The party game that you have play  from time to time to have fun and train his language.
It takes attention, imagination, and lots of bagu and a touch of humor.
If I had more time in my day I would like to play it once a month.

L'improvisation est loin d'être mon fort, la différence de niveaux dans ma partie fut bien trop grande : je me suis ennuyé pendant les quelques manches jouées et il ne me tardait qu'une seule chose, que le calvaire finisse.

So funny it's almost guaranteed everyone end up in tears from laughing before the end of a play.
Don't expect strategy or real competitiveness though.

[b]Great story-telling/word game. Produced some of the best laughs I've ever had in a game. Sucks if you are the bad guy and the first one to be interviewed, unless the other players are very experienced and pick up on and use your words. Doesn't matter much, though - it's the funny stories that count, not who wins.
I really need to be in the right mood to play this - being the murderer and having to hide the fact is quite stressful. Only works with people who are both creative story-tellers and don't mind working with a timer.[/b]

This storytelling deduction game is fine party game for up to 7 player. I actually like this game, it is a lot fun and I'm always willing to play. The problem is that this game is great only with the right group or else the game will go flat. If you're not very talkative or spontaneous, pass your way.

Un jeu d’enquête original et marrant comme tout, sauf pour les timides qui souffriront vraiment au moment de donner leur alibi. L'exercice d'expression oral reste difficile.

With the fitting playing group, this one is great fun! I like this so much more than Werewolves.
But never talk people into playing it, if they don't want to by themself. 
This will most likely lead to big disappointments.

With the right group of people this is amazing. However I think not everyone will like it since you must not be afraid of embarrassing yourself when you tell your probably weird alibi. Very communicative, very very funny, I guarantee you will laugh a lot if you give it a real chance and additionally I think it improves ones rhetorical skills.

The rating is so low because this is really not my game. I am not so quick in thinking and talking and not creative enough. But even the others in the round in which I tried it could not play more than two cases (which means that only two players had played the inspector) and then decided to quit. They will play again from time to time but never more than one or two cases. It is interesting if you are a really smart talker, but even then it is almost work.

Leider bisher noch nie die ideale Anzahl an Mitspielern dafür gefunden, und leider auch noch nicht die Gruppe, mit der ich denken dass dieses Spiel funktionieren würde.

Very good "improvisation" game; there are some downsides, namely the murderer book is always the same (a very bad oversight) and the rules could be better implemented. Anyway, if you play it as an activity game is really funny.

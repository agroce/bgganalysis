Not bad really...feels like a boardgame version of Metal Gear Solid. However, the rules are a bit of a mess, and not playing it that frequently causes this relatively simple game to take too long to explain to bring on the table. I have heard that the Bunkersturm expansion makes this really worthwhile, and may change the score based on that.

Should be more popular. One player plays the nazis in a bunker, while 1-3 (or 4 with expansion) players are trying to steal important documents (or rescue a scientist with expansion) as allied agents in 60 (game) minutes. Agents have to try to sneak around or go in guns blazing. Offers both basic game, which is good for learning how it works, and advanced game rules, that offers a lot more depth. Contains a very clever mechanic, where almost every action can be either taken as 100% success by using time or taking a chance with dice and hoping for a success. It's a great game with some very tense moments thanks to the time running out.

Marvellous game. Really manages to capture the atmosphere of films like "Where Eagles Dare". Most sessions are nailbiters to the last minute. The expansions that have come out so far (new troopers, dogs, a new "exfiltrate the scientist" mission) also add a lot of value.

This is a neat game that suffers from being produced by a small company.  The board tiles are excellent as they're made of thick cardboard and match up to other company's standards.  The characters are represented by cheap cardboard standees which do not look great.  The cards are flimsy thin perforated cardboard that are reminiscent of old Avalon Hill games from the 80's.  

The gameplay is pretty solid overall and does require tough tactical decisions.  The game does seem to emulate that Metal Gear Solid feel quite well and this is an achievement.  It does however, offer very little variety in terms of scenarios and can feel a bit samey if you play it multiple times in a short period of time.

This is like a boardgame version of Metal Gear Solid, in which a team of up to 3 players infiltrate a Nazi-controlled bunker, in order to secure valuable intelligence. Each player controls one of three characters, each with his own weapons, equipment, and stats. Players roll against their stats to complete tasks successfully or opt for guaranteed success, at the potential cost of a time penalty. There is a 60-minute faux timer that ends the mission, if it reaches zero. 

All in all, an interesting system, gameplay-wise. There could have been more variety in the characters, but I assume they will address this in the free added content for the game, provided in their magazine, The Killing Time. The artwork is somewhat mediocre, but I'm using the Tannhauser figures, which I like very much. There are quite a few niggling little rules (much of which is covered in their FAQ) and the decision points are somewhat limited, but I do want to play the game some more.

The rules were either too fiddly or not layed out well enough in the rulebook so it was hard to get into this game.  Too many times we had to stop and try to figure out, "So what happens now?".  There may be a great game once you get past that point, but I wasn't feeling it.  Also, seemed like the game is rather boring for the Commander at the beginning of the game with not much to do then at the end he's too powerful with several men with machine guns.

Reminds me of a 1980s Games Workshop game, and I mean that in a good way. There are lots and lots of options and seemingly all of them involve rolling a die. The clock is a clever mechanism and the game seemes well-tested -- in our game the Allied agents escaped with a single tick on the clock, and you can't ask for much better than that. I did experience a bit more rulebook flipping in that first game than I would have liked. The game definitely reads cleaner than it plays. And there are some curious gaps in the play aides (why no character cards for the commander or his guards?). My set has the full kit of painted figures and I'm not sure if I'd like it as much were I playing with the paper components. But it was a game tha delivered entertainment and a narrative and definitely is worth playing again.

This a fantastic game. A great WW2 game with espionage, combat and stealth.

Such a tense game which has an evil little clock counting down the time for the allies to enter, find the items and get out. Easy? No! Everything you do cost time. Open the door? Costs time. Seach the room? Cost time. Fight the Germans? Even fighting costs time. 

As I have said time is everything here. It creats the most tension we as a group has experianced (execpt maybe Fury of Dracula games!) On a few times the allies have escaped the stronghold with only a minute on the clock!

You should try this. However - if you should also buy the 3d Stronghold download which make this game stunning (and more so with painted figs) don't beleive the 10hours build time. It took me over a week to make...

Bought at a UK games expo many years ago, along with the metal minis. Painted but unplayed. The longest held game in my collection to never have had an outing!

Well, the rulebook is pretty pants. (I have read it thru 4 or 5 times over the years) But the game does look real fun. One day.....

Almost an RPG - You are constantly making checks. Can I breach the door? How about evade the guard? Can I react fast enough?

The firing mechanic is neat. You roll your dice for your gun, then subtract enough dice to cover the range. So if you are at 5 range, and you roll a 1,2,4,6 as an agent with 4+ for combat, then instead of getting 2 hits (4, 6), you only get 1, as you have to use one of them to cover the range, as your other 2 dice don't add up to 5 range. In reality, this all happens much fast then it takes to read all this. Roll dice - subtract range - 1 HIT!

The agents sneak around, the commander collects alert tokens from the sentries, and then sends out guards, who try to kill the agents as they steal intelligence cards.

A very interesting system for carrying out stealth operations in a boardgame.  There is a ticking clock (determining when the German reinforcements arrive) and the Allied agents can choose to either take the time to do things right or run the risk of exposure to achieve a hastier result.  (the ticking clock means the game scales well since more agents mean the clock runs faster)  When things go awry, the combat system steps in and speeds the action right along - firearms are fairly dangerous and take little time to resolve.

Unlike most similar games, the German player is cast in the role of an antagonist, rather than as a gamemaster.  To this end, he controls only one figure (the Commander) - the other Germans (sentries and guards) are 'programmed' by the game and are very limited in what they can do.

There are a fair amount of rules, but warmacre has put out some excellent pdf record sheets and between them and the comprehensive manual, you should be able to start playing fairly quickly.

That said, my favorite thing about the package is access to the Bunkerstorm expansion, which is fast moving and very fun.

I admit it is a bit of a dice fest but a fun one. I have played many times and have enjoyed it everytime. Last time intruders got out with one minute to spare, talk about close. The game is pretty well balanced but like every game with dice you can get pretty frustrated when they don't go your way.

[OLD VERSION]
A WWII tactical game between a defender and one or more assaulters. Assaulters attempt to complete their mission within an hour and in secrecy as long as possible. The theme is reminiscent of so many movies where the heroes sneak around a base and try to dispose of guards quickly and quietly.

The game system is very unique, players choose whether to 'take time' to guarantee success on their check rolls, or make the rolls and hope for the best. It also scales very easily (no need for different set-ups for different number of players). Combat, in particular, was handled very elegantly in my opinion.

The bad: the rules are overwhelming (two different sets) and sometimes fiddly, and its hard to keep track of things since no player aid was provided. Movement was a little static since all figures moved the same number of spaces, you never seemed to be able to outrun or catch someone.

Most importantly though, the shift in balance always seemed to be unequal (at the start, the defender would be frustrated at how hard it is to alert the base, at the end, the assaulters are almost outnumbered by 3 or 4 times). The period of time where the balance could swing either way was too short and cuts short the tension by quite a bit.

Overall though, we all enjoyed the different missions quite a bit. I look forward to playing the newer version to see how much the rules have been improved or changed.

[NEW VERSION - Significant rules changes]
A little better and cleaner than the original, the biggest disappointment was that there is only 1 mission/scenario - and it isn't even thematic, its set-collecting. The new game is easier to teach and plays faster but I thought was a bit boring because all the rooms are the same (whereas the old version had different rooms each with unique abilities).

Neat Premise. Very thematic. The rulebook is not very organized and the game system is very clunky. The rules try to create some sort of abstract balance but fails and also gets lost in too much dice randomization. 

The components are a mixed bag. The perforated doors and other tokens are much too thin. The plastic bases aren't sized very well. The room tiles are lovely. Player Aids are necessary.

With a heavily rewritten rule system I could see this being a great game, but it would not be the one that ships with the box.

I am so glad I stumbled upon this treasure!  This is the closest I have found to a PC game (e.g. Full Metal Gear) accurated translated to a board game.

Up to three allied commandos try to break in and out of a German fortress without running into the Nazis.  You can play in "sneak" mode, "assault" mode, or a combination of the two.

Every game we've played has come down to a nail-biting finale.  Incredible theme and feeling that "you are there."

The rules are a bit complex -- especially involving the difference between ranged and melee combat -- and will take a couple of plays to internalize.  But worth it.

Just awesome!! This game deserves a perfect 10! Great mechanics, highly intelligent rules and an authentic WW2 atmosphere make you want to play again and again.

Sometimes a publisher can get lucky with a game. I don't think there was a lot of development that occurred with this game, but somehow it all seemed to work and come together. I seriously doubt this would hold up to repeat plays, but the first play was surprisingly promising.

This Game feels like a prototype with it's low quality Box, components and a crazy thick rule book. But a great little game that has been re-implemented in Spy or die trying with a change of theme and relatively better quality components.  Amazing game play. Rulebook is thick but actually rules aren't that complicated. Think Metal gear solid sneaky sneak and your part way there.

Tired of the same old shoot-em-up stuff? Try Hour of Glory - players have to get into and out of a heavily guarded stronghold within 60 mins (the "Hour" of glory). Stealth and cunning are just as important and shooting and fighting (maybe more so!) Every game I've played has come down to the last few minutes on the clock. This game rocks.While the game can be played with the paper counters enclosed, it really comes to life with the figures specifically designed for the game. They paint up quickly and add real life to the game. Highly recommended.

Admittedly I don't have a lot of experience playing wargames, but I really enjoy playing this solitaire (for lack of opponents).  There is a lot of depth to the game, it plays well solitaire, and the mechanics provide a fun simulation of the conflict.  It can be a little long and fiddly, but this can be mitigated by choosing a shorter scenario.

Engrossing depiction of air raids "downtown" (Hanoi area) in Vietnam. If you have the slightest interest in jet-era air combat buy it! The attention to detail and support for this game are second to none, and the complex rules can be absorbed in reasonable bites by following the suggested sequence of starter scenarios. An added bonus is the sense of historical development of measure and countermeasure that arises from playing scenarios in roughly historical sequence.

This is very much what I consider a heavy duty wargame. Playing the intro game with about two counters each took us over an hour, with lots of rules to figure out. Still, it is exciting and I think we will get faster at it with practice.

RATING: 7
UPDATE: Having now played this a fair amount, I enjoy it, but my excitement for the game (which started off high for the first few plays) is softening faster than I would have hoped - especially in light of the high start-up costs. Maybe that's just a side-effect of being late to the party; I didn't start serious playing Downtown until this year (2006). Regardless, I just find I have trouble figuring out where the game is in Downtown. You learn the tactics associated with the various planes and configurations, and you do lots of stuff. But is it a game, or is it a puzzle of figuring out which tools to use for which tasks, or is it more narrative generator than game? I think it *is* mostly a game, but not really one I find interesting enough to justify the high complexity and non-trivial playing time.

All this said I still like it enough - the historical flavor is wonderful, and the process of solving the tactical puzzles is interesting - and I will continue to play for a while. But I'm just not sure that Downtown is a long-term keeper.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A playable operational air system, with chit pull for initiative to shake up the turn order.

There's a fair bit to do before the counters even hit the board - in fact a good part of the 'game' for both sides is looking at defensive set-up and attack plans. The plotted flight path for the strike mission is excellent as it commits the attacker to their operational plan.

Quite a lot of dice rolling - rolling each turn to detect and then undetect flights is a bit wearying - but the flying itself is a doddle. Generally smooth, intuitive and easy to play.

Initial play of the intro scenario is very promising. Looks a lot more complicated than it need be in practice, mainly because there are so many options on the US side. Many of the early scenarios eschew significant parts of the rulebook, allowing you to adopt what amounts to a programmed instruction learning process.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Interesting subject despite me not knowing much about the air campaign in the north.

Planning missions as the US is fun and are tense as you execute them.  The DRV has to set up traps, and decide how to spread their defenses about to cover all their bases.

The solo rules work not badly at all, but it's really meant for 2 players.

This is a very good simulation with some well written rules. The problem is that good simulations don't always turn out to be good games and this is one of those times. The playing time can get pretty bogged down if the US walks into a SAM nest and/or some Migs show up, with all the cross referencing and die rolling going on. Plus, it's just not that interesting for the DRV player, and a good set of solitaire rules would be a welcome addition.

Final verdict: hardcore grognards only.

Very interesting game that gives a fresh approach to wargaming. There's a good feel of the cat-and-mouse dynamics between the US attacker and DRV defender. The planning stage is fun in trying to figure what's the best way to tackle the problem and also trying to get into the head of your opponent. 

Two things to note though. This is a long game but the pacing is bit off. There are lull periods where you're just either waiting for the US planes or the US player is just pushing counters across the board. Players should exercise judgement to get the game going to the exciting bits.

RATING: 9
Until this title, there was only one other game that covered this topic as a roughly similar scale, 3G's ROLLING THUNDER.  DOWNTOWN is far and away the best simulation of the subject and is a very fun game to boot.  This is the scale that most air warfare board games should aim--decision cycles are one-minute turns and the battles simulate single missions involving "packages" of raiding and supporting aircraft versus a defender.  U.S. Raid force players must properly plan their missions and adapt with suppleness when assumptions made in planning don't pan out during execution.  The DRV defender's job of gumming up raid execution to the point of mission failure is a challenge and a fun one at that.  Best of all, the spread of scenarios let you see how technology changed over the years, changing how air campaigns were waged, and the different developments between the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force methods.

As a military aircraft and history fanatic, Downtown is a must-have.  However, Downtown is far more of a simulation/narrative generator than a game.

It takes significant time to play (way longer than you might think), and several plays to understand good and bad moves.  A simple mission to Kep, for example, took 34 turns, including taking flights off the map that were not in danger, avoiding dummy mind-games late in the game, and not doing a CSAR mission.  In practice, 34 turns takes at least 8-9 hours, but you can add on several more hours for the action-packed turns and the pre-planning.

After many plays, my rating has dropped down to '6', and that is being somewhat charitable.  The victory conditions are just brutal on the US; you don't have nearly enough SEAD flights to make a significant dent in the NVA defences, so you are just hoping for luck to avoid losing the 1-2 planes that will doom you.  In the end, you make a damage die roll that wins or loses the game.  I get that historically Rolling Thunder was an exercise in futility, but the victory points in a game do not need to reflect that reality.

There is also a critical problem of the NVA player doing all-or-nothing/no tomorrow defence plans.  There needs to be far more restrictions on where things can be setup, and how many missiles they might fire at a single flight (e.g. the recon flight that wins or loses the scenario).

Note that this rating is based purely on Downtown as a game, not on my opinions of the designer's antics on BGG.

A beautifully crafted game telling a unique story of the Vietnam Air War. It does an remarkable job of evenly representing the strengths and weaknesses of the three air services in play. This differs from many previous representations, which tend to have an American viewpoint. (Of course, it is only very recently that information from the Vietnamese side became available).

The production value of the game is simply superb, with outstanding map and counter work. Also, the story told on the interior box edge is very cool.

One other neat touch. The game name derives from the period hit song by Petulla Clark, which became a moniker for flying over high danger areas like Hanoi and Haiphong. Each of the scenarios is also named for another period song.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game has great topic appeal among aviation fans and vietnam era fans.  I was one of the playtesters and a minor collaborator on the design.  A few things should be mentioned.

It succeeds where "Rolling thunder" an older design failed miserably.  It abstracts flying and combat and concentrates on the mission aspect and targeting aspect.  With the NVA side having hidden units, but not knowing the target of the day, the excitement, both pregame and endgame stays high.

Counters are moved hex-to-hex at speeds of 3 to 6, and since flying the planes is not part of the game, the design has tremendous potential to attract the cross-over gamers, those who like land games more than air games because it feels like a typical land game as you interact moving counters to and fro.  If you have any interest in the historical aspect of the air war in Vietnam, this will be a must have.

Believe me, if anyone knows air games, I do.  I don't give it an 8 or higher since I feel a hair too much of the flying and combat rules were overly-simplified, but it is still a good looking and highly playable game. Plus...it provides suspense and unpredictability thus having good replay value.

This is an excellent game that makes you feel like you are really there directing or defending against a highly integrated air mission.  The graphics and systems work very well and provide a nice narrative. The programmed instruction approach is greatly appreciated and makes the game much more accessible than it might otherwise be.  I also love the wealth of historic information provided.

The only flaw of this game is that the SAM system can get tedious when there are 20  SAM battalions on the board.  A lot of dice get rolled with not much effect.  But for this flaw, I would rate this game a 10 rather than a 9.

As an interesting aside, I originally had little interest in this game due to its subject matter and only purchased it as part of ordering The Burning Blue.  The funny thing is that afer opening both games, it is Downtown that grabbed my attention rather than The Burning Blue.  I suspect the graphics of the carriers on the USN Aircraft sheet helped trigger my interest since it brought back nostalgic memories of the Revell and Monogram platic model kits of Essex, Kitty Hawk and Nimitz class carriers that I built as a kid.  I finally get to see what all those little plastic airplanes did for a living.

Finally bought a mint copy off eBay since a reprint, while mentioned, seems far off. Unfortunately, there's a lot of C3i price gouging so it's doubtful I'll get a hold of those components outside of the aforementioned reprint or VASSAL.

This is a more simple than EV (not a bad thing) but the map could definitely have been printed on better paper. It had a corner crease hole fresh out of a shrink wrapped box! It is just one map though so space is less of an issue. The rulebook is super flavorful and well-written. It's doubtful anyone would complain about a lack of complexity and the counter load is pretty heavy. Air-to-air combat is exhaustive and expect to miss steps your first few goes. Exceptions aren't overwhelming but the paperwork can take as long as the actual missions for a newbie. It's quite a lot for a single brain and not exactly solo material but the density of the material provides a decent amount of immersion and historical simulation.

The more I play it, the more I enjoy it.

My first wargame, and I find it utterly perfect.  Great choice of subject material and scale.  The rules are a model of clarity and interesting to read in their own right.  The game graphics are great and although there are only 16 scenarios, each contains so many variations that in reality each could be played multiple times for very different gaming experiences.  My only slight disappointment was with the misprinted counters and map; I've since replaced them with the errata counters from C3i #17 and #18, but that was quite expensive.  I've not played face-to-face, and think to do so may take too long, but I have found VASSAL to be an ideal way to play, either PBEM or realtime.  The game requires critical decision making from beginning to end and provides more tension than I thought ever possible from paper and cardboard.  I need more of this kind of game.

See my review for more comments.

RATING: 5
I'm ambivalent.  It manages to compress a great deal of detail and allows you to experience a revolution in tactics and technology before your eyes - it's about as immersive a design as you can get.  On the other hand, it is a game where you can do everything right and get (badly) screwed by the dice and that part turns me off.  For example, the US player may pound the heck out of a target (attaining the maximum damage level), but only find out after the game that he slightly damaged it - that's a defeat even if he did all the right things.  Or a couple lucky flak rolls might drop some US aircraft and leave the American player with no chance of winning - I think this is more of a turn off here than in other games because there's such a design emphasis on careful planning and deliberate play.  I would also quibble with some of the game mechanics - there are moments when the illusion of simulation breaks down (such as the various tricks that can be done with the NVA dummies).  Ultimately then, Downtown is a hard game for me to rate as I like some parts a lot and wince at others.

Downtown is a genuinely exceptional game. It combines rich and painstaking historical detail with elegant, often innovative mechanics to capture the reality of its long-neglected subject in a system that is a genuine blast to play. The feel of the game is in many ways reminsicent of tactical combined arms land warfare, and should appeal to a wide variety of land- and naval-oriented wargamers in addition to the traditional air combat gaming community.  Complexity is fairly high, but not as daunting as a first glance at the rules tends to suggest, since the early war scenarios occur before many of the technological complications like SAMs entered the fray.  Wrapped in a gorgeous art and production job, this deserves to be an enduring classic (and I'll be surprised if it doesn't win a bunch of awards).

Love all the hardware. Just played the basic scenarios so far. An interesting game of trying to outguess your opponents intentions. 

Too many turn steps and chart referencing to feel at ease with the system yet. Perhaps a bit too fiddly with a lot of steps for combat. Why two die rolls for SAM combat etc ala RPG style saving roll? It's like the designer was designing a computer program flow and forgot that it was people that were going to manually do all these steps.

Fascinating topic.

Finally broke down and bought it even though it probably wont see a lot of table time, who knows though.

My initial reading of the rules  has left me feeling that the game is not too complex. Mostly it seems that the execution of the various parts of the USAF/USN Raid just require lots of (easy) steps. Most everything in the game is revolved via 2d10 utilizing various DRMs. 

Initial placement of air defense seems crucial for the DRV, though it's their turf and they only have to stop the bombs from dropping. Likewise planning what aircraft to use, what weapons they will carry, and what route the bombers will take seems to be the most important aspect of being the US player.

Of course good tactical play appears to be rewarded as well. 

The programmed instruction in the Scenario Book is definitely the way to learn the game. The rules are presented in such a manner that you gradualy learn more.

The components are nice, and the map is fairly large. My only complaint is that GMT only included 3 planning sheets. They could have at least included enough to have a seperate sheet for each scenario. Oh well...good thing I have access to a decent copier - and the .pdf's of the planning sheets are available online (with permission to reproduce!).

Good stuff here. So well researched, and even a list of songs to listen to while you play.

Similar to "RAF" (West End) game whereas in here you control the US Air Force carrying out the air raid campaigns against ground targets of the Vietcong. It looks like a serious air raids simulation.  The heavyweight of the game also added a sense of "something-must-be-inside" to the game.  The complexity level, however, is higher than the current trend of wargame publications. The very high rating received for such a complicated game is really a mystery to me.

Excellent game. Very interesting setting and the raid-scale is well suited to the subject. Lots of variation in the scenarios. Smooth game mechanisms, but for some reason I always have to look up something on the other side of the reference sheet.

The counters and map are astonishingly pretty, and the whole game has a very high production standard. 

The one detail that bugs me is the lack of force on force engagements. I would have liked to play missions where both sides had substantial forces, such as a sweep vs. sweep scenario, but then that was not what happened over North Vietnam, with its highly asymmetrical warfare

I guess I really wanted something like Zulu Alert in the same format as Downtown, but in the meantime this is great! - and now that is becoming a reality with Red Storm, which in in the P500 on GMT!

Unique game that captures its topic like no other. Despite the abstractions, game play is very tense through fog of war and the combat outcomes are always evocative and sometimes hilarious as one imagines the pilots struggling with situation awareness. Marvelous game, great graphics.

Minor detraction: It's not a fast game, if you do the big strike packages (and who doesn't want to) this will take a fair bit of time.  Also, you have to dissociate yourself from the perspective of being in a particular cockpit or it will be too harrowing. A breakthrough experience.

This was a very solid design.  While toting a theme I am not extremely familiar with (and sort of replicated in The Burning Blue, a more familiar war), the production value, ability to experiment tactically, and the overall suspense during the raids make this an A  effort.  The language in the rulebook is easily understood but not without a small learning curve.

Excellent operational level game about air combat over Vietnam.  There is a bit of a learning curve and games will take several hours, possibly over two sessions, but it is a rewarding experience.  Lots of scenarios and many with multiple objectives, so there is high replay value.

No rating yet as I've still only played the simpler scenarios: no SAMs, Jamming, etc. I agree with everything people have said about the immersive qualities of the system, and I suspect that just intensifies in the later scenarios, when the DRV doesn't know the target of the US raids and the Americans have an increasingly dense and sophisticated strike package to command. Peter B. is right in his comments hereabouts that the contrast between all the careful planning and a handful of key die rolls can be jarring at times. No doubt such frustration was the nature of the air campaign. I appreciate how hard it is to score kills--one thing the game definitely does *not* do is inflate results. Some of the really low-level tactical stuff feels a bit fiddly at this scale, such as the DRV player micromanaging his AAA network, or either player counting up movement points to get an interception just right. That said, this is a gamer's game that has earned its following for a long time to come. Kind of weird then to see GMT dumping the stock in their last couple of firesales.

Difficult to learn, but, really not so hard to remember the rules once you've learned them. Have someone show you how to play and save yourself many hours. It is quite a bit of work to play.  Haven't seen a "campaign" played, it sounds interesting.  More interesting to play scenario's that have more MiG's in the air.

RATING: 7
Detailed, complex. I like it. Downtown is at least as much simulation as game, something which should be understood before attempting to play it casually. It is demanding, but it returns a much deeper understanding of the operational environment of the air war over North Vietnam than would a lighter game "designed for effect." That said, I'd love to see a game at the next level up, which would lose detail at the mission/flight level in favor of examining prosecution of the air war at the squadron level over the course of the war.

RATING: 8
Outstanding game, easy to play and very fun (can play a scenario or mission in one sitting of a few hours).  The campaign game is also good, almost finished the first campaign game, and it's tough going for the US (as it should be).  Recommended.

RATING: 2
Well, I've read all the comments, and come to a conclusion: it is not just me! Something is wrong with this game.

Now, I'm going to be somewhat less charitable than the other detractors, mostly because I suggested my best friend buy this game (he is an air game fanatic, any type, and the initial reviews of this game were so favorable.) I cost someone else money, so I feel doubly critical.

OK, is there a game in this box? It seems like the players plan out a game, push the figurative start button, shift a column here or there, roll some dice, and check for bombing accuracy, and voila: game over? It doesn't surprise me that the designer also makes computer games. It seems he is hung up on creating a "narrative" for the game, the cost being woefully reduced game and player interaction.

That said, it is truly an impressive package. The designer seems to know his subject matter exceedingly well. Unfortunately, he couldn't turn all this into a dynamic game (say like Dean Essig does, man, everything he designs in ultimately playable.) This game is more of a talking book.

RATING: 9
What a masterpiece! This one of the best design of the last years, not to mention one of the most innovative system ever released. It has a steep learning curve for sure, but the difficulties to grasp the system are more related to the fact that it is a very unique design than to it's real complexity... and when you get all under the hood, it plays smoothly and quite fast too. It also add a great VASSAL module too, which I still have to try, that looks really promising. If you have any interest in air war, and expecially in low tech air war, it is a dream come true, and if you are a serious wargamer you owe yourself to try this one.

My rating is in response to the Solo rules. This game is fantastic, the rules make sense (once you sit down and start paying, at least) and game play is smooth and engaging.

I was really eager to play this. After scenario D1 it all felt pointless. It must be because of the scenario but I see little good in this game.

There are lots of options and different ways to victory in this game but playing the DRV meant almost as playing an AI. No thrill at all.
With US it might be fun to plan the raid and assign all the tasks and stuff. Perhaps somebody enjoys playing DRV, good for him.

The luck seems to be pushed in a way too big role in this. Most of the time you end up trying to achieve ridiculously high rolls. Especially SAM-activity is stupid: SAM rolls to hit (with a really high target number) and the target plane also rolls. A luck hit with SAM-player can be missed even if the target plane rolls rather low. 
I just don't get it...

Too bad that this didn't turn up to be better than this. I really hoped for more. I'll try again someday.

As pointed out by other respondents, Downtown provides unique coverage of ill-understood conflict. This game shows the quality of the Vietnamese defensive forces which accorded themselves quite well against the powerful American air services. It also shows the technical and training improvements taking place in the American forces. The game covers the Rolling Thunder campaigns of the late sixties and the Linebacker campaigns of the early seventies. It is focused on the bombing campaign over the heavily defended north of North Vietnam.

The coverage is tactical with each counter representing a flight of aircraft. A flight is typically two or four aircraft. Aircraft are flown at an coarse level, so you track altitude and heading, but not much more. No need to learn about dogfighting, loops and rolls. Downtown is playable by the average wargamer and does not require any special "aircraft" knowledge.

I've spoken with a few folks mistakenly believing Downtown is an operational scale game. This game doesn't really deal with tasking and resources I would expect from an operational game. You don't even deal with air-to-air refueling. The only off-board resource you think about are jamming resources (EA-6's, EF-10's ad EA-1's), which actually setup at the edge of the game board.

An additional recommendation. Check out Marshall Michel's books on the Air War over Vietnam: "Clashes" and "Eleven Days of Christmas". Not to be missed.

Downtown is a truly unique game covering an ill understood conflict at a scale that has not been approached before. It is a very strong offering. The rule writing is strong and the graphical presentation is first rate. If you have interest in this conflict, I wholly recommend Downtown.

Very detailed simulation and very tense. Good solo rules.
Suffers a bit from counter clutter. 
Rules very well written, but so many of them !

Even with the clear rules, too much for one person to keep straight. The solo rules are great, but wish I could play face to face.

Now have almost mastered the rules and play the non solitaire version by myself. Very enjoyable and extremely well executed game.

Wow!  This is the perfect example of how to make a game.  Everything about it is great.  The components are high physical quality, very pleasing to the eye, and extremely functional.  The rules are complex, but the rule book is unbelievably well written so it is not hard at all to get into the game.  It appears as though the game was play tested to the extreme, as everything is so thoroughly worked out.  The designer loves his work and must be a perfectionist to so thourghly take care of all aspects of everything.  He even has a web site up with loads of historical info, Q&A, downloads for play aids, solitare rules, Cyberboard and Vassel modules for the game, PBEM turorials, etc.  The game plays great and gives a great feel for the subject.  IMO, this is the best written rule book I have ever read.  It is very hard not to give this game a 10.

Seems like a good game, but I only played the beginner scenario.

Ok, now I have played D2.  I am quite annoyed at this game.  It has been downgraded.  I will give it another chance Potter.  But I just did not enjoy the THREE rolls to win the game.  Or so I thought.  Potter tells me I need to be more sneaky as the DMV.  I think I did adequately but the rolls were not in my favor.  It seems to be a game where engaging is just too damning!  Well, I will give it another try.

Great air game!  Operational air scale is rarely done, but DOWNTOWN is THE model.
Each scenario is one "raid."  Some complain that you really don't get to plan too much.  Being a Navy guy and having done time in a carrier air wing I can tell you it closely approximates what a typical "strike team" has to deal with; i.e. you get a target, look at the intel, plan your attack (maybe an Alpha strike, maybe less), and you fly.
This game is quickly becoming a favorite.

I was very enthused playing this game the first few times, but then things really faded fast the deeper down we got because the payoff just wasn't there. Feels like a computer game force-fed into a box.

This is the kind of game I would have loved 15 years ago. It's extremely well made, and this is an unusual game. I'd call it an operational air combat game. You plan and execute air missions on a whole theater of operations on short scale of time. But now I found it too hard to learn alone. If I'd have another player who enjoys the topic I'd surely have given it a try.

May be I'm missing something but there are so many good games and so few time...

EDIT November 2009 : I finally give it another chance, the topic is too interesting for me. I bought a C3i that adds F-14, I couldn't simply resist. ;o)

EDIT August 2010 : Finally traded it again. Really too much to learn for me. Nevertheless if you like the topic give it a try.

A very good game that I didn't like on my initial playing As I felt it was too asymmetric with little for the NVA player to do and the NVA airforce plays a relatively minor role leading to very few dogfights. Subsequent playings changed that view completely. This game is absolute gem. One of my favourite air war games. Plays extremely well via VASSAL. A very engrossing historical simulation that includes the right level of chrome for historic immersion in the subject.

This is the game that my wargaming only friends (who don't read BGG) like so much they made a giant sized custom board to play with. I won't rate this as it's more sim than game.  As a game there are hundreds of die rolls that the game theorist in me wonders if they couldn't be better consolidated to produce as wide a range of results with less rolling.  As a simulation each and every one of those die rolls meant life or death for some pilot or person on the ground and the heaviness and weight of what they represent comes through with a passion.  Overall a very mixed feeling for me being painful yet so full of passion. Every gamer no mater what their slant owes it to themselves to try this game and understand its motives.

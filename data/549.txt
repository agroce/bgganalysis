RATING: 9
playing in a large group with all the great models was a great experience! everything you'd want from a WWI dogfight game and nothing else, just boiled down goodness. maaaaaaybe it'd be nice if there was a chance to hit or not, but that could be frustrating since you have to 'progam' in your shots. meh, what do i know. i'm dying to play this again and feel my rating may even go up after i get a few more chances with this one.

Played at a lot of Cons in the area, with stats accumulated and medals earned.  Quick and fun, but not terribly deep game.

A simplified Canvas Eagles.  Play that (or Blue Max) instead.

The plotting movements is fun, but plotting fire isn't.  I usually just tend to spin in  a circle hosing off all my ammo then fly off the board.

I played the 1/72mm Aerodrome 1.1 easy rules. Basically the game is aerial battle with careful maneuvering. Altitude, deflection, distance and short or long bursts determine the damage dealt. The scoring system awards hits, but getting the kill is what earns the pilot points to win the game. It's easy to learn and great for a big group to play as teams. The trick is in manuevering. Just like how Roborally requires you to program 5 turns in advance, you need to give three turns of orders to your planes while anticipating where the enemy aircraft will be. 

Advanced rules have night vision - you can hit friendlies, some terrain obstacles, and more. Check out www.aerodrome1online.com\board to see the game and play it online.

I have started collecting plastic models and am now feeling I may have started another hobby.  I'll have to think about this.

This has been a great game to get non-gamers interested in gaming. The wooden cockpits and miniatures draw people in visually and it is simple enough for almost anyone to learn quickly. That is also the drawback in that it sometimes seems too simple, so my group switches back and forth with Canvas Eagles/Blue Max when we want more complexity.

A game with very subtle strategies and skills.  Really feels like WWI flying combat.  Very expensive to own though.

I thought this game had about much in common with WWI air combat does chess with ancient warfare.

I first discovered this title at Origins Game Fair. I really took an interest to the game mechanics and was impressed by the following it had. I'd recommend this title to anyone interested in 1/72 scale model building. This title completely replaced Dawn Patrol and Wings of War for me.

I have played this several times at a convention, and it is a very simple fast playing and fun game.  It is roughly equivalent to Wings of War in terms of game play, and only slightly more complex.  One advantage is that it includes some good stuff not included in Wings of War like altitude effects, deflection, limited ammunition, and more, without being much more complex.

This is a very good example of an airplane miniature game. Simplistic, easy to understand rules with some nice chrome.

The game I've played the most face-to-face.  I fell in with a group that played monthly; I just happened to be at the game store when they were playing and it looked so cool.  Ended up playing with them for nearly a year, but then I moved away, so I have a few plane models and rulebook just lying around now.

It really is a fun game, and it works really well for the subject matter.  Cannot recommend highly enough.  Only drawbacks are the HUGE table and map needed, and that it can only be played head-to-head, and really needs eight or more to put its excellence on display.

Aerodrome is great fun at cons and the small set brings the fun home. Expensive but a real eye-catcher and as much realism as you want.

Complete 1/144 (WoW minis) Set. (Six planes; DVII, DR1 Albatrao DIII; Camel, Snipe, Spad XIII

Best played with several players.

Stan Kubiak has done a great job of making a very playable WWI Air Combat game. Loads of fun and always a great game at the cons.

RATING: 5
Visibly stunning (if done correctly).  My gaming experiences were less than stellar.  And the calculated damage results, i.e. minimal to non-existent randomness is S.T.U.P.I.D.  I also wish the system allowed for more scaled variance between the fighter stats, but I do realize that would take away from the ease of play.

Great game for conventions with teams, otherwise I would suggest wings of war for smaller settings

I play this game every year at Origins and PentaCon, and run it (in 1/144) at FlatCon and starting in 2017, AdeptiCon.  Easy to learn, easy to play, EXPENSIVE to own make it the perfect convention game.  This will always be one of my favorites.

A great WW I air combat miniature game to become an Ace. I like playing this game at conventions where pilot stats are kept for the individual players to improve in kills to become a Knight of the Air.

Have been playing this at cons for three years now!  Lots of fun and I like that the Great Lakes chapter keeps running stats.  Got my 10 year old interested and he's doing even better than me at the game.

The thrill of "hunting in packs" for other elusive birds of prey, as you watch the aerial circus unfold in front of your eyes.  Thrilling, agaonizing, yet vitally fun, screaming through clouds to burst out, machine guns blazing as you send your opponents to a glorious blaze, in order to control the skies.  

Good-good fun.

I worked on the game development. I enjoy highly the combination of deck building (with different combos for each hero) and cooperative adventure game play. It is a first for me, that the cooperative game can be so hard and engaging at the same time. Mistfall provides me with excellent gaming experience!

Very interesting game, and it captured the feel of an MMO for me.  The first play is rough, due to all the icons and terms and moving parts, but I'd gladly play again.

I definitely noticed the MMO archetypes present, with tanks and healers and dps, but that may have been due to me playing the archer, who gains a bonus if no enemies are focusing on him.

RATING: 9
An excellent system, like a more puzzly Lord of the Rings LCG, and themed beautifully.  My only major question is about in-game balance: it's all exciting at the start, but by the time each quest ends, the boss fight is a quick and underwhelming affair.  Perhaps a slightly different quest structure (less linear?) might work better in the expansion.

RATING: 6.5
Update - Once I played once or twice with each character it got a little boring. Also I think Warhammer Quest Card Game (unsupported though it is) is superior. Some good ideas here though. 

(Retail edition) Base game is a little too easy once I figured it out. Switching to advanced mode changed that up drastically and suddenly I am on the edge of my seat every encounter.
The priest is way overpowered in kind of boring ways.

I wanted to love the game so much, but in the end it fell flat. On the positive side we have great artwork, nice back story and a nice basic mechanism for the hand management. On the negative end we have (unnecessary) complicated rules, a terrible rule book and the game is just unfair. Even if you play the introductory chapter you simply cannot win solo with certain characters if you have bad luck with the time cards. The time card mechanism is on of the main problems for me. I wanted an alternative for LOTR LCG, since I don't like to buy a ton of adventure packs. So I thought this game might give a similar solo experience without the deckbuilding aspect of the LCG. However LOTR LCG plays so much more smoothly, while having the same complexity.

Το Mistfall είναι ένα συνεργατικό card game στο χνάρια του Lord of The Rings LCG από το οποίο δανείζεται κάποιους βασικούς μηχανισμούς όπως πχ το να βγαίνουν οι εχθροί σε ένα κεντρικό σημείο και μετά να μοιράζονται στους παίκτες με βάση το Threat level του κάθε ήρωα. Μπορεί ένα παιχνίδι από μια μικρή πολωνική εταιρία να κοιτάξει στα μάτια το LotR? :what:

Αλλά ας πάρουμε τα πράγματα από την αρχή. Το Mistfall περιέχει διάφορα σενάρια με το κάθε σενάριο να περιέχει κάποιους ειδικούς κανόνες, εχθρούς και στήσιμο στο χάρτη. Όταν λέω χάρτη εννοώ ένα συνήθως 3χ3 τετράγωνο που φτιάχνουμε με τυχαία location tiles. Να σημειώσω πως κυκλοφορεί και ένα μινι-expansion που δίνει την δυνατότητα να παίξεις το παιχνίδι σε μορφή campaign. Δεν το έχω δοκιμάσει αλλά ακούγεται καλή φάση. :)

Διαλέγουμε λοιπόν όλοι από ένα ήρωα και ξεκινάμε. Όλοι οι ήρωες έχουν μια αρχική τράπουλα και κάποιες ειδικές ικανότητες στο ταμπλό τους ενώ έχουν φυσικά και έξτρα κάρτες που μπορείς να αγοράσεις κατά την διάρκεια του παιχνιδιού ξοδεύοντας πόντους εμπειρίας τους οποίους μαζεύουμε μαζί σαν ομάδα. Προφανώς και ο κάθε ήρωας έχει διαφορετικό στυλ παιχνιδιού. 

Οι κάρτες έχουν μπόλικο κείμενο και αρκετά σύμβολα πάνω τους αλλά η λειτουργία τους είναι σαφής. Απλά δε μου άρεσε που χρησιμοποιούν όλες οι κάρτες του κάθε ήρωα το ίδιο artwork του ήρωα. Βάλτε μια άλλη πόζα ρε παιδιά. :yuk: Το artwork γενικά είναι όμορφο, απλά χρησιμοποιείται συχνά το ίδιο, ενώ υπάρχουν και πολλές κάρτες χωρίς καθόλου. Επίσης το rulebook είχε κάποια κενά στους κανόνες (ευτυχώς υπάρχουν τα forum στο BGG) και κάποιες κάρτες έχουν φάει ήδη errata. Κλασσικά προβλήματα πολλών kickstarter (και όχι μόνο)  παιχνιδιών. :shake:

Στα θετικά του παιχνιδιού να βάλω το γρήγορο στήσιμο, ενδιαφέρον σύστημα μάχης, μεγάλη διαφορετικότητα μεταξύ των ηρώων, δυνατότητα για campaign play, ωραίο σύστημα level up όπου ανάλογα με την περίσταση κοιτάς ποια κάρτα/ικανότητα χρειάζεσαι και την αγοράζεις με XP παίρνοντας την αμέσως στο χέρι σου. Βασικά, αυτό ακριβώς το deck building on the fly είναι το καλύτερο χαρακτηριστικό του παιχνιδιού. Εκεί βγαίνει η συνεργασία των παικτών, συζητάμε τι μπορούμε να κάνουμε για να αντιμετωπίσουμε τους εχθρούς και ο καθένας προτείνει τι μπορεί να αγοράσει με τα κοινά μας XP. :) Παικτικά τον μηχανισμό αυτόν, τον βρήκα καλύτερο από το να έχεις φτιάξει μια τράπουλα πριν το παιχνίδι και να παρακαλάς να σου έρθουν οι σωστές κάρτες. 

Συγκρίνοντας το με το LotR LCG πρέπει να πω πως χάνει σε θεματικότητα κυρίως στο τομέα των events γιατί στο Mistfall χρησιμοποιούμε ένα γενικό event deck  κοινό για όλα τα σενάρια σε αντίθεση με το LotR όπου κάθε πίστα έχει τα δικά της ειδικά φτιαγμένα για την περίσταση. Επίσης έχω την εντύπωση πως το Mistfall δεν έχει μεγάλο replayability καθώς αργά ή γρήγορα θα μάθεις τους συνδυασμούς καρτών των ηρώων και μετά δεν έχει κάτι καινούργιο να προσφέρει. :( Το  LotR έχει περισσότερο replayability από το βασικό του κουτί κιόλας, και μόνο που μπορείς να δοκιμάσεις διχρωμίες και τριχρωμίες φτάνει. Δεν μιλάω για τα άπειρα expansions, εκεί χάνει η μάνα το παιδί και το παιδί την μάνα.   

Αξιόλογο παιχνίδι με ωραίο και ενδιαφέρον gameplay. Κάποια παράπονα για το επίπεδο παραγωγής είναι πάντα αναμενόμενα σε kickstarter παιχνίδι.

The game has potential but the rules are incredibly hard to follow.  So far this game is just making me feel stupid and confused.  After about 4 hours I got to the boss (the 3rd location tile!), I think I have an idea of what I'm doing but it's hard work and I'm not able to take in the theme, I feel like I'm just slogging through the rounds like a check list.

Un poco farragoso inicialmente. Cuando le pillas el truco es un juego bastante entretenido. Es importante jugar con 3 o más jugadores ya que es cuando las mecánicas empiezan a lucir y muchas cartas y clases de personaje empiezan a cobrar sentido (y a ganar utilidad).

Aunque se puede jugar en solitario yo no lo recomendaría. De hecho a dos o menos jugadores se hace algo aburrido ya que la interacción entre jugadores se vuelve muy limitada (o nula) y se pierde parte de la gracia del juego.

I really, really wanted to love Mistfall. The artwork is gorgeous, I love co-op games, and the campaigns seemed promising. But the cards are a a confusing, unattractive, bogged-down mess. I find the information so hard to parse that the game feels like work without much of a reward. 

If only they streamlined the card text/symbols to make gameplay more intuitive, this could possibly be a great game. As it is, I have to force myself to play it. It makes me wonder whether they play-tested this at all. Sad.

Wow!!! This is greatness in a box. Imaging the love child of the LOTR Living Card Game and Mage Knight. Like those 2 games? If yes, then GET THIS!!!! The characters feel incredibly different but all are very powerful. The Combat is puzzle like, which is a bonus to me. I also love the deck building mechanism. There are sooooo many great cards you want to get, but you can't get them all. An instant classic, IMO and into my top 10 favorite games of all time. Must get campaign expansion!

Too much fiddly rules and not much of a adventure feel to it. It looks nice enough, but it all feels repetitive. There are some good ideas but it doesn't result in something immersive. And that should be the main point of playing a fantasy coop. Disappointing.

RATING: 3.5
After one play:
This has lots of unneeded complexity. Too many phases. Parts of the threat mechanic make no sense. Furthermore the character abilities I saw were clearly tiered and thus character development was uninteresting, but I only played one character so far (Lightning Mage). Maybe the others are better!

The mini puzzle each fight is open information and you can just iterate through the different possibilities for the best solution.

I didn't like the time mechanic.

Interaction was non-existent in our game, travelling was not interesting (this random tile or this random tile?).

The way card interactions work is well done. There's an interesting mini game in trying to set up a strong combination of cards at the right time, but this is not thematic at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Imagine Pathfinder mixed with Mage Knight ... That's mistfall. Great sense of narrative, and more replayability than pathfinder, I'm happy to play the same adventure over and over

Not perfect, but still a solid 10. 
Issues for me: 
* confusing rule book make learning the game harder than it should be
* not colour blind friendly, 'blue' and 'green' enemy decks are indistinguishable by their backs :(
* lots of card typos and errata
* scaling - seems a bit easier at higher player counts (3 and 4)

I hope this game sees expansions

*** Campaign is interesting, thing to remember is if there is a vital card for your strategy you do NOT want to include it in your deck, better to survive the first couple of encounters then purchase it straight into your hand, rather than risk it being at the bottom of your deck.

This is a game I will only play solo. You have to know all your cards in order to survive the scenario. A lot of care was put into developing the character and the decks. I wish that much attention was put into the rulebook--it's well laid out, yet the translation is not quite right and elements are missing for ease of use. 

Update:  Tried to return to this, but the rules, iconography, and disinterest in card-combo games made me put this right back away in the box. I think I'm done.

The graphic design of this game left a lot to be desired. Deciphering the small writing on the cards was always an effort. I also did not like that characters really powered up during a scenario, (how did they get all those powerful new skills in the middle of a pile of skulls or an old battlefield?). And when the scenario was over, they suddenly lost almost everything and had to start over. 

Traded away happily.

Not my cup of tea. Bad rules, player turns are way too long (the active player needs a huge amount of time to figure out in which way he will be able to play the best possible combos) and during the turn of other player there are not much possibilities for cooperation. Very long play time. I love the LOTR Card game, which is similar in some ways but this one is not for me or anyone in my group.

Maybe it works as solo game for me. We'll see.

As much as. Enjoyed it the rules and cards are fiddly.  This may get the axe, it's taking me over an hour to try to figure out how it play it again.

Why I got rid of it - Ya its gone.  This is a much better game than that paizo adventure card game but the icons are small and hard to read and kinda confusing.   I heard the second version is better but I probably wont try this again.

Mistfall comes close to being a top game. The gameplay takes time to learn and the rulebook doesn't help much, but once you get past that its an interesting game of deck manipulation. Your deck is your health, as well as your abilities. Take damage, lose an ability; heal, gain that ability back. A very aggressive design, but one that makes you hurt when you take damage.

I've played this game 20 times as a solo game and eventually sold it due to these reasons:
- Lack of interesting enemies. The main bosses in each scenario were cool, everyone else seemed very dull and the lack of variety here hurt.
- Extremely tight game clock. I don't mind tight games, but I felt like this game didn't give you the option to regroup, if you did it felt like you were conceding the game...but still had to play for another hour. I don't think I ever was able to explore any maps or go back and heal many wounds.
- Character balance problems. I'm almost certain this is a me thing, and not the game...but I could never EVER win without the cleric in my group of 2 or 1. I tried several combos of characters and died almost immediately unless I had the cleric. That left me a bit frustrated.
- poor card quality, I felt like I had to be very careful all the time. I prefer linen finished cards.

This type of game typically isn't what I enjoy, but I did enjoy my exploration of Mistfall for the short time I had it. I never got to play the expansion, so I don't know if that fixed any of my issues. Ultimately the game became repetitive, the narrative in the game got dull and it just felt too constraining.

Mistfall is a sophisticated card combination game where you make effective chains while managing your deck a la Pathfinder ACG. In fact, I would call it a thinking person’s PACG in that you must make effective use of your cards rather than just roll dice for attacks/effects. Like PACG, your deck doesn’t reshuffle once you use up your cards, and certain effects can pull cards out of your discard or burial pile. Killing monsters gives you coins you can use to purchase skill upgrades. Again like PACG, there's a campaign system to chain multiple games into one big adventure.

I found playing the cards quite interesting in how you chain them to good effect, and certainly buying your upgrades is fun (level up!) and offers different ways to tailor your character to your liking. I thought the characters each seemed to play at least somewhat uniquely. For example, the ranger was dodging people whereas my warrior was blocking attacks and able to “heal” 1 card a turn. At first blush it felt like there was some nice differentiation. I can see myself possibly getting another copy at some point but I moved my KS copy on. Why?

Well, I think Mistfall does what it sets out to do with the consequence that it’s best as a solitaire game.  It isn’t devoid of cooperation but it’s quite mild such that my regular LOTR:TCG group felt like we were all pretty much playing multiplayer solitaire. When we play LOTR, we share attachments and generally are much more reliant on one another for effects and attacks. We talk and coordinate our card play. 

Here, other than range, we weren’t paying attention to what others were doing. I don’t think the game attempts to render a story the way LOTR or PACG does, it’s pretty much just hack and slash, so it’s no fault that it doesn’t do what it doesn’t try to do but without that element, the game is totally reliant on how interesting the combat is. Line ‘em up and knock ‘em down; do it again but maybe differently this time; occasionally fight someone else’s enemy.

Now, as a solitaire player I was interested in the game because I actually don’t play much LOTR solitaire as I don’t like playing two-handed or house ruling range/sentinel. I figured this would be a better option for that and it very well may be and I could have kept it for that. But the reason I was OK moving my copy on at this point is due to errata and general rules ambiguity that I just don’t have the energy for. I mean, just look at the rules forums! I sold my copy for a modest profit and may use those funds to get a new version in a year or so that has fixes and a better rulebook. So, all in all, it’s not a bad game, just not interesting enough to warrant filtering the noise first adopters are going to have to deal with.

The gameplay is a lot of fun.  Strictly better than pacg in my opinion.  Sadly the rulebook is rather poorly written and the sheer number of blatantly incorrect cards is pretty frustrating and drags down the game.

[u]Thoughts[/u]: A sort of deckbuilder/dudes-on-a-map hybrid, which is awesome, but the issue I have with the game is that the selection of cards that you can buy and put to use in your decks is too small to give any amount of longterm replayability. Because inside those small pools of cards the player will likely find a very solvable puzzle, and the rest of the game doesn't do enough to create the depth he or she might be looking for.

Overall, a disappointment. However the game was very reasonably priced, and that should count for something.

Mar 2017:
I *do* like this. It is a cool system and I was making things harder for myself than I should have rules-wise when I started (ie reinforcements for every encounter including the final one of "Into the Wilds"). I can't wait to properly dig in.

Nov 2016:
I want to like this but it is a bit frustrating. I don't like the swingyness that comes from the time deck, the variability of the encounters and monster draws. But also I'm not very good at it, so I'm guessing that a lot of this apparent randomness can be mitigated by intelligent play. I'm just not doing any of that at the moment.

An adventure card game that takes some getting used to. The poor rulebook and mistakes on cards do not help. But once you get the rules down and get into the cadence of the game it is quite enjoyable.

There are some flaws with the game, mainly in the random elements of the game. Plus it takes a few plays to master a character which means I will only be playing this game solo.

Cooperative deck building adventure game.  Beautiful artwork, challenging play, little shuffling.  I'd say it lives up to its hype as a thematic combat-focused adventure game. It's a very "meaty" game I will say, and I'm not sure about the replayability factor once you have it figured out.  Traded away and the wife and I are going to try something more basic like Pathfinder card game.

Okay game.  
-> Best things:
- Main gameplay (playing cards to deal and cancel damage, and a novel form of deckbuilding) is actually fun.
- 8 different characters that feel different.
- Upgrade system during the game (deckbuilding) fits really well into this rpg style game.
-> Worst things are:
- An overcomplicating of "phases":  Only two of the seven phases are really "active" phases, the rest is practically upkeep and/or are skipped in 66% of the rounds.
- Length, combined with aformentioned "phase complexity", and badly written rules can make this a mental strain, especially during the first few plays.  Also, some form of repetetiveness.
- Lack of different quests (4)

Absolutely nothing to do with the bland and pointless "roll dice - see what happens, rinse and repeat" from the terrible Pathfinder the card game.
Nothing to do either with Lord of the Rings LCG, which is about creating your deck, especifically tailored for the adventure, plus the feeling is completely different (stats, allies, resources, etc). 
And nothing to do with Mage Knight, which is more puzzle solving and optimal mini maxing, rather than stacking your deck and pulling the combo off (which is what Mistfall is about).

Mistfall is quite unique, not nearly as complex as Mage Knight, its strength comes from the richness of the universe lore wise, the feeling of adventure and above all, the combat oriented mechanics.

The downsides are the huge amount of errata, and some broken combos that apparently were not detected during beta testing (hence some of the errata). I would have preferred waiting for longer and have a more polished quality control. They delivered earlier than expected, which is really nice, but not at that cost. 
Looking forward for their next expansions: the Valskyyr campaign feels bland and very rushed, just to throw something for the people that were opinionatedly asking for a campaign in a game which clearly had not the intent of being originally played as such. Another example of why KS sucks big time. This would have been excellent if properly developed, tested and not caring about a rushed, silly campaign mode, but eventually a more complex and developed one. As it is, I'll give it a 7 rating, while waiting for the official errata cards in a future expansion, hopefully way better than Valskyyr.

PS: every time someone compares this to Pathfinder or LOTR, God kills an innocent, lovely kitten.

One of the deepest games of the deckbuilding-dungeoncrawl genres out there with what looks like a steep learning curve. This looks like a hard game to play well, and, during combat it creates a narrative as if you were playing an rpg. Definitely a step up in respect to the Pathfinder card game, and one that I would play.

I love the tactical nature of the cards and the surprising knockout-blow chains you can create. I love the easy tracking of player health, and the customisation options and variety of heroes. The component quality is very high, thank you to the publisher.

I like the mild sense of exploration (wish there were more), and the suprising effect of some seemingly-innocuous game rules (like enemies who track you after an encounter is over).

I'd rate it even higher, but the intricate game rules make it a little daunting to get out again. It's really easy to get lost in a single turn trying to figure out the legality of this or that, so much so that I worry that half the game is played wrong.

In all, really great quality interesting game so long as you can keep track of the vast ruleset that goes with it.

There's a lot of good and interesting stuff here. The character variety and depth is superb. At the end of the day, though, it's just not worth wrestling with the game system itself. The rules are relatively straightforward--complaints in this area are dramatically overblown--but dealing with the deluge of conditional effects, special powers, card text, etc. etc. is more work than fun. Plus, some encounters are well-nigh unwinnable for certain groups, whereas others will be a cakewalk.
In a way, this is what Sentinels of the Multiverse might look like if it were more of an actual game; and I say that despite loving Sentinels and recognizing it's not much of a design. Mistfall just ends up being not worth it.

Got the Kickstarter, which eventually turned up in Australia. One punchboard missing, but NSKN sent the missing pieces (2 character boards and some tokens) promptly, though they spent some months in the postal system.
The rules could be organised much better, leading to constant searching of the rules when learning. First experiences were not great. Got the worst encounter first up when playing a solo character (it was unwinnable for that character as a first encounter).
After some advice and a bit of experimentation, we got it worked out, and had an amazing game.
The suggested intro scenario is shorter, but difficult, and probably not good for giving an initial impression.

A good co-op euro combat game. The player interaction is fairly small for a co-op. It's mostly limited to healing, moving enemies and the occasional ranged attack.
The heroes plays very different and each hero has a few different upgrade paths to take during a game. This game definitely rewards multiple plays.
The rule book could need a bit of structuring. Play the game to learn it.
I'ts a bit too long for what it offers.

Kickstarted this. Initial impressions are a bit mixed, but overall a decently entertaining game. Lots of card errata and a pretty badly laid out rulebook. Heroes could have a bit more flexibility in deck options, IMO, as well as have a bit more variety in overall function. All heroes tend to feel similar by what they can do damage/defense wise, with one or two gimmicks to differentiate them from each other. Slightly disappointed overall, but I don't regret the investment.

Mistfall may or may not be a good game, with good artwork and an interesting theme. But this simply does not matter when the rule book is so poor that I just can't bring myself to play a single scenario. The first job any rule book is to teach the game and in this respect the Mistfall rules are simply not fit for purpose. They consist of many, many lists of tiny text. There is no single overview of the game - for some unfathomable reason the core of the rules is split into two inter-related sections, erroneously labelled Round Structure and Advance Rules. The former is so labrynthine that it defies the term 'structure', while the latter contains many essential, basic rules. A read though the rule book would be sheer torture even without the necessity of constantly flicking between these two sections. I gave up after a couple of attempts and tried to play through the introductory scenario - a couple of hours of poring through tiny card text and trying to make out the meaning of minuscule symbols was enough for me to call it a day and assign this monstrosity to the rejected bin. I can honestly say that this is one of very worst rulebooks I have ever encountered for a modern board game (and I have read through hundreds)!

Poorly laid out rulebook made it take far longer to learn than it should have. However, once all of the iconography was understood and the correct flow of the various phases was nailed down the game plays fairly smoothly, although it is still quite dense. Still need a win for the first mission (played two games just with Ardenai, needed one more damage to kill the boss on the second play).

I'll echo what others have said. It's a really good solo board game and probably the only way I'll play it. Rulebook needs improvement but the gameplay will absolutely blow you away. However, I was hoping the adventure phase of the game can be a little more emphasised.

Alot of fellow bgg-ers complain about the combos being overpowered but I feel this is also what makes this game different. Overpowered? Yes. Once in awhile, you just want to obliterate something. Furthermore, the combos have to be built up.

Fun game which is a real brainburner each round as you try to figure out a way to defeat the current encounter.

Keeping a close eye on this one. I really want to support it but so far I don't see what it has to offer that we haven't seen already or that it might do better.

Pros: 
-Really interesting mechanic related to the players' card decks. As players take damage they are required to move cards from their hand or discard pile to the "burial" pile, if all cards end up in the "burial" pile that character dies and the group loses the game.
-Interesting card combination potential that makes for some cool moments.

Cons:
-gameplay is a little slow
-the game is significantly lacking in unique art
-Cards can be hard to interpret due to text size and symbols, as well as the way the card effects are allowed to stack
-Game end felt more like a Phew! than a Huzzah!

Liked this one very much. A bit confusing at first, but I really liked the cards, the artwork, the theme and the feel. Very tough game, we didn't win in the end, even though our dps (lol) misinterpreted the rules and didn't substracted the enemy armor from each seperate attack. I do think I'm going to remove the timer cards that move the timer with 2 spaces, because that is just too random for this game imho. A game could potentially finish in 5 turns if you're 'unlucky' and that's just stupid.

After second play i'm less happy about it that i was after first one. I'm afraid that i might want to like this game more than i actually like it, must chack it once more.

We will probably try it again one day with at least one less mage.

After a video review: Playable solo, but it should be very hard to play since there is no cooperation between players.

The cards are hard to distinguish from one another because they have no unique artwork or icon.

the deck cycling mechanics reminds me of LOTR middle earth.

There are some interesting mechanics in there, but not sure I want to buy the game if it's hard to play solo. Of course difficulty is very adjustable. I might want to play it first.

Mistfall is what I expected: a similar game to Pathfinder PACG but more complex and card-combo driven, and without dice. After one play, I'm not sure which of the two I like best. Mistfall has by far the superior artwork, but less variation in cards.
Also, the rulebook is a bit of a mess, which makes the - already not inconsiderable - learning curve even steeper.

After two plays: two heroes is more fun than one. I feel there is a really good adventure game in here, but it needs players who will play it often so they can play fast, know all the icons etc. I'm afraid I'm never going to be that kind of player.

Un  juego insufrible. Lo he probado un par de partidas y muy a mi pesar no fuí capaz de acabar la segunda. Demasiadas cosas a tener en cuenta (modificadores, resoluciones...) para lo poco que aporta. Se hace excesivamente repetitivo y la mécanica de uso de las cartas es tediosa (Carta a la mesa, carta al mazo, vuelta para la mano, ahora al decarte, y venga arriba-abajo), definitivamente NO.
Una pena porque el juego prometía y los juegos basados en cartas me encantan.

RATING: 8.5
This is a Pathfinder killer for me. Mistfall is a complex, but rewarding fantasy adventure card game with a great back story. Choices are dictated by player decisions, not dice and the adventure choices are interesting. That said, there is a huge learning curve for this complicated game that could dissuade more than a few players. I'm hoping the game is worth the trouble. At this point, I think it is, but it will take several more plays to be sure.

UPDATE Sept 12/15: Yep six plays in and I can tell it's a keeper. Very immersive and a ton of fun.

Bookkeeping and management issues aside, the game is solid. I did find the card combos a little dry after figuring out what hero did what.

RATING: 6.5
Similarly to Mage Knight, this game is a bit too fidly for my taste, but the puzzle during combat is just very immersive and enjoyable for me. A strategy/tactic-heavy adventure dungeon crawl w a card based mechanism. 

Could certainly stand to be a bit more streamlined, but a pleasure nonetheless.

This one takes the place of Mage Knight for us.  Same type of puzzly combat, but more straightforward play and the games (for us) do not last nearly as long.  Also, much more feel of co-operation in this one.

Backed this one in my early days on Kickstarter, more out of general enthusiasm to receive a reward -- any reward -- than a rational consideration of my current tastes. It's become really apparent that D&D derivatives/high fantasy have gone stale for me since my 1980s days of playing First Edition D&D. I tried to give this a chance, but the confusing instructions and the generic fantasy "rpgness" of it all had me quit before I'd spent too many hours trying to puzzle it out.  I won't be giving this one a rating as that wouldn't be fair.

RATING: 6.5
Good combat optimization game where you constantly feel overwhelmed by an angry mob and try to fight your way through. However, the learning curve is quite steep and the complex symbology will scare off most new players to the genre. You may also require multiple legal advices on the interpretation of the rulebook... in fact, just make friend with a lawyer! Keep in mind that the rule you will most often refer to is: "In case of contradictions between the cards and rulebook, the former supersede." Always keep a laptop or smartphone handy to check the FAQ and errata. Although, these are major irritants, the game has solid potential.

I can see what it tries to achieve - something reminiscent of a RPG or MMORPG game where you control a team of specialized fighters that "level up" and "gear up" to beat the big baddie in the end - but it does so in a convoluted or even bloated manner, with lots and lots and lots of tiny text and not much of a theme. This is a game that looks like a thematic game but plays like a dry euro; it's about trying to maximize your turn by combination of actions and cards that are completely predictable; no randomness here, no surprise elements, just counting the best outcomes round after round. Is it bad? Well, it's mostly taxing and, after a while, repeatable (and in the end can become boring). 

It's fun to try different party combinations (warrior + priest or maybe rogue + hunter or even dual mages etc.). All characters are well balanced and can offer a lot to the team, so no combination is doomed to failure. Still, it doesn't offer much more than that. There's little adventure and a lot of testing out the efficiency of your team in murdering waves of enemies. 

Also, the Kickstarter edition cards (all the additional encounters unblocked during the campaign) have LOTS of mistakes and were probably designed in a hurry (and never tested). Shame.

This is very likely a good game, but the rulebook is a nightmare and many rules are so unintuitive that it is hard to memorize the flow of the game. I have faith the expansion and updated rulebook will save this one though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Rated from one play. It's a co-op fantasy card-driven adventure game. Principal mechanics are card and resource management. Looks lovely, plays quite well once you get past one of the worst rulebooks it's every been my misfortune to come across. 

We enjoyed it as a one-off adventure, but it's clearly designed with this in mind. There is a campaign system, but it's neither as interesting nor as involved as in the Pathfinder card game, which is the obvious comparison (although when we spoke to the designer at Essen he would prefer it to be compared to, say, Descent).

Solid thumbs-up for the game in and of itself, but we were hoping for a strong Pathfinder alternative, which we didn't think this turned ou to be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is one of the best solo rpg/dungeon crawl type games I have played. Lots of replay value, loads of unique characters and very challenging. 

The characters are all totally unique with many options for advancement and the different combinations you can take mean each game is different. Whilst the game is quite complex and you will need to learn the characters to fully enjoy the game - once you have done so its a lot more straight forward than it first appears.

The only reason I can't rate it a 9 is it takes a long time to play a game so getting the chance to play may be difficult if you don't have much game time in a week. Games can last between 2-3 hours and that means even though you may WANT to play this you will end up playing something faster, which is a shame. If I have a spare few hours though I think Mistfall will always be high on my list.

First impressions from the tutorial. Mistfall is an Ameritrash "min/max" game, where you try to use the cards in your hand to the best of your ability. You have plenty of options to use, and need to find the best use of them. The game is hampered by iconography and mechanics unfamiliar to most generic fantasy adventure games, keywords that you need to check to make sure you're playing the game correctly, and the least intuitive card layout I've seen on a card. That being said, Mistfall is also the best attempt at details outside of a roleplaying game. For example, you may have an encounter that has the Undead keyword, meaning that you will only encounter undead monsters. One of the monsters may have the fire and lightning vulnerability keywords, making some spells more effective on them. In effect, Mistfall is closer to a roleplaying game than the umpteen adventure boardgames and dungeoncrawlers were you roll dice and see if you hit something. Perhaps a Mistfall gamer who uses the system for a roleplaying game could even play out the mechanics for the players who only look at the titles of the cards before deciding their actions ("I cast Magic Missile at the Vampire Bats and the Skeleton Warrior!"). The tutorial in the files section is ESSENTIAL in understand the iconography and uncommon rules for this game. It's not a bad game and a better "simulation" of generic fantasy adventuring than most other boardgames, but I'd rather not go through all the terminology and rules just to bash monsters.

From one 3 player game: a robust concoction of elements from Pathfinder and Mage Knight. Problems include down-time, numerous vaguely-worded effects and for me some of the bite of MK and the light fun of PF. Pluses include the sense of adventure, the variety of setup, the effort to create an integrated, atmospheric theme (charmingly reminiscent of Runequest). It's a decent effort, but falls short of both its progenitors for me.

RATING: 6.5
Entry changed to KS exclusive edition.

This game has a steep learning curve. Not necessarily because of the rules, but because of the horrid iconography and lousy rulebook. Each time I've played it, I had to backtrack a couple of things as I missed them only to discover them one/two turns later. Small examples:  means only activates from out your hero area. B1 is you can only have 1 item on your body. 'Beasts' on the quest card ties in to the enemies you draw (only beasts). Etc. etc. 

However, it is enjoying as a solo-challenge so I'm all up for that. I just wonder if I can endure the learning long enough for the game to actually break through. I KNOW there is a good game hidden beneath this iconography, but I have yet to draw it out. 
Therefore, I rate this 6.5 for now: good to break out as solo-puzzle, not ready to put it down for others yet. Should this hold up as a solo-experience, rating will probably go up by 1 point.

That being said, I find even the intro-quest is completely undoable as a solo person. Now, I'm all for challenges so this actually gets me wanting to try out the game again, but this is a second possibly fail-point. 

On top of that, the quest guide and the quest cards themselves for the intro quest are not even giving the same numbers. Should I mix 6 or 8 transient gear? How much is the actual life of the endboss? This spells BAD editing and a rushed project to me.
Therefore I wonder if it is only the editing that suffered from rushing, or that the scaling also was rushed? Don't know yet. 

Game is good enough to try a couple of more times, but either the learning curve is steep because the iconography is bad (ok, I'll get over that), the game is deeper than yet discovered (my secret hope) or the game design was atrocious (my fear).
Decision still pending.

This is one of worst rulebooks I have ever read! (And I read a lot!) The rulebook is cluttered with superfluous sections & unnecessary icons that only confuse you more. After spending nearly 2 hours reading the 8 or 9 pages of rules, I still don't think I completely understand the game. I am not investing anymore time in this game. If you want a good game with deterministic combat & adventure, play Mage Knight the board game! It's much better than this game!

I don't know about the english rulebook, but the german rulebook is not a good one. While some things are explained multiple times, others we were unable to find anywhere. The "Extended Rules" suggest that you don't necessarily have to read them to play the game, which is absolutely not true! Also, often it seemed you could have said things easier and made the rulebook better to handle...

But ok, we got through the Intro-Scenario ok, but already I can tell I will be fine if I never play this game again. What really annoyed me: the time-cards. Some progress the time marker one step, others two. The two-step-card might not have any special effect, so you'd think it's balanced, but the one-step-card might have an effect that you couldn't care less about! And: you can counter the effect of a card, but not the time value. In the intro game ideally you would have 7 rounds to win. We only had 5, because twice we got cards with two time steps! I would argue that even seasoned players can't win in 5 rounds with three encounters. Especially against a boss with 10 minions and 14 hitpoints! Very frustrating.

Yes, you do play cooperatively. But you almost don't notice, since everyone pretty much does their own thing. Why are the characters' abilities so different when you can't really choose which opponent to fight anyway? The card mechanism is neat, but it did not feel like a deck-builder. 

All in all: awful rulebook (in german), hated the timing mechanism (make the game to random), and it didn't feel very cooperative. So I'm gonna stick with Shadowrun Crossfire for this category.

Fantasy coop Eldritch mystery adventure to explore random tiles and fight AI controlled monsters with card driven actions. Encounter difficulty increases with your threat level as you become more badass.  I like the LIFO oriented action deck which adds a unique strategy element. There is a lot of card interactions and terminology which induce some heavy AP processing at the beginning of the learning curve. But there are big combos to unlock with practice. Some novel mechanics in this game evolve the genre. I like that it is a heavier game, which for us, I think will add to its replay life.

As for the gameplay and mechanics, this would probably be a 9, but I can't honestly rate it that highly. When you consider the horrible rulebook, it falls down to a 7, but the numerous errors found in Polish edition (and I heard that there are many, but not as much, in the English one as well), the game is unplayable. So I have to rate Mistfall a 4 and recommend avoiding it until a second edition that adresses the game's many issues comes out.

I returned my copy.

Brain burner adventure game, hand optimization and lots of equations. A very difficult game to learn from the rulebook but very easy to understand when explained by somebody else or a video tutorial. Very recommended for those that like to create the perfect combo in a cooperative play. Can prompt analysis paralysis so try to play it with people you know think fast.

After finishing of the 2nd scenario.

Mix of MiddeEarth Quest, Lords of the Ring LCG, Dominion with some elements of few other games like Runebound - if you're familiar with these titles (nad you like them) this game is for you!
Really deep, with lot of possibilities. I'm hungry for next games!

HOWEVER: instruction is poor written and organized (NSKN: release new version!), and I don't see some answers of my questions even in FAQ. Thuss -0.1 for rating :D

Fun, but the art is repetitive and not great

A big investment to get the system down and the first mission is a little frustrating if you don't have the right mix of characters.  However, playing with different characters provides variety and bigger quests are more satisfying.

Very heavy and meaty deck-building co-op fantasy adventure game... quite a lot going on here, but once you play it a couple of times everything should click... everything works well and I really like the combat system... cool game!

RATING: 7
This is a fun game.  I know there are some complaints that it is Power Grid light and removes some of the strategy, but what you get is a fun reverse auction game with some resource management with some of the best wooden bits I've seen.  I think the game is clever, fun, and lasts exactly as long as it should without overstaying it's welcome.  If you have the time for original PG, it's just better.  However, this is still a fun game that I believe without the PG moniker would have been more well received.

1st play: Power Grid games are hard to evaluate with 2 players, but I wanted to figure out how this game worked so I tried it anyway. The game improves on power grid in a few ways: Better theme, less time spent calculating, simplified resource refill rules. The auctions are a lot less tense and the game ends quickly, but those could both be a result of playing with 2.

2nd play: Still played pretty fast, and where this game simplifies the upkeep phase, it makes the expansion more complicated. Doing the math to determine how much food it costs to expand slows the game considerably. It's a shame, because the production quality is great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Dull, lacking the spark of Power Grid (which I admire but don't love, partly because I play 2p almost always, and partly because it's pretty calculational, and as a computer scientist I hate doing addition), but mostly just lame, and food is way too loose, making it easy to fall into degenerate games, esp. 2p.  The "techs" are boring.

Variant on Power Grid where each of the mechanics is sort of "inverted" but still familiar. Played with a mixture of hobby gamers who had played the original and more casual gamers; first round or two were rough but once we got into the flow of the game, everyone really enjoyed themselves. General consensus was that the game takes less time (in general) than Power Grid to learn and to play. It removes a couple elements of complexity from Power Grid: First, connections between placement areas are simpler (and must be adjacent, but can never be totally blocked. Second, tool cards (power plants) are not auctioned, but simply selected in turn order, with later players having the ability to "steal" what earlier players chose. This means that as the first player, you have to choose a card that you can see is good for you, but is mediocre to bad for everyone else. While removing these elements obviously removes some complexity from the game, I don't think it hurts the experience much. In fact, the more severe depletion of resources in this game coupled with the relative abundance of fields ("green plants"?) makes for an interesting risky strategy when trying to monopolize a resource.

All-in-all, I had as much fun playing this as Power Grid, suffered less brain trauma, and played multiple games of it in one night with a very mixed crowd. 

Also, the mammoths and bears are cute.

One of the practical problems with standard Power Grid, for me, is that there are a few players who know it *very* well, and it's hard to compete meaningfully. Also, there can be too much mental arithmetic if you're not in the mood for that. This simpler version reduces the amount of mental arithmetic needed, and shakes things up a bit. You can get most of what is fun about Power Grid a little bit more quickly and more simply. I think this is also more accessible for new players.

This is a simplified version of Power Grid that just lacks much spark, or fun.  Seems very mechanical when playing, like you are acting out a script with very limited choices.  It actually manages to call into question whether Power Grid is even worthy.  Was playing Power Grid this scripted?  This bad? This boring?  I don't remember feeling that way, but come to think of it...hmmm...

Seems very programmed - you don't really have many choices during the game. There doesn't seem to be a catchup mechanic if the leader gets the "move down one space in turn order"-tech.

I liked it and it is a slightly lighter version than Power Grid and an decent re-theme with a few twists that give flavor. It is not much lighter or different to justify buying this when I own and love power grid but I like it enough to play it instead of power grid sometimes.

RATING: 8.5
Wow!  I'm not sure why, but I wasn't expecting to like this game - I ended up enjoying it a lot.  Playing the turn order mechanic is important, and deciding whether to save up food (and lose 1/3rd of it) or spend it to expand (thus losing turn order) is huge.  There seems like a decent amount of meat to the game, but it went amazingly fast, without seeming "too short".  I haven't played Power Grid, but this seems to be missing some of the things that I imagine I wouldn't like that much in the original.  This rating may go up on additional plays.

Kipukkadt a lufi...

Gondolkodtam, hogy még rosszabb pontot adok, mert HATALMAS CSALÓDÁS volt a játék! De 1 játék alapján ennél rosszabbat nem illik adni, tekintettel kicsit az elődre is, mivel az meg az egyik kedvencem.

A csalódás első részét az okozta, hogy a játék semmivel sem tűnt könnyebbnek a régi Power Gridnél, de ez még nem zavarna, inkább nevezzük meglepetésnek a nagy beharangozás után. (Az emberek lehelyezése pl. feleslegesen túlbonyolítottnak tűnik a hirdetett könnyítés tükrében.)

De hogy 4 játékosból 2 gyakorlatilag a 2. körben kiessen... Egyszerűen nem akartam elhinni, hogy ilyen szerzőtől ilyen hírverés után ekkora lúzerségbe botlunk. És más is megerősítette, hogy ez előfordul. Én elfogadom, hogy egy játék lehet büntető, de ez úgy büntet, hogy minden más játékost is megbüntet, mert ilyen esetben nem érdemes folytatni az egészet. Erre válaszul én is büntetem a játékot, első körben egy 4-essel, ami még mozdulhat bármelyik irányba, akár lefelé is:)

A lényeg: simán lehet olyan szitu, hogy valaki nem termel többet annál, mint ahány embere van, a meglévő pénzéből pedig nem tud kártyát venni, mert elfogytak azok az értékűek... és kész ennyi, beállt a játék. Nevetséges.

Maga a szabály nem tűnt rossznak, szép a játék, elemeiben néhol felismerhető a Power Grid, ez mind szép és jó, de csak erre nem lehet alapozni.

Na most jól megmondtam:)
---
Újabb parti: megint elszállt egy versenyző a legelején, reális esély volt arra, hogy végleg beáll a játéka... De végül "csak" utolsó lett. Plusz egy pontot kap a játék, mert játszható végül is, ha épp nem rontja el senki, de alapvető hibái vannak. Ha ezt a játékot egy ismeretlen szerző találja ki, és nem létezne a régi Power Grid játék, akkor ez egy nevenincs játék lenne, és eltűnne a süllyesztőben, soha nem is hallanánk róla...
---
Arra jutottam, hogy a fő hibájától ha eltekintünk, akkor tényleg sokkal könnyebb játék ez, mint a Power Grid, talán túl egyértelmű is, mi a teendő: az elején óvatosnak kell lenni, utána szerezni legalább egy erős kártyát (ami után akármit csinálnak is a többiek, tuti jut valami kaja), és ezután pakolni fel ezerrel az embereket. Ez egyfelől növeli a költségeket, másfelől viszont a rohadás csökken. A technológia kártyák miatt nem teljesen egyértelmű a dolog, ezt a játék javára írom.
Ami még fura, hogy nem érzem valódi korlátnak, hogy csak 3 kártyánk lehet.

Since the game invites a comparison to power grid:
1) Faster.
2) Less math.
3) Very focused on turn order shenanigans.
4) Suspect much less replayability.

Not bad. My opinion is somewhere between benign neglect and cautious optimism.

Really enjoyable game.  Try to expand your tribe around, keep feeding them.  Really cool tokens to represent the food (cereal, berries, fish, bear and mammoth) and funny art in the cards representing tools and knowledges.  I really like the auction mechanics here.
It is impossible not to compare with Power Grid, since FS is obviously an atempt to make a PG-lite.  All in all, I think I prefer First Sparks.  It keeps the basic idea of PG, which I like, but simplifies the auction (not being a real auction in FS) and the counting, since numbers in FS are much lower.  Thus, it reduces time and calculation, which are the parts I did not enjoy in PG.  Tools are equivalent to Power Stations, but Knowledge is a new, and nice concept.

I prefer this from power grid. Probably I am the only one, but I very much like the civ feel it gets, and I would even like it more if there were more "ability" cards! I also care for the new "bid" mechanic, take it or leave it. Great! faster. less calculative. Great artwork too.

This is basically a family version of Power Grid. And while we're at it, it's a good one. The theme speaks to younger players and the components also help with that. So while luring the initiates in with eye candy it also provides solid gameplay. It leans heavily on Power Grid but has managed to make the game more streamlined, easier to learn and most importantly less mathy. While it is not for me I appreciate the design and can imagine there is a market for it. I'll just keep playing it's big brother.

Provisional rating.

Much prefer this to powergrid - it's faster, more thematic and for me more fun.

Possibly there is too much food in the game, but that's easily rectified if you want a 'harsh' game just reduce the replenishment rate (danger is fields then become  too good, so apply adjustment for them too, such as costing 1 food more)

Seems to work fine as a 2 player too which is nice

** Update

Definitely a lighter powergrid - but that's a good thing IMHO, Powergrid was gathering dust and I had no burning desire to play. This is quick and a variable map.

Interesting variation on Power Grid, however, the feeding your people mechanic can be the death of you.  In the game I played one person got stuck in a loop of farming just enough to feed their people and nothing else, that made it so they could not do anything for several turns effectively taking them out of the game, and in a long game like this that just turns me off completely.

RATING: 6
A good twist on Power Grid, but with a few elements that I thought made it a bit of a weaker game.

In First Sparks, your income comes in the way of food, which you need to hunt/harvest.  To harvest, you essentially need a tool (like a spear to hunt bear, for instance) as well as a guy on the map next to the hunting space that matches that tool (such as a bear hunting space).  In theory, you think that would create a challenge, having to match your tools to your board placement.  However, the map is rather small, and by the second or third turn, it seems rather easy to get guys placed adjacent to nearly every type of space.  It just seemed a little odd to me.

Secondly, if you thought turn order was important in Power Grid, Power Grid: First Sparks seems to ramp up that factor.  Being in first place near the end of this game seems rather devastating, as the food supplies (where you get you hunting income from) all but dry up by the time the first player gets to hunt.  Granted, the first player can do things to plan accordingly, but the effect seemed a little over the top to me, whereas I think it's pretty reasonable in Power Grid.

While there were these elements I didn't like as much, I did enjoy the game and it does have it's pluses.  It does play much more quickly due to ditching auctions in favor of a simpler, quicker mechanism whereby the start player picks a tool that goes up for purchase.  In reverse turn order, players then simply get the option to purchase or pass on that tool, making the phase play much more quickly.

Overall, a good twist on Power Grid for when you want a Power Grid-like experience but are short on time, but I'd rather just play Power Grid.

This is not quite at Power Grid's level in terms of strategic thinking or depth. However, it is a fun time diversion and wouldn't mind playing it with people who do not like the heavy calculations of Power Grid, but want something in a similar vein.

My only complaint is that the games I've played tend to end early when a player does a tribe expansion rush.

edit:

Played this with 4p and the game shines a little more with a higher player count. It's much harder to expand, which solves the end game rush to some extent. You have to very carefully balance out expansion with food. You need to expand to a have a chance at end game, but it has to be tamed with food supplies. Revised my ratings upwards due to the added (good) complexity.

Billed as Power Grid without the 3 hour play time, First Sparks ends up being a poor man's version of Power Grid in almost every way.  Something felt "off" about the game when we played it.  We could have been playing something wrong, but none of us cared enough about the game to re-read the rules and play again to find out.  With such an excellent game as Power Grid available to us, there is really no reason for us to play this again.

Maybe it should have avoided the inevitable "THIS is the new PG game?" reaction by being a bit less explicit about its ancestry, but it does a respectable job of bolting PG mechanics onto a different theme and having it work -- the card drafting mechanic seems to drill down to the essence of PG while relieving some of the mathiness. I worry in the abstract about replayability, even with the modular board, but I doubt I'll find myself playing often enough for that to be a life or death issue.

This is especially true if you play with anything less than 4 players and that's a real minimum imo. This game definitely should've been more fun to play than it was.

Defintely power grid light.

I'm starting to get the idea and wangled a quick victory.  I pulled out a lead extreamly quickly since I got a spear and was set up close to two appropriate hunting grounds.  A second spear came my way and the game never looked close again despite the mechanisms designed to prevent run away wins.

This could be down to inexperience players but equally the game may end up be decided turns before the game is completed.

The man with the green hair returns to Power Grid for its 10th anniversary, and produced a new game in the Power Grid 'universe'. What drew me to The First Sparks is its promise that it is a faster version of the original. There are times when 'slow gaming' is fine; but a game which distills the concepts of a previous design down to their barest essence is always a Good Thing.

It took me a while to get through the somewhat sloppily translated rules, and in the end it turned out that we also played one rule wrong (the virtual food-one, to be precise, quite a common mistake to make, from what I gather). But overall I have to say that a lot of chaff has been removed from Power Grid. No more messy step changes with power plant manipulations noone can remember; the market resupply phase is significantly simplified without loss of the feel for dearth; the game [i]moves on[/i] rather relentlessly; the bidding phase is simpler and avoids the problem of burdening the players with valuation of the power plants (which is of course not a problem in experienced groups, but is if you're playing the original casually); the map calculations are much simplified; and there is now a noticable increase in the power of being last in turn order. This comes at the expense of the map in itself, because the feeling of playing a country now has been reduced to a boring min-maxing exercise on an unnamed landscape; and of the loss of a feeling of freedom, as the game now very firmly decides how it wants to be played. Lagging behind is still an option, but much less so due to the fact that your 'money' (= food) spoils every turn, and that there is a cap on how many new meeples you can put on the map per turn.

I have to admit that I consider most changes to be for the good, but whether they are good for you too depends on how often you play the original. If you can remember the weird plant manipulations occuring at every step change, then The First Sparks is probably too much mollycoddling for you. If on the other hand you want a less mathy and clunky experience, then The First Sparks has to be your game of choice. Me, I fall in the middle. As I said, I like most changes because they align the game better with the game groups I play in. What I really dislike is that the clunky map feel has been removed from the game. Right now the map game has become too silly for words, even if you need to be a bit careful if someone has access to various technologies. But overall the costs are such that you really can't do anything smart or creative here anymore. This is really a bit of a downer. Had Friedemann come up with a more creative solution, the game would've gotten a higher rating, and ended up on my want to buy-list; as it stands now, it just lacks that extra something.

I'll happily join in future games, though: the game is nice and quick enough for that.

RATING: 5
Components: Pleasing art. Great wooden components. My only quibble is that having to hold multiple competing currencies in my hand, and remember their relative worth (especially when some are equally valuable) is confusing.

Experience: Very, very similar to Power Grid. I'm still not a fan of Power Grid, so the comparison alone doesn't help this game. I like the theme better here, because Power Grid's theme is a bit depressing. I like the special cards here (e.g. Fire, Speech). Spreading the clan is simpler than in Power Grid. But using my hunting/gathering technologies is much more volatile. In Power Grid, I find that the resources to power my plants are usually available, they just might be very expensive. In First Sparks, they might just not be available.

Both games are extremely punishing for coming up just short of being able to afford something; but this game is also punishing for having too much food (because of food spoiling). More than most games I've played, this game seems to be designed to punish new players who don't know (and couldn't know) how to hit that sweet spot right on target.

A really great game.  Will suggest at games nights, always play when suggested, unless Power Grid is also suggested

Whilst I think in theory I'd think I'd rather play Power Grid the accessibility of theme, playing time and simplified calculations put this on the table much more frequently.

I first got it as a more accessible version of Power Grid for my friends. The components are very colorful and cute which helps. However, I haven't played with my casual friends for a while and after getting Power Grid, I find that there is no space for this guy on my collection. I definitely recommend as a alternative and simpler version of power grid for more casual gamers.

Though it's not fantastic, I still like it better than the "full" Power Grid. I'm not a huge fan of route-building in general and I found the continuous adding and re-adding of costs and money in the original Power Grid to be very tedious.

This one eliminates all of that and streamlines the game in some ways. The only thing I really miss is the market economy of the original. (I really liked that.)

More palatable to my game group than Power Grid, probably because First Sparks is a much shorter game. No one with whom I play particularly liked the auctions in the original, but I find the set-price sales in First Sparks to be a little clunky. First Sparks does not become as dauntingly calculational toward the end as does regular Power Grid. Were it not for the length, I think I would like the original better; as it is, I'm not sure which I prefer. Each has its moments.

First impressions of First Sparks - I'd rather play Power Grid.  This left me cold.  I appreciate the desire to simplify, but I hate the way the game pushes you to turtle, once you've connected to the resources you need.  The already painful position of population leader is made even worse by an inability to bid on the cards you want.  I'll definitely give it another play, but right now I'm not excited about it.

This is definitely a Power Grid light, clocking in at 1 hour or less.  The auction mechanism is simple, the person who is in last place can buy the offered tech card or pass.  Then the next person gets a shot.  No interaction.  Too easy for the leader to stay in the lead. If I had played the game first, I would not have bought it.

Scratches the same itch as Powergrid but plays much faster and is less cumbersome to play. Too streamlined? Perhaps, but new as it is I prefer this one at the moment.

Have some of the same problems PG has that the technology queue really can decide a game depending on what's drawn, especially if one player get all of one type of technology for themselves.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Players expand their tribe across the board, learning new hunter/gatherer techniques and gathering food.  Anniversary revision of Funkenschlag, rethemed to caveman times and simplified down a little.  There is no money now, and food is a blend of resources and cash.  The power plants have been replaced by tools and technology, and power station expansion is now tribe expansion.  Still retains the tight game play of Power Grid, but a lot of the grit has disappeared and the game is much faster.  Good stuff. Five plays and it got samey fast.  Sold on.

●Played my very first game (3 players) on 8.11.2011. Essen copy. My first impression was that the buying tech card phase left me uninterested. It was like a give or take experience. Also, in our 3 players game, the game ends abruptly/prematurely in my opinion. If you have a lot of food, and it so happen you be the first player (which you go last in the spreading clan phase), you get to end the game by buying a lot of clan members (provided that you're at 8 or more clan members; max you can spread is 5 members and game ends at 13 members). Other players cannot spread again as their turns have passed.

●Artworks and wooden bits are gorgeous to look at.

PowerGrid light. Ugyanakkor bár a mechanizmus majdnem teljesen azonos, a téma más: talán családbarátabb, (ősemberes, gyűjtögetős) és persze néhány egyszerűsítés miatt mindenképp családi játék. Az előd gémer játéka helyett. Ennek megfelelően sokkal színesebb, szebb is. Jól el van találva, s h a fajátékelemek is figurák -hal, bogyó, medve, mammut- s nem csak kocka, az szintén dob rajta. Gyors játék, nagyjából feleannyi idő kell hozzá, mint a powergridhez, és persze az is sokat számít, h a licitálást és a pénzt kivették a játékból, így jelentősen egyszerűsödött. A játékélmény jó, az elemek szépek, a játék jól sikerült. A Powergriden edződött gamereknek is jó szórakozást kínál.
Update: 2 játék után is tetszik.A klasszikus mélységét nem éri el, de szórakoztató, hasonló, jó.

TRADED IT!

Decisions in the game feel very light and somewhat pointless: most things make food, everyone spreads meeples on the fairly meaningless board, and it all ends in a fleeting few turns. They really need to up the cost to spread meeples, otherwise the game seems to always end with the one guy winning from placing first or having less competition for the land grab.

Great theme and bits, but not too much to do here. A game for those who just want to relax and move pieces about.

My first play was a pleasant surprise as it had enough interesting decisions and played quickly with six people, though we had a runaway leader. I chalked it up to inexperience. My second play revealed I was bored with the game already and once again there was a runaway leader problem. The set-in-stone expansion costs mean if you fall behind, you're most likely done for. Doesn't seem like the technologies are near worth the tools which produce food, and I think they should cost a lot less for what they offer. From pleasant surprise to forgettable in two plays.

This game works fine, but I don't think the designer has found a suitable replacement for the auction mechanism that was used in Power Grid.

Rules are simple, math is simple, cards are easy to read.

Unique wooden components. One player commented that instead of green & yellow wheat being worth 1 & 3 respectively, it would have been nice to have the 3-value wheat with 3 stalks (instead of just a color difference).

Replay-ability: Board and layout can change with each setup, and so does the mix of cards. 

It is easy to fall behind in this game, and difficult to catch up, but it is so short, doesn't matter that much. (Taking technologies too early can do this.) This is a game all wanted to play again immediately, and several said they like it better than the classic Power Grid.  Some also thought the modified auction is better.

Power Grid: The Famly Game version.  I think Power Grid: First Sparks is more "fun" than the original, and certainly takes less time to play, but if I'm in a strategic mood, I wouldn't get as much satisfaction from this new incarnation.  Take Power Grid, eliminate the auctioning of power plants (instead choose to either buy them at their stated price or not) and make the buying of resources more straightforward, remove most of the math from making connections between markers on the board, and add some cheeky cave man art, and this is what you get.  One of the main knocks against Power Grid: the amount of luck in the order that the power plants come up and are available to buy, is still present here.

Shaving off a little game time from Power Grid and cutting down on the sometimes overbearing calculation a little seems like a good idea.

The defining element of the original is, of course, the power plant auction. Now imagine you drop the auction and replace it with a simple pick with priority going to the last player. What's left? Not that much. The game now centers entirely around the struggle for turn order advantage which, in my opinion, was one of the weak parts of the original already.

First Sparks should appeal to those who found Power Grid too arduous, but I suspect that for casual play you still need to juggle too many numbers.

I actually enjoyed this more than I thought. It is a simpler version of PG, but plays out nicely and retains a number of the enjoyable parts of its mother game.

I would rather play PG in the end, but the quality components and game flow in this one make it an alluring game. If this was the only game in the PG family on the shelf, I'd choose to play this one along with other strongly rated games.

Played once in Essen with strangers, thus wont rate. I never played PowerGrid, all other people in the game I played, did.

The mechanics are elegant and smooth for the experienced player. However, I had a bit the impression that the only significant thing you can do in the beginning is making a mistake. The last two or so turns will make you win if you crunch the numbers right. This might well change if you know the available "technologies" from previous plays or if you start the crunching well ahead.

Not my game, but I can see that other people enjoy it a lot.

Love it and the rating might go up after a few plays. There is a risk for beginners to stall by expanding too fast, so you don't have enough food to get better tools. I saw this happen in my first game. She was never able to recover.

The nice network building of the original "Power Grid" in a simplified form, without the tedious auctions and number crunching, in half the time and with a more appealing theme. However, the design still punishes the players who are doing well, maybe even more than before. Also, I have never been a fan of Maura's artwork, and the drab colors of the board and tiles just make it worse here. Three plays so far, I have enjoyed the game enough to want to play it a few more times, but I'm uncertain about keeping it in my collection.

We tried this game twice and both games failed because we misinterpreted the rules. I seems like a good game and I don't want to rate it down just because we could't read the rules properly but I think it's fair id I say the rules aren't very clear or the game play intuitive. 

More importantly, it's far too easy for a player to screw himself over early in the game and not have much chance of catching up later.

This is much better than Power Grid.  There is much less chance for Analysis-Paralysis, because there are way fewer calculations of how much money you need before the auction round.  And it's not as much of a timing game as Power Grid.  That means that I'm likely to play this sometimes, whereas I typically won't play Power Grid at all!

Did not like the added disadvantage the leading player has when selecting an item from the market.  Essentially, you have to select something no one else wants, which is counter-intuitive.

Random board and tribesman placement is Ok, but does not make up for the lack of control the leading player has due to dwindling food supply, which is again counter-intuitive unless you start calculating what everyone else can get in order to know how much you will have...

Did not like this one, and will most likely not be playing it again.

RATING: 5
Interesting modification of the Power Grid system. Instead of power plants, we see hunting and gathering technologies which in turn require you to position your self on the board accordingly (e.g., if you get fishing technologies, you best have some cave people around lakes and rivers to take advantage of your nets). Between the way the growth action is structured and the way in which your food (the currency of the game) perishes, the rubber band in this game is a bit stronger than in vanilla Power Grid -- this, in theory, should make for tighter, closer games. Furthermore, this disallows for the "surprise!" growths for players jockeying for last place (which, unfortunately, almost becomes 'the' game for Power Grid).

Overall, I'm not sure if I prefer it to the 'original flavour', I also rank this a 6. However, while the math here is just as transparent as with the original, I do  
appreciate that the math is much simpler (so that grinders who slow down games have less numbers to crunch).

RATING: 5
It seems like this Power Grid variant was intended to streamline the experience. That's a noble idea, but for me it didn't really work. I just never quite "got" Power Grid, and this doesn't change things up enough for me to feel much different about it. The arithmetic is simpler and quicker which is a plus. The auction house shuffle is still present and still a nuisance. Goofy special rules abound as well, such as "virtual food" provided in specific cases which only exists to provide a chance at a bonus. One of the highlights of the original design, the auction, is much diminished-- it's now a low fixed-price auction, determined in player order. First player picks an item, last player decides to buy it or not, repeat until everyone's got something.

In the end, I'm not sure who would actually like this design... Some of the nuance has been streamlined out, while a lot of fiddlyness was left in or added. Power Grid fans will find little here to recommend it over that game, and new players will still have to deal with most of the same issues and eccentricities of the original.

Very light version of the mechanics of original PG.  Only played with 3 players, which is not ideal for the original game.  Not sure if this is too light, as the mathiness of PG is part of its beauty.  Will re-evaluate after playing with 5-6 players.

RATING: 8.2
A very solid game, obviously very similar to Power Grid. I actually really like that your "power" and your "money" are the same thing- it's a nice streamlining of the game mechanic- it also makes up-bidding slightly less obnoxious, because it can't go on ad nauseum a dollar at a time and bidding someone up actually means something.

Food rotting is a great mechanic that stops one of my biggest problems with power grid- that it's almost always best to come from behind after saving up a lot of money. Unfortunately, food rot doesn't stop this entirely and this is still a game that brutally punishes quick expansion and makes it a non-viable winning strategy.

Some of the technology cards are also far too powerful- namely the transport sled outperforms absolutely every card in the game in my experience so far.

Probably doesn't have the kind of replayability I'd like and even after a few plays is somewhat samey- but a very good game, and actually very slightly better for me than Power Grid.

Keeps a lot of the tension of Power Grid, slightly streamlines the market aspect, and adds more depth to the area control.  

However, in my opinion the rules are more fiddly and more difficult to grasp at first, the "virtual goods" is an odd concept that could have been implemented in a better way, and it feels like a slow bubble to 8 with a rush for the last 5 clan members for the win.  This isn't a huge change from Power Grid, but when there is no penalty for prematurely ending the game as there is in PG (sure, you can build to x number of cities, but can you power them?), the end game falls a bit flat.  I think it would be more interesting if there was at least one extra copy of each technology card, as some can be a "gotta have it" type of card, wherein PG had strong, but not dominating cards.

I'd probably prefer PG, especially with players who know it well enough to keep it under 2 hours.  Factory Manager kept some of the flair but a much different beast, and maybe this feels a bit too samey.  I still really like this style, of course, but it's tough to give this one a 10 alongside PG.

RATING: 5.5
I have a lot to write about this and I feel very mixed about the game. Power grid I love; there are three esential mechanics to powergrid... there is is the market for power plants, the market for resources and the area control aspect. In this both markets are simplified.

The market for tools/techs is simplified and should just have been done in reverse player order with players picking and not being out bid (it would change nothing and shave 20 minutes off the gameplay). The techs themselves are some really nice ideas and cards like that could quite easily be shuffled into a regular powergrid deck as a mini expansion, the variable amounts of some of the tools is a nice touch too.

The market for goods is dumbed down too in that you aren't paying a diminishing amount dependent on player order. Ok you could be getting a reduced amount back if you were further behind in taking your resources but it's still less economic based than the genious of power grid.

The placement of people is simplified too though not to the point of it being unenjoyable or too simplistic.

Lastly the number of pieces that accompany the game have shot through the roof meaning it feels almost like I'm playing an over simplified version of Agricola. I dislike games that require too many playing pieces as they take up too much space on a table and become too fiddly to play.

The net result of all these changes is that it feels like I'm playing a game which is very confused about what it is trying to be. There are lots of good elements to this and lots of bits to it which makes you think it is being aimed at a gamer, yet they have dumbed it down and put childish pictures all over making you feel like it's aimed at kids. Much like the hare and the tortoise (with it's in depth utility maximisation functions yet cartoon pictures and kids theme) I don't quite think they knew their target audience when they made the game.

(03/04/12) Initial play. This game borrows heavily the mechanics of Power Grid with a theme similar to Stone Age. Power plants are replaced with tools, cities are now tribes of cavemen, and Elektros are now various kinds of food. The board is made up of geomorphic hexes, comprised of various terrain supporting different kinds of food, so this gives a different layout every time. Connection costs are now a function of how many spaces you want to expand into, plus how many other players' tribes are already there, plus cost for going over mountains. 

Given that this was from the designer of Power Grid, I was expecting so much more, but this game is simply a re-theme of PG, and distilling it down to the bare essentials. There's an auctioning of tools/knowledge, expansion of tribes, and collecting food and feeding, until one player triggers game end by expanding to 13 tribes.

First play felt like Antiquity, where it was a struggle to just survive. A simple mistake early on meant stagnation. I had bought a tool for hunting bears in my first auction, although I did not have any tribes in the hexes that contained bears; I should have bid on baskets to collect berries (doh!). After being cut off during expansion, I did not have enough food to expand to such a space which was already occupied by another player, since I was only producing one food per turn from my starting tool. All the zero and one minimum bid tools were already taken, so I was essentially dead-in-the-water after three turns. Although we had a reset, that first experience pretty much soured me to this game.

In my opinion, there are very little meaningful decisions to be made; the game could be played on auto-pilot. I will only bid on tools appropriate for the terrain that I am on, and possibly bid on some random knowledge that pops up in the queue. I may expand in order to gain access to new terrain and new food types to expand my income choices. In order to maximize food collection, I will probably try to keep my tribe small relative to the others, as last-place gathers first, just like the catch-up mechanism in PG. I then feed my tribes. Rinse and repeat, store food, hang back and wait; at the opportune moment, surge ahead and expand to 13 tribes to end the game. This sequence of events is as dry as balancing my checkbook, since the math is straightforward. The only uncertainty is how the auctions will play out, but even that is unexciting, since there is very little incentive to bid something up too high like in PG. If I occupy a diversity of terrain types, I'll just get another tool or knowledge if there is a bidding war. There is no sense of urgency to get a specific tool or knowledge. Beyond the auction (and it seems others were playing with an older "reverse draft" rule), this is an economic snowball like Saint Petersburg, but with an extremely short half-life as far as re-playability and appeal are concerned.
 
I'm sorry, but this is one soulless game--all the magic and excitement of PG has been stripped away. I give it an initial rating of '6'. I am willing to give it another try, but this game is as exciting as watching grass grow.

Update (11/12/12): After meditating on this for over eight months, I have no desire to ever play it again. It is too simplified and offers no excitement; I'd prefer Power Grid over this any day. Dropping it to a '2'.

Lighter and more cartoony than Power Grid (which I was never a fan of), so this ought to suit the mechanisms better, but there's a fatal flaw: it's all too easy to lock yourself out of the game by producing just enough food to feed your people with no surplus for expansion or new technologies. A early Fire is a good route to this gaming purgatory, for example. In short, this is an unfinished design that would never have seen the light of day without the designer publishing his own material. A complete travesty.

An interesting attempt to streamline the original Funkenschlag yet still further.  However, I think the lack of auctions is a real detriment.  The problem being, auctions "auto-correct" for over powered cards, or playing circumstances that might lead to a runaway leader.  First Sparks just lets that happen.  The only upside being, it does not take 2 hours for all that to happen.  Additionally, while the game is faster than power grid, it is also less intuitive.  The currency-by-food-type mechanism adds some interest to the game, but also keeps things a little foggy and fuzzy.

Power Grid light.

I quite like it.
It's clever and borrows several mechanisms from Power Grid.  There is some novelty, but still, I would've dismissed it as an unneccessary PG-clone, should it be PG-long.
  Instead it's dynamic and fast (up to 1h).  Hence the fun :)

Warning - being far in turn order is _much_ more important here than in Power Grid.

EDIT: Don't play with 6.  It's too long - like PG-long, which is not good in case of simpler and lighter (than PG) game.
With 3 there's too little competition on the other hand.
4-5 players seems to be a sweet spot.

EDIT2: It's a solid game, but after 4 games I worry about replayability.  Besides, being a 'solid game' is not enough for me when so many _great_ games wait for playing in my collection...

My favourite game of Spiel 2011 so far (directly after the fair). Friedemann took the basic Power Grid structure, stripped away the auctions, the differentiation of needed resources, the fixed game board and added a few special skills available for purchase to get a quicker, less calculation-intensive Power Grid light. The best part: he succeeded with this task!

RATING: 8
The simple version of Powergrid. All the core mechanics exist, but in much simpler terms (once around auction for 'power plants', fixed 'power plant' purchase cost, simpler resource management, simpler 'city expansion' rules) while maintaining the core ideas. I'm impressed, and I like the theme better. Hunter-gather societies are cooler than power plants. Still, I'm not sure I can see owning both games. But it's an excellent medium-light version, and a nice way to bridge the gap to a heavier economic game like Powergrid with people.

I own and have played Power Grid multiple times and used to really enjoy it. Oddly, our gaming group is enjoying this one more. There appears to be an abundance of resources but a lack of tools (power plants). This makes the game different and enjoyable. Play time is much quicker too. There is no auction but you quickly get used to that. Being the first player is a real disadvantage. So try not to be first too often. All in all, a great game.

Better and lighter than the regular PG, but still the major problem of turtling reigns. Play aggressively and you're getting crappiest power plants, less production, higher maintenance and higher costs for spreading.

It's a much lighter but still fairly substantial Power Grid adaptation. I don't know that there's much else to say about it - it doesn't add any new mechanics, it just makes the existing ones much easier to cope with for people unused to the series. 

I can't think of a better way of getting newbies into Mr. Friese's canon - this game is a lot of fun without being long (plays in around 45 minutes), and nothing about it is tedious or procedural. Really well done.

One interesting innovation: the Accomplishments sheet that comes with the game. You keep tabs on who unlocks each of one or two dozen achievements with your copy of the game, from "won a game" to "won with 15 clan members and extra food" to "won without using mammoths." It's an ingenious and video-gamey touch, and I hope more games do this in the future.

Not bad, lots of points for humour and speed of play, but play seems too simplified (from original PG system) for my tastes. Might be suitable as a "intro" game for non-gamers.

Power grid lite, but "ruined" one. It's not a bad game, but a bit streamlined and still somewhere more complicated (money/food) than it's precessor. The lenght is a bit shorter, but it won't save the game because the original is pure diamond and this one isn't. Sure I'm ready to play this sometimes, but PG is my thing.

It's lighter - more family-friendly - than Power Grid. It looks nice. It has a more fun theme. The gameplay is more tense. Probably a bit blander than the original. Altogether it still doesn't feel as classy as PG, even though I prefer most of these changes.

Played once, 4p.  Much better than I expected, but it is very much a simplified version of Power Grid.  It does have some of its own rules quirks, however, that are new, and not taken from Power Grid.  Definitely a worthy prequel to Power Grid.  One caveat, though: it may be better to play and understand Power Grid first, before playing this, since playing this might lead one to depend too much on some of the incorporated crutches.

RATING: 8
A simpler version of Powergrid but very enjoyable nonetheless. Art on cards is quite humorous if you pay attention to every art on them, but i feel that the player who has Fire starts with a huge bonus and if he plays properly he can hardly lose.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It shares various mechanics with PowerGrid (player order, "power plants", scoring, etc.) but it's really it's own game.  It plays different, the strategy is different, etc.  On the plus side, it plays very fast, it's streamlined and there's still decent depth.  It also plays 6, which is pretty awesome for a game like this.  On the neutral side, it's simpler and less mathy than PG.  

On the minus side, it's a bit more fickle and there's less time to react & adjust.  It feels less like a race and more like... music (for lack of a better analogy).  You need to build up and time the ramp up of your crescendo of expenses and tribesman placement just right.  You want to be first to finish, with enough steam to reach 13, but not more cause overbuilding will means someones completes before you.  Quite a few things are chaotic / inter-weaved enough that this is a hard thing to achieve reliably, making the game a bit more random than I usually like (there's no 'randomness' per se, but lots of side effects and stuff you don't control).

I need to play this more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I prefer this over regular power grid as it plays much more quickly and is not so dependent on the focus of being the last place player.  Ultimately, though, I'm not certain if I really would ask to play this one.  Just not that fun.  The food scarcity didn't ever really seem to come into dramatic play in my first play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Kind of a mess. I admit I was distracted during the rules reading, as I played this at Unity Games and was interrupted with auction deliveries, but I thought we as a group still had a pretty good handle on them. That's doubtful, though, since there just didn't seem to be much to this. There was an abundance of food and apart from one player who "got screwed" (I never really understood what he was saying hosed him so much) nobody had much of a problem. I'm almost certain we were doing something if not several things wrong, but to be honest, the gist I got from the game doesn't make me too worried about figuring out what it was. This doesn't seem to buck the trend of me absolutely adoring Power Grid and not caring for any other Friese games.

The setup rules are shit. Especially for 2 or 6 players. That's how far I've gotten - now to BGG to help figure out this mess. Poor rules sprinkled throughout, darn.

WOW these rules get shittier as they go. I have rewritten hundreds of complete rules... these are the worst rules I have read so far this year, and probably all of last year, too. Garbage.

How do you refill in phase 4 each round? The rules don't actually say! Is the refill value the max, or do you Add this each round?

Have played... so much effort to figure this out, ugh. I would not have bought this had I realized. 'They' missed an opportunity here. This should have been a great intro for noobs to learn and try out the Power Grid system. Instead, 'they' writ it up for Experienced Users Only. Dumb move. If you are a noob - avoid this at all costs unless you have an experienced user teach it. Otherwise this is an obnoxious slap in the face.

This is the essence of PG with a simplified auction and more emphasis on turn order.

Played once. While Power Grid is one of my favourite games, I find it hard to judge this one after just one game.
I like the fact that it's a faster game (for a change), I also like the theme, but the different food types are rather fiddly and being the last player in turn order seems to be even more of an advantage than in PG (both because of hunting mechanism and because of the technology sales mechanism).

After our first two games, this appears to be a streamlining of Funkenschlag that is similarly successful as the transition from 1st to 2nd edition in jettisoning excessive meat without touching the bones of the game itself. Unlike the transition from 1st to 2nd Ed., this time there’s a little pain along with the gains in playing time, because not all of the delicious strategy of map positioning is transitioned over.

On the other hand, the gains are huge, and I for one am happy to see the auctions and the fiddly moneycounting go. Getting a lovely retheming thrown into the bargain makes me seriously consider whether this might be the only Funkenschlag version I need, especially since I’ll have a chance of getting my wife to play.

The mechanisms of Powergrid are recognizable. I want to play this again a couple of times for a better judgement. For now I believe some knowledge cards are extremely powerful. And turn order is extremely important, much more so than in Powergrid, because there are no auctions here. Last player is always in the drivers seat to get what he wants, so everybody tries to stay behind. So interesting effort that I need to try, more but there is nothing like the real thing: powergrid.

Faster and simpler than Power Grid.  Players try to expand their tribes but must collect tools to hunt and harvest resources. The resources are currency and also needed to feed your tribesmen.  Each round players can bid on tools (for food resources) and resources (special powers).  Auctions are once around and you don't bid anything up.  You just say yea or nay and the the "yea" tie-breaker is turn-order.

The biggest difference between this and Powergrid seems to be the importance of turn-order.  If you're last in turn-order (due to having the most clansmen on the board) then you lose auction tie-breakers, are last to get resources (which can be very painful) and last to expand.  Sounds similar to Powergrid but when getting resources you only use each tool once it has nothing to do with the number of clansmen on the board. Where in  Powergrid having more power plants on the board means you are making more money than the other players.  This leaves players with some tough decisions on when to jump ahead or not and turtling can be difficult if you don't have something like fire which keeps your food from spoiling.

Despite the awesomely shaped wooden pieces, this game is far inferior to its elder brother, Power Grid. I think it is primarily the lack of the auction phase that prevents it from obtaining the high esteem in which I hold Power Grid.

However, this game is still good - it works well as a simpler and shorter version of Power Grid, and is easy to teach.

I did enjoy this game.  I need to play again, but basically it is a trimmed down Power Grid that is supposed to last one hr instead of two hrs I suppose.

A stripped-down Power Grid which compares well to its bigger relative; I miss the auctions, but there appears to be less incentive to do the "Power Grid two-step", even if the punish-the-leader mechanics are still there. This results in much more of a snowball race feel which is more satisfying.

It's unfortunately easy to mess up early in the game (especially when playing one's first game) and leave yourself literally unable to do anything for the next 2 hours. Takebacks are advisable for newbies!

RATING: 6.7
This game takes more things from Power Grid than Factory Manager, the other game of the trilogy. 

I do not recommend games with 6 players. We already had 2 players with 13 clan members in the 5th turn! The cards cycle very fast and you get the good ones very fast. The winning strategy was very simple: just grab the tool that produces the most food and expand to the cheapest places.

I would say 4 players max.

Games with less players progress slower, they work much better and the experience is more similar to Power Grid.

Of course, it's not as deep as Power Grid, but it cuts its duration in half.

Main critics: The positioning in the map is key. Having 2 additional empty spaces to expand can be the difference maker. Also, starting in a bad position with no/few empty places to expand will doom your game since turn 1.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really would love to have a proper power grid lite. I think PG is a good game but it is just a tad too math/auction intensive for me to play (or actually: to enjoy). This game takes auction out by just giving the last(est) player in player order simply a chance to take the card that was put to "auction" and this makes turn order much more important and perhaps too much so. The game feels simplified yes but in a bit wrong way. Also for a game that is meant(?) for a bit broader audience it is way too easy to kill your game totally by expanding too much early and there is no way to come back after that.

Power Grid lite: a lot of crunchy goodness of PG, but in an easy to digest (pardon the pun) format. Replaces the orginal's cyclical, on-going auction with a once-around similar to Ra.
It also has a decent catch-up mechanism when playing with more than 2-3 players. With greater numbers of players (5-6) the chances to miss out on food can increase severly, hamstringing someone who is too far ahead.
Overall, I like it, but I am not sure I love it.

A charming re-imagination of Power Grid with a prehistoric theme. Most elements of Power Grid are retained, albeit in a simplified form - the auction is replaced with an allocation system, the resource track with a resource pool and the timing and connection considerations are more obvious. Quicker, friendlier and seemly less counter-intuitive, this is a good game, but it pales in comparison with the original.

There are some similarities to Power Grid: the turn-order mechanism, limit of three tools (~powerplants), and the game-end/victory condition. Both games prioritise strategic planning, too.

But there are significant differences: "auctions" are most changed, but so are the rules for expansion, and there are new mechanisms to manage food gathering and spoilage. From a gameplay perspective, the biggest change is the pace of the game: First Sparks ends quickly, and game duration is roughly half that for PG.

I really like First Sparks and we will probably purchase a copy. There are a plethora of 45-minute medium weight Euros, but most games in the category emphasise tactical rather than strategic play. Also the "board" is created from modular pieces and it's size alters depending on the number of players. The changes this introduces are not enormous but will increase the chance of replays. And the waffer-thin animeeples are great...

There are no colourblind issues with First Sparks (icons!) and the cards and components are very well made. The rules are well presented and the translation is excellent. As noted above, it comes with piles of animeeples, and although the "fish" look like dolphins these are some of the nicest components I have seen.

Very tentative one-play rating.  One 4-player game.  The instruction book is awful--worse than even Power Grid.  The game seemed to have a weird tempo.  The initial build-up, and then a VERY rapid push to the larger tribes and the end.  As in, a 5 tribe-member expansion followed by a 4 for a win with 14 tribesmen.  It seemed like technologies very rapidly became inefficient and not worth buying.  We ended up with 4 technologies left on the top row and never hit the Phase 3 equivalent.

We are not sure if we played the hunting rules correctly.  It was frustrating to still not be sure at the end of the game.  That rule book is obnoxious.  I would like to play it at least 2 more times and see how it changes.

The art is fun.  My kids loved lining up the cards and seeing the increase in capacity.  The food is awesome.  The cavemen meeples are weird and look like mutated mammoths.

The Power Grid name is appropriate to use here as the game is certainly a descendant of the line, but it's also misleading in that this is a much lighter, simpler game than its progenitor.

It's also, IMHO, a game with an almost fatal flaw - it's just far, far too easy to hang back and then win at leisure once you have enough food for the big push. The lack of an auction (in its place is essentially a reverse draft, with last place choosing first) takes all the tension out of the game. Hope you get lucky enough to be last at the start, hang back to get Fire (a skill that keeps your food from rotting), then sit and wait, amassing food like mad in preparation. Whee.

It's  an ok family game, and more play might show that the strategy I outlined has a foil, but I'm not interested in playing again to find out - I'd much, much rather play Power Grid instead.

A nice variant on the Power Grid system, eliminating all the connection stuff and making it a straight race to get meeples out faster than the other players, aiming to have the most after someone gets 13 out. You get three stations (aka tools) to generate food with (sound familiar?), but eliminates all the bidding, diverting to a very clean, fast system where the leader puts one up and people in bottom up order either claim it (paying its cost) or leave it for the player putting it up to take. The tools allow you to claim food. Pay 1 food for each meeple you have out there. Pay to put out more meeples, but leave enough food to pay for more efficient stations (aka food gathering tools). It's nice and easy to play. There's less maths, but there's still some while you're working out how much more food you should spend on new guys, leaving you enough to buy more stations. All in all, it's less intense but there's also less downtime and it's an enjoyable variation on a theme.

I hoped this to be more straightforeward than Power Grid and easier to learn. But boy this is difficult to learn too, even if many things sound similar to things a Power Grid player knows.

The rulebook is unclear many times, something I didn't expect!

This game doesn't really hold a candle to the depth and richness of Power Grid, but Power Grid is my favorite game.  It's a little difficult to determine how this game stands on its own.  There are no auctions in this game, which makes it a little Factory-Manager-esque, and really enforces the turn order mechanic: if you're first, you're not going to get what you want.  That said, expansion used triangular numbers, so there was the constant pressure of deciding whether to expand now and risk turn order, or expand later and deal with steeper triangular numbers.  Overall, it felt like there were Power-Grid-ish things going on, but I didn't feel like I had as much control over them.

Not sure what to think of this one. It felt similar to Power Grid but not really in a good way. I didn't like the goods conversion and having to keep an eye on how many goods you were consuming and how many you had left. You can get yourself into a cycle where you essentially pay out exactly what you make leaving you to do nothing for the rest of the game. I would play it one more time before I make a final judgement, but at this point, I'm glad I didn't buy it.

Plays very much like Power Grid but the economy is greatly simplified.  To build three cities, you no longer add up the elektro costs and get (7+15+13+20+8+20).  Instead you add up numbers like (1+2+5).

One play: this certainly has the feel of Power Grid yet is different enough that it doesn't come off as redundant. It's shorter play time is certainly a draw, but it doesn't have quite the complexity that I love about Power Grid. That said, our four player game agreed unanimously that this is a great game and should be played again soon.
[Update] After numerous plays my biggest beef with this game is that it's keeping Power Grid - which I still prefer - from coming to the table quite as often!

Power Grid with less maths in about an hour?  Sign me up!

But be aware, this is NOT Power Grid.  It's shorter, for one thing - you just won't have the time to play cautiously throughout the game.  If you spend too much mental energy worrying about manipulating the turn order, I *will* build to 13 and finish the game while you're still positioning yourself for the Stage 2 to 3 transition.  Not least because there are no stages in First Sparks.

A pretty solid, yet simple worker placement. It's a simpler alternative, but I think I prefer this over big brother Power Grid. The setup of the board prevents players from memorizing game winning strategies so this should stay interesting for multiple plays, even with less experienced players. My only gripe with First Sparks is the game end condition and would've preferred some sort of point system instead of a race to the finish line.

Update: After my second game, I think I've decided I much prefer this game with a larger numbers of players. It seems there's a lot of potential for someone to get shut out of the game for a few turns and a lot of the tools simply become junk with small groups.

This game does a great job at using certain mechanics from power grid and transforming the into a completely new  and interesting game that plays in about half the time.  The auctions in the game is the most interesting and innovative as you are not outbidding each other rather you are out bluffing each other.   Trying to out guess what the other players are going to bid on and not bid on can really make for some difficult decisions. A great addition to the power grid series that was fun and engaging.

Fairly light retheme of Power Grid - gameplay slightly different, but not massively so. The lack of any actual bidding seems to take a lot of the major decisions away, but there a few other decision-making points to compensate. All in all reasonable fun, but not a game I'd want to play often (much like the original in this respect, in fact I find is inferior, but not by enough to justify a rating as low as 5).

Played it finally. And of course was taught that one part about virtual animals wrongly. I caught it in the second round, but by then the game was nearly done due to how fast food was taken with a +2 food instead of the correct way. Okay game of the caliber of power grid. I liked the easy auctions, kinda like Industria in that sense - both are easy to throw junk on the deck to see if anyone bites so you can get what you want for real.

The Power Grid roots do shine brightly in this one.  Gone are the auction and the multiple phases which helps speed up the game.  (While the power plant auction is a key part of PG, the tool drafting here has its own strategy and certainly helps speed up the game.) The game rewards efficiency and using all of one's money (food) with minimal carry over.  And players need to pay attention and work that no one player monopolizes any resource.  A quick game (have played with 6P including rules explanation in 2 hours) that fits nicely into a game night.

Had high hopes for this one because of the buzz and because I love Power Grid. Was let down a bit because this doesn't offer a lot in excitement. Also in our first game one player was deadlocked when he was able to collect exactly as much food as he needed for upkeep so he wasn't able to get any more new tools. There is a warning for this in the manual but it still shouldn't be able to happen now would it?

A nice (over)simplified Power Grid. Less depth ofcourse, but much friendlier to the casual player, it still retains enough complexity that keeps it from being an entry-level game.
Stripping away the calculations, and simplifying the auction phase, surely took away a great part of the game, but also removed the danger to fall in Analysis Paralysis.
The components are very nice, and I like the art a lot.
All in all, I think this one is a very good game. Being able to play Power Grid in 60-90 minutes without getting a headache is wellcome. As much as I like the original PG, it was a hard decision to sit on the table knowing that you need 3 or more hours of concentration, that I rarely made. First sparks did the trick for me.

One for the Powergrid fans who'd like a faster game without the auctions. I think it's alright, but the come from behind rush at the end seems better suited to a cycling game theme than tribe members reaching the mythical "13" tribe spaces. The decision putting the various tools up for auction is the most interesting part of the game and the reason why I like to lead from the front - cos it makes it more fun to play. I think I'll stick with the slightly more fiddly and longer Powergrid due to the better theme.

RATING: 4
An overly complex, yet simultaneously shallower, Power Grid variant. Neither the currency nor the cost to expand were intuitive, and the bulk of this game deals with both. In addition 1/3 of you currency, rounded down, rots every turn, which is just more to keep up with, I bought a card that prevented rot just so I could exclude doing that calculation every turn. I -get- that these things were done in the name of making the game thematic, but it just makes the game burdensome to play. This is a really poor design, stick to Power Grid, and if you want a variant, buy a map. 

This game also includes a bug in which players early on in the game can buy things in a way that eliminates them from the game completely. This is not anything a player who knows the game would do, this is only a beginner's trap, so why is it there? See video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es-E-oRW4Ek

The Problem being in Super Pitfall you can just restart immediately, and in First Sparks you have to sit there for the next 90 minutes while the other players finish the game.

Bought new from Madison warehouse sale. Shorter variant of the original with a Stone Age theme.  No time to have a bad round here as you will most likely not have time to catch up.  Same gameplay as Power Grid with bidding on technologies instead of power plants, but there aren't three phases to play through.  It's a race to place 13 clansmen and that's it. Good game!

RATING: 7
Not Power Grid, not Power Grid light - more like Power Grid ultra lite.  Like a light beer, the flavor is there without the heaviness that is found in a strong brew.

The game plays much more quickly - minus the auctions and the multiple phases.  Here each player puts up a card (tool or knowledge) in turn order and others have the opportunity to buy or pass.  Of course if they all pass - you must buy it yourself.  

You want to be able to harvest enough to expand your clan and buy the right tools - but be efficient in your spending so as not to have too much spoil and be wasted.

I can see this being a filler with a group who already knows the rules.  And even if it requires a rules explanation it still fits well within a comfortable evening of gaming.

RATING: 7
[4 plays] Power Grid is the superior game. If First Sparks was a little simpler, it wopuld fill a better niche in the game closet. As it is, I think I'll always prefer the deeper and complete experience I feel from Power Grid.

Great theme, fun artwork, nice production, and best of all, a healthy portion of the fun, tension, and interaction of Power Grid in only 1 hour!

I was afraid the non-money auction in First Sparks would be lifeless compared to the fun and tension in Power Grid. It isn't gone, it is different and twisted, but with a delicious psychology all its own.

Quicker and easier than Power Grid. Has some similarities to Settlers. Still has the same problem as Power Grid for me- anticlimactic endings.

I'm not a big Power Grid fan, but I was hoping that this quicker, simpler version would be better.  Well, it's not and it's actually worse in some ways.  First Sparks is an exercise in pure number-crunching and everything counts.  This game can be won or lost on each turn, so figuring out the absolute optimal play down to the single food resource is necessary to do well.  It's possible to get an early lucky combo, but it's also possible to ruin yourself on the first turn.  I don't look forward to playing this game ever again...

Power Grid is one of my all time favourite, so for me it was no question to check this version out:).

We tried it out with several friends, hard-core and nongamers as well, and it was fun for all of them. 
A bit lighter and shorter then the original spark, but it makes it playable for nonpalyers as well. I like the idea and graphics as well. 
One thing that is exatly the opposite of Power grid is, that when you develop more, you don't get  - in this case - more "food" as in the original, but you have to feed more hungry clansmen.

One very big hug for the little cardboard animals you put on the board, that shows, how many food you have to refill, so you don't have to check it in the rulebook every round.

One minor thing more, there are the player aid cards, one of them is 2 sided. It should have been better to make it on a different card, as you need both sides information, or put some of them on the board. But that is all I can complain about:). 

Greate game again. Thanks.

As far as Power Grid game style games go, if you like PG you may be interested in this.  I found the game to "make sense" after a few rounds - but also not make sense.  I understand why you want to spread your people out ... but unlike in power grid where the more cities you have = a bigger paycheck if you power them, this game relies on double feeding.  It costs food to spread out ... and then costs food to maintain.  You can have 3 people and get 3 food.  You can have 10 people and get 3 food - the number of people farming relies solely on the "power plant" cards you get.  I do like the mechanic of acquiring cards - not an auction but a first guy in line chooses and has to hope no one behind him in the order wants that plant and is willing to pay for it.  That part is really cool.  The one game we played was kinda broke though as one player totally went bust after 1 round by over-expanding and buying a tech plant of fire instead of a hunting card.  Since he was unable to do anything, it made life way too easy for the other 4 of us.

Nagyon szép kivitelű játék. Az állatok alakra vágva fából, szép hatszögekből felépülő játéktér. A szabály alapján pedig nagyon kellemes játékot vártam és a Power Grid trónfosztását. Sajnos vagy szerencsére, de ez elmaradt. Hihetetlen, hogy egy ilyen szintű alkotó, mint Friese kezéből ilyen játék kijöhet. Mintha nem tesztelték volna. Volt ugyanis egy fél játékunk, ahol a második körben 4 játékosból 2 teljesen beszorult és nem tudott tovább fejlődni. A következő teljes játékunk alkalmával is az egyik tapasztalt játékosnak okozott majdnem ugyanilyen szintű gondot a játék. Hihetetlen, hogy Power Grid tökéletes megoldását nem sikerült ide átültetni (0 házzal is van minimális bevétel). Ha nem figyel és számol pontosan az ember, akkor nagyon könnyen teljesen nullázhatja magát a játékban. Az pedig, hogy elvileg a PG könnyítéséért alkották meg a játékot még hihetetlenebbnek tűnik. A licitálási mechanizmus szinte ugyanolyan, az érdekes és nagyon kellemes fix ár megoldás eltérésével, de a térképen való terjeszkedés szerintem nehezebb és több figyelmet igénylő, mint a PG-ben. Az egyszerű "erőmű" lapokon kívül itt még tudomány lapok is vannak, amik nekem kifejezetten tetszettek, mert színt visznek a játékba, de ezekkel való pontos játék is több figyelmet igényel. Szóval a játék semmivel sem könnyebb, mint a PG, sőt, illetve a beszorulási hibája nagyon lerontja az összképét. Nagyon akartam, hogy jól működjön ez a játék, mert az egy-két újítás benne mind tetszik, a játék kivitele 10-es egyértelműen, de ez a beszorulási dolog ez nagyot ront sajnos. A játék simán 8-as, 9-es lenne, ha hiba nélküli lenne, de így muszáj sokkal kisebb számot adnom.

[2012-04-07]
Egyet mindenképp emelek a ponton, mert ez a beszerulás teljesen egyértelműen elkerülhető, ha tudja az ember, hogy pontosan mire kell figyelni. Viszont tényleg nagyon egyértelmű a játék menete is. Pontosan lehet tudni kb. mennyivel kell növelnünk a vadászok számát és hogy játszunk. Emiatt lehet mégis tényleg könnyebb, mint a PG. Harmadrészt nem tudom miért, de a téma és gyönyörű kivitel nekem nagyon sokat számít, lehet később még egy ponttal növelek.

Light and fast worker placement game using PG mechanics to upgrade your worker's potential, but they are only pulling from a limited supply so focusing too heavily on one thing can be disastrous if people work against you.  For a game so short there seem to be quite a number of ways to manipulate the outcome.  While there is lots of game in a small amount of time, it seems that the game barrels to its conclusion a bit too fast.  I question whether Friese intended for people to push to 13 as quick as we do.  It feels like you don't get to see 1/3rd of the game.  I can't imagine how buying the Tool Sled would be any benefit as the game is over so quickly, unless it was sometime near the very beginning, and even then.

Really love this so far. It feels like Power Grid but does some new and interesting things. I was thrown off by the lack of auctioning at first but I actually like the new system a lot. My only complaint is that the resources don't feel as tight as they maybe should until the end of the game, but maybe I just need to play more to find ways collect them more effectively earlier on.

This short game with much of the feel of the original Power Grid, but with twists and simplifications to make the game much easier (and quicker) to play. Quite fun, actually!

However, I have several issues with the production:
- the rules left several questions unanswered or unclear (refilling market, harvesting if you're next to several hunting grounds of the same type, ... just look at the rules questions here!) -- there's now [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Power_Grid:_The_First_Sparks_FAQ]Wiki page[/url]!
- the various animal types are just different denominations of currency; the meeples should have been marked with some numbers!
- the harvest board shows the currently available foods, from which people harvest each turn; but it also has a place for the generic food tokens. That's confusing, because when you pay generic food back it goes to that spot, but the other food tokens do _not_ -- they go back to their piles [i]near[/i] the board!
- that board also has numbers showing the start-of-game supply of each of the animal types; but that's confusing, too! You'd think it has some meaning ... maybe it's the value of that food type? But no, it is just there to confuse you during the game! They should've done something else: maybe just in the rulebook, or in the spot where the resupply indicator goes? Oh, by the way, the resupply tokens are cut out in animal shape but they're double-sided ... they don't fit in their spaces on the board half the time!
- the bear and mammoth are both shades of brown! In good lighting, it probably wouldn't be a problem -- but I would have preferred more dissimilar colors to have been used, especially since the icons on the tech cards are relatively small (and might be far away from you in the market!)

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The playing board is constructed from large domino-like double-hexes, total size varying according to player number. Each hex shows one of 3 types of hunting grounds, and is divided into 3 spaces. Pre-determined power plant (technology) market, techs numbered 7-14; remaining are shuffled, some removed (based on number of players), and Shuffle card placed at bottom of stack. 

At game start, players set turn order randomly (by giving them tools = power plants numbered 1-n, then place a clan-meeples into an unoccupied space, max 1 player/hex, on the board (reverse order, free). In turn order, may place another (pay usual costs). Then reset turn order (number of clans on board; tiebreaker = number on tool).

Each turn:
1. "Auction" tools. There's a current/future market (4 each), in ascending numerical order like Power Grid. The twist: not actually an auction. In turn order, may put up a tool, for the price on the card; but in turn order, others may preempt the purchase. Most cards are tools (max 3/player; if buy 4th, discard one) which either allow you to harvest/hunt a type of food, or give you food for free (like the fuel-free plants in PG). Another new twist: some cards are knowledge cards, which modify your rules/abilities in some way.

After the auction, everyone (without knowledge of fire) loses a third of their food (rounding down).

2. In reverse turn order, hunt for food. Each tool allows you to take food from supply based on the number of tokens on the board. Then, pay one food per clan (if cannot, remove clans from board without splitting your network).

3. In reverse turn order, expand clan network. May buy up to 5 (costs 1/3/6/10/15); placing on board is free if first in space; +1 if crossing mountain to get there; if space already occupied, +1 per total number of clans in space (including yours)

4. Bureaucracy. Update turn order, add supplies to harvest board (based on player number), update technologies (power plants) (place highest number at bottom of stack).

When shuffle card revealed, shuffle technology deck. You go into the PG-Stage 3: market compressed to 6 techs, all available for purchase.

The game ends at the end of the round (skipping Bureaucracy) when any player builds out to 13 clans. The player with the most clans wins; tiebreaker = food remaining?

RATING: N/A
After reading the rules I admit that I was very anxious to play the game mainly because despite the usual and boring usage of the Power Grid success name I really felt that the game could be different enough. Well, it is different but yet so much worse too! And it's not that different!
The new tool selection isn't very interesting. Players seem to go and adapt easier than in Power Grid maybe because at some point all players are present in each region and so it doesn't matter if the card you pick is berry, bear, fish... related because everything works the same. The only difference should be the turn order which may influence the ammount of hunting production but even so, at a given point of the game every player had a few virtual pieces of each animal/berry making this fact not an issue. Uninteresting!
The game turned out to be a race. A very boring race in which decisions didn't seem to matter that much. It lacks the tension of the auction, the storage of a certain type of good and the importance of the feeding because it always happens after the hunting!

Overall we played a boring game with no real decisions along the way. Disapointing!

UPDATE
Played it wrong. The marketplace and the virtual goods. Must try it again properly.

First sparks is an interesting game.  Many people said it ‘fixes’ the problems with Power Grid .  I don’t believe that one bit.  It is obviously built off the same system, but Sparks is its own game.   I am not really sure I like how the auction works.  It seems like you have to offer something up that you don’t really want hoping someone else is willing to take it.  It’s a fine game that has its spot, but there are others that fill a similar niche that I would recommend first.

One bit of apparently contradictory wording had us scuttling for the Geek during the first play, where all was explained. Since then it has played seamlessly and the shorter playing time gives it a strong practical edge over "proper" Power Grid. The variety offered by the different expansions for the original game means that it will still get played here, but not as often as First Sparks, I suspect. The bear/pig/sloth debate about what the bowmen are hunting adds to the fun.

For me, the game takes away too much from Power Grid to be fun and engaging.  The map play is not interesting.  The difference food resources form different pools but all convert backs to currency once you get them.  There is no build up in the game as it ends too quickly.
A big let down.

RATING: 7
A shorter, lighter Power Grid, with auctions tripped out, increasing the emphasis on turn-order manipulation and board positioning.

Instead of purchasing resources to run plants, you draft technologies (fishing rods, spears etc.) which harvest resources depending on how many are available. You might get 2 fish if there are 8+ in the market, 1 otherwise; as in the original game, players with a better position in the turn order or a monopoly do much better. Players also need to be present on appropriate spaces on the board, which increases the importance of positioning.

It plays faster than Power Grid but maintains much of the same feel: manipulating turn order, expanding now because it is cheaper than expanding later, competing for resources. The plant/technology market refreshes the same way. But the soul of Power Grid is gone: what is an auction game without auctions?

In theory the interaction of board positioning, resource markets and technologies is interesting, but in practice the drafting exacerbates positional advantages (both turn-order and board) and leads to somewhat scripted play. If there is only one spear in the market, only the player in mammoth territory will want it. If there are two players in mammoth territory, both will want it and one will be screwed. This is literally the perfect situation to employ an auction mechanism, but of course, First Sparks dispenses with it.

I also find it much harder to "read" -- it's difficult to see from across the table what each player will get for each resource bracket and painful to work out how that will change depending on turn order. Power Grid is mathy but simpler.

It's a good game, but it's only a pale shadow of the original.

Initially I'm a bit disappointed.  I had higher hopes for a 2F game.  My opinion may well change with future plays--there *will* be future plays--now that I've a fimer grasp of the rules.  The rules could stand to be a bit more clear.  Our first game it turned out that we'd been playing wrong for most of the game.  We only found out because someone who'd played before wandered by when we were about two-thirds finished and set us straight.  Also gets my vote for some of the most abstract Meeples I've ever seen.  When we were trying to figure out how to play we were puzzling over them--"Which way is up?".  If it hadn't been for an insight from my ten-year-old son--"They're guys holding spears, Daddy!"--we'd still be confused.

RATING: 6.5
Decent twist on the basic Power Grid mechanisms. However, like Power Grid, it is designed to nearly always be a close game that boils down to whoever can do the best math on the last two turns or so. Additionally, having all the resources basically be convertible into food and be exchanged at any time seems weird and loses some of the unique flavor that is found with varying resources in other games. Still interesting and I'd play it again (the special power cards add some spice), but it isn't something I'd probably seek out to play simply because it suffers from the same flaws that Power Grid does.

This is a difficult game for me to rate because I can't help but compare it to its parent, Power Grid. First Sparks plays a lot like Power Grid light. There is no auction, the "fuel" (aka food) replenishes at a constant rate throughout the game, and the board is wide open from the start. I can't say I didn't enjoy First Sparks, but much of the nuance of Power Grid is missing. I enjoyed the theme and the extra rules contained on the technology cards. For variety's sake, First Sparks is pleasant. However, for a game that is so similar to Power Grid, I'd rather play Power Grid.

Has many of the same problems Power Grid has, in that someone gets lucky and the uber power plat (or, in this case, food engine) drops from the sky at the right time and they win. But unlike Power Grid, where you can at least hope to slow someone with a great power plant down by making fuel expensive, there's no way to stop the leaders in First Sparks - the rich just get richer. I do like the theme and the faster playing time, but the huge luck factor and runaway leader problems in both Power Grid and First Sparks keep both from being anything more than just OK games in my book.

Here's a session report of my first game:

I purchased the Fire technology.
I expanded my clan.
I expanded again.

And that was it.  I was literally unable to do ANYTHING for the rest of the game.  I started with 1 VP, I ended the game with 1 VP.  Without having purchased a Tool technology in the first round to gather food, turns out I was only able to maintain one clan member (the other two quickly starved to death).  And I was unable to purchase technologies to get me out of that hole because I didn't have a Tool to build up some cash/food beyond what I needed to sustain that first dude.  Wouldn't it be a simple fix if Tools were the only affordable technologies for the first round?  How was this not caught in play-testing?

(Yes, I'm the dummy who did those actions, but I'd like to think a professionally published game couldn't be broken five minutes after a newbie sits down at the table.)

Now what to say about this game? The artwork is simply amazing. Much love for the detail here plus I really dig the "cave art". I thought, I'd enjoy this a lot, because I always saw Power Grid as just too long and drowned in math for the fun I took out of it. So wouldn't a streamlined and much shortened version of it be the perfect solution? Unfortunately, it isn't. At least so far I can't see it. The cost of streamlining PG in the way it was done means that there's just not enough time to recover from a bad round. The turn order advantage of being in the last place won't just be around long enough to make a difference on the final outcome. 
This game will definitely get more chances though.

I love the stone age theme in games. I often prefer a stone age themed variant of a game to the main game. Carcassonne is dull — but Carcassonne: Hunters & Gatherers rocks! I'd like to get into Power Grid, since it's so popular, but I have a strong suspicion I'd prefer this version.

I would actually like to have a copy of this, but it is on my wife's list as well and she's participating in the Secret Santa with me, so to avoid multiples, I'm downgrading my priority on this title.

The First Sparks transports the Funkenschlag mechanisms into the Stone Age. The order of phases during a game round, the player order, the technology cards: you know all these parts from “Funkenschlag”. But what is new? What is different?
The First Sparks is much faster and far more direct. You are immediately part of the action. Each turn, each decision is important. As a clan leader you decide on the well-being of your clan during the Stone Age. You need to develop new hunting technologies and get new knowledge - to successfully hunt food or to learn to control fire. With the help of these skills, you will harvest enough food to feed your clan and spread it far enough to reach new hunting areas.
In a game of The First Sparks you are always confronted with many decisions: Which technology cards offer you the biggest advantages? When is the right time to spread your clan on the game board? Which hunting areas will grant the most food? Reaching new hunting areas or trying to secure parts of the game board for your own clan are important factors for your strategy. Empty spaces are cheaper for you to settle compared to spaces in which other clans are already settled. If you are the first to increase your clan size to 13 clan members, you win The First Sparks.

My first impression is based on a single play with five players. Having played Power Grid on many occasions, I was intrigued by TFS since it was supposed to be more streamlined. I can candidly proclaim that TFS is indeed more streamlined and faster than PG, but not necessarily in a good way. A few aspects of TFS stood out. First thing that was eliminated was the auction. I am not always a huge fan of auctions. They can be really time consuming and in general, a handwaving mechanism inserted by the designer to eliminate the need to effectively evaluate the true value of an item. It lets players decide that for themselves. However, in PG, auctions become a necessary component to instill a sense of urgency and tension between expansion and technology upgrades. With TFS, that element is now missing. Instead, it is substituted by turn order priorities. If you are last on the turn order, you will get first pick of any card being selected. This mechanism just doesn't work in my mind. Turn order priorities is integral to PG gameplay. It is unclear to me how turn order is being utilized in TFS and after the first play, it is clearly not that important. The second aspect of the game that is a downgrade from PG is the tightness of resources. There are no longer resource markets in the traditional sense. Instead, we have a variation of the market represented in the food source. However, food supply was very abundant in our game. So much that it was never really an issue of maintaining a balance between expansion and feeding the clan. The tension and tightness of balancing the budget was clearly absent. Instead, a massive and early push for expansion is a clear route to achieve victory. Playing TFS using PG tactics (staying close to the leader of the pack but not losing out in turn order) just will not work. The third aspect of the game that I did not enjoy was the victory conditions for the game. Unlike PG where cities built triggered the end game, but powering the cities was the critical element for scoring, there was no such rule in TFS. The person who placed the 13th clan triggered the final round and ended the game immediately based on clan size, not on feeding. This negated the requirements of balancing expansion yet having enough resources to feed the clan (or power the cities in PG terms). One can simply expand like mad in the final round depending on how much food you obtain. No need to conserve resources. If you happen to reach the 13th clan, the game ends immediately. There are no comebacks or no sudden depletion of resources based on the market supply.

The positive side of steamlining the game is a markable increase in the speed of play and ease of teaching the game. Gameplay is faster and newbies do not have to worry as much about turn order. I also liked how technologies were interspersed with civilization advances during the "auction round" (speech, intelligence, etc). I wished PG had a subset of technologies that could alter powerplant efficiencies and also flexibilities (though some expansions and promos do just that).

To be honest, I was quite dissapointed with this one. I can see that the idea was make a version of Power Grid that would be faster and include less number crunching. In theory, I think it is a good idea (I don't enjoy the number crunching part in Power Grid). However, this game just felt flat. 

The main structure of Power Grid is actually quite confusing (you have many different phases that you go in different player orders). But this all makes sense in Power Grid. When there is a lot of thinking and turns take a bit longer, this kind of cubbersome turn-structure is OK. But with less-meaty game, it just felt a bit teadious and un-elegant. 

As there were no auctions, this game seriously lacked the nice tension Power Grid has. Also, one of our players got locked into a situation were he couldn't produce any money - I mean food. I think he played very poorly, but still it wasn't good thing to see player eliminated in this kind of game...

On the plus side, the game looked nice and the theme is very funny.

Obviously reminiscent of Power Grid; lighter primarily because of the neutered auction mechanism.  (Well, it's actually not an auction at all.)  

I don't mind that it's lighter, surprisingly, because it's also shorter, and the exact dollar min-maxing of PG's original auction was never my favorite part.

A couple of plays.  Original Power Grid doesn't really grab me but this has the advantage of being shorter and not having money to count.  My first game, with 5 people, was frustrating because I began the game in the middle of map, and each time I tried to spread out to clear terrain, my neighbours blocked me. Four players, much better.

Effectively cuts out the tedious bits of Power Grid, and plays in a remarkably fast time.  Have quite a bit of criticisms, but they may just be from lack of experience with the game so I'll have to get more plays in.

RATING: 8
I've only played it once, but I'll take this over the original Power Grid.  The game never stagnates in the center, because the power plants (technologies) available are pretty much always good enough to warrant their cost.  The lowest value plant has an incentive coin placed on it, to keep things interesting.  The auction has been changed just slightly, but it takes only about half the time now.

Another great change is that the abrupt changes (from phase 1 to phase 2 and phase 2 to phase 3) have been pretty much eliminated.  You can't be completely blocked in, and even though the board becomes more crowded (and costly), it's a much smoother curve.

If those changes weren't enough, the board is now modular, and the theme is really well implemented.  I've been turned away from other classic game remakes (eg. Priests of Ra), but this one hits the sweet spot for me.

I thought the new Power Grid was excellent. My least favourite part of the game is power plant auctions, so getting rid of them here is a big plus. If I didn't own the "normal" game and was looking to buy one, I'd choose this one. The board play was much more interesting, as players can build in the same areas right from the beginning of the game. Being hex tile based though, this game won't have the "map expansions" like normal Power Grid.

The game implements some basic mechanic from it predecessor, Power Grid with major difference, the bidding phase for technology cards.

RATING: N/A
Not fair to rate this, since I had to stop partway through the session, and especially since I found out afterwards we missed an important rule.

Power Grid is my favorite modern game and I'm time-limited these days, so the concept of a fast-playing PG was appealing to me. And it's not a horrible game, but it's similar enough to PG (and not as much faster to play if your gaming group can do mental arithmetic quickly like mine generally can) that I don't think I'd ever want to play this over that.

I miss the auction system, both because I like auctions and because the cards don't strike me as especially balanced (perhaps unfair after a single game, but it would be very difficult to perfectly balance that many cards and auctions help that nicely). The resource system not scaling in different steps is just odd to me. That was the area we missed the rule, which means it's not actually broken, but imagining how the game would've gone differently with the correct rule doesn't make me feel like it would've been any more fun.

Overall, it just seemed less interesting that PG and not enough faster to justify the streamlining.

A fine game for the niche it fills.  Seems like it will play 6 people well.  But, its ties to Power Grid are probably a detraction.  I suspect heavy gamers will not like it as much because they are comparing it to the original.

Shorter, less math-ier version of power grid.

The main thing bad about this game is that you can get stuck - where you spend all your food feeding your people and have no way to get extra when the next 'buy technology' phase comes in. 

Then again, the rulebook warns you about this.

I need to play it again but it is surely comparable to powergrid and in some aspects even better.
The "auction" here is a struck of genius and alone makes this game worth to be played.
After an initial difficult explanation i thought it was just another game too similar to PG but it is actually a PG boiled down to its essential mechanics, still fiddly but not as the original; components are very good, you can still follow different paths to victory, you need to keep an eye on what others are doing (hunting fishing...) and it seems the ending is very very tight and tense.
Rating could probably raise.

A gentler, but not necessarily kinder version of Power Grid.

Given their many similarities, I don't see why anyone would want to own both First Sparks [i]and[/i] Power Grid. But if your gaming group prefers lighter games, purchasing this version instead of the original would be a wise decision. 

[i]Update:[/i]

As far the need to own both versions, I've had a change of heart.  A LOT of people who won't play the original will play this version, so my money was well spent.

If anything casts a shadow on the game's worth, it's the following imperfection: The rulebook is a mess.  Due to scrambled translation and general obfuscation, a number of rules are unfathomable until you consult the forums.  This is particularly true if you've never played the original.

Played my first game with the kids (11-13-15) and they loved it.  Great parts, superb quality.  Rules are not so clear about how to place the boards, but it was well explained here.  Same for the rule of virtual food.  The game is easier than it looks to understand.  After 2-3 turns, it gets faster to play.  I never played the original Megawatt, but I am now so curious to give it a try.

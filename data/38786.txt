Outstanding game.
Components are perfect : beautiful map and counters, clearly written rulebook, captivating playbook (historical context and designer notes).
The gameplay is fluid, dynamic, with just the right amount of chrome. The game system has been thoroughly crafted and tested.
Both players should play in accordance with the doctrines of the belligerents to snatch victory - something that is missing in too many wargames.
There are optional rules to add flavour or balance the game in one side favor, but I found the basic game very tense, with both players always short of that unit that could change the battle outcome.

If you have any wargaming experience this rule set will be walk in a park. Very good design, if you want to bring someone into the hobby, playing the tutorial will give excellent idea of the gameflow.

Now, strategy is something that you will need to master.

An excellent game on a fascinating topic. Characterised by meticulous research and an easy to understand system. Multiple scenarios of varying complexity as well as a longer Campaign Scenario. A real highlight is the HUGE booklet that includes a wealth of historical commentary. I'd love to see more games using this system.

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: GMT has done an outstanding job with the components to the game. The map, although mostly washed in white is gorgeous to look at. The counter graphics are clean. The rulebook is clear, understandable, and not overwhelming. The Playbook is wonderful and well worth the price of the game. This operational level game has just enough chrome to immerse you into the conflict without bogging the game down. The many tense decisions don't leave you feeling hamstrung for options. The scenarios are designed to teach the players lessons about timing and stance. After playing a scenario you're left feeling like you've experienced a story unfold.

10 Plays: The rules have become second nature to me. Now it's all about the various strategies to employ in each scenario. I still haven't played the full campaign but I'm dying to try it out. This game still holds my interest after 10 plays.

RATING: 5.8
Although the production is top notch (Playbook is one of the best I ever seen with so much historical design notes), the theme and scale is intriguing, counter density, complexity and speed of play are all quite good, I am disappointed with this game.

My main reservations are that it feels a bit tedious at times, with repetitive tactics, not much manoeuvre due to channeling terrain, a very tough CRT for the attacker not really rewarding aggressive style of play. In a word I guess, I found it boring with not much room for creative strategies.

Once you have figured out how the Soviet should engage the Finns early on and gang up against the edges of the defense front it becomes quite predictable and tough on the Finns. That's why most of the optional (chrome) rules do favor the Finns I suppose.

In brief, I doubt I will get back to it when there are so many other creative and deeper games for my tastes out there.

Designer did a solid job, though. Very thorough and rigorous, rules are complete and do work well.

I played the starter scenario solo -- 3 turns with a handful of units.  So far, I like the game.

One thing I like about this game (and GMT in general) is the great care which went into it -- the quality of the components and the play aids, the clarity of the rules, the designer's obvious attention to detail, his historical analysis and hints on play.

Initial Rating of 6 based on a short solo play.  I expect if I played this with someone, my rating would rise at least to a 7.  I'm not sure that there's enough to distinguish it from other good wargames that it'd end up any higher than that.  

After one play, I'd say it's a good, solid relatively low-complexity wargame with ALOT of different scenarios and some of those scenarios have very low unit density which is an interesting change.

Fun little game. Simple yet with amusing chrome (not too much of the latter). Yet I was left wondering whether an entire game subjected upon what could be described as a single ASL scenario is worth it? Sure I suppose.

It would act as a good intro for those new to tactical games.

An outstanding system and rule set. Easy to pick up and play, but with enough nuances to keep you coming back. A ton of scenarios and options, despite what on first inspection appears to be a limited number of strategies for each side. The balance appears to be pretty good. Soviets have the upper hand early on, but the Finns come on strong towards the end. Really like it, despite not having much interest initially in the battle and theatre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
4 plays of campaign scenario
1 play of first two days
many solo sessions of first two days scenario

When I'd first posted my thoughts on this game its designer, Mark, a long-time BGGer and all-around good guy, emailed me asking for specifics.  As our session had faded from my memory by the time Mark contacted me, I decided to give the game another chance.  I'm interested in the topic, believe we'd played a few rules wrong, and I felt the game deserved a fair chance.  

I suspect many of the issues during our first play stem from the scale of the situation, set as it is between operational and tactical.  Historically, this is a difficult scale to simulate elegantly in a wargame.  Mark has taken bits from both styles of game with an emphasis on elegance and simplicity.  A goal I laud, but the emphasis on simplicity trends the design towards operational wargame mechanics.  The result doesn't "feel" like a tactical game at first and could be described as an operational game that's tactically themed.

Examples of what I'm thinking of as operational mechanics include ZOCs that can't be infiltrated, a CRT that allows most results to be taken as retreats, a lack of command control or integrity, perfect knowledge of opponent's units, ideal spotting, and an abstract model of ranged fire.

All wargames make abstractions, and I have found that my enjoyment of a wargame often hinges on my acceptance of that game's abstractions.  For some reason, perhaps the grand tactical setting, I found Red Winter's abstractions difficult to accept.

But I enjoy playing the game and as I learn how to use the subsystems like ranged fire I am gradually making my peace with Red Winter's abstractions (and not coincidentally becoming better at playing).

Be aware that the well written rules at times hide their ramifications.  For example, to avoid the pitfalls of our first play, realize that defenders can't necessarily absorb all CRT loses as retreat hexes because at most they can retreat a number of hexes equal to their MP-2 [8.5.2.1]. 

Furthermore become familiar with the use of ranged fire both in support of combats and in suppression of enemy units' ability to support combats with their own ranged fire.  Ranged fire is a huge part of this game, read, re-read, and practice solo combat situations to become comfortable with the ranged fire subsystem.  Get comfortable with how the time of day, the target stack composition, and the terrain impact ranged fire.

This game's CRT is all about column shifts, and ranged fire is the major contributor of shifts.  Don't let the operational mechanics fool you, things get tactical when one begins to use the ranged fire system effectively.

I am glad I gave this game a fair shake after a poor introduction.  Will I make my peace with its abstractions, with its plethora of modifiers, its design approach?  Only time will tell.  If I do, I expect the game will be an 8+.  

----------------------------------------

Update:  
A rather revealing thing happened the last time we played this game.  It had been a couple months, and I wasn't sure I'd like the game anymore.  We started to play and it was better than I'd remembered.  Then after the first day of the campaign, we realized that we were ignoring the modifiers to the ranged fire table.  We reset and had a session that wasn't near as engaging.  In fact, we quit the game during the second day.

We've now quit the game on the second day twice.

The problem is the time consuming ranged support fire system.  

Now, I'm fine with "buckets o' dice" systems.  They're a simple way to replace tables with large amounts of dice and very few, easy to remember modifiers.

Here in Red Winter we have a different animal.  We have a system that uses tons of individual die rolls, WITH tables and a PLETHORA of modifiers.  It's not rare to see 6, 8, or even a dozen die rolls per combat.  And these aren't simply "a 6 is good" die rolls, they're die rolls where each roll has unique modifiers based on the the type of firing unit, whether they can see the target, the time of day, the number of infantry companies in the target hex, and on-and-on.  After the smoke clears the net effect in terms of column shifts to the combat is often minimal, except that one's suspension of disbelief, one's engagement with the game is trashed by the tedium.

Put another way, the support fire system simply overwhelms the game and I don't play wargames to focus on support fire.

I can see that the design aspires to a simplicity, but it's a table based, modifier rich sort of simplicity.  It is the simplicity of a hammer.  

Which could be fine, unfortunately, in Red Winter one needs to hammer half a dozen or more die roll based table look ups per combat.  One begins to long for a less tedious approach; one longs for a nail gun.  

Simplicity is not elegance.

I think if the design had distilled the support fire system down into something less time consuming, less distracting.  If the system took all the support fire and in a single step (with, or without a table look up) returned the modifier to the combat, it would be a much better game.  It would also be much more conventional.  And perhaps that's why convention has evolved the way it has.  Because when you're faced with a lot of nails, you'd prefer the elegance of a nail gun to the tedious repetition of a simple hammer.

Sold.

Good game about one of the crucial point of Winter War between Finns and Soviets.
Very good production value, rules easy to read and understand.
Game mechanics nice catches differences between combat doctrine and possibilities of both adversaries. Finns are more flexible but they are outnumbered and have lack of support weapons. Soviets have material advantage, but they are cumbersome to handle. 
All in all winning is this side who better uses his own advantages.
In a grand scale I have concerns about replayability. I think, that replay value is average. Map has couple of points, which are crucial to win the game, axis of advance are predictable and not surprising. Another flawed factor is change in overall stance. Soviets attacks in first two days, third day is a stalemate, fourth and fifth days gives advantage to Finns, but this is too artificial and does not include real situation on the board (with one exception: Soviet losses, which depends mostly on die rolls). So dynamics of game is strictly limited, which is major flaw.
Minor issue - campaign game is unplayable in one sitting, but PBEM via Vassal works very well.

RATING: 10
After tutorial, 17.10, 17.6, and 1/3 of the campaign (so far - it's on table), I'm down.

 The game is steeped in detail without burdening the player with cumbersome rules. The last few wargames I've played (Arab-Israeli Wars, Ancient Battles Deluxe, Rock of the Marne) are all solid, but they don't capture the theme very well in comparison. Pushing counters and counting combat factors is fine, but Red Winter shoes how much more a design can accomplish without the benefit of the CDG card mechanism. 

Most of the optional rules are quick to implement and well worth the minor inconvenience. I haven't used Friction Fire or Fog of War.

October 2017 - forgot to follow up ... last winter I finished the solo campaign and played a FtF campaign. Could see playing again sometime.

An excellent tactical game that simulates winter warfare well. There are several scenarios included that make for a variety of play. The game is also very approachable for a wargame. The Finns and the Soviets need to use different strategies (or lean that way).

Anti-tank guns may be too powerful, although the Finns only have two, combined with their assault bonus Soviet Tanks have a far less effect on the battle as they historically did (IMO). - Note I was corrected on this history by the creator, so tanks are as vulnerable as they should be with AT guns being properly powered.

One game of campaign game so far as the Soviets. Very fun game, but so far a little overwhelmed with how to conduct a proper advance. Had my artillery park knocked out by the highly mobile Finns at night.

Enjoyable game with low counter density (I can't imagine the fiddliness of games with even more counters). Focus is on maneuver and overwhelming force. Both sides play very differently. Soviets very aggressive and larger forces to bear. Finns need to delay and defend until more reinforcements arrive.

Interesting to adapt to the conditions (time of day and weather/vision restrictions). I especially enjoy the use of artillery (both on and off-map).

Played both the tutorial scenario and the full campaign.

Excellent combination of tactical/operational mechanics. Very well researched game, with mechanics that feel both clean and accurate. The overall situation is quite interesting.

The game itself comes with a bunch of shorter scenarios and you could do in a single short session, or the whole campaign. Plus it comes with a very cool playbook, with a good set of optional rules if you want to get a bit more chromy.

The rulebook is fairly well written, though we had questions about supporting fire, which seem to pop up somewhat frequently on the forums. But that's a minor complaint.

The box contains a fine map with large hexes, player aids and generally good components. A thorough research and design has preceded, giving lots of  hypothetical and historical scenarios. The rules are of medium complexity and after a couple of scenario plays you probably won't need the rules booklet. Although one can explore a plethora of 'what-if' situations, the terrain and harsh climate conditions do not favor maneuvers thus creating plays which become repetitive and lack the factor of a thrilling wargame. Also, the ranged attack mechanic and supporting fire could have been incorporated in the combat system gaining time in the outcome of each clash. The scenarios are intriguing, fast and furious combats. The campaign is a different story. It portrays the actual circumstances of the fighting: harsh frozen terrain and narrow road corridors between frozen lakes and shows what really went wrong for the Soviet plans: overconfidence of success, underestimation of the foe and unprepared for a sub-zero environment.
 
Although circumstances favor the Finns, scenarios are balanced and each player has the ability to attain his goals. Though the campaign cannot convince me that it gives the Soviet player any chance to make a breakthrough in Finnish lines and celebrate victory. A lone Finnish infantry company with a couple of machine guns sections placed at the proper road hex can give a bloody nose to his adversary for many turns in a row. Even when the Soviet player finally reaches Tolvajarvi, the Finnish change of operational stance occurs. It provides the Finns with bonus combat and assault odds thus crashing any further hopes for the Soviet player and forcing him on a continuous fighting withdrawal. Very accurate as a simulation but not balanced as a wargame.
 
Players should be cautious when choosing optional rules; some of them shift the balance heavily in favor of the Finns. And if the dice hate the Soviet player, then all his efforts will be in vain.

I'm the designer of this game so I won't rate it. I've had an interest in the Winter War as far back as I can remember. This is the first of a proposed series of games for GMT. 

I created Red Winter with an emphasis on fun, speed and competetive play balance. Historical accuracy was also important, but the first focus was never making a hardcore simulation. I noticed that the wargames on my shelf that get played the most are the ones that move along at a brisk pace, keep both players engaged throughout, are well balanced, and feature a unique gaming situation. I think I have achieved all of this with RW, and I hope others will enjoy it as well.

Jury is till out for me on this one.  A very unique combat system was a challenge for me to get my head around.  Why can't I shoot my MG at the infantry running towards it while they're in the open?  After two plays I still don't know if I've figured out how to play let alone how to play to win.  The Finns seem completely overwhelmed for every scenario and it's learning how to play them to delay the Soviets rather than play to defeat them.  Overall it seems like it can be fun, but I just don't think it deserves all the hype it's received.

RATING: 10
Played the full campaign after the tutorial, F2F.  Simply perfection for a hex-and-counter wargame.  Both sides play completely differently and both get to defend and attack.  Lots of interesting theme, and the amount of detail in the design notes clearly indicates that the homework was done for this game.

The campaign is about 2 hours per battle day, with 5 days being the maximum length.  Given the low counter density and straightforward rules, your head is in the game 100% and the tension is high; no wasted time dealing with counter stacks or rule-quests.

Now, to figure out a strategy to win.

1st campaign, Soviet capitulation just as the fog started to lift on day 4.  The Finnish had just killed the rampaging T-26m31s, and Pajari was camped on the crossroads North of Kivisalmi Bridge, knocking a good deal of Soviets out-of-supply.  Soviet VP was -10 due to losses, early armor entry, and only holding Hirvasvaara (OOS), Kivisalmi Bridge, and the entry road.

Brilliant design, congrats to Mr. Mokszycki!

Let me use a quote from Judd Vance on another game: "I love many games, but only a few ... are what I would call "game changers" and this is one of them, because it changed how I looked at games."

Good: grand tactical - winter war - easy / medium

I usually do not prefer tactical / grand tactical games but this game caught my eye 2,5 years ago due to the amazing information provided by mark m. 

Plus:
-Theme
-Designer support
-Production value
-Players guide
-Intuitive and clear rulesset
-Easy yet comprehensive system
-A lot of great scenario's
-Optional rules to keep things fresh
-Great solitairy suitability
-Plays quick

Minus:
-No rules for command & control; all units allowed to move freely each turn.
-Terrain channels the options so it is quite restrictive. However the gaxillion scenario's ensure there isn't a dull moment.

This seems to be a real winner and I am still puzzled it took 2,5 years to see the light (it took that long from the moment I pre-ordered to actually arrive) but it was absolutely worth waiting for.
A true labor of love and the designer continiously enhanced the game in the p500 period and it shows.
It has been a very long while (since Battle above the clouds) since I was that impressed with a game that is not particular of my interest as far as the scale is concerned.
Thw Winter War theme and tremendous pre publishing information made me enthousiastic from the start.
The terrain leaves little space for mamouvring except for ice attacks. As these are extremely the mid game saw two very careful opponents.
On the other hand the morale bonus rule keeps the game going and is a very clever rule to ensure the Russians not wanting to forfit their bonus day 1&2 and the same is true for the Fins day 3&4.
Anyhow, time will tell but since there are tons of scenario's this game has it all.

Great game but I got a good offer. Sold it.

A truly solid and entertaining wargame from a first-time designer, with one of the best rulebooks that I've read in a while.

It seems a rather traditional hex and counter design at firtst sight, but there are plenty of refreshing small details in the SoP, combat system and the different special units of both sides to make this one stand out from the crowd.

All in all a game that drips with history (just have a look at the playbook!), altough I'd have wished for some FoW being added into the C&C and combat subsystems.

This is a very, very nice game.  The components are absolutely top notch and the rulebook and playbook are incredibly well put together.  This is how wargames rules should be written.  Clear, concise, well indexed.  The playbook contains a plethora of scenarios and a wealth of information on the battle itself.  An outstanding package from GMT.  edit:  I've upped my rating from a 9 to a 10 (only the second game I've ever given a 10).  This really is just an exceptional game design.  I look forward to other battles using the same system.

The game is good, but lacks replayability.

Components, artwork & background info are very good. I especially like that it covers a formerly unchartered theater of conflict.

Rules are of medium complexity, if you know some other hex-&-counters it's a walk in the park.

Seems very balanced & packs a lot of chrome through nifty asymetric troop options. Be aware you'll need about 2 games until you grasp all of them.

Unfortunately it's the same map & the same troops every time. But if that doesn't deter you it's an insta-buy.

One ftf play of first day scenario only, plus one ftf game of the tutorial scenario (and a couple of solo tutorial plays to familiarise myself with the system).

As a game, this seems very well done. The scale enables a combination of some of the concepts usually seen in strategic-level wargames (zones of control, odds-based combat results tables) and some more usually seen in tactical games (ranged fire, assaults. off map artillery). It's a medium complexity hex and counter wargame so it's not simple, but a lot of thought has gone into paring down the rules and moving the subtlties away from pages of rules exceptions and into easy to manage numeric modifiers to the die rolls used to resolve combat.

As a boxed package, this drips love from the designer and production team. The art's evocative, there is a ton of supporting material in the box, there are loads of scenarios to choose from, from simple three turn affairs to full campaign games (historical and alt-history) that will take several hours to play.

I like that nothing's purely deterministic, everything involves the chance element of a die roll. This means you can't spend ages mathematically optimising each move, instead to an extent you have to use your judgement, i.e. there's only so much scope for the over-analysis that kills purely deterministic games of some complexity for me.

Early days, but I'm impressed.

Exciting for both sides, easy rules, but very subtle strategy. Uses classic wargame elements with enough twists and chrome to make the company level combat work for me. The quick playing system simulates the actual battle very well. Additional, the graphics are great, the map is very well done and works nicely with the counters. I found the set up game very pleasing to look at.

Pre-ordered from GMT in April 2012. Arrived 29 June 2012. Tactical level game which covers an under-represented theater of WW2 land warfare: Finland's heroic stance against Soviet invasion in the 1939 "Winter War." Lots of research done for the development of this game, much of which you can find at CSW or the GMT website.

I would say that it is not bad but it did not get me much.

Game is little bit too mechanical for me. Strangely it seems that it is pretty easy to score hits on ranged attacks and it is also much more safer. 

Victory conditions are not especially well set-up where it is usually good tactic to send some weak units to capture some land on last turn - which does not seem very historically pausible to me.

Also theme is not that great. You are fighting for some really insignificant land in middle of nowhere :-).

An elegant hex and counter wargame at the 'grand tactical' scale, which is as close-in as I like to get. Exemplary ruleset, the game is easy to learn and teach. The opposing forces play differently and yet it is balanced- truly remarkable. Also, the components are just gorgeous. A gem in my collection, a brilliantly executed design. Games like this are why I love wargames.

RATING: 5
A visually very attractive game and clearly a labor of love by the designer, but the game play feels very mechanical. C2 and morale are absent, lots of odds counting and die rolling, units can soak off losses with long retreats in a way that seems extremely artificial. There's some historical flavor but it feels  pasted on. In spite of a predisposition to like Red Winter, after playing several games I have little urge to get it off the shelf again.

(Rating based on several plays)

I used to be a huge fan of CDGs and keep away from hex-and-counter wargames. Red Winter was my first and it convinced my that such games can be a lot of fun.

Rules complexity is just right (I'd say slightly easier than Combat Commander) and counter density isn't overwhelming so the game plays fast. There's a lot of scenarios to choose from, which is great because I can adjust to the amount of time I have for the game. Playbook is truly a masterpiece.

I can only complain about components having lower quality compared to GMT deluxe editions. I can live without a sturdy box and with rulebook printed on thinner paper, but the lack of mounted board is a huge minus.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
So far it plays quite fast. The designer did a great job of minimizing die rolls and steps to the combat system and sequence of play. No extra opportunity fire phase or impulse activations are used which speeds up play. The system accounts for the effects of defender fire in the final outcome of combat. Even better no %^$^%# cards! A real wargame :-)

Only missing is some sort of formation or command integrity.

I generally like block wargames more than hex-and-counter, but I think this game is an example of what hex-and-counter [b]should be.[/b]  I haven't gotten far enough into this game to rate it, but there's a lot to love about it:
- the core rules are simple & fast-playing, and light on status/record-keeping
- some fun optional rules (although the only one I've used is friendly fire, which I love)
- [thread=902023]very clear[/thread] & well-indexed rulebook
- 17 scenarios of varying length, including a neat little tutorial scenario for teaching the systems; most are playable in 1-2 hours
- great, great-looking map, with lots of neat little functional touches like movement costs written on hexes down the main roads
- great support on BGG from the designer
- you could beat someone to death with a rolled-up copy of the playbook; it's got 30+ pages of design notes, historical notes, & photographs
- counters are clear, readable, sensible
- interestingly asymmetrical forces, with different problems facing each player

After playing more, [i]maybe[/i] I will feel that the map has a limited number of choke points & that most of it goes unused, or that the many scenarios will feel like variations on the same situation... but maybe not; I haven't played more than the first couple days of a 5-day campaign.  I haven't even seen armor in action yet!  So there's a lot more of this game for me to see.

The quality of this game made the designer's next game an auto-preorder for me.

Update: I still haven't played past the first two days of the campaign, but we were struck again tonight by how good the rulebook is, in terms of being able to find answers to your question quickly during play.  I will probably come back and make this an 8 later--I mean, it's no [i]block[/i] game--but for now, by gosh, I'm calling it a 10.

One of the best company-scale (grand tactical?) systems.  Particularly good use of supporting fire and the difference between fire combat and assault.  Most notable for the smooth mechanics (simple for the level of sophistication) and the interesting terrain.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Interesting scale but suffering from a boilerplate system that has virtually no tactical or historical flavour - all of the flavour is in the chrome.   For my money, a 21st century tactical game should at least make a stab at command control - but here all counters are used interchangeably, there is no command hierarchy or anything beyond a single leader counter on the Finnish side who only influences the stack he's on. Everyone's under perfect control all the time, no morale effect lasts beyond the combat phase.   Funny enough counters are colour-coded by battalion, but it has no effect on play.  Strong ZOCs and odds-based combat (where the defender can always convert results into retreats unless his units have to run too fast) removes the remaining tactical feel this game might have had.  (MGs and tanks can fire ranged fire, but usually to little effect unless they get close and end up odds-based, too.)  

The rules are complete but overwritten, marred by being distributed across three parts of two rulebooks, overuse of acronyms (virtually every table gets its own acronym - I don't think anyone outside ASL ever had a need for that), and obfuscation by unnecessary new terminology.  For example,  "Friction Fire" is explained as being "similar to opportunity fire rules in other games", duh, that's exactly what it is so why not call it that (and why hide it 65 pages from the start of the rulebook, it is entirely trivial).  

The game is really simple to take up, that is because it also merely plays like the four hundredth cookie cutter operational game.  By mid-game I found myself going on autopilot, and not in a good way - support fire, odds, roll, retreat, rinse, repeat, while thinking about what we'd play next. Except for the support fire and the occasional long range fire by MGs or tanks, this looks like Command's Krim with ZOCs, even the concentric attack modifier is there, though the CRT has fewer results that affect both sides (which was one of the nice things about the Krim system). I've never liked the criticism of Krim and its ilk as being overly generic, but I think by taking it to this scale,  the bounds have finally been stretched too far.

Summary: for people who like their systems bland but with lots of chrome on top. Tournament players will love this as perfect knowledge plus odds-based CRT maximise opportunity for local optimisation in play.

Rate only on first impression. Good overall quality on game parts. Nice graphics. Color coding could be better. Especially the tables. Color blinds will have a problem...

Rate revised (6->7)having read through all the material. Fantastic value for money! The Play Book itself is worth the money alone for a geek on the subject. Great research. Well written and understandable rules. The devotion the designer has put in to this project shines through.

Looking forward to play the game and to give it an even higher rating...

Raised to an 8 - This system really rocks! Mark has really got the ballance well in this system and very hard-to-design scale. Really enjoyable.

A very hard game to rate.  The game features beautiful components, well written rules, and an astounding playbook with historical notes.  The game system is pretty novel and it works well, although it takes a few turns to get used to.  There are a ton of scenarios, but many of them are variants on existing historical scenarios.  At times it seems as if the designer is so into the period that he can't help but create rules that show some of the unique things that occurred in this relatively unknown battle, so at times the game can feel a bit scripted.

Fun game.  Each side has certain advantages that need to be well understood and employed (sometimes savagely since some, like Morale bonus, are short-termed).

Unquestionably beautiful looking, this game also plays very well.  

The company-level scale took me some time to get used to, it seems like all hex and counter wargames are either Squad leader tactical or Third Reich strategic/operational in scope. The ranged fire system fits in well with the conventional Combat Results Table wargaming mechanism to make the scale 'feel' right.

A very innovative and entertaining design with lots of flavor for the weather and combatants.  For all the innovations, the rules are easy to understand and follow.  The low counter density is a plus as well.

So many have used the expression "labor of love" to describe Red Winter, whether referring to the thoughtfulness and clarity of the underlying ruleset, the historical chrome, the evocative map, the generousness and variety of the scenarios, the thoroughness of the designer notes and the playbook, the nice counter density, the selection of artwork, etc.  It is all deserved.  This is a great game, addressing an under-appreciated WWII campaign in a way that any wargamer should appreciate.  And it is accessible to first-timers as well.  Very nicely done.

No cards to play, no "tricks" up your sleeve. 

One map, a handful of units, the perfect amount of rules overhead in an unintimidating, user-friendly rulebook which feaature short, balanced scenarios as well as the more meaty, full campaign.

Turns play fast, combat is nail-biting and can be quite brutal.

No 'right' way to play, plenty of room for gambles and imagination.

When it comes to straight hex & counter wargames, this one left me feeling excited about the current state of things.

RATING: 8
Company scale wargame depicting the battle of Tolvajärvi during the war of 1939 between Finland and the Soviet Union. Every effort seems to have been made to make this a very playable game e.g. accessible rules, low counter density, numerous scenarios including some with a short playing time. The sides play quite differently with the Soviets having an advantage in combat and morale early on in the game. The Finns counter this by being more manoeuvrable, dangerous during night raids, and less susceptible to losses from the cold. The components are excellent and particular praise must be given to the map, which beautifully depicts the snow covered forests and frozen lakes of the Tolvajärvi region. This is certainly the best game covering this lesser known campaign, but it is certainly a worthwhile experience for those who don't have a specific interest in that particular theatre as well.

RATING: 9
Thoughtful & well produced, the whole package (the historical notes, excellent ruleset, clarity of the graphic design) give the game inertia that gets it flowing quickly. The graphic design is gorgeous as well as practical. A labor of love, excellent & impassioned writing by the designer, his design choices fully documented leading you into the gameplay understanding the remarkable story of the Winter War and the reasoning behind the particulars of the rules. A model publication.

The design favors playability. Each side in the conflict have very different strengths and opportunities to exploit. The asymetry in the doctrine, units, and rule particulars are held in a well balanced frame, a point system for controlled areas and attrition, differing by scenario.

The very cool night raid turns, the clarity of LOS, the vulnerability of the ice, supply tensions without burdening flow, the restricted artillary & positioning of mortars/field guns... all are lucid and meaningful so the story comes alive. The chrome is splendid, the field kitchen counter and optional rule just made me grin. Much thought is given to the many scenarios, and advice on how they should play help you choose them as you get to know the game. I'm learning like crazy and having a blast. 

Excellent solo play. And with the scenarios that are more than learning fluff and can fit many time slots up to the 6 hour campaign.

I recommend Trotter's [u]A Frozen Hell[/u] as a companion book. And the designer's log maintained on GMT's site is terrific and detailed, explaining his design choices and supplementing the historical notes.

Provisional rating based off of playing "the First Day" and "The First Two Days" scenarios. Both solo

Overall, interesting game that does take time to master.  The Finns are brittle and need to trade ground for time and the soviets are like an inflating balloon - the soon begin to thin out as they capture territory - making their initial strength sap away.

Things I liked -

 the ability for the defender to retreat instead of taking a step loss

Night turns - interesting mini game for both sides as they try and account for the weather losses and night raids

What I did not like - not sure that I like this scale - but I need to play it more.  Not necessarily the fault of the game - but to one that I am dying to get back to the table.

Still interested in operation dauntless by the same designer - but it will be a GMT Sale purchase instead of auto order.

Several nice things about this game.  The rules are simple to understand; counter density is low but still varied; the map is nice looking, has several interesting features, and has useful features; there are many scenarios; the playbook is one of the best I have ever seen and is chock full of information, and the turns are quick.  
On the other hand, the features on the map make many games play out fairly similar even though the scenario is different.  The game seems to become a slow grind against a few well defended locations.  The Victory Points in the early scenarios seem very biased towards the Soviets because the Soviets get 2-3X VP for reduced and eliminated units.

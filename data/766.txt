Game is complete +.
I added the '+' because I have also added a wind indicator (3D with knob) from an older 3M version.
Along with that bonus, all 6 yachts, 4 course markers, 2 dice (1 red & 1 white), 6 spinnaker cards, 1 committee boat, 1 Wind Indicator, rule set and 3 part board are all present and accounted for.  Some of the paint has chipped off some of the metal pieces, most noticeably on the high points of the white committee boat.  Box condition is solid (no split corners) with shelf wear on edges and corners.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Complete copy.
Box bottom: One split corner, round blemish (1/2" diameter) from old price tag.
Box top: Solid, some shelf wear, blemishes on front and sides from either price tag or tape 
All yachts, course markers, original dice, committee boat, spinnaker cards, and wind direction marker are present and accounted for. Committee boat has some paint chipping off of high points and wind direction marker has a pin hole through the middle, with matching pin hole on compass rose on the board. Clever idea for play, however pin holes are hard to see.
Ready to be played.

RATING: 7
As with other 3M racing games, production values are excellent (in a retro way), the game is a lot of fun with the right crowd, and it is a very good simulation of its sport.  To some, that will not be "fun" enough.  The die in this game effects all players equally, everyone has the same special effect cards, there are no auctions or ridiculous scoring "mechanisms".  The playing field is equal, you make your choices, and you live by them.

That having been said, changes in wind direction can be a killer, we often play without allowing the wind to change heading at all.

Of all the 3M racing games, this may be the best as a teaching tool.  Players can pick up nautical "lingo"and will be forced to internalize basic sailing concepts regarding boat heading, speed, and wind direction.

As always, the 3M original is better than the Avalon Hill version, it is gorgeous - in a retro metal bits way - even by 3M standards.  The way the boats tip to heal with the wind is a brilliant bit of game piece design that seres a functional purpose and adds to the atmosphere of the game.

Well, sailing makes little sense to me but this seems like a solid, interesting simulation of the sport.  The movement rules are a little confusing to the layman, but there's some interesting choices to make and the way the wind movement is handled adds some fun turns of fate.  A nice game, all around.

The best sailing race game.  The movement of the boats is consistent with the theme. The wind changes are random and within reason.  The random # of movements per turn creates those bursts of speed where one yacht slides between and ahead of other boats as occurs in real racing.  The Puff cards and spinnaker use add strategy that is affected a little bit by chance. The only thing I change is to use Leader Order after all the boats have crossed the starting line.

If you like racing small pieces around a nigh-infinitely variable board, tactically blocking your opponents' wind (and thus movement) and having your movement helped or hindered by the changing breezes, this is the right game for you.  Pleasant nautical theme.  The game includes both tactics and some strategy, offset by the randomly changing wind.  Oddly, the dice rolling to determine both distance and wind changes doesn't bother me in this game.  One of my new favorites.  Has the ability to increase both the realism and complexity with the advanced rules. Unfortunately, it has a runaway leader problem, which it seems is a very common problem in race games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Highly underrated sailing simulation!  Very enjoyable, all the subtleties of real-life racing, and a great way to teach the tactics of racing too.  Very glad I got this.  I can understand how non-sailors might not "get it" though :)

RATING: 6.5
Regatta is an older sailing game, originally from the 3M series, which is based on sailboat racing.

It is a very simple simulation, but allows for a certain amount of varied movement with winds, positioning, and and other tactical considerations without overcomplicating things.

The 3M 3-Island set is really quite nice, and the game seems like it can vary a great deal depending on wind shifts and tactics, much as a reall yeacht race might vary.

Some basic sailing rules for interference and disqualification are also included, to provide a way to make things a little more complex/lifelike.

After a 1st learning race with 3-boats, I am starting this at a 6.5, and we will see whether I feel the need to chnage it or not.

Speed Circuit on water? Afraid not. A decent simulation, but no fun as a game.

Played on the 3M edition (Ability to vary the position of the islands on the board).  A very accurate simulation of yacht racing even to the extent that if you have sailed before you have an advantage (possibly a weakness if there are new people to the game or the theory of racing has not been explained) .  I really enjoy the theme so this was a surefire winner but this is a great race game and 3M from this example knew how to produce a beautiful game.

The only criticism of the game is that there maybe too many wind changes but we can argue this point until the cowes (pun intended) come home.  But what remains is one of the best sports simulations around ... please reprint it and sell it to me and every other sailing club around.

3M 3 islands version, pristine condition.

Because speed and direction are tied together when sailing, every move is an interesting choice, e.g. "do I do a short beating move directly in the direction I want to go, or do I take a longer beam reach move that takes me off course but which breaks me out of the pack and may give me better movement options if the wind changes next turn?
The 'right of way' rules, restricting where you can and cannot move, the ability to position yourself so as steal your opponent's wind, the idea of spending the first 2 turns maneuvering your boat behind the start line trying to get the best position when the starting gun goes off, all work together to give the game a bit of a chess feel as well.

A bit of a learning curve for non-sailors is the only drawback - and I kind of wish the sailboat minis had articulated sails.

The Luffing rules are hard to understand and explain so I'm playing with simplified house-rule
e.g.,' a player may voluntarily move his boat into Luff position on the LAST leg of his turn only'

As a game without a fixed setup, the sailing simulation Regatta can be enjoyed in several ways - short, easy tracks for training or long epics, races with broad movements at open sea or anguished bottlenecks between buoys and islands are all available. 

The game is driven by an interesting take on the roll and move mechanism (still relatively state of the art in the late 60s): a player throws a die for the number of legs all players are going to move (or for a wind change, either clockwise or counterclockwise). While this doesn't leave as much to chance as roll and move usually does, players have got to make the most of the wind before it changes... because a stranded boat against the wind has no choice of recovering (I suppose art imitates life in this special case). Through the use of a spinnaker and extra wind currents a player can try to gain some edge on the others during a single turn.

The beginner's rules make Regatta a flexible, rather enjoyable race game. The advanced ruleset includes right of way rules and legs spent on heading movements.

Vague rules and some oddities, but this is a fun race game with a neat wind and action point system. In 2-player mode it is far too easy to end up with runaway leaders, but it's great with more.

Sailing just doesn't make for interesting gaming, and even if this is as good as a sailing game can get (?), it just doesn't provide enough oomph for the gametime. And like most sailing games, tres impossible to catch the leader.

I played this a fair number of times as a kid. It clued me in to the fact that there was more to boardgames than war games. I'm not sure if it's the nostalgia factor or not, but I thought it was a fun and interesting game. I'm not sure if non-sailors would find it as interesting, though.

Conceptually simple with short rules but so easy to screw up and then forget about catching the leader.  One false move, a shafting by a competitor, or an ill-timed shift in the wind and you should just 'sink your boat' and play a filler game until everyone has had enough.  There is a potential for competitive tension, just doesn't seem to ever turn out that way as far as the leaders go.

 A good game for combining tactics and luck.  You can move you ship one of various choices when it's your turn, and how you move and choosing to "blanket" an opponent (which steals his 'air' and slows him down) can be quite fun in a close, tense race.

One of the best racing games, a good simulation similar to Leader 1. Rules are a bit of a mess, and both 3M and AH rules have their good and bad. I came up with my own rules that clarify leg losses from spinnaker, luffing, heading change, put wind change probability between that of 3M and AH, change the movement numbers when the wind direction is diagonal, and where you have to give used puff tokens to other players, which adds a nice catch up mechanic so everyone is always invested in winning the race. The customizable setup and race length makes it one of the best choices for competing across multiple races. Oh and don't bother with the right of way rules - a pain to teach and it's more fun and strategic when you can freely block each other.

Despite sailing and gaming my whole life I somehow managed to overlook this game on sailing.  Finally got a copy, or most of one, and find it to be quite fun.

RATING: 7.5
12/11: Discovered this game while researching Race the Wind, then scored the '67 version on ebay. As others suggested on the Race the Wind page, I play a variant with a mix of rules from both games. I also use a house rule for shifting puffs and lulls. 

While the boats in Race the Wind were the initial draw to a sailboat racing game, I've come to really appreciate the timeless aesthetic (and materials) of Regatta's components, the '67 version's islands, and 3M's novel gameboard that doubles as the game box.

I believe this game has the most bang-for-the buck, fun-to-rules-check ratio of my collection. Even w/ the mish-mash of rules, the game has the rare balance of being intuitive, tactical, and simple. It captures the concepts of sailing very well.

I bought the 3M 1967 version when it first came out, and have enjoyed it thoroughly over the years.  The boats "won't stand up" because they are designed to lean downwind, just like real sailboats.  If the wind shifts enough that your boat is leaning upwind, then you have to make a heading move (accidental jibe) to correct the situation.  This is prototypical--an accidental jibe will always cost speed, and may send you for a swim if you're sailing a small boat.

It's a good social game, with a lot of replay capability--redo the same course or set up a new one.  We frequently paly 3-4 games in a session.

The game components are best in the 3M game - especially the wind indicator.   The board is best in the Avalon hill version.  It can be hard to get the 3M board to lay flat and you tend to stress the snap every time you play.

RATING: 6
An adequate racing game, but far from the best.  If you're into sailing, there might be enough to hold your attention.  It's a simple race game, and there's definitely the possibility of a runaway leader.  Play in the basic game is simplistic, probably too much so.  The advanced get impenetrable with the naval jargon, so I haven't tried.  They definitely add complexity, but I'm not sure if they make the game more interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A very good sailing representation.  The components are very high quality and the rules are intuitive (assuming you know a bit about sailing).  The only drawback keeping it from getting a solid 7 is the fact that the wind changes a bit too often.  Overall, a small drawback in a great little sailing game.

I passed on a 3M version of this game twice in a thrift store before I bought for a whopping $3.00 (I think close to the most I ever payed for a second hand game). 

It is probably one of the better games we own. If you ever see it on a used game shelf, go for it. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have walked by it the first time.

Very hard to catch the leader. A bit fiddly. The wind shifts are too random. Care must be taken to lay out the course so that there are multiple paths to take to get around certain buoys. Then there can be some interesting decisions as to which way to go. Also helps to run longer races.

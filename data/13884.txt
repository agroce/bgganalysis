GAME: The Scepter of Zavandor
RANK: 828
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Takes the core elements of Outpost and rethemes them into a shorter (but still long) and more attractive game. Much more strategic than tactical. German text on the cards and playboards is not insurmountable but does add a bit more to a relatively steep learning curve. Counting energy can make things a bit fiddly and despite attempts in the mechanics to prevent it, it feels like it has a 'catch the leader' problem

Have one and three quarter plays. The game is very good but the play time is quite long.  Three or more hours with 3 or four players.  This holds back giving it anything higher than a 9.

RATING: 8
A very tense economic game with a pasted on fantasy facade.  There isn't a whole lot of player interaction apart from a few of the artifacts and the auctions, so it is somewhat an excercise in optimization.  I like it though, if it is a bit long for what it is.

110220 Fiddly, drawn out, very mathy and kinda ends with a thud.  Reminds me of Power Grid but clunkier.  Worth playing once if only for the historical value of seeing how Seyfarth got to Puerto Rico.  Update, played Outpost and really enjoyed it quite a bit more -- SvZ is a definite 1 now, much too fiddly.

A well designed game, but really feels pretty fiddly.  Lots of number crunching, especially late in the game.  Runs a tad long, but manages to hold interest.  The theme is ok, but the game is really about the mechanics and resource management.  It will probably get a few plays, but not a ton, just because of time consumption.  I like it a lot while playing it, then I see what the time is.  ;-)

I'm liking this a lot, some of the rules are a bit trickier than you would expect, looking forward to playing this more.

I like that the turn order mechanic is also current VP's (rather than something else which is only a part indication of your position in the game) which can be altered up and down, it makes the game very fluid and dynamic. The penalties/discounts for being 1st/last do make a difference and keep the balance.

It's very true that this is an economic game rather than a thematic one. There are a lot of things to manage and there's a very strong "economic engine" feel to this one. Rubies, in particular, can be quite strong, and you'll have rounds where you pull in just gads of cash. It seems like it's pretty much just straight-forward get the best kind of gem and make as many of them as you can, which is sort of one-dimensional, but it's an interesting decision to switch from production to points.

The more I play this game, the less I enjoy it and the lower I rate it.  And that's a little strange to me.  The mechanic of it is really very interesting but it's FAR too long and repetitive.  The playing time says 90 minutes and in several 4 and 5 games it's [b]never[/b] come in at under 3 hours.  If the game really played in 90 minutes it would be cool but the truth is that it just doesn't.  Perhaps with two players it could but there's very little chance of this hitting the table any time soon again with our group.  If we're going to spend most of the evening on one single game, there are dozens of games which are far better.

{1 play, 4 players} Despite the fact that it has some really cool stuff going on in it, I've never been a big fan of Outpost.  So when I heard that there was a "German" version of it that might be shorter, I was hopeful.  And, for the most part, this game delivered.  Slightly streamlined, much easier on the eyes, and I LOVE the runaway leader "correcting" mechanism (often a BIG problem in Outpost).  Our newbie game - first for all of us, with only me having played Outpost before - took about 4 hours, but I suspect we could shave 90-ish minutes for sure next time.  So my rating will probably go up with repeat plays.  It is unfortunate, however, that the cards are so small and that the player mats do not have ALL the starting info on them.  It helped that we played with English card paste-ups and store-bought glass stones:)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While this is an interesting economic snowball game (with an odd theme), I worry that the runaway leader problem has been fixed too strongly, in that, like Power Grid, the "leader" isn't actually the person at the top of the track, and it becomes a game about winning without looking like that's what you are doing.

Pretty good.  Looks like some of the people start at a disadvantage (the Ruby player in our game didn't get anywhere), but I think overall it probably balances out well (of course, that's just the opinion after one play!).

It was good fun though.  I had the gem discount track, and maxed it out right away, which didn't really help as much as I'd have liked.  I think the gold dust one mist have been a good track to get alongside it.  Might give it a try next time =).

This is long game and I'm not sold on its length for the gameplay offered.  Be prepared for a long game (2-3hrs).  Game complexity is almost in line with the duration and overall it is a good game design... mostly.  My biggest issue is regarding the "rich get richer" feeling.  That is, it seems to have a bit of a run-away leader problem.  At its heart the game is all about economies.  Increase your income to push for and purchase the strongest artifacts.  Get ahead and you'll stay ahead.  Fall behind and you'll ride the wave until the game ends.  With the game's length this is not as much fun as it should be.

RATING: 7.5
Played German version, 90 minutes set up, with excellent English language player aids from the BGG.  Four players took four hours, but engrossing throughout.  Having no 1 counters was irritating and an added but unnecessary complication.  One player bought the Crystals of Protection and Chalice of Fire and ended up with twice the VPs of the other three, who were all within four pints of each other.  This game does not appear to provide any way of pegging back a leader, which is both a negative and a positive.  In summary, a worthwhile experience which we were all keen to try again.

So, one week later and three originals plus two newbies keen to try (again).  This time a close game with difference winning strategy - lots of sapphires, the fox and few artifacts.  But still four hours to play (with my non-too quick opponents).  The apparent lack of an obvious winning strategy is a big plus.  The crystal of protection became too expensive after last week.  Excellent spare parts service from Lookout.  Happy to increase my rating after a second play.  Similar to Goa and St. Petersburg in feel.  I may even get to like the lack of ability to peg back leader.  A fairly unforgiving game where it is best to get the income increased as soon as possible.  Recommended

Reworking of Outpost, which I've played 50  times. Initial feeling is that this is a slight improvement. At least, the different characters increase replayability. A downside -- the game seems to add more time per player (because of options). 6 Player outpost is probably faster than 6 player scepter. (8 player outpost may be faster ...). Still, looking forward to playing more.

Plays very well as a 2er, better than Outpost.

About the only flaw to the game is that it has been superseded by Phoenicia.

Rating -- Indifferent

I want to give this game a few more tries.  Everything going on is very interesting and neat, but turns where each player can do multiple things with very little interaction can make the rounds drag on as you wait for your turn.  The game ended up taking about three hours.  I'm not sure if that was us or the game.

Possible game for 3p niche.  I hear that this is heavy on the arithmetic side.  A lot of people are turned off by this, especially me, since I cannot do arithmetic very well.  This is a try before buy.  If I can tolerate the arithmetic required of this game, then I think everyone else could.

[b]Try before Buy[/b]

8 Jun 2008 - First Play
Scepter is a pretty interesting economic model.  At first I thought the hidden random payouts would annoy me a lot, fortunately, I was mistaken.  It actually keeps the auction lively since the players do not know exactly how much people have to bid.  The Curse of the 9 Sages (bidding more than you can pay) penalty of automatic loss is pretty funny.  I like how each character is different and lends to assymetrical play and feeling.  The knowledge tree compliments this assymetrical feel as well. The Z-man production is very well done and is what I expect from Zev.  
Things I did not like: While the random payouts kept things from being too monotone, the rule that limits the change you get is very annoying because if you want to be efficient, you would have to re calculate how much you pay for every decision tree you are exploring.  Due to this the arithmitic is over bearing and really slows the game down.  I think this is the main factor for me not trying the game again.  I also do not like the fact that the game is one dimensional/linear.  In other words there is only one way to get points and it is to get more money to get more points.  So once a player is ahead in the income, the gap between them and the rest of the group just grows.  The designers noticed too and is why they had to include an articial rule of penalyzing players that have 10+ more points than anyone.  Also while the hand limit is provides a need effect of flavor for characters, it also forces people to spend money when they don't really want to.  People cannot save money for that great arifact/sentinel that the player wants and to keep it away from the winning player.  Pretty much this game is a great example of a snowball economic game.  I don't like the fact that there is no other way to end the game other than buying sentinels.  So for those players that got left behind in income have no way to end the game and hope that they are still winning at that point.  I am sure I am missing something but there is enough turn offs in the game and other good games that will keep me from exploring this game further.

Excellent! although a bit prone to AP, we needed another light economic game like this! The game offers many delicious developing choices each turn: more immediate income, the foundations for future income, the lift of some restrictions, the advancement on "technologies", the acquisition of abilities or scoring conditions...it's great! and it also comes with a nice theme. Will play again many times!

I had played Outpost earlier in the year and as this game was being described, I realised that SoZ and Outpost are near identical twins.

To be fair SoZ has a better feel for some reason. There are tweaks to the rules that seem to iron out some randomness but the slow start and tendency to encourage AP, especially toward game end is the same for both. Outpost had faster ground rush at game end whereas this game of SoZ seemed to really drag.

Although I appreciate the mechanic, the considerable AP as permutations are crunched and re-crunched infuriated me. Our game took 3 hours with four players compared to the 90mins suggested on the box. 

+0.50 of a point compared to Outpost but not a game I would want to play again unless I know all the players were fast and proactive..

The four-player game felt a little long. It was also confusing for the first few rounds, then it starts to make more sense. The theme and playing time take it a notch down for me for what was otherwise an enjoyable, well-crafted game. I would play it again, just not that often.

RATING: 7
One playing with 5.  I understand some of the complaints about the continual accounting, but that doesn't offend me.  The Sentinels feel like a poorly designed last minute add on, as the game was quite close from first to last until the sentinels sent the leaders rocketing ahead (each sentinel was worth 1/2 of what the last place and 1/3 of the first place players had up to that point).  One play definitely left me with a "next time, I'm gonna..." feeling, so thats a good sign.

Extremely good game if you like to progressively develop your economic base and choose bonus option.
The score system let you keep a close control on the situation, and the system deals well with runaway leader problem.
Multiple paths to victory. This should garantie long life to the game.
Some goa resemblance, but it is less abstract and work well with up to 6 players. Extremely tight when having even player number, for there is just 1 artifact type for each 2 players. The 4 players game is the most difficult, needing the better possible resources optimisation. Matches with 6 players can last longer for players will joust to benefit form last position bonus, thus delaying their progression.

I played one four player game and was simply destroyed.  I way overbid for a few artifacts and did not generate much income.  I was able to sneak in two sentinels for cheap at the end but it wasn't enough as I finished 4th by around 15 points.  Even so, I liked the game and I can see that a few plays would make a big difference.  There are other games I'd rather play though.

RATING: 7
Word of advice: if you have someone who can teach this game who has played before, make use of their services. The rules, in any form, are difficult to follow, although some of the rewritten versions on BGG do help a bit. A lot of odds and ends to remember and the amount of small-number-math made initial gameplay very slow and painful. This feels a lot like PoF to me in terms of very little player interaction (bleh), though the differences of each character add a nice twist, and I appreciate that there are more choices.

In our one and only "rule-learning" game (not logged), money was very tight, which was, in a word, frustrating. Not fun, not agonizing-in-a-good-way, but really obnoxiously frustrating. Maybe I'm just not in the mood for this tonight. I'll give it another go, but given the potential for A.P. and length of rule deciphering, I question how well this will work with our regular groups.

Having now played Caylus, and having a similar reaction to it (complete, total frustration at the starting conditions) makes me wonder if this wasn't a trend for the last couple years in German games by designers intent on "balancing" the games to prevent runaway leaders. If that's the intent, please, stop. It sucks the enjoyment out of the game from the beginning.

RATING: 6
A good mechanic in this game, but I found too much downtime, even with only 4 players and it was quite evident that I was not going to win the game an hour before it finished! This is based on only 1 play, but if you make the wrong choice with income and get stuck without access to higher income streams (or you simply get outbid) then it is impossible to catch up. As enjoyable as the game was, I could have done with the game being an hour faster - in which case I would have rated it nearer a 7 than a 6.

This is my absolute favorite boardgame, by a long way. The game is all about getting your economic engine humming and requires a significant time commitment. The time commitment does not detract from this game for me, its just that good a game. 

My minor complaint (and thus the -.5) is the desperation of wanting to crush a person who has or will have an important lead (you can see it coming) but being almost powerless to do so. There are a few subtle things, so it doesnt piss me off but I would love it if I could lay a smack down and that is impossible. You could actually beat someone up decently during the auctions if you have the stomach for it but yikes. This game requires the flexibility to adapt to emerging situations which makes it unlike 'solitaire.'

I havent tried this with three yet but it plays very well with 4 and 5 seems to be the sweet spot. I have to try it again with 6 before I say it's too long. I finally played this with two.. it's pretty wild how fast it seems to go. It may suffer from a bit of imbalance with just two, but I'm not sure yet.

I bought this, opened it, read the rules several times, and never got it to the table.  Traded away without even punching it.  It looks interesting to me, but my wife is my primary gaming partner, and she's not fond of auction games.  This is all auction.  Just not worth hanging on to.

Very fun game with an accelerated finish.
You think that you will never have the money to buy a Sentinel. Suddenly you have loads of resources to buy everything.
What should you buy?? Such aganizing moments. :)

Has similar functions as Puerto Rico with the Sentinel cards.

I do appreciate the game system, but all in all the game or rather the downtime between turns is much too long for my taste.
There is quite a lot of number crunching (and with really odd numbers, too), which is not my favorite sport. 
Although the game tries to pull back the leader and push the trailing players, the self accelerating engine system seems prone to leave less experienced players hopelessly behind after an early mistake, which seems too punishing in such a long game.

I so want to like this game!  I'm really concerned, though, that the tech tracks are not balanced.  The one that gives you the free gem cards seems to blow all other tracks right out of the water since cash is so scarce in the beginning.

I wanted to like this game, as did my fiance, but even though it wasn't the worst thing ever, and we could actually picture ourselves playing it once in a great while, we still couldn't justify it taking up shelf space.  Another game that may work better for more than two.  Overall, though, for all the purported depth of this game, all I could see was math.  Yeah, adding up stuff in your head over and over gives you brainburn.  I can't see how there are so many varied strategies - if you get emeralds, you won't get diamonds.  If you get diamonds, likely you don't have emeralds.  It's just gather up resources, spend them in one of 2 ways, and buy VPs.  Repeat.  The scaling up of magic production being equal to the scaling of the auction items also was quite boring, and leads to a very predictable feel - I buy this, you buy that, it seemed like there were basically two paths, and as long as you totally didn't botch anything or do something stupid on whichever path you chose (or got dealt), then you were guaranteed to be competative.  The only tension surfaced in the final few turns, in competition for that 3rd sentinel.  Yeah, this was a weird one - and why oh why can't a Euro have a fantasy theme that doesn't suck?  (Dungeon Twister excluded here.)

This sucker is long... real long.  The bang for the buck ratio in regards to playtime is way off.  This would be a 7 or so if it were 1.5 hours at the most... but at close to 3 hours with 5 people, this is a 4.  Pretty sure there's an optimal strategy to the game as well, which isn't a good thing.  Not much player interaction either.

Too long for the level of enjoyment I get out of the game.  I like games where you build an engine with the goal of out producing everyone by the end of the game, and this is a good game in that vein, but it takes a long time to get going and then ends in a rush.  Not a bad game, but the length and somewhat tedious math will keep it from hitting the table much.

UPDATE: Well, with Phoenicia now out, Scepter seems kinda futile. I played it again recently and liked it more than I remembered (and the previous comment seems to indicate), but it's still long and a bit tedious, and Phoenicia is so clearly basically the same game but so much cleaner and better, that it's hard to imagine playing it much.

Hey, an improved Outpost! That would be cool! I think the fatal flaw in this logic is that by today's standards, Outpost really, really sucks. So how good could an improved version be? As it turns out, not too bad, but that's a bit short of where it needs to be to come off the shelf. It's also way too freaking long. I think I'd play Zepter von Zavandor again if it came up, which is saying something; but I don't think I'd ever suggest or push for it, which means I'm pretty safe in never having to test that theory. Which, I suppose, puts the whole concept into question.

RATING: 6
Good if you want a minimal luck economic engine game.  There is always more to do than you're able to do, resulting in some pretty difficult decisions.  The only reason for the mediocre rating is that it can take a long time to play, and has a lot of downtime once you have the full complement of 6.

I have after three plays come to a decision that this is a little too long and it seems to be set as to what you need to do from the start of the game. Secure a good income base or fall behind. Get artifacts at the right time to boost your score and do interesting things and then buy sentinels for a final boost in scoring. If it was shorter though I don't think the game would work so well as it is the hard work that you put in early that pays off towards the end. Not enough interaction in my opinion, decisions seem a little too obvious on each turn so you feel like you are going through the motions. 3 Plays.

RATING: 8.7
I'm putting this at this rating for now just based on 1 play with 2 players.  I can't wait to try this with 4 players.  This game combines the mechanics of some of the best games I have played.  The track from Caylus, the turn order penalty and economics from Power Grid, the building up of resources to victory point conversion of Puerto Rico, and a good auction mechanic.  It is an economic game with alot of simple math, which may deter some people.  Personally, I find it endearing.  Another issue is play time.  This is in the Caylus/La Citta range.  Just a ballpark figure, 20 minutes for rules, 15 minutes for each player unfamiliar with the game + 30 minutes per player...means a 4 player game with 4 unfamiliar players will take over 3 hours.  So, like Caylus, I will probably play 4-6 plays before I begin to discriminate who I play with.  In any case, the game is deep, and should be in the top 20 in a few months of this Z-Man release.

Another solitairish optimization game. The variety of the different starting characters help define the strategy you take, and multiple strategies seem viable and balanced. The artifacts and sentinels are so important that the player interaction is meaningful when it arises. My complaints are the hose the leader rule, the massive length that can't be mitigated ala Goa by simultaneous actions, and the ridiculous theme. I have lowered my rating as I find myself avoiding this game at  all costs.

The downtime is killer in this one - and I generally don't mind downtime.  I didn't particularly find the Mathy part all that distracting because I didn't really care if I was 1 over my expenditures, simply because I could have pulled a 6 card instead of a 7 - so I didn't see the big deal in that.  All in all, its an OK attempt at an engine building/auction game.

Another build the perfect engine game.  A genre that's outlived it's welcome ion my table.

An early misplay, especially by a newbie, can mean *hours* of sitting there with nothing to do.  Downtime is a serious issue with the game.

One of the few games where I have quit after an hour and a half and left the others to play on because I had no chance to win and had better things to do for the next 120 minutes than watch them think :)

I would play this again but if/when I have the necessary 3-4 hours to spare I have a long list of games I'd rather play.

Almost identical to OUTPOST, although player interaction is a little less prominent and the turn order mechanic nearly useless.  Still, a fine resource management game with a lot of Euro "levers".  Probably the only Euro game where the theme actually manages to get in the way of play. (Edit: Nay, Reef Encounter is now the other Euro where Theme > Game.)

RATING: 8
Enjoyable economic game.  It's a little long, but so far I haven't found that it overstays its welcome.  The rounding is a little annoying - in that there are no single units of money.  I think this was done to simplify the rules on hand limit and opal payouts, but I think it also might add time to the game for no reason as people try to maximize spending.  I have enjoyed my playings so far, and will definitely play more in the near future.

Played Once, for for reference I love Outpost, one of my favourite games.

My conclusion: <font color=red><b>Stick with outpost!</b></font> Many of the subtleties of outpost have been removed, and the game has been averaged out too much to make everything far too balanced.  In addition, an attempt to remove the "runaway leader" problem with inexperienced outpost players has been added.
The incomes between the different resource cards are much too similar, all in all too much averaging will make the game too samey after a few playings.

The only thing it has going for it IMHO is that it is a lot more obtainable than Outpost is.

This is really a provisional rating...but will probably be there a while. My experience with the game was under adverse conditions in the first place. I'd read about it months and months ago. I got to join a game that had already played a turn or two...so was just given some resources to adjust for it. There was no rules explanation, so I tried to catch on by watching other people do their turns. Basically, I had no possibility of developing a strategy and finished in last by a good margin. 

The finishing last wasn't terrible. What bothered me was that the slow pace of the game didn't correlate with tough decisions. The interaction between players was pretty marginal. The theme is great and the components are decent....but I found myself prefering Goa for a similar game with more interesting interaction or Caylus for a game of that length with a lot more satisfying decision-making. 

In the end, I realize that I probably should play Scepter again under better circumstances, I just doubt it will happen. I think I saw enough of the game to realize that its one I would play if others really push for it, but won't suggest myself.

RATING: 7
Extremely punishing economic game with some vague similarities to Goa (i.e.: the knowledge tracks encourage some specialization and allow the players to do certain things better than others) but lighter on player interaction which will likely be one of the things that makes it fall flat with many people. I personally don't mind these sorts of optimization games, and there are enough things to consider that I find it rather fascinating just to try to optimize my play at this point. 

The basic idea of the game is to invest in gems, which pay out the game currency each turn. You in turn use this currency to buy more gems, knowledge (which gives you in game advantages), artifacts (which give you more knowledge or gem slots) or sentinels (which basically are like PR's big buildlngs...straight points). The game tends to start slowly, but by about the midgame everyone is generally specialized along some route, and the money starts to fly. The end game on this tends to sneak up on players pretty quickly.

As I referenced earlier, the race for Sentinels is akin to the PR big building chase, i.e.: you need to know which one(s) you're going for from the start of the game, and if you and another player are angling for the same one and they get it you're probably going to be sunk. The lack of player interaction aside from the auctions might eventually cause problems for this game as it could end up becoming samey as a result (i.e.: if you know "optimal" ways to play the other players don't have enough leeway to interfere), though I think this will take quite a while given the different characters and the different ways to approach each of them. The order that the artifacts come out in and the size of the game also serve to vary the play...the scale having the bigger impact because with 4  at the table there is generally some serious head bumping over the gem specialty sentinels and the game in those cases can take on a dramatic air as players are in a race from the midgame, know it, and do their damndest to be the one who gets that valued sentinel.

The auctions are nasty in that it is often difficult to interfere with another player who is after you in the order because of the extremely tight nature of money (it is considered part of one's hand, and that is always restricted by gaining knowledge) but that interaction is crucial as it does end up determing the victor in the game, which in turn means positioning feels much like Power Grid because going first will make it very hard for you to interfere with the other players and will additionally increase your costs. Unlike Power Grid the determining factor of placement (current VPs) is much harder to manipulate. It's certainly possible to do it, but it's not as easy for *all* strategies to do it, which mitigates, for instance, the power of the more valuable gems in the mid game. 

The rating on this started at 8, after more plays I was up to 9, and went down to 8 again and finally dipped to 7. I don't think it will dip below 7, but this game became samey with heavier play which led to the decline. I do still enjoy playing it on occasion, but there isn't enough variance in it for it to make a higher rating for me anymore. I might also add that in general the artifacts are slightly out of balance and the game seems to hinge too much on buying the elixir because it provides access to a very valuable gem at a very low relative price for what you get.


Notes on the 2nd Edition Rules Fixes:
The 2nd edition rules offer mild touch-ups to Zepter, and I think both of them are good. The 9 Sages track is slightly weakened, and the Druid is allowed a minor break in that he can buy 1 Ruby at level 3. I saw both of these rules come into effect in my last game, and I definitely think they have strengthened the game. The 9 Sages effect in particular is huge because that track is no longer an automatic choice at some point, as you have to time the advances to get actual use out of them. The Druid fix is nice though, as it can at least allow him to get some bonus power, as he is usually forced to spend the early game completely eschewing knowledge, which is a hindrance. The mid-game pick-up definitely helped make him more competitive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I judged this one a little too harshly based on the fact that I was playing with a bunch of AP-infected "serious" gamers and the fact that the 4 hour, 6 player game was just simply much too long.  With 2-4 players, the game is much more interesting, engaging, and even fun.  It's clearly an economic game despite its fantasy theme but unlike most recent German games there are plenty of decisions to be made- no hand-holding, "choose from these two cards" sort of crap.  It's probably closer to Power Grid than Princes of Florence or Puerto Rico, it's all about making your wizard more and more efficient while pursuing different goals.  It's a good game, I'm not sure that it's extremely replayable or one of the first things I'd pick to play, but the design has some compelling features like the gem management and the structure of progress.  The auctions are pretty slight, really, and can be dramatic.  The game is a little too mathy in the long run but I'm not a math person.  The English version is definitely the way to go- no more pasteups, please!

RATING: 6.5
On the minus side it is longer than expected. However we did play with 6 players and it was our first time. The other problem is there isn't a lot of multiplayer interaction so its hard to slow down the leader. There is no luck and its a momentum game so to repeat if your in the lead its not hard to stay there. The game does include some internal mechanisms to slow down the front runners and help those who are behind. On the plus side it has many ways to build your economy so there is plenty of room for experimentation and should remain fresh for many games. The card auctions which is the only interaction also provides some room to bid up the price to slow down the leader but you can always get stuck with the card your trying to raise the price on. I'm still very interested in trying a few more games to see some other power and card combo's

This game has all the theme I love of Talisman but in a solid economic/variable turn order game. I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this. It is mid-weight and about the right length (we finished a 4 player game in under 2 hours) although I can see it could have to potential to drag. 

The game doesn't have a lot of player interaction (except during the auction phases). For me, the theme makes up for this.

This is a good economic game with a fantasy theme only lightly applied.  I think of the "magic energy" as money and "charging gems" as "buying gems".  It's a bit mathy in that we had some pauses while we stopped to calculate how best to spend down in which denominations in order to avoid losing money (magic energy) to the hand limit.  

The first game was a good learning experience.  There are some things I'll do differently in the next game, but so far I'm very much liking this one.

RATING: 4
This game is well-designed, interesting, intricate, and ruthlessly demands resource optimization. I loved it the first time I played it, but my enchantment has diminished with each successive play (~5 games at this point) - what first seemed like a wide-open world of interesting possibilities now seems like a game where most of the options are illusory due to being provably wasteful. The better you get at valuing things well, the fewer interesting decisions there are to make.

The auctions are the only point of interaction; the auctions and card-draws the only points of variation outside of a player's control. I played a game recently as the Druid, where it seemed (to myself and the other players) like the first seven turns of the game were pretty much deterministic for me: if [cards total X], do Y; else do Z; don't bid on anything. (I actually [i]did[/i] bid on something in effort to try a variation on the straightforward/no-decisions route, and was suitably punished for it by the game; our conclusion was reached in post-game dissection of what-should-you-have-done.)

If that sort of optimization is up your alley, learn the game - you won't be disappointed. I prefer a greater variety of viable options.

This game is wonderful economic game, with Fantasy theme! What more could I ask? Apparently, game-time. It will take some time (maybe 2-3 hours), because so many calculations to be made (like power grid). But that doesn't mean repetitive, far from it. Instead every turn you will progress to be better. And the tension battle of auctions really makes it strategical yet also tactical.

This is based on only one play so take with a grain of salt.  The game seemed determined within the first several turns.  Once the leader was established, no one could catch him.  The only interaction is through the auctions, so there really wasn't anyway to bring him back down.  The game also took way too long.  3 hours, 3 players, first play, minimal rules referencing.  I would've rather played 2 games of Goa during that time.  The game to me seemed similar to Goa, with each player advancing along several "technology" tracks, and auctions over shared resources, but the similarities end there.

Edit:  I've had a few more plays and decided to bump it up.  Once the group got the hang of it after a couple of plays, it has really begun to shine.

Long, methodical, and dragged.  But my opinion seemed to be the minority.  I tried this a second time and still just couldn't get into it, despite my enjoyment of other games with a similar "snowball" mechanic.  The downtime is immense - I felt like I took about 30 seconds playing my turn and 15 minutes waiting for everyone else to take theirs.

EDIT: After another play, all my feelings were the same. If you like the basic mechanics of this game, but find the repeated counting and game maintenance to be tedious and boring... get Phoenicia instead. It's a much better game.

- - - -
Scepter of Zavandor takes a lot longer than advertised--and most of that time consists of very tedious counting and recounting of both your money and your current victory points.

There's a very good game here... I'd probably really like it if the money and VPs were tracked automatically (perhaps as an app or something). But as it stands, there's a lot of headache and hassle to this one.

Part of my disappointment is due to the fact that I came to this game via a related game, Phoenicia. That game takes many of the same core mechanics and really makes them shine (particularly the auction aspect).

In short, we loved the theme and the gameplay... but (with 5 players) everyone wanted the game to end when it still had an hour left. I was so tired of adding up random denominations of money totalling in the 100-150 range that I eventually didn't even care to try to optimize my bids.

(Oh, and there's also a pretty blatant catchup mechanism where the two leaders are heavily punished and the two players in last place are heavily benefitted. Rough.)

Grrr. The whole game's a near miss.

 Decent game with neat, reasonably balanced mechanics. The major issue is the length which went for 5 hours (4 player) for my first game. While subsequent plays are sure to decrease time I can't see it getting down to under 3 hours. If it played in under 2 it might rate near an 8. 
 I may play again, but probably only very occasionally. I'd rather play 2-3 good shorter games in the time it takes to play this.

The wife loves it, and I love her.  OK, I love this game too even without her also loving it.  I like econ games, and this series (SoZ, Outpost, and Phoenicia) really deliver on that model.  This is my favorite of the bunch.

Update: the one thing that I'm not too fond of is that some tracks are just plain better than others, which means that some characters are better.  I know that the game tries to balance that is a couple of ways, but I'm not convinced that those mechanisms are enough.  I might be inclined to try a bid for character choice variant.

This game is the spiritual successor to [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/game/1491]Outpost[/url] and it has the same benefits and drawbacks, for the most part. Players are competing to develop their own economic engine and this garners complaints of multiplayer solitaire, but this doesn't bother me, personally. It's very "mathy", which can cause analysis paralysis, for some players, which translates to downtime for all other players. Lastly, it takes a while to play. Even with all of these drawbacks, the core resource management and optimization is thoroughly addictive.

Solitaire-ish economic optimisation game with many ways to win, but limited player interaction via auctions. I enjoyed it quite a lot and there was very little downtime, but it was all a bit long for what you get. PR, PoF, PG & Goa all provide a similar feel in a third the playing time.

Wow!  I really enjoyed my first playing of this game. It's been awhile since I played a game for the first time and enjoyed it as much as this one.  It was a 6er game that clocked in (w/6 newbies) at 4.5 hours.   I think it may actually play better w/fewer players in order to reduce turn downtime and game length.  Can this game provide enough replayability?  Is there more than 1 path to victory?  That is the real question in my mind.  It is very similar to Goa...however Goa is all about the exploration track.  SoZ will hold up if it continues to offer multiple paths to victory.  The gems, dust, artifacts, special abilities (from tracks), sentinels, player turn order...There are a lot of pieces and many good choices to make during the course of this game.  I'm probably going to wind up buying this one.

Scepter is a damn fine game that is not too tough to teach yet deep and interesting to play. It goes down smooth too because of how short individual turns are and the relatively low downtime in the game.

I prefer the implementation of the timing mechanism in Scepter over that in Power Grid, but I admit it is even leaving me a bit cold in Scepter lately. I am not sure how much more this one is going to hit the table.

Players represent junior wizards who are trying to gain the Sceptre of Zavandor.  Basically an economic management game, where players enchant and disenchant gems (= buy and sell), which provides magic (income), which are invested in more gems, artifacts (special powers), advances in knowledge (more special powers), and sentinals (victory points).  Nice solitaire-ish game to play, but gets a bit tired and same-y after a while.  There are quicker "advance" games out there, Goa springs to mind.

UPDATE: Still a pretty fun game, but just too long. Furthermore, the strategy seems to be pre-determined by the character you choose. 

I found the game to be very fun, but the game is just Goa repackaged into a fantasy theme. The theme is what makes this game better than Goa (I feel like I'm going to Hogwarts with Harry Potter). Otherwise, I think it has the same faults as Goa: too much downtime and little player interaction.

Played Scepter of Zavandor for the first time and simply loved it.

I need to play it again to have a better understanding of the game. There was a lot to take in for one game It's rather complex with lots of different cards that you can buy. Also, all sorts of different gems you can also buy which each has their own value. It's with gems and magic powder you buy the cards. The better the gems, the higher your purchasing power.

Game is quite long for what it is.

Got a copy in a math trade.

*UPDATE*
Played it again recently. It was less fun than the first time. Not as I first remembered.

TRADED.

RATING: 7.5
The randomness in the payoffs is slightly annoying. It becomes less so as the game goes on, but it's still bad to have that variance early in the game, since the early game is important, as in all economic snowball games.

Still, quite enjoyable, albeit long. Hopefully the playing time will come down, though I doubt I'll play it enough with the same group for it to come down too much. Also, hopefully the randomness will not prove to be a dealbreaker with this game - if it does, I may have to use a variant with fixed payoffs.

Generally, I'd rather play Phoenicia. It's very much the same, but faster. This does have much superior components, however.

This is a massive improvement on the "Outpost" design. There is more player interaction and the "non-surpassable-leader" syndrome of the original has been remedied by a very clever production/upgrade structure. It might even be good to fall behing on purpose sometimes, as you get hefty discounts on the cards.
The problem is that the rules are very vague and obscure, and some of the game components are so tiny that you need a magnifying glass to be able to read them. Even more strangely the text on the already small cards is printed even smaller, leaving most of the card empty. But as the playing material is very varied for the relatively small price, this can be forgiven.

[4 plays] This is an awesome game, essentially an economic-engine game with a fantasy theme.  I have played with 3, 4, and 5 so far and it's all good.  If you care about theme at all, I recommend reading the thematic introduction in the rulebook so that things will make some sense.  It's a long and complicated game; the first two times I played, I forgot or misinterpreted important rules, but even though these blunders doomed my strategy, the game was STILL a lot of fun.

I can see why this game is popular, many paths to victory, interesting auctions, but the decisions came down more to doing math calculations than really having a tough choice, and the theme was paper-thin. It's very easy to make mistakes with counting how many auction modifiers you have, and it seems a 2+ hour game of strategy with close scores should have less room for player error to tip the scales. Remove the fiddliness and number-crunching, streamline the handlimit restriction, and you'd have a pretty good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like this one, but it's a fragile game where one player can escape the clutches of the table while others get left behind. As to what it is -- an economic snowball game -- it does the job exceptionally well. There's a definite rhythm you must learn or else while others are making increasingly sweeter music, you'll just be making noise. In a brilliant twist, you have a "hand size" that limits how much money you can hold from turn to turn, so it's not as simple as just hoarding until you're ready to make a big move. The game forces you to make some expenditures before you may want to, and this mechanism drives the interaction as you only bump into each other in the auction. Defensive bidding (where you don't really want to win but are bidding it up) is required here as well as knowing when to buy something just to keep it out of someone else's hands. Not for the faint of heart, but with a competent group it's a distinct experience that hits the right notes.

I quite like the pressure the game puts on the table to manage the balance of the game via the auction. Despite some 1s and 2nd player penalties (that are easily overcome), it's really up to the players to keep one player from getting bargains in the auction. Your action choices are centered on spending money on your engine and/or increasing your tech. As a fan of auction-action games (Power Grid, Princes of Florence), I'm at home here. Each of the 6 characters in the game starts the game differently for some nice asymmetry that promises replayability. 

Update: After another uninspiring and unequal game with both a runaway leader and loser (the leader damn near lapped the loser!), I've decided that my group just doesn't play this often enough to maintain the level of competence required. I can't help but think of Princes of Florence and how that game is better balanced; the auction in Scepter is much more fragile. Some groups may like walking that razor's edge, but it's too fine a line for my group. Up for trade.

A solid game. Fun to play. I've lowered my rating for two reasons. First, the rules are very difficult to get. I had to play a few rounds by myself to fully grasp how the game rolls. Once I'd done that, though, it was smooth and enjoyable. Second reason for the rating is game length. With four players, we were at the table for over 2 1/2 hours. If the game were set up to end after about 60-90 minutes, I'd be able to pull it out more often. As it currently stands though, I'm going to have trouble convincing my group to devote a full 3 hours to this game when they could play three other games in the same amount of time.

This is one of those games that require a lot of planning ahead in order to win.

It must have been hard work to stuff this game into a fantasy costume. Even after playing it I'm not sure through which crack the fantasy stuff crept in.

Whatever, who needs theme, anyway. Zavandor is an economic game in which players try to build up their "engines" (read: erm, what, magic potential? Not having read the rulebook, it's pretty hard to guess...). The built-in catch-up mechanism (stuff gets more expensive for the leaders, cheaper for stragglers) ensures that the scores stay pretty close throughout the game.

I guess you could argue that it works a bit too well. Since everyone's so close a lot seems to depend on timing in the last few turns. That's not too bad in itself but the game is maybe a tad long for this kind of finish.

Other than that, though, it's an entertaining ride through the, um, enchanted forest. Or something.

As much as there is to like in this game there is an awful lot that seems to persuade me that over all this is not too wonderful a title.  Firstly, it is extremely calculational, every round is about pure efficiency and how best to spend your money. The interaction is low.  There is a repetitiveness that sinks in as the game lasts longer than it should.  I feel that there could be a bit of imbalance at the off set with the random draws for sapphires which could have game breaking potential (Someone with initial high draws, over someone with low draws could severely pull away).  There also appeared to be a bit of a runaway leader possibility.   I didn't detest my one playing, and the engine is unique enough to tempt future playing, but i somehow feel that if i am to involve myself in a pure earn and spend money efficiently type game, I much prefer the option of jumping into Power Grid.   The "variable player powers" categorization for play mechanic is a bit of a stretch here, everyone starts on a different leg of the tech tree, but beside that there is no difference.

My introduction to this game was a friend posting "too many math!" on her Facebook status as she played this game.  That pretty much sums up the biggest problem with the game.

A game of economics with heavy fantasy theme.  Nice bits for the most part, but the cards may wear out rather easily.  Fiddly, and has a lot of annoying calculations.  It's fun, but playing time runs too long for my taste (2.5h+).  Can suffer from runaway leader issues--the built-in penalty on the leader is not very severe (practically negligible by the end of the game), and there's not enough player interaction to allow the other players to penalize the leader significantly.

There aren't a lot of really well balanced asymmetric games out there, but this is one of them.  The game is won or lost in the auctions, but there are other tactical elements.  Each player starts with their own position, although you can research any magic paths you want.  With as many times as I've played it, I've organized my copy to get rid of some of the fiddliness. SoZ is an auction/econ game with magic theme.  This is a game I've played and replayed because it has actually become more enjoyable as the nuances blossom with greater familiarity.  Rating based on a couple minor variants (same starting value cards, using a 1 chip to eliminate some of the math)

RATING: 6.5
Sceptre of Zavandor is a complex game with subtle strategies.  For your first few games you will just be trying to keep your economy moving forwards.  The game automatically gives you every opportunity to fail and move backwards.  This is even before your opponents get in on the act.  When the "magic mirror" cards come out, be prepared to lose your economic nest egg.  However, just working out how to get your economy moving is a fun enough challenge and makes the game interesting to play.  As far as competing with other players is concerned, you'll have a hard enough time competing with yourself to worry about them for a while.  I'll have to play it more before I can adequately comment on strategy between players though.  An interesting but confusing game, so I rate it just above the middle of the rating range.

Steer clear of Das Zepter von Zavandor if you don't enjoy games in which your main goal is to build up an efficient economic engine (Goa, Saint Petersburg, Power Grid, Roads & Boats, 18xx, etc.). Despite the fantasy wizard spellcraft magical gem fairy dust mumbo-jumbo, this is a game of building economic infrastructure.  It can also be quite long if played with 5 or 6 players, and I recommend playing with 3 or 4, which should take about two hours if everyone is good at mental arithmetic.  My final warning is that Das Zepter is a game that has much less player interaction than many other games, although what little there is can be extremely important: player turn order, bidding for artifacts and sentinels, and timing when to offer them. Mostly, though, it's a game about finding an efficient path through the obstacles in front of you, independent of what the other players are doing. As an optimization game with very little randomness, Das Zepter might have a hard ceiling on the number of times you'll want to play it.  At the very least there are six different characters to discover (the characters determine your starting resources and knowledge).  This game was great fun the first few times, but I've become less interested after repeatedly seeing the dominance of diamond-heavy strategies. I feel like I'm "done" with the game, but I'm keeping the rating high because it was very enjoyable for several plays.

This is really deep and interesting, although we found some misprints and made a few mistakes in the first games. The major concern is that beginning with the druid is a disadvantage? I increased the rating from 8 to 9 after the second game and after my 7th game, it's increased to 10, only compared to Puerto Rico in my game collection.

RATING: 6
A game where you take 1 of 6 paths towards different bonus tracks and try to tighten up the efficiency of your magic producing gems as you go along.

There are multiple paths to victory but you have difficult choices deciding what to optimize next. You always want to do about twice as much as you are able to every round. There is a bit of a learning curve on this game as far as strategy.

One of the deepest auction games out there. Some will say it is too long, but personally I don’t mind since there is tension the whole game. Because of the catch-up mechanism there is constantly struggle for position much like Power Grid.  There are several different development paths which makes the game compelling and really interesting. If you like optimization games this is a good choice for you, but not for those who dislike counting numbers.

RATING: 4
Really disliked this one. It is a game of continuous calculation, and reminded me a lot of the number crunching from the last hour of a game of Civilization, without the payoff of watching empires rise and fall. The theme is only remotely attached to the mechanics -- I thought I'd be a wizard creating and casting spells, but instead I was some kind of flunky in a gem factory. The rules in our Z-Man edition were a bit opaque, with needed charts scattered through the rules instead of on play aides as I would have expected. I hated the font -- for half the game I thought my "7" value cards were worth "2." Pretty much zero player interation. Oh, and it takes too long. A disappointment.

Very smooth mechanics though wished a bit more variety in the economic system (deeper). Nice material as well but could be improved with the use of icons. Sad that you are urged to write on your material to get correct data (see errata). This and permantly doing math prevents this game from a higher rating.( First Edition).
I had to downrate the game after about half a dozen of plays; there are not that many viable strategies and so I got bored to play same strategies on and on. So for me the replay value is not that high.

Great game.  Long-term strategy, tactics, bidding, and management of scarce resources.  The bad?  Extreme number-crunching, even while you're trying to bid and plan out the rest of your turn.  The figure of 60 minutes is insane... it's at least 30-45 minutes per player each time I've played, and more than about four players is just too much for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I've always enjoyed a fantasy theme and although the theme isn't exactly that strong it does help. The gameplay is what makes the game for me though. It's another game that gives you plenty of options but limits you in what you can actually achieve each turn. I think that seems to be something that attracts me to a game as I enjoy the similar aspects to games like Caylus, Puerto Rico and Power Grid.

This feels like it could possibly become another 10 rating but there are two things holding it back at the moment. Firstly the length of the game. It's so far clocking in around 4 hours and although that will no doubt get shorter with more plays I doubt it will get less than about 3 hours if you have 4 or more players. Secondly, in one of the games I played someone made a mistake early on that effectively put them out of the game and they then had to limp along while the rest of us fought out to actually win. That wouldn't be so bad except for the previously mentioned point about the length of the game.

Overall though I really enjoy this game and I'd like to try it 2 player to see how well it works and how long it lasts.

Edit: Played with 2 and it works but if one person gets ahead it can be very difficult to come back. It is much shorter with 2 though.

A really enjoyable game with some lovely mechanics of managament of resources. However, the overall feel is slightly too individual; it does almost feel like playing on your own as there is little interation beyond the auctions, which is the only way to affect anyone else.

RATING: 3
theme - zero; at no time during this game did I feel that it had anything to do with magic, or that my 'character' was anything other than an economic engine.  completely uninspiring artwork and components.

player interaction - close to zero; underwhelming auctions where 90% of the cost is fixed, and few of the players will be involved in any case.  You can't do anything to slow down the leader, except for possibly buying a card that hurts everyone but yourself for minimal gain.

pacing - poor; the beginning is boring and the end is anti-climatic.  You buy a bunch of stuff and then the game ends when some really expensive stuff is bought.

excitement - zero; count up your income, figure out what you can buy, and try to figure out the payback or efficiency of whatever it is you can buy.  If you get behind, there isn't anything you can do but wait around for the agony to end.  Note that all of the accounting is fairly fiddly and quite prone to inducing AP, even with experienced players.

RATING: 8
In spite of the game’s length -- up to 4 or more hours in some cases -- I remain intrigued.  The rules are short and fairly straight-forward, yet the dilemmas and choices facing the players are many and significant.  There are numerous paths to pursue, and one must carefully weigh all of the options each turn.  Surprisingly, this doesn’t result in much down-time, and I never felt I had to wait long before I was able to actively participate in the game.  Auctions are present, but since they do not occur each and every turn, they are not overwhelming.  And, in spite of the game’s strong solitaire aspects, there is still significant interaction.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Decent economic game disguised in a fantasy setting, but a little too long. It takes time to get things going, and the massive accounting doesn't help. Possible runaway leader problem, especially because you can't do much to affect other player's plans, other than getting some item before they do. The different areas of knowledge in which you can improve your character add some variety and interest to the game.

RATING: 3
The game mechanics is fine/works allthough personally a bit boring. The real issue is all design problem in this game.
Tokens counts as handlimits - In regards of 1,3 and 5cards - Very unintuitive
Front side of cards are black and have sort-of same "gemlike" picture - Hard to sort even without eye disorder.
"Buy limit" (that you cant get higher gems) to opal and emerald (or is it smaragd?) is not anchored in any design element on any board.
The design that your knowledge token "covers up" the cost is horrible (why would I look UNDER the token for the price to put it on board. Incase you must "cover up" you "show" what next token cost to put on board for easier play.
Fonts? Bad contrast and bad design - 7s looks like 1s, 6 are same as 9 with a dot (.) to small for many people.
This is just a small sample of bad design choices.

Liked it much many years ago, but when I played it again, it couldn't hold it's ground anymore.

For some reason it's a good game, it's fun and demanding, but at the same time, it's boring and doesn't offer much interaction. The real big problem with this game is, that it takes WAY too long for what it is and this kicks it out of my shelf. Also, it's a simple, but repetitive game. Gain income, bid for cards and/or upgrade one level - repeat for hours.

Some people LOVE this game.  I think it's kinda boring.

You have to know what are the possible upcoming artifacts in order to win.  Remember to keep some sacrificial opals around (and active) because there are 4 artifacts which cause all players (except the winning bidder) to lose an active gem.

RATING: 3
This game came across as an advanced GOA, where you need to manage your "funds" (magic dust and power/cash?) in order to upgrade your different skills in 6 (?) different abilities/books.  Essentially, you are trying to build up your capital so you can afford the better items (VP and/or bonuses) and gems (cash).

When a player selects an artifact, a round of bidding is conducted until everyone passes.

There are a lot of cardboard pieces in this one, as those are used to represent your magic dust as well as your money/power.  And you keep collecting and spending/returning those all the time.  A tad too tedious for my tastes.

RATING: 6
Wait. Is that right? Does this hand of 16s, 17s and 19s add up to 120? I better triple-check to be sure. Scepter of Zavandor has some really great strategic options, but the whole thing is mired in awkward arithmetic that really slows it down. The result is a game that just takes way too long. It's also kind of limited on player interaction, making the downtime tougher to bear. I can't even imagine wanting to play this with more than 4 players. Still, it's cool to see a strategic vision come together over a 3 hour game, and in our first play the outcome was very close (the runaway leader issues I've heard about were not present). There's some really good stuff in there but... it's just not something that will get a lot of play around here.

Having never played Outpost in which to compare this with, I really like the game but felt it's length was prohibitive. As it was our first playing, I've been assured we could trim some of the playing time the next play, which I do look forward to. It's a very nice looking game with a terrific chance for someone who is very behind (read: me) to be able to catch up (within 5 or 6 points of the winner, for second place, yea!). The math might be prohibitive though, as there is a lot of adding up small income cards to determine if you can afford something. And if it is played according to the rules, if you can't pay for an auction, you lose the game, something our group would not do (not that cutthroat). I wish that there was an English version of this available though, I would like to get a copy. Maybe in the next German order though. UPDATE: After another play, I've come to the conlusion that this game lasts too darn long for me. I really like it, but in our group at least, it just drags on. Almost 4 hours in our last outing with it. I may still buy the Z-Man version due soon, but I'll have to think about it some more.

I'll like it better when I finally win once.  Unfortunately can suffer from the same flaw as Outpost, that after some initial positioning for income there is little that can be done to change the outcome by mid-game.

A well-produced economic engine with a fantasy theme, but one that doesn't seem like it readily invites re-playings. Strategies are straight-forward and there is very little player interaction.  Learn the system, make a plan early and execute it well, and you'll be in contention for the victory.

After taking a long time to come to the table this has proved to be an excellent game. It has been very successful played with 2 and 3 players. It is longer than Phonecia and shorter than Outpost while fixing some of the outpost problems. 
Do want to try it with six, but certainyl a grade A game.

The only caveat I would add is that it is a heavy game and you need a group that will take this sort of game, you can't do takebacks very easily and on your first game you have to accept that you get the valuation of artifacts wrong and that your gem strategy is sub-par. There is alot to learn in terms of strategy.

But it plays well with 2 and 3 in my experience and many games that claim to play down to small numbers often fall flat as they rely on mechanisms that onyl come alive with 4 or more people.

Scepter of Zavandor takes the Outpost-style auction/development track game to a fantasy setting, where gems, artifacts and sentinels are what the players collect as they try to gain power and claim the seat of Archimage and the accompanying Scepter of the title.

I've not played Outpost, but I have played Phoenicia which is built off the same system.  I think this one handles certain runaway leader aspects better, based on a 1st solo 3-player game, much as I love Tom Lehmann games.

I'm pegging this one at a 7 for starters, with the possibility of sliding up further, or down towards Phoenicia (which is a slicker game- this one plays much longer), but which truly has the runaway leader issues I've mentioned.

Looking forward to more games of this one.

Since getting the reprint of Outpost, I have been getting that one to the table, and have harder time wanting to play Scepter.  May get traded at some point, unless I find something to love (like I do Outpost...)

A pretty straightforward engine game: take income, buy things, improve your income. Artifacts and 'sentinels'  are expensive, so this really is about having a sufficient hand limit to save your money for a big power play. There are plenty of economic games out there and in a crowded marketplace this doesn't really have an engaging mechanism to hook you, nor is its case helped by the fact that box and contents look really boring. Give me Puerto Rico or Race for the Galaxy any day.

This could have been a great meaty game, albeit a touch on the long side. Taking six players is a mark in its favour, though. However, many small details count against it: Lack of cheat sheets, hard-to-read font, and the money system. If, say, the random money cards were replaced with tokens being worth the average value (shifting halves one way or the other), tokens worth 1 (and counting 1 towards hand limit) were introduced and the tokens were reshaped such that they covered up the appropriate number of squares on the hand limit track then the game would be a lot less fiddly.

Where's the fun?  Scepter includes all the challenge and min/maxing optimization anyone could ever ask for but it misses out on the whole fun to work ratio.  I would've been OK with this game if it weren't 3 hours long with little reprieve from the monotonous mechanics.  Beware!  Zavandor is very mathy and stale, nearly encouraging AP in its participants.  As it is now, this game is way too dry, unengaging, and lacking in theme (sure there's theme, but it's super pasted on).  I'd rather work an excel spreadsheet instead since it feels about the same anyway.  No thanks.

The sentinels really steer what strategies you can try.

And the turns and auctions just take too long.  I'm good with math and all, but adding 17+8+6+5+10 and then counting your 10 & 15 discount just got waaay too annoying.

This is a great game, though you will be doing a lot of addition. Analysis paralysis can affect the game because there are so many cause and effects in the game.

Not a negative IMO as I love PoF, but some may see it that way.

I really enjoyed my one play of this game, but you better be ready for a 3-4 hour game.  The length did not bother me too much though as it felt like the game moved along pretty well and kept you involved.  If someone gets much of a lead it can be difficult to reel them in although the sentinel cards can let you make up ground with the right combination.

== Initial thoughts

First two plays with 5 newbies in the same night. This was the normal "train/econ game" group of guys. Despite warnings on BGG to the contrary, we had no issues at all with game length for 5 players.

Everyone enjoyed it, and there were several comments to the effect of "that's definitely hitting the table again."

The rulebook is on the poor side of the scale.  To prep for the evening, I read the rules three times and read every thread in the rules forum.  Teaching took 20 minutes, and we only had one very minor rule incorrect (Player II's penalty only kicks in when he, not Player I, reaches 10 points.)

I crushed game 1 by purchasing all three Mask of Charisma.  I was maxed on the artifact knowledge track, nullifying the Player 1 penalty, so I was getting the full -60 discount on sentinals. (Pro tip: If someone monopolizes the Masks, save everyone some time and just start a new game.)

Game 2 I came in a distant 5th place.  I tried to play the Faerie, and made a couple of critical errors early on which pushed about 1.5 - 2 turns behind everyone else.  I tried to rush to diamonds ASAP, which I still don't think is terrible, but I got sidetracked along the way by some shiny trinkets that never really paid off.  I paused a few turns before buying the two diamond cards on the knowledge track, thinking that it was better to get the cards than the dust equivilent.  This thinking is just ridiculous, since I was spending money as fast as it was coming in anyway, so my hand size was irrelevant.  I should have plowed straight through that track and used the income boost to build up my engine earlier in the game.

I'm very intrigued, and want to get this one played again before it floats out of our heads.

The order in which the artifacts come up and the speed with which they're bought does mix things up, but I basically jumped out ahead in the beginning and never looked back, despite the price handicap.

Bash-the-leader mechanic is awkward.  That's about the only thing I dislike about this economy builder.  Those who can't add small numbers very quickly might also find that quibble as well.  With experienced players this is a fast and intense game -- recently got through a 3-player in 55 minutes.  There are at least six distinct strategies (ruby, low-gem diamond, high-gem diamond, low-gem emerald, high-gem emerald, sapphire), which is an amazing amount for a game of this type, and reduces the probability of colliding with others in the auctions - two or more people will still usually collide, but it's not like it could have been, where everyone necessarily wants a subset of the items auctioned.  Except for the Masks of Charisma; everyone wants a Mask.  Scales well with any player number from 3 to 5, though (as with Puerto Rico and buildings) differing ratios of artifacts to players make 3-, 4-, and 5-player subtly different games.  Also playable with 2.  Six isn't bad either as long as the group knows how to play the game and plays quickly.  Unfortunately with 6 players one has to play the Druid, and that can feel a little scripted.

After 2 plays I haven't made my mind up whether I will want to play this many times or tire of it quickly.  Lots of accounting to work out what you can do slow the game down.

After playing at our last Games Day... nice game, but way too long for such a simple design.

The autions bog down an otherwise great little economic, resource management game.  Each player just takes too long, especially in the mid-game to figure out what they have to bid with... it you can't add your cards and dust and possible sales in your head, you are going to slow the game.

A good suggestion from what I've seen... get rid of the auctions.  Don't put any Artifacts out for sale on the first round and then, starting with the second round allow each player to buy ONE Artifact or Sentinel on their turn (TWO once Level 3 is gained in the Knowledge of Artifacts).  I don't think that this would detract from the game one bit.

Or, just play to attain a set number of VPs... say 70 or 75... that might work.


Another problem with the game is that in the early stages one or two players can fall behind, Usually due to poor card draws/lack of energy.  Once a player gets into the lead there is no way to stop him from maintaining it.  A good example would be if the Druid pushed to get rubies early... the other players would be at least three turns behind him on the Knowledge track.  He could buy , and earn from three rubies before anyone else... that could amount to 90 energy more than other players... a HUGE advantage, and one that couldn't be countered easily.  The Druid almost appears broken!

Nice in concept, but requires too many fixes.  Only rates a 5.

An accumulation game that has plenty of strategic options.  Reminds me of Power Grid in that there's a race placement aspect you have to worry about.  being first forces you to pay more for artifacts and sentinels, but also allows you some control of the auction flow - in other words, can be good or bad.

A multi-player solitaire game of compounding and accumulation (with just a l'il bit of player interaction when bidding for resources).  Offers a variety in selecting strategic paths to victory, all while making tactical adjustments along the way in reaction to opponents decisions.  I personaly enjoy this game very much, however, the constant number crunching and lengthy game play sadly doesn't appeal to the rest of my family.  The english paste-ups are very helpful and well worth the effort.

RATING: 8
Phenomenal economic game with a horrid, regrettable theme. But the game is so good, you soon get over the fact that you are spending gem power to purchase Knowledge of the 9 Sages and getting your change in magic dust. It's HARD to get past it at first, but you will if you like economic games.

This may be one of the best-paced economic games I have ever played. The increase in income times out just right with the price of available artifacts and the increasing cost of knowledge (technology). The two kinds of money, one public (magic dust) and one secret and variable (gem power) creates an interesting partial knowledge situation with everyone's holdings, which adds just the right amount of uncertainty to make the auctions interesting. The types of knowledge to invest in are fairly well-balanced and no artifact feels overpowered for where it is in the game. 

In fact, it is hard for me to find a fault in the game, except for the horrible art work and lame-as-hell theme. I like fantasy, but this is NOT good fantasy theming! The theme actually makes it somewhat embarrassing to introduce this game to others whom you don't know REALLY REALLY well...

UPDATE: After playing this game a few times I have found another flaw in that it can be very challenging to catch up with the leader. There is definitely a snowball effect in this game that is difficult to overcome. I've downgraded the score from a 9 to an 8 because of this, but still a very enjoyable game.

Played less than 10 times, doesn't get played more because of its length.  This game is an improvement, both graphically and gameplay-wise, over its progeny, Outpost.  Higher costs help solve the runaway leader problem, so much so that one strategy is to avoid being in first or second.  Timing of advances on the six tracks is also an important element that was missing in the original game.

Abstract from [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/405403]my review[/url]

An Unlikely Theme for an "Economic" Game, Some might see some kind of horrible Eurogaming slight against the fantasy genre, but for me it's more like a lovable black sheep. Zavandor is the epitome of an economic-snowball game. You take your initial allotment of energy (the game's currency) and set out to generate larger and larger amounts of it. Each turn becomes about making the wisest acquisition(s) as you execute your overall strategy. The game offers six paths of specialization ("Tomes of Knowledge") that are commonly available to all players. To prevent the "rich-get-richer" / "runaway leader" problem common to economic games, players receive discounts or penalties to acquire artifacts based on their relative score. A special set of artifacts called "sentinels" trigger the endgame once five have been acquired. Sentinels are end-game targets around which you configure a strategy. There are several viable approaches and several variations on each approach. With newcomers, SoZ is best played with four, which tamps down on AP and provides some competition among artifacts. If the game is taking more than 1/2 hour per player, your enjoyment may suffer.

Highly recommended for fans of complex, pure economic momentum games. 

Update: this game is at the back end of my 9 ratings. A recent play seemed almost simplistic compared to the deep, spacious game I remember discovering. I don't think I'll be willing to play this with three players again any time soon. The game really needs at least four just so players have to watch a wider array of strategies. I'm not sure I'd play with 5 either - there's room for players to go in more directions, but perhaps too many artifacts. This game needs four players to create a razor-sharp atmosphere. I'd definitely be willing to play with 6 if everyone knew what they were doing. 

Update 2: Tastes change over time, and while I admire SoZ for its rich and complex rendering of the economic snowball genre, the overall structure of the game is less interesting to me than it once was. Contrast this with Puerto Rico (which I've played twice as many times and still have an enormous appreciation of), or Homesteaders (which is half as long, has a wider range of possibilities, and more interesting dynamics between the players).

RATING: 7.5
Much more engaging and varied than I remember Outpost being.  ZvZ is an economic development game with special powers and priveleges.  It is somewhat in the Goa mold (and was also compared to Power Grid, without the grid), but with just a single "currency".

A key mechanism in the game is that greater values of crystals provide greater income, but that players must earn the right to buy certain levels of crystals.  When I played Outpost, I recall it being very much a stepwise process: invest in level 1 until you can afford level 2, etc.  Some of the additions in this game multiplied and convoluted this path, adding a more varied opportunity for strategy.

Main gripe was the downtime, the calculations, and the length.  We took 4 hours on our first play.  Admittedly, a lot of that was a function of unfamiliarity and a desire to overthink and perfect some calculations.  As the game progressed, it moved along much more quickly and became more engaging.

RATING: 7.5
Rating based on 1 play.  One of the few games where I felt giddy about playing just for hearing the explanation of the rules.  I’m not intimidated by the length since I found every minute of the game an incredibly enjoyable experience.  During play you get excited about the fact that before you lies a multitude of options and picturing how those options will help you is very exciting.

RATING: 8
A very interesting economic engine game. The interplay of gem value with hand size is clever. Making the most out of each of your card slots can be essential, but it's not the only way to make things work. You can spam lower value gems but without the hand size to back it up you'll have to carefully spend down every round. There's a lot going on with that simple mechanic, I love it.

The 'technologies' and artifacts add a good dose of strategic variety. However, I am concerned that the strategy space may feel stale and dictated to you from your initial free tech, or certain combos that work well together. Perhaps a knock on reply, but it's far too soon for me to conclude anything on that front.

I want to play more!

An intriguing economy game hiding in a fantasy theme.

Unlike other economy games (not my favorite genre), I find this one to be exciting.

After a few plays, I am beginning to see how to put together a working engine and make effective descisions on what artifacts are worth the effort at any given time and when pushing for Rubies is the most effective.

I can only see my rating of this game going up.

Has somewhat of a Power Grid style of play. Start with tight magical energy sources, struggle to increase your resources. Struggle over the choices to make along the way. Throw in an auction element and suddenly you never have enough money (magical energy) to do everything you want. There is certainly a lot of replayability early; I wonder if ultimate strategies may prevail or if multiple paths to victory exist? This is my type of game.

Admittedly the theme is pasted on, but the Outpost economic engine is wonderful. Great fun building your "motor" through good decisions and timely auction acquisitions and watching it power you to victory. Down time somewhat of an issue. Suggested that play passes to the next person immediately if one doesn't (or can't) initiate an auction and just wants to do personal actions that don't require interaction.

What a bizarre game!  I've never played anything quite like it before, but that's not necessarily a compliment.  I can see how this can get very long and drawn-out.  I am reserving final judgment until I can play with someone that has played before and can help me.  I'm able to teach most games to myself, but for some reason I had a difficult time figuring out how this game works.  Actually, I know what "some reason" is.  The nomenclature in the game is ridiculous - "enchanting" stones... "magical energy", "magic dust"...it would be so much easier if it said "buying" or "money".  I guess another factor is that I do not really care for fantasy themes at all, so all this local color falls flat.  Based on everyone else's comments, I think I should like this game, so hopefully I can play it again and reverse my opinion.

Reminds me of Puerto Rico, Goa, and Power Grid all rolled into one.  The German text on the game is only an issue for the first game.  The only drawback is the constant counting of the cards and figuring out how to get under the card limit (reminds me of Power Grid in this respect, all this adding).  This wouldn't be bad except I think it contributes to the game being so long (4 1/2 hours for our first 5 player game with explanations, second game took 3 1/2 hours with 5 players ).

I have taken this off of my trade list...it is that good.  
Regretably, I waited way too long to learn this game...the translations scared me off and it never hit the table. :(  My fault, as I finally got to play a friend's English version!  What a joy!  Became a current favorite for our group and once the group of us gets down the rules to "back-of-my-hand" variety, will severly cut down playing time (my only complaint with the game).

Update: 
Still good, but some of the luster has worn off a tad.  Long, and not much "surprise" to the outcome.  Somewhat difficult to catch the leader, even with the meager penalty the games gives him/her.  Very good, but will never reach greatness, imho.
End-game stipulations are a tad weak, imho, but still a real gem here...pun intended.

RATING: 5
Rating provisional. Definitely not a six-player game. It's also a little mathy, so especially when you're playing with people who like to carefully consider every move, it can move pretty slowly. Also, the theme is sort of tacked on. I can see this being a lot of fun with four or five, as long as everyone commits to moving quickly. When I played this, I committed to a strategy of (a) buying only as many artifacts as I needed to generate ever-higher income, like the elixir and the ruby thingy, and (b) buying as many gems as possible. It worked out really well, well enough, in fact, that I'm a little suspicious about this game being broken. It kind of bothers me that there are aspects of the game that are best ignored, like the Knowledge of Fire, which only seems to really benefit one class, and is so prohibitively expensive to buy into that no one (in our abortive game, anyway) ends up doing it.

Years ago I played a lot of Outpost.  Zepter is a chip off the old block.  But years later the basic design shows its age.  Lots of charts, longer playing time, fiddly.  Nonetheless I liked it - but partially for the nostalgia of playing Outpost years ago.  Since it takes 3  hours to play, this is not a comfortable fit with my evening gaming schedule, and despite some hesitation, I ultimately traded this one away.

Astounding! I'm not one for 'no luck' games but this one caught my attention immediately. It wasn't even the theme. I love that there are multiple levels of 'money' in the dust, stones, cards, and tokens. Plus your limited on the types of money rather than on the amount (did that make sense) so the money has two elements to it... size allowance and value/worth. GENIUS! I would probably play this game every day. However, I see too that there are set strategies for each character. If I played this game enough I'd find that there would be a set pattern to follow each time depending on the character and who I'm playing with. But that's a minor beef overall.

RATING: 5
This opinion is based on only a single play, but this is an economy game where the rich get richer and the poor stay poor - a frustrating mechanic for anyone who isn't already experienced with the game.  Clearly the game designers realized this and added a balancing mechanism, but I still think the game is skewed heavily towards those that get out in front early.  There seems little opportunity to regain lost ground, and it's one dispiriting round after another for all but the one or two leading players.  A very long, unrewarding slog indeed towards an inevitable conclusion to the game (~3 hours with 5 players).  I have no inclination to give this one another try.

RATING: 3
In summary, it's an economic engine game where you spend money to make even more money. There is not much thing innovative or surprising about this game and the magic theme is very thin.

The goal of the game is simply making money for the goal of making more money. There is no objective or achievement that you could do with this money. You just play to have more. 

At the end, you could buy special tiles that give you a lot of victory points, put that's it. Everything else is make more money and grab victory points on the path.

Here is a few things I don't like

The game is long. Our 6 player game took around 4 hours to complete. Second, it take a lot of turns at the beginning of the game before you can start doing something interesting. For example, you can buy items by auctions but the minimum price is so high that in the first few turns, nobody can place a minimum bid.

Second, there are auctions. I won't explain my self here but I try to avoid most game that has auctions (especially euro ones) unless it fit with the theme (ex: chez dork). The only things that makes the auction less annoying is that there are many auctions where there is no competition since the objects are so high that many players cannot afford them.

Third, the component design is bad. The progress track should have been placed on the character sheet, it would have taken less space and made it easier to player.

Fourth, some progression tracks are very weak unless you start the game in the track. While some other are very powerful. So there is a lot of unbalance over there too. I also hate the fact that some progress level gives nothing.

So I am really not impressed and I am not hooked by the theme either.

I would have better liked a game where you try to power up yourself in order to perform certain tasks, like quest, for example. Which mean using the power you accumulated for something.

A really good improvement upon Outpost; contains (what I think are) the best aspects of Outpost and solves the "runaway leader" problem.  It is still a very long game for what it is, but that's not a major flaw in my view.  It's a very calculational and arithmetic game with bidding as a central mechanic (not unlike Power Grid but plays longer).

I jumped at my first chance to play this game but was really disappointed.  It just seemed to me that there really is a limited avenue to victory and if you miss your chance, you're screwed.  You'd best have enough gems/dust to buy the significant items when they come along.  My second try I didn't find myself much more impressed.  I'll try to give it one more go since I just acquired another copy.

Not bad, but not engrossing either. Get yer money, spend yer money - very straightforward. Marred by disappointing graphics, though.

I'll play if everyone else wants to.

My only game of this was a 4-player that I somehow miraculously won, even though I had absolutely no idea what was going on when the first turn started.  Finally at about mid-game, I started understanding what I was supposed to do, but by that time I still could only make sapphires and emeralds, so the ruby track was the only thing that saved me.  Aside from feeling like an idiot while playing, I enjoyed the game and would play again, but it's probably not one I would actually suggest.

I've heard a lot about this game (and its predecessor, Outpost) but never actually played it. It's a meaty economic game with some tacked-on leader-punishing. Like Power Grid, which I adore, you want to try and stay towards the middle of the pack and figure out when it's okay to jump ahead. However, also like Power Grid, if you're doing really well, the lead player penalties aren't going to hurt you too much anyway. I probably wasted a couple turns not really having a clear idea of what my goal should be, so I'm eager to try this one again.

I want to like this more.  It looks like a good game and the economic engine (even dressed up as it is) is fun.  But so far the games have taken too long for the reward.  Perhaps greater familiarity would help?  Still tempted to try it out again, if I can persuade a willing accomplice.

My update in Nov 2013: we managed a few plays but only one aborted one with more than 2. It just slips down the want to play list among my group and the 2 player game was not enough to keep it in, even if my wife was more enthusiastic. So to the trade pile it goes.

This is what I would characterize as a 'meaty' euro, for better or worse.  If you like meaty eurogames, you will almost certainly love Scepter.  I like it much better than Power Grid, Caylus and Princes of Florence, which have all worn out their welcome with me fairly quickly. But, eurogame it is--the theme is there, but even the rules admit you are 'buying' gems, not 'enchanting' them (as the Germans would have you believe), for instance--clearly tacked on.  Lots of choices and different paths to victory keep the game interesting to the end.  There is just enough interaction with auctions to keep it from being multi-player solitaire.  All in all, it's a game I will return to several more times, but not most likely at my suggestion.

I *really* enjoyed this game. I had heard from reviews that Goa fans should check it out, and as a Goa-lover, I was not disappointed. The game isn't quick, but the learning curve isn't that steep. I expect future plays should go quite a bit faster than the first.

I do like 'optimization' types games, with multiple-pathways and tech-trees, a (weak) fantasty theme with well-balanced different roles/characters, and where solid bidding is important.

Bidding and resource management to build an economic engine that grants VPs.

While this is a very intricate and interesting game, I have too many problems with it to see it becoming a favorite of mine. My biggest gripe is the unwieldy theme, which makes the accounting seem more complicated than it needs to be, because things are not very intuitive. Another problem is the playing time, especially since early mistakes are punished severely. Nevertheless, it is very good at what it is, but if I want to commit 3+ hours to a game, there are a lot of games that have more appeal to me.

I love this game! It did take allot of patience to learn with the included rules. I finely, after almost giving up, came here and found some rewritten English rules which helped greatly! Still was plenty confusing, and took much thought and contemplation to play through the first game. Lots of calculating numbers in this game. You might want to bring a calculator. after all this though, the game can move along quite smoothly, and is really allot of fun. Glad I had the patience to learn it!  Better download the English rules from BGG before you attempt this one.

2 1/2 plays with 2 players! I will try 3 or 4 players next time. Was great fun though with just 2!

I think it is another game for planners and optimizers, with all that analyzability and solitary feeling... And the theme is applied conceptually, not visually.

But I also think different character powers would increase replayability, and game play felt more thematic than I have expected.

Another one that doesn't give up its secrets easily to one trying to learn from a rule-reading unpolluted by any experience with the game.

I played "Outpost" once, and watched helplessly for a couple hours as the two experienced players (among 6) ran off and left the rest of us to gape and wonder which of them would win.  Being a glutton for punishment, I bought Scepter, hoping to redeem myself.  Haven't wrapped my head around how to play, and may not get around to it given the number of other choices available.

I would like to try this again before I give it an official score, but this game does not bode well. The game, at least the edition that I played, was very badly designed and the artifact cards were very unclear. The rulebook also suffered from a poor layout, forcing many frustrating instances in trying to clarify misunderstandings. I want to like this game, but it will be difficult.

(edit) Ive now played the game a full time with two players and I was not impressed. I got totally demolished that we called the game and I conceided victory. There seems to be few paths to victory and as soon as one person gets ahead, it goes exponential. I still would like to try it with more people to see if it is less bad.

(edit) Playing it with more people, and knowing "how" to play (though I hate being forced to play in a specific order when the game appears to be open ended) my like of the game has decreased. This game is slightly fun, but my time can be spent playing better games.

New in collection sept 07.
Nice surprise gift from a familiar vendor to make up for some missing communication after a fault in a previous bought game. 

Economic game with a fantasy theme. Weird combination. Rulebook from hell.

I had the first German edition that needs lots of paste ups and helping printouts (to solve errors). 

No wonder it took more than a year to hit the table. It's a bit of a miracle I got to play it at all. Took (too) much time to get that 1st game going. Game itself is ok though. I might even say 'good' if the theme fitted the game, which it doesn't, and if the game was shorter. I don't mind long games, but for the length this takes there are a lot of games that deliver more.

 UPDATE: Traded away, bought the original (Outpost)

RATING: 5
Reminiscent of Goa, but without as much "soul". This one felt much more mathematical/linear/intelectual than the visceral experience of goa. It seems like in Scepter, you should upgrade your economy at any chance you get, the bonuses given by the early artifacts aren't as important as generating more income than your opponents. This removes a lot of the angst in the game (and makes the first 3-6 rounds feel more like an extended setup phase). Also, always calculating/re-calculating the value of your hand gets frustrating and hurts the brain by the end of the game.
Still, it's a decent game
Note: the rules with the z-man translation are a little "holey" and not the best I have ever seen.. make sure you get the clarified rules here on the geek.
Update: lowered to 5 after discovering Phoenicia

Too calculating, too long and too cold for my tastes.  However, I would like to try it again with a smaller group (the 6-player game is ridiculous).  If you like building economic engines and don't mind minimal player interaction you should definitely check it out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Enjoyed the game very much, but disliked the shallow fantasy theme completely.  The economic income flow creation / income generation aspects were great and could have easily taken any of a number of other themes.  A lot of emphasis was put into the artwork to make it fit the theme, but this was to the game's detriment.  Much of the text was hard to decipher, and the usability of the player mat was degraded because of the emphasis on making it look like a video game RPG.

This was surprisingly enjoyable, considering that I have owned it for a long time and the rules were not enticing.

Turns out that the outpost-like bidding and income escalation plays quite well. The leveling of abilities is a neat addition. A slightly greater variety of artifacts would be nice.

This is a nice game.

There's an element of "multi-player solitaire" in the game, as the interaction only appears in the bidding and (occasionally) the abilities of the artifacts.

I've seen games of this one with a runaway leader, and it seems tough to catch someone who gets too far ahead.

The catch-up mechanic seems like it only works properly in a 6-player game.

The game seems to hang around a little long, although once the Sentinels start to get bought, the end comes very quickly.

All that said, I do enjoy the game.

I guess the problem is summed up somewhere above: Time-wise, the game needs four players to be about right, and yet mechanics-wise, it seems to beed the full six players.

Great game. I don't expect to play this with anyone but my wife - we both get into the heavy economic euro goodness. I really enjoy this and if it weren't for the fiddly calculations that slow it down towards the last quarter of the game I'd give it a 9 or higher. Even still, with just two players it doesn't take an unreasonable amount of time.

I like optimization games, but Zepter has some serious flaws in my opinion. The whole money and hand limit system should be tossed out - I can't see what good it does for the game, it just makes it long and complicated.

Biggest problem is the nature of the game. It's very strongly rich-get-richer, which is not good in a long and complicated game. You can see you're losing fairly soon and then you'll have drag on for hour or two. Not good.

Basic idea is very interesting and I'm not saying I won't play again, but you can be sure I'm not in a rush to get this one. Now that Phoenicia is out, there's absolutely no reason to play Zavandor.

Indifferent.

Two plays.  Rating has actually gone down .5 points.  An overly complicated economic system caused the game to drag on for longer than it should.  This is largely due to the calculations needed for many fiddly parts in the game.

An interesting economic engine building game, with a cleverly tactical auction component (since auctions come on players' turns, and players have limited amounts of money they can keep at the end of their turns, players in later turn order can time an auction so that no one else has any money left to compete). Unfortunately, the first game ran way longer than a game like this should (3h), and it seems it's a common problem with this one.

This game was much hyped when it first came out, so I was hoping for something that would knock my socks off.  Unfortunately, it didn't.  It's a good game, but not a great one.  At it's heart, it's an economic game where the goal is to maximize production- you buy stuff so that you can get more money to buy new and better stuff.  If that's all there was to the game, I'd probably give it a five, but it also has an auction component, which makes the decisions on how to spend your money a bit more challenging.

The theme seemed very pasted on to me- I understand that this is a close relative of Outpost, a game where  you run a moon colony instead of a Harry Potter wanna-be.  The game would work just as well with that theme, or any other economic theme.

My comments probably sound a little harsh, which isn't really fair- I DO like the game and will gladly play again.  I just don't think it lives up to the early hype that I was hearing.

Scepter of Zavandor is yet another efficiency-engine game, but this time wrapped in fantasy clothing. It's not a race-to-the-finish game like MoV but a point-churning optimization exercise based on Outpost [in turn based on Civilization]. Instead of buying up space technology or building granaries and farms in some vaguely ancient city-state, you're enchanting magical gems and collecting fairy dust.

Really now, isn't that a better theme, objectively speaking? There are plenty of fantasy games and plenty of economic efficiency games, but there are precious few that so overtly overturn the thematic conventions of both genres. I still don't get why this game has never been in BGG's top ten given what else has lived there. It's not my favorite game, but it's among my favorites of the point-churners.

Produce different types of gems to earn gold, bid for artifacts, and advance on 6 different tracks (reduce prices for gems, get base gold, reduce prices for artificats, hold more gems, get bonus cards, earn ability to buy rubies). Some artifacts give you discounts for more expensive artifacts. Balancing mechanism is that current leaders of the game must pay more when bidding for artifacts and current losers have to pay less. However, in our only game with 6 players, it took more than four hours! We missed one key rule where only active gems score VPs as well. I am willing to play again, but not if it takes 4 hours. There are some neat concepts here.

Comes across as a bit like Harry Potter.  I liked it.  The mechanics are a bit repetitive, but all in all it's pretty solid.  Once Sentinels start to get bought up, the game ends in a hurry.

Overall, a good game.

Preliminary rating based on one play.  What keeps it from being great are the time it takes to play and the fiddliness of the energy denominations.  Those two problems are linked, IMO.

The snowball effect of a runaway leader is dampened by penalties for the leaders and benefits for last place... not enough benefit to STAY there, but a nice equalizer.  Lots of strategies, minimal luck, cheesy tacked-on theme.

I still prefer my old beloved Outpost to this one. Zepter is more beautiful. Zepter has some nice additions (knowledge-tracks). Zepter has a lesser leader-runaway problem. 
But Oupost was first - and it has a better fitting theme. The fantasy theme in Zepter doesn't work for me. I will never enchant or disenchant juwels. I might stop talking about diamond factories and opal production sometime ...

Economy and Auction - a little dry perhaps, but a challenging game to wrap your mind around - the rules are NOT filled with a lot of 'chrome' or difficult to forget exceptions which makes this a real winner.

Too unforgiving considering its length - you might find yourself waiting for the game to be over for 45 minutes if a strategy you tried didn't work out. This is why it might take a few games until you really enjoy it. But it's worth the patience.

An enjoyable game. Found the rules very hard to follow, but downloaded a much clearer version from here. Although I enjoyed some aspects of the game I also found it a bit fiddly. It was a pain constantly having to calculate odd bits of money and to recalculate the victory points every turn. The fiddliness and length mean reduced how much I enjoy it.

I like the game, but.... A couple of things should had been tweaked with the game components. Gem cards should have been coloured on the back so you know which discard pile to put them in. Gems should have the VP on the front so you can see, not the back. Little things - but would make it easier to play.

I think the number of believed viable winning paths might have lessened with replay, but we're still enjoying exploring it and re-valuing the artifacts with our experience. Getting combinations of artifacts working together is key. Determining who's likely to bid up what and claiming a different path is a strategic element, as a couple of bidding wars can be death. Knowing when to hold back money for next turn, versus investing it now in a bigger engine provides multiple turning points through the game. The choice on which tech trees to invest in is also key. With so many key decisions to make throughout, it's a game I always enjoy.

2/26/11 - First play today and I was the fairy character. I was lost as the rules were explained to me and about the third round I finally got the hang of it. I stuck with emeralds and followed the gem specialist, artifact and extra gem schools. With the purchases of the wand and belt I managed to stock pile emeralds to a second place finish. I would have liked the game more if it didn't take so long to play. 2+ hours on this game wasn't worth the time.

This game is basically an economic game where you try to increase your income earned from turn to turn by upgrading gems, buying artifacts and learning spells. The theme makes the game all the more interesting when first looked at but after a few rounds, you notice that it is just tacked on. Although it may be tough the first time, there are mechanisms that help out the players in last while hurting those in the lead. The play is fairly straightforward but as you must plan ahead you may be stuck near the back on your first game. I'm glad I held onto this game.

RATING: 7
Despite the fanciful theme, this is more of a heavy economics game than anything else.  You're trying to build an efficient engine by buying "gems" (for which you have limited room) that give you varying amounts of "energy" each turn.  The game prevents you from saving up for big point moves, so you really need to focus on your turn-to-turn production.  The game is fairly long, and strategies aren't immediately apparent, so if you like this sort of game, make sure to play it a few times before passing final judgment.  If you don't like long economic efficiency games, just give it a pass.

Overall a fun game, but it out-stays its welcome.  Each round has the same mechanics, so at 2.5 h (with experienced players) it just goes a bit too long.  Happy to play if it is brought out, but would never request (or buy) it.  Lots of arithmetic.  Could use some streamlining.

1 of the only multiplayer solitaire games that I really enjoy.  The auction does add a little interaction (and it can be quite crucial), but it requires more than 2 players to really shine with the auction, and each player adds 45 mins to the gametime.  A long game, but enjoyable.  People who don't enjoy math need not apply.

I'm not entirely sure why but this game really didn't click for me. It really took me about a third of the game to figure out what was going on and by then I was so far behind with my economic engine that I couldn't do much to catch up by that point. It felt more frustrating than fun... (normally I do quite badly on a first play of a game but enjoy it anyway.... in this case, I played badly and felt mostly annoyed that I couldn't seem to get anywhere.)

Overall, this was probably just too mathy for me.

An okay game.  Nothing really exciting or innovative, and takes about twice as long as it should.

Reminds me of both Princes of Florence and Goa, both of which I like better and play quicker.

Quick Synopsis:

:thumbsup: - Heavy and engaging.  Mega machine building.
:thumbsup: - Clearly multiple ways to achieve victory.
:thumbsup: - Overall good quality of components.

:thumbsdown: - Rulebook.  You've gotta read this thing front-to-back as it's not intuitive and there are no reference sheets. This is especially bothersome when you sit down for your first play.
:thumbsdown: - Theme.  This is silly.  I would have much preferred if this were stripped of its 'wizards' theme and exported into something like 'foreign trade' or 'currency markets'.  Just call a spade a spade already.
:thumbsdown: - Presentation.  The box is uninspiring, the magic dust looks like dead moths, and the game is riddled with foreign languages.  (sorry, I hate that the game gets busy with wording.  Make a German copy.  Make an English copy.  Simple.  Don't make one type that serves both languages.  It's brutal.)
:thumbsdown: - Length.  Stab me in the face, the length is just unnessasary.. and the length could have been mitigated by reducing the costs for guardians and other things.

I highly doubt that this game will get solid play by a full table any time soon, as 1) I own other games that do something similar and play in a shorter time 2) the theme is silly, would have been better if the game 'matured' and stripped itself of it's D&D-style trappings 3) explaining this thing just isn't feeling fun.

For a 3+ hour heavier strategy game, this one does not deliver. Very fiddly, unforgiving, and practically broken at the endgame with the Sentinel tiles. It is an economics games with income rising in a geometric progression form. One mistake in the first couple of turns and you are practically out of the game. It should come with a warning: Do not buy a card in the first round - buy gems!
I've seen SoZ compared to Goa or Puerto Rico. To me, that is an insult to those games.
Rated on: 06/29/06.

Update 09/22/07:  The 2007 game, Phoenicia, is very similar but is less bloated and much shorter.  I would rather play that than SoZ.

This is a game where you race to grab up as many points as possible before the tiles running out, by increasing your currency production and investing in some very basic tech trees.

Nicely produced with great theme. However after a few plays we're not convinced that it isn't broken. We get the feeling that one of the tracks is too powerful (ruby track I think) and thus a sure path to victory every time. We didn't want to waste anymore time finding out and moved on to other games.

RATING: 6.7
Rating and comments after one play: this game is a lot like a cross between Antike, in which you gradually build up your production base and acquire abilities on ability tracks (except without any of the 'war game' features), and Keythedral, in which you spend your limited resources to acquire victory point items before the other players can get them, except with an auction for both production and victory points, rather than first-one-gets-it.  I think it has a lot of merit and I'm very interested in playing it again.  But, it seems to have two flaws to it: First, I messed up a few decisions early in the game, and from that point onward, exponential growth took over and it was obvious I had no chance whatsoever of ever catching up to anyone else or even having any influence on the game at all, yet I had to keep playing the game for another hour to be polite.  In some games where your situation is hopeless, you can still have fun by messing with other players' plans, or joining coalitions, and so on, but not in this game, where you feel like the shorty in a game of keep-away.  Second, in role playing games like Monsters Menace America, or Fury of Dracula, or Dune, giving each player one of several random powers at the start that are supposedly balanced - but aren't - is no big deal, but in a pure strategy game like this one or Mare Nostrum, it is a BAD IDEA, and favors the player who gets the power that is truly more powerful than the others.  In Cosmic Encounter, the other players can work together to overcome a strong opponent, but in this game, there is essentially nothing the other players can do to hinder another player who had the strongest initial power.

I love the theme of this game.  Collecting various gemstones is so girly.  I even played a delightful little fairy (who looked a little worse for wear).  It took a while for me to understand the game play which was really fairly simple: collect gems to get income to buy more gems and advancements on the tech tracks which will give you a higher income and easier ability to buy super power cards that give you victory points.

It was fun to collect the different incomes and try to get better gems or gems in groups of fours.  I didn't really enjoy looking at my money and trying to figure out the best way to spend it.  There was almost always a way to spend it the best and I wish they had just included money with a denomination of one so that the players spend less time doing arithmetic.

This is your standard good-but-not-great game.  The theme's cool (if very twee) and the items to buy and auction allow for different strategies.  The variable income mechanic is very clever, but the clunkiness of the three different currency types and unintuitive "hand limit" makes the game unnecessarily mathy.  Sadly, the biggest problem is it's just too long for the type of game it is.  It feels like a solid 90 minute game that, because of the inefficient complexity, stretched to 3 hrs in our four player game!

Niche theme combined with a fairly heavy (and calculation intensive) game similar to Power Grid makes this a slow starter.

Acquiring and activating gems as currency, improving in various power tracks to develop in multiple areas (e.g. hand-limits) over time, and ultimately auctioning for the acquisition of artifacts and sentinels to add abilities and victory points.

Forget the theme. You have money, you use it to buy investments, they return more money, which you use to buy more investments. Most investments also have a victory points value, at some arbitary point the game ends and the player with the most victory points wins.
Now I've only had one play so it is very hard to judge the game because this sort of game depends a lot on the nuances of the particular mechanisms. The main thing is that the game requires very careful optimisation play, which is a good or a bad thing depending on you and the players you play with. The bad thing (and usually a bad thing with all such games) is compound interest. A good move on turn 2 will have a much greater impact on turn 10, because the extra money you get on turn 2 will feed on itself to generate yet more money. The game doesn't seem to have any meaningful mechanism to stop that which means that developing an opening strategy out of play would probably hugely improve your chances.
The game did feel a bit slow, and some of it a little fiddly (there was never any real explanation for the dust counters, the lowest form of money, and the complicated hand size rules that accompany them - in fact I'm fairly sure the game could get by fine without them).
Certainly I look forward to playing in the future, and possibly doing some analysis but I doubt it will ever achieve a real following (too analytic for fun gamers too limited for analysts).

It reminds me of a simpler version of puerto rico (though it took much longer to play), probably because it was our first game.

Once you get past the hard to understand rule book this is a good game (only a few plays so far). Observations so far: Game unfolds slowly at first while players build up thier "energy" generation capabilities. Once players get a good base of crystals the game quickly picks up momentum. This seems to open up the potential for a runaway leader problem (if one player hits his or her income stride early). More plays will tell.

I like the theme (duh).  Rules are a bit hard to follow--I was confused reading through them the first time just getting the board set up.  Of course the rewrites people have posted have helped, and it's actually a decent little bidding/resource collecting bit.  Runs a bit long, but very replayable.  Waaaaay too long with a few margaritas and 5-6 players.  Can be bogged down with too much "analysis paralysis".  Mathy.

The game is okay, but wow is it dated in both production value and mechanics.  What art there is, is awful, and the graphic design screams 90s-era Photoshop.  The gem cards are only colored on the backs and monochrome on the front, making sorting them into the right decks harder.  The artifacts have three or four lines of text in both German and English on mini cards, plus art and icons, so they're printed in Flyspeck 3 font in white-on-black.  Each turn, you get something like up to a dozen cards from the various gem decks with varying values and need to add them up to figure out what your purchasing power is, you can only bank a limited number from-turn-to-turn, and making change when selling is a tedious optimization minigame that almost never matters once you have enough money past the first few turns.  If you retuned the game to have fixed incomes and a hand limit based on a given value, it would remove maybe 5% of the strategy but cut the play time in half.

This is the first game in a while that I've wanted to play over and over.  The way the game builds on itself, and the myriad of choices you have make for an excellent, challenging game.  The players' scores during the game are almost always close, and usually don't vary greatly until the end.  Interestingly, I've seen players who were generally trailing in victory points during the game pull ahead to win at the end.

Great, Great game.  May move up to a rating of 10 for me.

A very good game.  Our initial outing took a little longer than expected (2.5 hours), but it didn't drag.  I liked the combination of economics, with "investments" into the areas of knowledge. I would love to see this printed in English, though with the player aids on BGG, it should be accessible to most.

Following a second play, I still like this game a lot, but it does eat up the time.  I would say that one needs to budget around 35-45 minutes per player for the game, unless one's group is exceptionally fast.  Despite the length of our last game, I still enjoyed it quite a bit and look forward to playing it again.  The only disappointment with the long time-frame is that we didn't get to any other games in that game session.

What a brain-burner!  Since there are so many paths to victory, it was very hard to determine right up to the end of the game who was really going to win.  First game was approx. 4 hours, but didn't seem too long, because there wasn't a lot of down time between turns and the many auctions kept everyone engaged. I found it impossible to really grasp the flow of the game just from the rules, but it was fairly easy to make sense of the game's economy once we began playing.  Look forward to playing SoZ again soon!

Fun auction economy game. It might get a little boring after several plays, but not as boring as say Power Grid since the auction items vary a lot and there's 6 different player roles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
SoZ has a Power Grid-like system of economic optimization combined with a Goa-like set of abilities tracks.  Basically, you purchase gems that will generate income, allowing you to purchase better gems.  Income is also used to advance you on the abilities tracks, which allow you to be more efficient.  Even better, you may place one item up for auction.  These items make life easier by providing VPs, making things cheaper, making you more powerful in auctions, etc.  

This is a well-designed game, with nice components.  The theme is a total paste job, although there's tons of it.  My only complaint is that it takes a while to get going, even in a 2p game.  Mostly, I'd rather play PG (a 9), Goa (an 8), or Caylus (an 8), so this gets a 7.

RATING: 8
Really good, but they're lying with that "90 minutes" crap! Of course, most of our games involve at least 1 newbie. This is an economic game with variable player powers (to start, anyway) - you have to approach the game differently depending on which character you get. I still haven't played with all the characters. Like Power Grid, you also have to keep an eye on the turn order which you may be able to manipulate somewhat. Despite initial appearances, I think the characters probably are well balanced - you just have to know how to play them! One problem, though, is the constant math: some people seem unable to add up their money quickly!

It's unlike any game I've played before, partially because I'm not too interested in fantasy themes.  It sounded like a good game, so I tried a two player learning game, hence no rating yet.  I would try it again if someone requested it, but there weren't enough interesting decisions to hold my attention even for a 60-90 minute game and I can see how it could go on much longer.  On the other hand, I may be missing some of its attributes, so I'll reserve judgement for now.

If only it took about 90 minutes...
I like the game. It has clever mechanics well combined. The thing is that the game is very poor in interaction, and it's very, very long wich makes it boring. The downtime, played with four is huge. The auction phase actually is the only phase where some interaction occurs but eitherway, in one round you could only participate in one auction because there's no money left for more. Not even to buy anything.
The evolution chart is oppened to everyone and the resources never end. I found the flow of play very similar to Goa which I prefer. Not because of the theme or the absence of interaction but mostly because of the time of play.

Played again in a 3 player game. I don't like fantasy themed games but - I'm not sure why - I like this one. It's clever and well designed. What I don't like is the way things occur during the game. Everyone plays for a long time and in 5/6 turns the game is over. After 3 hours the game rushes to its end.

I also don't like the opportunity given to players of colecting infinite amounts of emeralds or diamonds and build their economy only based on that.

A fairly interesting game that offers a lot of avenues for advancement.  Your choice of character will definitely influence what you decide to do early on, but I don't know if it matters much later in the game.  I also like the "catch the leader" mechanics built into the game.  The only problem with this game is that it REALLY bogs down when you have more players.  I don't think I would ever play it again with more than 3 (maybe 4) players, it just takes too long to justify the gaming experience.  With 3 players, however, I wouldn't mind playing this one.

Having just played Talisman for the first time the day before, I was expecting a more dungeon-crawly game, but The Scepter of Zavandor is actually an economic game wrapped in the language of magic.

After a couple of turns I grasped the general idea of this game, but there were too many variables to figure out a good strategy in just a single game. We ended up cutting it short; a couple players had to be somewhere else, and it was clear that none of us had a chance of catching up to the leader, who had played before and taught the rest of us.

Play again? It was interesting to play once, but while I would not turn down the game if someone else wanted to play, I doubt I will ever bring it up myself. There was something oddly familiar about the game underneath all the sorcerous trappings, but I haven't been able to put my finger on what game it reminded me of.

There's a lot to like in this game but, unfortunately, the long playtime (45-60 minutes per player) and amount of "math" involved make this one unlikely to see the table very often.

Not an awful game, but I feel that it's really too long for what it is.  The theme feels tacked-on (I know that some would strongly disagree with me on this), and it just boils down to an (to me) annoying exercise in number-crunching.  And that's coming from a statistician.  I prefer its "diet" version, Phoenicia (or Phoenicia's more flashy cousin, Vegas Showdown); they have the same draw for me but don't take nearly as long.

Update 06/08/06  really thought about this and finally settling on a 7. While most everything I said it true,  BUT it takes way too long.  I have never seen a game finish in under 3 hours.

Upped my rating to a nine.  Really superb game with few flaws. There is no run away leader issue, there are many viable options to victory.  The game is forgiving of minor errors, yet rewards good decision making.  Each turn requires decision to be made, few of which are obvious and the winner is invariably the player who made the fewest small "mistakes".  Just excellent. 




I'd have to say it is an improved version of Outpost.  It adds a level of complexity without stretching the length of play.  Our games regularly clock in at nearly 3 hours in my methodical group, so most groups will finish in under 2 hours.

A real gem (pardon the pun)

RATING: 7
I must admit that this game has lost its appeal with me over the years.
When it was new I really liked exploring all the different strategies that they game offers to you. However, after about 20 games (not all recorded on BGG) the game hast lost its freshness. Strategies are pretty much visible now and there are only a few critical waypoints in a game when winners are separated from losers. The auctions are still very important and bidding from behind (in a 5 or 6 player game) is a huge advantage.
That said, Scepter is still much better than Outpost, and that is still a valid statement.

This is a pretty involved game with lots of bits and lots of strategies.  It reminds me of Goa and I'm told it's essentially a slightly simplified remake of Outpost (which I've never played).  Its biggest flaw IMHO is that players must add up the values on handfuls of cards before doing just about anything.  The game frequently grinds to a halt while players take stock.  Other than that one minor flaw, I enjoyed the game very much.

Lengthy economic development game (albeit an economy based on magic dust and jewels). My single 3-player game (2 newbs) moved along nicely, with nobody screwed by a bad error. Perhaps a little lacking in interaction, with even the auctions often uncontested or contested by only 2 of the 3 players. Given its length, I’d probably rather play something like [GAMEID=19777]. I did, however, enjoy it much, much more than [GAMEID=28620]; a more recent game with a similar structure. Happy to play it again.

3 to 4 hours, up to 6 players.  90 min. with 3 experienced players.  Never more than 4 players because adding 5 players changes number of gems aka money and lengthens the game???  But if you know you have 3 hours, why not setup a 5 or 6 player appt. game on a Sunday @ 1:00?  30 min/player?  Overall I would suggest you start with 2-4 for beginners but once everyone is familiar with the game try out a 6 player game. It's worth it in my opinion!  Lots of player aids, send out rule summaries in advance, and plan for a long session!

Lots of interesting things to do, but extremely fiddly; bidding when trying to remember your various modifiers and keep in mind how much money you need to save and where the point breaks wind up being for selling gems can be a serious headache.

House Rules: We allow a '1 dust' counter (counting as 1 card).  Not having a '1' is just more fiddliness, and very pointless.
Druid can get 1 Ruby at second to highest 'fire' level (as in English version).

Upgraded Components: Glass pente stones for the gems. A bunch of $1 calculators so everyone can have a calculator to use.

RATING: 8
Played 3+ times.  That was great.  This is an economic engine game and the economic system is tight and nasty. Everything that doesn't produce money (artifacts and knowledge tracks) has to be evaluated carefully to ensure that it will help you win.  So you have to ramp up your economy and then start converting your money to VP's.  I think as the group gets more games under their belts the prices of various artifacts may vary wildly.  I really like the variable starting positions, I'm not sure if they're balanced but I'm having fun finding out.  Looking at the various knowledge tracks now there must be more to some of them than I can currently see because they look unbalanced but that just means there's more for me to explore.  Also, I think if I was the designer I might have put sapphires at 4-6 rather than 3-7 because in the first couple of turns a dollar here or their can cost you a turn. 
**UPDATE** Play with a starting variant where you put the 3's and 7's in the sapphire deck in the discard pile the first time so they don't come out until the deck is shuffled.  Both the center board with it's tiny vp track and cursive script and the sentinels with their generic pictures leave little to be desired.  I think I will look at making replacements to ease play.  I think I might like this more than Phoenicia and playing this makes me want to play Outpost. 2009/05/28

After 1 play of Phoenicia (a simple variant), I found tSoZ and bought it.  Read the rules and it seems quite fun.  But, I'm a bit concerned about the math required.  I fear some of the players in my group will bog down with AP...or simply have to spend too much time counting (as may I) :\

This has yet to be determined, so I can't wait to try it!

Update: Had my first play and like I suspected, major AP bogged the game down...and the calculation of energy reduced the enjoyment and importance of auctions.

I really like this game.  But, those two negative points really reduce the rating for me.  I'm hoping future plays reduce AP and help everyone get better at the calculations.

Update: I wonder if I should add a +5 point min bid when outbidding someone.

RATING: N/A
Nagyon jó kis játék. Annak ellenére, hogy kb. 4 órás volt a parti, mindenki végig el volt foglalva az építkezéssel és élvezte a játékot. Az első partit végül mégis csak végig játszottuk annak ellenére, hogy a játék hossza miatt csak félig akartuk lejátszani.

A játékban vannak nyelvfüggő elemek, de nem olyan vészesen sok. Ráadásul mivel minden információ nyílt, ezért elég, ha csak egyvalaki tud idegenül. (Amivel mi játszottunk az kétnyelvű volt: angol-német)

Mivel az induló tulajdonságok különböznek, ezért elég kézenfekvő, hogy mindenki más stratégiával kezd. Több út is vezet a győzelemhez, és ha okosan használjuk a megfelelő eszközöket, akkor valószínű mindegyik stratégiával egyenlő eséllyel lehet nyerni. Mint sok más hasonló kaliberű játéknál, itt is csodálom, hogy néhány egyszerű kis játékmechanizmus mennyire változatossá és élvezetessé tudja tenni a játékmenetet.

A tulajonságos skálák miatt nekem kicsit a Goa-ra hasonlít. Itt is van aukció, és bár többkörös, nem nyújtja meg annyira a játékot. A lényeg a termelő gépezet fejlesztése.

A téma kicsit periférikus. Varázslók meg varázserőt adó ékkövek. De végülis nem annyira rossz. Talán még illik is egy picit a játékmechanizmushoz. Fantazy egy kicsit, de egyáltalán nem az az orkos-törpés.

Mindenkinek csak ajánlani tudom, aki rá tudja szánni 3-4 órát, és szereti a "development" játékokat.

An exponential growth economic game. Plays too long for what it is. The randomness of the cards not only makes payout and paying for things slower, it allows a slight variation in the cards to have a disproportionate effect on one's economic growth. Since that growth is exponential, your game can be irrecoverable quite early.

Too long for a game where you basically just do the same thing over and over while constantly calculating your magical energy or whatever. Too mathy for me. Too bad, I wanted to like this game, because one could buy acrylic gems and make the game look soooo adorable.

My rating will either go up or down. The fact that the game is great will drive it up and the constant math will drive it down. We'll see which side wins out in the tug-o-war. UPDATE: I've stopped counting the VP every turn and change them as people buy stuff. If I'm unsure of the VP, then I'll count up someone's score. This help take out the constant math.

This is a fairly complex game where the players have distinct abilities that can be honed as the game goes on.  I like that formula, but it seems that all players can max out whichever tracks they choose, which is a little unsatisfying.  Very enjoyable overall.

After several plays, and a reduction in playing time to about 1/2 hour per player, the group is really liking this one. There's a nice sense of creating a strategy and being able to follow through on it by game's end, often pulling out the win in the last couple of turns.

RATING: 3
One play, the game was too long.  I played with people who have some serious AP issues, so maybe it would have been pretty good with faster players.  For 4 players, learning and playing the game took about 4 hours.  The game itself was pretty good, I won, but I can't see playing it again anytime soon.

Update:  Played this again, and I while I might give it _one_ more try, I don't think this is a very good game.  Runaway leader/loser problem, and seems prone to analysis paralysis (and I played with a different group the second time).

RATING: 8.5
I greatly enjoy games where you get to build an economic engine--even if it is powered by crystals and pixie dust. This game provides you with an entertaining variety of routes to follow, encourages you to pick one early, and then challenges you to see it through as efficiently as you can. And you're never sure exactly how well you've managed the task until the final points are being tallied. A long game, but always engrossing!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Tedious exercise in math. Mechanism to balance the game is stretching the game even further, because everyone pushes really hard to score as low as possible in the beginning (where paying extra really hurts big time). Later on this very mechanism doesn't usually hurt the players in the lead at all. (even if they have to pay 10 or 20 plus) By then there's bound to be a runaway leader. And about an hour in the game you can see where your final position will be without having the slightest chance to change that outcome. Unfortunately the game will last for another two hours then at the least.

Plus, if you play this with six players the player with the ruby(?)-"advantage is clearly disadvantaged. Everyone else has an advantage that comes in handy right in the beginning whereas that player has an advantage later on. Well, maybe he has that advantage. Because you won't be able to build an economic engine as fast as the other players will. This fact in a game where it's all about yourself with almost no chance of influencing the game of the others, makes the game broken with six players.

Difficult game for me to rate.  Only one play thus far.  I really like the efficiency engine, the purchasing of the upgrades, and the tech trees available.  The game can crawl to a halt, because of the multiple currencies.  I am really going to look through the variants section to see if there is something that emulates what the game tries to accomplish, with only one currency.   This could rise as well if familiarity speeds up the game.  There is a rough runaway leader issue, but it can be over come.  Its an incredibly clever game, but I'd only be willing to play once in awhile, despite there being plenty of moments I really enjoy.  Its a game I really want to try again, but there so some problems with the streamlining of the game which slows it down.  Really tough game for me to rank.  It does things really really well, and really really poorly.  

The tracks seem imbalanced as well.  This isn't normally an issue with me, but the fact players randomly get assigned to a track for free, and the relatively high cost in the early game to enter a track.... it just seems off.

RATING: 7
Holy crap there's a lot going on in this game. Much more than what it would appear from a superficial glance. What looks to be a sort of ameritrashy game with a strong fantasy/magic theme hides the core economic nature of this very deep game. The game should be played very fast I think especially the first few rounds but it was our first game and we were fumbling through the rulebook. Now that I know it I believe I can teach it so player will play faster and not make the game last over 3 hours as it's a 2 hour game max. 

UPDATE: Tried this as a 2 player as I play a lot of 2 players with my girlfriend these days and it does not work as a 2 player game at all. HORRIBLE. I had to drop the rating a bit to reflect this. Should never be less than 3 probably 4.

Good game.  Silly and confusing theme.  If you explain it as a magic game, people are confused.  If you explain it as an economic game (which it is), people get it.  The efficiency engine in this game is fun, but it is very much multi player solitaire.   It would be much better if you could affect others more.

Frankly, I am a bit disappointed with this game. I certainly would have liked it better in the pre-Agricola age. Now, I would rather play Agricola if I am in the mood for a game of this ilk. Although the mechanics of this game certainly are my cup of tea, it has two major issues in my opinion: (1) Halfway through the game, some players may already be out of the race - pretty bad if you consider that the game easily takes 3+ hours to play. (2) The game is very, very mathematical and offers very little in terms of player interaction. On the plus side, I do like the economic options and the multiple roads to victory. Starting as the druid certainly does not do you any favours though.

I like this game, but it does lead to some AP with.  I purchased calculators to make the adding of all the odd numbers a little easier.  Also, I purchased some acrylic gems to pimp the game out.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The first game will be something of a learning experience as players grok the flow of things and see what the different artifacts do, but subsequent plays are smooth and the game can easily clock in at under two hours. Scepter is a game about investing money into things that will make more money, towards the goal of eventually being able to buy sentinels, which are a formidable source of VP. There are tech trees, special abilities that are auctioned off, and an interesting hand-limit management issue. Although there is a multi-player solitaire feel to an extent, the auctions are actually a very important part of the game and doing well in them is critical. Each player has a different starting position depending on which character he draws at the beginning. What slightly bugs me is that although there are a bunch of different strategic options there are only a few viable ones for each character, so your options are limited somewhat by the character that you drew. Of course next game you could draw a different character, so there is replayability in that sense. Overall a good game - I really enjoy how the different elements tie in together.

I think this is likely a better game from a mechanical perspective than Goa, but I like Goa better as I think it's more fun. My second play downgraded this game significantly, as I feel that those who don't play well will be doomed to counter-pushing and not being able to catch up for a bit too long to be tolerated.

RATING: 8.5
A good game where you build an economy (that generates magic dust) and use it to bid for artifacts or extend it further. It is an economic game and I enjoyed it. 

The game gives a disadvantage to the leading two players, which makes it tough to stay in the lead since artifacts become more expensive and by going first you deplete your monetary supply, so others can get remaining artifacts for cheap.

RATING: 8
Played this game once, 4 Player game, first time play for all of us. Rules explanation and playing took us 3 and a half hours, but we enjoyed it. 

This game has a 'slow' start to get your economy growing. In this way it reminded me of "Power Grid", slow start - the end can arrive fast in comparison to the start.

After the first Sentinel was bought, it took 20 minutes to reach the end conditions (5 Sentinels auctioned).

It has similarities with Goa too, but this game puts even more pressure on the brain. Lots of calculations by head... But you get nice Artifacts/Gems/Sentinels in return, worth the counting :)! 

Don't play this with slow players from nature, the game will last too long.

For a first time play all went smooth, we didn't 'fight' in the auctions, like we do in Goa (but this game we know well). I think a 2nd play will give some auction tension for certain artifacts/sentinels. One player had a sentinel I needed too after the game was finished... did cost me the victory I think.

Number 1 and 2 were about 5 points separated, Number 3 was further behind. Number 4 made a crucial mistake at one point, selling all his Gems for being able to pay for a artifact. He was far behind.

Don't do this, Gems are Income generators, you need them badly! Now he didn't have money (energy) left, and he had to buy new Gems for getting money (energy)...auch... it took him 3 turns to recover!

Will we play this again? I think so, but not often, this game is nice to play but takes some time...

I rate it a 7 at this point, with shorter playing time in a 2nd play it might go up in rating. I have a feeling that without the game explanation and not too 'slow' players, this can be played within 2 and a half hours. I don't mind this playing time in a game like this, it's evolving!

Played for the second time, 3 Player game, preferred this over 4 Players.

All Players had played before, so rules explanation took 10/15 minutes. It was a better game then the first, many auctions were fought over this time. An improvement. Being able to hold more cards (hand limit) was crucial this game, the Player who won had a bigger handlimit and was able to buy 3 Sentinels. I had 2 and Player 3 got 1 Sentinel. They can be big point machines, my Sentinels gave me a whopping 32 points. Just not enough, the Player who won had 1 sentinel more which gave him a 10 points lead over me.

Like this game! With 3 Players it's an 8 in my book. Can be a great 2 Player game too, I think. It has a solitaire feeling, the auctions will give some interaction. But your head spins from all the possibilities and calculations! You will be your own enemy... can you do the math :)?

If you like games like Goa, Power Grid...everything with a economic system, try this one. Be prepared, this one is a brainburner...

This 3 Player game took almost 3 hours, but time flew by! Recommended if you like long and deep games. The game isn't difficult to learn but difficult to master!

I've played this twice, once with 5 players that couldn't think ahead or do math in their heads, and once with 3 players that could.  After the game with 5, I wanted to stick needles in my eyes, as the game lasted forever.  The second game was reasonably pleasant.  Don't play with AP or slow players - you'll regret it.

Also, I didn't feel a ton of tension in the game.  There were a few bids for artifacts that were interesting, but not that many, and it always seemed like there was another artifact I could use instead.  Pretty solitairish economy maximizing game.  

All in all, the game is too long for what you get out of it.  Now that Phoenicia is available, which provides a very similar engine and game experience in about an hour, I can't see the 2.5+ hours that this one takes.  Even without Phoenicia being available, I think this game is ok, but I'd rather play something like Goa, which feels a bit similar as well.

update: own/sell own/sell...I hate it when I do that. I originally had the german edition, and engrishified it, then sold it...Years later I bought the english edition on sale for $55! How could I say no. I always liked Zep, although it felt a little long, and so I was always enamoured with Phenecia. But the production quality of phoenecia sucked, so for the time being, as my collection swells yet again, I'm happy to own both.

purchased June 05. First game was hugely fun and tense. I had printed all the paste-ups for the player boards and artfifact cards, and we missed a few rules, but it was a great gaming experience. I loved the theme.

A good economic game.  It's got elements of Power Grid, in that you build your economic capacity, have auctions, and don't really want to be in first place, and a little Puerto Rico, in that you are trying to set yourself up to buy the big buildings at the end.  I prefer both Power Grid and Puerto Rico to this game, but I'm happy to play this from time to time.  You don't need to pay attention to the theme if you don't want to.  Nice components (even without the little gemstones).  Seems to run about 45 minutes too long.

I liked Phoenicia, and was interested to try SoZ because of that.  The theme is draped on, but I don't mind that, and the non-important magic theme was better than a manufacturing / money theme would have been.  I enjoyed the game quite a bit, but it may lack in interaction.

The only interaction is in the bidding, but that may be enough.  It's one of those 'build a better machine' games, like Puerto Rico, but the interaction is bidding instead of role-selection (and related role activities).

It would be hard to get on the table very often at all because of the time, and I can see the math (adding things up over and over again) would wear on folks.

Good game.  I' going to give it a tentative '8' right now(placing it above Phoenicia) and try to play again to what I think.

I've played this 6 times now, and i love it, am moving it up to a '9.' I get an itch to play this game periodically, and all other games   (this is hard to get on the table) fail to scratch the itch.

I'm going to reserve a final judgment until I play Zepter again.

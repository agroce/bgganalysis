Britannia system brought into India. The coming of the nations and it's strength is not too similar to Britannia. And because of this imbalance between the amount of units/strength and the turns they come in, some players will be left with nothing much too do. 

Similar pros and cons to Britannia. The game system wants to simulate the coming and decline of nations. But this is highly subjected to player fancy. So the decline of a nation is very dependent on inter-player diplomacy.

It is however still a fun and simple wargame that could be played well with 4 players. 

I have used the adjusted Guptas removal to 4/4 as per widely suggested and at least give the yellow player a good run for his money.

Fun, light theme game.  The player empires are not balanced giving one player a greater advantage than the others.  The combat system is 'dicey' and can be frustrating.  Game play is somewhat fluid.  The components are fair.

Similar mechanics to Britannia - unfortunately 4 player is broken, Yellow is very weak and very boring to play (nothing to do for the last 1/2 of the game - okay that's a minor exaggeration, you get the dutch at the end, wonderful, 2 dutch counters that get slaughtered by the British or the French, well worth staying awake for the last 2 hours for that experience, it's like playing purple in Britania but not getting any nations after the Romans ...) It's good as a 3 player though, shame the colours are for a 4 player game.

I had low expectations given the game's reputation, which was good, because I was reasonably pleasantly surprised. It plays a touch quicker than Britannia, which is good, because Britannia goes a touch long. It has resisted fiddling with the core Britannia system too much, so it's actually probably easier to play than its parent and shares the vast majority of its rules and adds very few new ones.

Unfortunately, it lacks the nice narrative arc that Britannia has. Britannia starts with a bang (the Roman conquest) and ends with a big showdown (the Norman conquest). The latest version from FFG even gives Green a stake in the final slugfest and a possible king. Maharaja on the other hand loses energy in the final turns, and the British conquest is kinda strange since the natives seem to have a big incentive to ally with the British with few, if any, downsides; so the British seem to be able to conquer everyone through simple disinterest. Declining factions also sap energy towards the end.

There is definitely a problem with Yellow in the 4-player game. Again, I was prepared for much worse play-balance; I played Yellow and while I did lose, I wasn't [i]that[/i] far out of it. Much more problematic is the fact that Yellow has little or nothing to do for the final third of the game. And I don't mean "not a lot" here, I mean literally nothing for a bunch of turns. I think the play balance problem can be mostly fixed simply by reducing or eliminating the number of armies the Guptas lose when they enter decline (8 & 8 is completely crippling; try maybe 2 & 2). But the lack of anything much to do in the last third of the game is much more problematic.

(As an aside, I played Italia a couple times recently, and while Yellow is a problem here, it's peanuts compared to Italia's play-balance issues.)

Anyway, the bottom line is that I did enjoy my play of the game, and wouldn't mind trying it again with 3. But even though Britannia is a bit too long while Maharaja seems more a much more comfortable length, Britannia still is the much better game.

An interesting variant of Britannia set in India, but with some interesting rules changes for submission and leaders, as well as new rules for the colonials.

Unfortunately, I have to agree with many other comments here regarding the yellow player being both underpowered as a whole and boring in the end game for the four player variant. There also doesn't seem to be much of a downside to submission in this game. It's nothing that isn't fixable, though, and this game could certainly be a worthwhile target for a second edition. 

If we play again, I'm going to recommend a change from 8/8 for the Maureayan/Gupta removals to 4/4 and/or possibly a one turn extension on population growth.

Note: Rating is for a three-player game.

I played a lot of History of the World in my younger days. The Britannia/History of the World system is brilliant - simple yet thematic. but HotW is horribly, horribly long. For this reason, I've always resisted Britannia because it takes longer than HotW, and that strikes me as wrong. (Shouldn't playing out 1,000 years of history take less time than playing out 4,000 years?) :p 

So I got Maharaja purely on the recommendations that it has a shorter playing time than Britannia and History of the World, works well with three, and retains the effectiveness of Britannia's simple system easily conveying the sweep of Indian history. I was not disappointed.

RATING: 6
The basic Britannia engine is very good, but unfortunately the adaption to India suffers in a number of respects:

i) The larger area and longer period covered unavoidably makes the game more abstract, lessening the historical feel. As a consequence of this, nations often represent disparate forces with goals in wildly different parts of the map at various times, making it harder to keep track what everyone is up to.

ii) Some of the new rules, especially those for submission, do not work well.

iii) The game has worse flow, with a succession of all-conquering empires that have to be endured rather than resisted, and brought down by special rules that do not feel very organic. Also, some players have very little to do during some parts of the game.

A game I really wanted to like because I love Britannia and it's built on the mechanics of that game.  Sadly, it just doesn't work out.  The early tensions simply aren't enough to balance out the overwhelming strength of the British arriving in India (and I've yet to see the British lose).  Arguably, the game just runs too long.  By trying to take India up to relatively modern day, there simply isn't sufficient balance between the early history and the end game.  Can be a fun one to try for Britannia fans, but likely to rapidly exhaust its interest and put the old classic on the table instead.

-

[Note: not to be confused with "Maharaja: Palace Building in India".]
This game has a very novel and interesting concept (like its better predecessor "Britannia", which I have not yet played.) The history of India is followed for a few thousand years and players control all the major tribes, peoples, and forces that shaped its history. These include the Mongols, Muslims, Sikhs, the British, the Portugese, the Dutch, the French, and several Indian sects. You may learn some Indian history from it, but it is highly fiddly and frustratingly long.  The 3-person "short" version took about 3 hours. Now I don't mind long games, but playing this is a major chore with all the administrative tasks and other little details you must keep track of. Additionally, the mechanics of the play feel dated. I think this game is more suitable as a computer game, but even then it will have a hard time competing with today's more exciting games.

Much weaker than its predecessor Britannia. The invasions are a typical sweep across the North Indian plain while remnants of previous civilizations cower in the south. 
Unlike Purple (the Romans) in Britannia - Yellow has no chance - unless the others infighting keeps any of them from scoring enough points in the middle to end game.
Also the submission rules which penalize the overrunning player while not impacting the submitting player means that a vital victory point province can be held and NEVER dislodged!  

The most interesting part of the came was the appearance of the colonial powers and infighting for factories.

- the submission rules are just a way to permit some nations to survive and don't give enough to the submitter
- the rules for the colonial nations are a mess and the final conquest of India by the British is really disappointing in terms of flavor. The last turns are a bit boring (too much nations, the colonial nations and their special and ill-thought rules, the length of the game, pff...).

Very interesting historical lesson as Britannia was when we began this system. I play both but truthfully, this game has better artistic value.

Ce jeu est plus pédagogique que ludique. Pour comprendre l'histoire de l'Inde. Dans le style Britannia.

Can't see why it is rated so far below Brittania. It is slightly more fiddly though, especially when the Europeans arrive. Gives a little bit of insight into the history of India at least.

Britannia meets India.  Fun but not as good as the original that covered the medieval history of Britain.

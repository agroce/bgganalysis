RATING: 6.5
Interesting tactical situation, but this game suffers from all the same problems as the others in this series.  The d10 combat results table is especially problematical.  The range of results is too broad with only incremental differences between the odds columns.  And the stacking rules are a nightmare.

RATING: 5
Played three times. All US victories.
To scripted to my taste. The command management of the drunk general is clumsy and boring. 
The Army Moral mechanic of the system seems to me wrong.
When, after some skirmish one side starts losing Moral the situation becomes irreversible without recovery!
In two of our plays the British lost the battle even before they leave their tents!!

Want to trade it.

Another fine offering in GMT's [family=54][/family] Series. This time, the numbers favor the Americans and the terrain favors the British/Hessians.  Not a lot of new rules offered in this one, so if you know the system, you are pretty much ready to jump in and play.  There is only one scenario in this, but will that stop a good wargamer?  Nah!  Play the "what if" scenarios.  What if the Americans were able to coordinate their attack?  What if Washington had ignored Knox' advice to take the Chew House?  What if Stephens wasn't drunk?  It makes you wonder.  Read my full review [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/43526/germantown]here[/url]

Tactical warfare in gunpowder era. Simple and smooth system. Interesting scenario. 

Good investment if you like such era.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent game of tactical combat on the 18th century.
Hard to win as the Americans. Every piece of terrain counts, and creative maneuvering is rewarded. 
Fantastic experience. It made me want to buy other titles in the series.

EDIT after second play:  I have the feeling that the American army needs to fight a battle of attrition, wearing down the British forces until it achieves a decisive victory or counting on a victory by VPs differential. It seems to be almost impossible to win by conquering the star spots on the map (too easy for the British to defend these spots).

But the experience was very rewarding.

Good job on this game.  I particularly like the order-of-battle research and its reflection in the units of Washington's Army at the particular time (post-Paoli) of Germantown.  The "Surprise" and fog (real, not just f-o-w) rules are also effectively done.

RATING: 7.5
Good entry in a very enjoyable series. I especially like the "Stephen's Shame" rule, which gives room for a lot of replayability.

Still like Saratoga best in the series though.

This is probalby the most tense of the American Revolutionary War games from GMT. It's basically a meeting engageent in the middle of the map. Hopwever, both sides have a descent shot at winning.

RATING: 6
Despite being a really great battle to game and some fun special rules (Stephens shame, Friendly Fire, the Fog Rules...) I never had a really good game.

I played it solo three times by now but always had a substantial victory (2x American; 1 x British) at turn 5 at the latest because of rapidly melting Army Morale.
Tends to end very soon...

In my eyes the Army Morale Levels are not high enough for a battle of this scale.
Two - Three good or lucky actions in a row to one side and the battle will end (too) early.

I would love to fulfill the game turn track and see how the battle unfolds. I will try to give both armies 4 additional morale points next time.

So - despite being a fine battle in a great series - just a 6.0 for this one.
Might rise if the next games play more like a battle. if...

Tactical game on the 18th century US war.
Hard to win as the Americans, so creative moving is rewarded. Every piece of land counts.
Very nice experience. But should have some more scenarios as just one does the replayability low.

Otro de esta serie que me encanta. En esta ocasión se trata de una batalla grandes pero rápida. El americano tiene la ofensiva y mas tropas con lo que con tiempo puede flanquear a un británico despistado. Pero la moral americana el floja y con un par buenos ataques en británico puede ganar.

2 plays.
Less interesting volume in the series. The restriction on the British, the heavy random Us movement and the fog at the beginning of game will impact greatly the game. All this scripting/randomness is also not working that well in terms of stacking and road movement on the map.
Overall it makes for a clumsy game where players don't control that much and are more spectators to the game than actors.

My preliminary impression is that this is one of the best in the series, possibly even better than Brandywine and Monmouth.  It's true that there is only one scenario, but what a scenario!  Lots of units in this one, with victory conditions that encourage a real brawl.  Lots of possible strategies for both sides as well.  I like.

I like the system, but I got hammered after Washington got hit by a stray cannonball burst and was carried off the battlefield at 8:30 am.  Things went downhill fast from there.

RATING: 7
Possibly one of the best of the Miklos GMT Battles of the American Revolution series.  The Americans have a tough time achieving the geographic victory conditions, especially the Stephens division threatening to induce panic through firing on friendly forces.  But the Brits don't have a cakewalk as the Amis have the most leaders, the most rifle units, and the most cannons.  A great deal of fun and highly recommended.

Better than Saratoga, from the same series. However, the system stills got something I don't feel really comfortable with, not sure about what exactly. I should play it more.

Playtest/proofreading holes: the first turn bonus for some American units which can't be used since these units can't have enough MPs to engage with the enemy. There are also a couple of specific rules which haven't been put on paper.

I don’t know why, but I just can’t get into the Battles of the American Revolution series. I’m wishing (vainly) for more in the Martin/Millman vein (The Battle of Monmouth, S&T 90) and am trying to work up the courage to try Clash of Arms’ Brandywine/Germantown. I know one thing I don’t like is the tactics cards or chits. I appreciate their cleverness, but they don’t seem to fit in a battle line. The components are fine and the special rules for each battle are sometimes clever, such as poor ol’ General Stephens at Germantown, but, when I look at my humble collection to decide what to play, it's uhhhhhh....

 large number of units makes it hard for either side to attack. Who ever goes first will get clobbered by defensive fire and can be crushed the next turn. Makes most games a draw between experienced players as they maneuver for an advantage.

Always thought this was an interesting situation, and this game (and Monmouth) are the best in the series for me.  Saratoga has too few units and iron maiden rules; Brandywine is an assult on a fixed position; Guilford can't replicate history; and I'm not interested in sieges.  This one gives you opportunities, problems (love the rules for the drunk American general Stephens) and dilemmas. 

In my first play, the Americans were shredded by artillery fire.  Do not overcrowd your units!

RATING: 7
One play seemed lopsided. Subsequent play was a draw. I think there is a moderate tip in the balance in favour of the British, but aggressive play at the right moment by the Americans (plus a little luck on the initiative rolls) can pay off.

Nice simple set-piece battle with rules very similar to the old SPI Quad games. Just enough chrome to give it some flavour without bogging it all down in detail. The usual high visual quality you expect from GMT. My only beef with it is it was a bit expensive for a single scenario with little replayability. I understand GMT are going to re-releasing some of the other battles in this series with 3 to a box, and I reckon those will be much better value.

Interesting chit-pull system for battle resolution, similar to Empires in Arms. Seems like the American player's chances stand and fall with Chew House and Stephen's Shame. UK player has a more predictable task, and should focus on bringing the Hessians into play quickly.

An enjoyable game on an interesting map. Being part of a series makes it easier to get into for anyone who is used to the series.

I like the morale track that can reflect how an army slowly deteriorates, though I don't like the tactical chits / cards, but this rule can be ignored without (in my opinion) detriment to the game and certainly helps keep the game moving.

The living rules are needed to replace the printed Exclusive rules as there are some amendments.

In our games it has been a tough one for the Americans.

First play into this series.  Components are very nice and some rules make it fun (like the Stephen being drunk event).  Wish the rules had better examples with illustrations (like Washington's ratings and what they mean).  Still getting used to the system but like what I see so far.

My first try with the system. Captures the battle really well with some nice chrome, but I'm not sure the battle itself is all that fascinating. Some interesting ideas grafted onto old hex-and-counter CRT game. d10 for CRT is too variable for me. Mid-level complexity. Some rules confusion (there's an LOS paragraph I can't make head or tails of).

Another good game in the series. It's very interesting the fact that despite their numbers, the american troops have to move very carefully to avoid easy losses of morale.

Like the series so used it to complete an order till free tranport level.

After playing we failed to be impressed.
We own star wars the card game and for some reason we expected it to be as much fun as that, but found we were disappointed.

Maybe it'll grow on us over time, but I have a feeling it may not.

Not enough of a simulation, and just not fun enough for beer & pretzels, or in last night's case beer & french fries.

Clash of Arm's BAR series is complicated, to be sure, but if learning and feeling 18th-century tactical warfare is your priority, playing one battle in that series is preferable to playing anything and everything in this one.

Wow!  I get to be the first person to rate this one!?

I played it at ConquestSF just one day after playing Monmouth, my first attempt at any game in the series. 

Don't lose your leaders!  The convention instructor left to teach a Monmouth scenario to another player.  He thought I would be fine.  A couple of minutes later I told him I lost the game.  He said "How?"

I said "Howe".

General Greene rode around back and shot General Howe and then things completely feel apart.  Immediately after that, one hex away, British General James Grant must have been trampled during the panic.  They were both removed from the game.

The fog could have lifted on Turn 4, but I decided to lose it in Turn 4 instead.  The fog never lifted -- in more ways than one.  I think my British only lost one unit, but they were completely demoralized.  Those back British units aren't even allowed to move until Turn 3.

My "reinforcements" -- drunk American General Stephen and his men -- never arrived to help shoot his own men.  They were headed straight for General Washington.  

The Hessians and the Colonial militia decided to fight over the tavern instead of joining the big battle.  Somehow that seemed appropriate.

The movement allowance on the roads seems to be twice as fast as those used in Monmouth.  We weren't sure if this was a misprint.  We assumed not as "half" was stated instead "1/2" or even "1".  Perhaps the roads are much better near Philadelphia, even in the fog.

Very fun solo, just don't use the tactics cards.

Not sure I'd like the tactics cards f2f either. A little two swingy.

Goodtimes F2F, as well. Got slaughtered, but it was still a blast.

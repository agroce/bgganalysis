One of the best WWII solitaire games ever made. Solid mechanics that captures intensity of squad level battle and you quickly become attached to your soldiers. You wince when one of your team is WIA or KIA and you cheer when they demonstrate their bravery. Highly recommend.

Great solo game which I found very innovative at the time and although replayability was limited, this didn't really bother me much as I didn't play often enough for it to be a problem - certainly I could revisit it now as I remember absolutely nothing about the missions.

Finally played Scenario #1 (Bloody St. Mick) - very solid system with very few ambiguities in the rules and holds up really well compared to contemporary games.
 
Some aspects of it are laborious (such as keep checking paragraphs), but with a bit of inventiveness (such as marking irrelevant paragraphs and not just events), as well as keeping the squad together - it alleviates 80% of the fiddleness and still makes for a very tense game. There are also computerised helpers (eAmbush, Vassal) to help with the laborious tasks. 

Still, nothing like it out there and really does play like a "Choose Your Own Adventure" game.

The only downside to this game is that there are certain events that occur during the missions that are rather unforgettable, which reduces those missions replay value to some degree.  That being said, it's a great solo game that can be very tense!

Lovely game, and relatively simple rules for a wargame - although it does take a long amount of time and the rules are a little confusing at first.
This game has a knack for proving that even a bit of cardboard has better tactical sense than me.

From a design standpoint, this is right near the top of great and innovative designs.  It's kind of a solitaire role playing game.  Flipping back and forth through the book and the decoder ring can be a bit fiddly.  Can you imagine a smart phone app that handled that?  The only drawback is that it has zero replay capability, but the good news is that if you buy the expansions and player-created modules, it will take you awhile to burn that bridge.

RATING: 9
If I was stuck on a desert island, and I could only have one game, it would be Ambush!  I loved wargames and military history as a kid, and I didn't have anyone to play games with, so enter Ambush!  It is a great game -- with caveats.

1.     You need patience.  Reading through paragraphs, cross indexing numbers, keeping track of soldier stances, turn order, initiative, etc.  For a "50 something" like myself, this is a piece of cake not having grown up with console games and computers.

2.     It is undoubtedly too slow for those not of my generation or not into nostalgic classic games.  

Other than that -- I highly recommend this game and all of the expansions.

The best solitaire game I have ever played. Very tense and exciting throughout the game as you try to avoid all the nastiness the system throws at you. The stories you create with your squad will be remembered for many years. Highly recommended for those armchair generals with no one to play with. It even has a fairly good replay value especially when you add in two or three of the expansions and play campaign games. One thing about getting old is that you start to forget little things here and there. Perfect, that just adds to the replay value of this game! :)

97% of wargames are sometimes played solitaire, and 3% lie...  Ambush!  doesn't have to.  Pretty fun, innovative system for its time.  Kind of like a "Choose Your Own Adventure" on PCP.  The only limitation is the limited replayability (though this is ameliorated if you have a crappy memory).

An excellent single player game that is rich in theme and well executed.  As as solo game, replay is limited (unless you have a poor memory), but the play experience is worth the one-time price.  Mechanics are a bit clunky by Euro standards, but game play is worth the inconvenience.  [GTI Code: TPSD]

Have played all the missions and had a couple of Grunts survive. Replay value is limited unless you leave about a decade between replays. Clever system in it's day.Tend to find it a bit drawn out now and mechinal and if you have a good memory you get to know the paragraph booklet quite well.

RATING: 8
Quite a good solitaire story-telling game crossed with a hex and counter war game. The paragraph and slider mechanisms, while dated by modern software-based methods, generate a pretty interesting scenario that can be somewhat replayed (some of the stuff remains on a play-through, but some hostile activations will occur at different locations, assuming you change your path through the map). Moving through the board and performing the map checks does a decent job of providing a sense of discovery/fog of war. Add in a just-simple-enough campaign mode and you have 9 missions that most solitaire wargamers will find worth playing. The expansions add more high quality stuff.

If you go in expecting a somewhat serious (LOS and other various rules grit), but still pulpy, experience you'll have a lot of fun going through the game even today. The fact that it is still worth playing after 30+ years is a testament to its strength of design.

Fantastic solitaire depiction of WW2 squad level combat in France. The 8 scenarios in this original set have limited replay value but approaching the objective from a different direction can cause Germans to pop-up in different, unexpected places.

A tounge-in-cheek, Hollywood version of WWII in a solitaire venue.  Pure 80's gaming bliss.  Great fun if played co-operatively.  One of my favorite gaming memories.

The most fun I've ever had with a solitaire wargame.  I played through all the scenarios once and it was a magical experience.  Knowing what's going to happen limits replay value, though, and I never personally tried to do so.

This game is a narrative style game.  It is a relief to have games like this if you're only option is to play alone some evening.  

I think this wargame is a great introducotry war game at the squad level.  It could prepare you for other classics with more extensive rules sytems.  For example, Advanced Squad Leader-or the Batille series.  All are enjoyable games and focus on small forces with very precise objectives like holding a building or eliminating forces etc.

It is a great entry level game for wargaming and squad based games.

What I also like is the the narrative style which almost makes deisel fuel and the smell of gunpowder form from thin air.

I absolutely love this game! 

After a couple missions, I actually began to have an emotional connection to my squad. The end result being that it made many decisions much more difficult. One notable example being whether to risk the lives of others to save an incapacitated squad member by dragging him 15 or 20 hexes off map (I think a specific die roll through every hex could cause him to bleed out or something) through enemy fire. 

The narrative of the missions and the persona's you apply to the squad members are what make this a great experience.

RATING: 9
If you&#039;ve got the time (missions can be a little long), this is quite a fun game - by far (far, far, far) the best of the various solitaire wargames. Replayability of the base set can be a little weak due to the scripted nature of the missions, but the expansions do a much better job on this point. Regardless, not that complex, and the excellent mechanics will satisfy your desire for meatier gaming when no opponent is available. The odds of being able to toss a grenade through the open hatch of a tank at 50 yards may be grossly overstated, but that&#039;s where the fun kicks in. And did I mention the time one of my squad members shot dead a sniper hidden in a steeple 200 yards away in one shot ... from a M1911A1 pistol!? The rest of the squad had so loaded up on flamethrowers and machine guns, half the squad was armed with pistols, but that half seemed to do all the damage. This game is a blast, the best game Victory Games ever did by a wide margin, and there are many, many hours of fun in the box.

It's always sad to be playing solitaire, but if you must, Ambush! can ease the pain.  Some issues with how it deals with opportunity fire:  too easy to avoid, in general, and then sometimes, BOOM! your guard is down, and someone (seemingly inevitably, a commander ... ) gets WASTED.  Hence, "Ambush!"

Just found out about this game and i really want it! 
Any sellers out there?

Update: Got it! Stort Tack till dig som sålde detta spel till mig!! Du vet vem du är ;)

Update 2: This is a excellent Solitaire game!
It really tells you a story while you playing. I love it for that. Nerve-breaking action and alot of luck in your dice rolling, but also some good strategy are needed.
The downside is that its alot of markers and rules to check up and make the game last for hours and even days, and it is a little complicated and "fiddly" (think thats the word im looking for?) and when you recognize what to do on every mission and what happens there is not much replay value anymore.. i guess.. but for now.. its a fantastic solo experience!!

Replability [RP] - This will be subjective and called out in comments
Play/Time (PT) - Dice rolling/crib sheeting/paragraph lookups/Rule Lookups

Comments
Good:  [GR]The ingenious hidden movement/activation of enemy units, action round random seleciton of advantage/disadvantage and number of turns for each side.  Player ability to tailor soldiers and equipment based on the points rolled. The book though 40 pages is a nice big font.  [BGG]The number of files available on BGG for download that aid in player play.  Also 487 members subscribed to it as of this posting.

Neutral:  [GA]Front box cover of the Jeep/troops is a little cartoonish (IMO)  The unmounted board/units are decent in so far as they match other games for the time it was released. [PT]Time consumed for paragraph checks and amount of dice throwing make or break this game.  Fortunately, I don't mind it but it is a fair amount.  [RP]Is doable enough "if" one takes the step of generating new squads and/or taking new opening moves if replaying same mission. 

Less Good:  [GR]Seems I have spent a fair amount of time reading/re-reading rules and consulting BGG rules forum for input.  Based on the number of posts, I'm not alone.   If you can struggle thru a play or 2 and be patient it will work itself out but can be frustrating at first.  Finally, some of the example diagrams could have had more detail or they should have added a few more (especialy LoS).

RATING: 4.5
A game that reminded me of those fighting fantasy game books.  Never enjoyed playing this game.  4.5 ultimately refects an urge for another go at this game at some point.

NB
My taste in games has been moving on since 2007. The bottom line is I am no longer enthusiatic about playing longer or unexceptional wargames.   I have downgraded most of my rating inline with this.  The comments reflect my opinion of the games but I have rated the games lower in line with BGG guidance since I am unlikely to be playing them again.

I play a lot of solitaire games, even ones that are not designed at all for solitaire. While this is a very good game that has held up well over the years, I find that there is too much back-and-forth looking at booklets and paragraphs to end up with a good "sense" of the fighting. Perhaps if I played more frequently, much of it would become second nature and the game would flow better. Still, solid solitaire game of World War II squad-level combat. Recently bought the new up-dated cards from Game Crafters. They look great. Can't wait to pull the game off the shelf to try it out with this great looking addition.

In my opinion its one of the better solo games out there. Good squad level action and the rules cover a fair amount of situations including parachute drops, tanks, prisoners, etc. Scenarios give a fair amount of options and the rules do a good job of covering troop reactions. Has a fair amount or re-playablity.

Despite being a member of the computer age, I found this to be great fun.  A neat mechanism for running through scenarios and reasonably manageable rules made this a great intro to squad-level wargaming.  All the paragraph checks and such are a bit fiddly, but I've been finding myself absorbed for the few hours it takes to go through a scenario once I get a good rhythm going.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After one play (Mission #1, where I lost by 3 VPs -- I had 10 VPs, most lost due to one dead soldier and two incapacitated soldiers), I have to admit earlier skepticism about the paragraph method for solitaire play was unwarranted. Once several turns have been played and the first combat has been completed, the rules start to really make sense, and it becomes an enjoyable game. Unfortunately, replay value will be missing, as I'll already know where the enemy is and what they're doing; but I still think missions could be replayed, with the player simply trying different approaches to winning.

Sentimental favorite: I taught my son to play wargames by splitting a squad with him; I handled the mechanics and he made the decisions. This game STILL has better A/I than most of the computer games on the same subject that I've played (101st Airborne in Normandy, for example). Yes, you still have to handle all the functions that the computer can do for us now, but the game's scripting and the solid replay value of the latter add-on modules makes this a keeper.

Solitaire only game.  Takes a while to play and if you haven't played in a while, a long while to re-learn the rules.  I have too many other things to do in my life to sit down for many hours and play a solitaire game.  I'll save my gaming for when I'm together with friends.

First things first: this game should be renamed "Body Count!", as the death toll gets pretty high no matter what you do.
 
Seondly, it has some great ideas that are well-executed for AI of the Germans and so on. However, who has the time and patience for this? The slight payoff is just not worth the immense effort here.

Perhaps a brief excerpt from my second playing will illustrate my point: An intrepid private guy catches up to the front of the line. This alone triggers  a check on the chart for the hex he entered, the roll of a die, which leads you consult a second entry in the  paragraph book, which in turn takes you to another paragraph, where you make a perception check for the highest value guy in the hex, which activates three enemies at various hedgerows and necessitates checking off sightings 2, 5, and 6. Which starts an initiative sequence requring every GI with LOS on enemies to make perception checks and get added to the initiative sequence and account for panic. The Germans proceed to immediately gun down two GI's, each shot requiring a 'Weapon Jam' check, a hit calcuulation based on stance and terrain of the target, a damage roll, but not the ammo expenditure roll you would have to make if it were a GI firing. So you charge the  GI's to capture them, which will be a relatively simple roll for the sake of variety. But before you can get to the hex, you must check for events in every hex moved into. A few chart glances later, the enemies are captured, and this raises the condition from 1 to 4, so you haul out a new chart from the box into the slipcase, which also means you have to re-check for events in every single hex ocupied by GI's, which in turn activates more Germans. 

Get the picture yet? This game suceeds at creating a one-player game of Squad Leader at the price of obsessive chart-referenceing, paragraph consulting, and die rolling. The volume of these activities goes beyond pedantic and into the realm of madness.

You are really better off finding a friend to run the Germans, but if you had a friend over, why would you be playing Ambush? I have a great amount of respect for the idea and the design, and would rate it much higher from taht perspective. But when you actually sit down, play a scenario for two hours, and look at the book you're reading or the NetFlix movies stacked up, you kick yourself for fiddling with a paragraph book for so long.

RATING: 10
This game was designed in 1983 and because of its reputation it came into my hands as well. Opening the box, the content raises questions of whether the game is worth my time: map and counters with poor graphics and cards totally unpleasant to the eye compared to today’s standards of printing. The rules will be unfamiliar to most wargamers because this is a solo interaction and the game tries to simulate the enemy's actions as it might have happened in a real situation. On first reading everything is blurry and confusing – your initial thoughts are that you might not even grasp the mechanics of play. Fortunately they leave no ambiguities or question marks, all rules are clear and comprehensive.
 
You command a squad. For each member of the squad you have all the data needed for the coming fight: the rank, the type of weapon carrying, ammo clips, grenades, initiative, weapon skill, perceptiveness, movement allowance etc.
 
Setting up the game and taking your first actions step by step put everything into perspective.
Each of your soldiers moves hex by hex and for each move you read a paragraph booklet informing you how the game-enemy reacts. Thrilling, tense moments like the pleasure one gets from watching a war movie!

Although each scenario might lose its surprise elements after it has been played, it keeps alive the replayabilty because every enemy soldier is controlled by the game and can react in a totally different manner from the initial game play!

Since the first appearance of this game in the BGG community there are several files that one can download and compensate for the old design texture on cards and rules with all updates and errata included.

Although the game is so old (regarding design) it was way ahead of its time when it circulated in the market, truly an amazing wargame dripping with theme!

As I was transitioning from being a miniature/tabletop gamer to more of a boardgamer, I added some solo wargames to my collection.  Ambush is a classic, despite its age.  I very much became invested in my band of soldiers as they progressed through the missions.  

The nature of the scenario generation means that this only comes off the shelf every few years, as I have a great memory for recalling some of the surprises the game system throws at you.

This is my perfect game. It takes around 4 hours to complete a mission but those hours are pure joy. It's like a war movie playing before your eyes in which you are the lead actor playing the general, giving orders and being responsible for the consequences. I always think a lot on which move to make and tension builds up with every move and paragraph check. 

It is not an easy game to learn and you may not start playing quickly but the rule book is excellent. It is also a nice read as most Victory Games rule books are. 

If you are a wargamer and if you like solitaire games get this. It is a real treasure.

Another creative solitaire system.  Has a Hollywood feel to it, and adds in some role-playing elements (individual soldiers are rated differently, and can play the missions as a campaign, leveling-up over time, assuming they can stay alive).  Lots of surprises, lots of fun, and works pretty well as a 3 player game, with 1 referee playing the Germans and 2 players each taking half of the US squad.

These comments apply to all expansions, as well as Battle Hymn (the PTO version) and it's expansion (Leatherneck).

I really wanted to like Ambush!; I do to a point. I wanted a solo infantry game, and I have always had a deep interest in WWII history.  This seemed like such a fit. It just didn't end up working that way. Some will say that the rules are too fiddly, but I think of "fiddly" as having a lot of "if x then do y" kinds of things in it. It is somewhat fiddly.  This isn't my first wargame; if it were just a little fiddly, I could handle it. However, after moving EVERY chit EVERY hex you need to reference a chart, and it just chops up the game too much. There is no such thing as game flow. I can't seem to muster the enthusiasm to give it another go.  Not that it's bad, but I would rather play both side of a much better 2-player game.
----------------------------
Update - A year or so later, I still don't like this game.  Checking very hex is just too cumbersome - even when I remember to do it.  There would be a great game in there, but it's hidden behind the paragraph checks.

This is still my favorite solo wargame. It's an absolute masterpiece of strategy, tension, and narration; the closest you'll ever feel to Band of Brothers on a board. It's an old game though so the components are relatively mediocre. Yet, it's the game I would bring with me on a deserted island. The rules are pretty complex and a little fiddly, but that's the price to pay for the kind of tactical depth they offer. Missions are tense and difficult, forcing you to extreme caution and patience. Of course, since they are are heavily scripted, they offer poor replay value, but there's enough content in the game to keep you busy for weeks. If you like tactical squad based solo games then I urge you to try and find an old copy of Ambush! It is, in plain terms, the very best in its genre, and possibly the best solo game ever made.

An interesting blend of hex and counter wargame and choose your own adventure book. The system works well and is a good cardboard AI, but there is lots of paragraph look ups involved. After a while this starts to feel cumbersome, which reduces the game from 9 to 8. The game also suffers because the equipment is treated essentially the same - a M-1 is no more effective that a 98K and a MG-42 is treated the same as a MG-34 or Browning M-1919. This reduces it to my final score of 7. Probably excessively nit picky.

Another one of my favorite solitaire games of all time, great atmosphere, very tense and the system plays very well.  I wish someone would revive the paragraph system.  Instead of looking up charts, maybe a little iphone app would suffice.  The paragraph system really creates a semi-intelligent opponent that also adds story.  The mechanics of fighting is straight forward but works pretty well.  All the expansions just give you more the best, and having your characters survive missions after mission is very satisfying.  Highly recommended game.   The only negative is there isn't more missions in the pipeline!

Another comment:

One of the best solo experience anyone could hope to have, there is story and squad level tactics.  The game world is alive through the paragraphs, the rules are concise and easy to understand.  There is the element of surprise through the fog of war (a real achievement in a solitaire game) and with all the expansions, it will take you quite sometime to play successfully through them all and if you do manage this feat, you can move on to Battle Hymn or for the hardy Open Fire, both of which use the same system.  And if you manage to survive all these missions, you can start all over again with a new brave crew.

Its a great game!  Highly recommended.

My fav game right now.  The later missions are better but it's good to learn the ropes on the earlier ones.  Really good to think through the moves once  the Germans appear.  Been lucky with gun jams and getting used to the various weapons.  Lots of tension.

Went out and found all the expansions including battle hymn.  So looking forward to playing them

This and chess cost me my first year at college. Played it with a friend and it was terrific. You learn to care about your squad members, which makes every shot matter. Would rate it a 10 if it weren't for the verbose rules, limited replayability and somewhat fiddly impulse mechanics. Heck, after playing this solitaire in the near future (I hope), I might give it that 10 still.

I had this and the first 3 add-ons when they were first released.  I played a LOT of this due to the ease of finding an opponent (i.e. they are solo games)

I absolutely love man-to-man tactical warfare.  I am a big fan of WWII.  I am a huge fan of Avalon Hill and this type of games in General (pun intended).

But, this game did *not* quite do it for me.  It had none of the detail I wanted (ex. weapon "types" were too generalized for my taste) and the entire solo system was cumbersome (even "back in the day").

I am not sure a good solo game of this nitty-gritty small-scale combat can be done (well) with an old-school hexagon based map (and I am *NOT* a card-gamer at all).

Quite a bit over-rated here if you ask me.  If you take the plunge get the first supplement as it adds a TON to the game (tanks for one thing IIRCC).

Engrossing, absorbing, immersive...I almost got frightened off at first by the long-winded and overly-complicated nature of the rules (mainly as a result of the wordiness).  But it really is quite simple to pick up, and the tables and "paragraph booklet" are much easier to use than I thought.  Only played partway through the first scenario, and already I'm itching to get back to "my boys" ;)

If this mission goes wrong it really goes wrong! I can see I will be having another go at this one very soon.

Creates a strong narrative, particularly over multiple scenarios. Indeed, I don't really think it's worth playing unless you get invested in the progress of the members of the squad (the worst is losing a man to his injuries after the fighting's pretty much over for a scenario).
Probably the best solitaire-designed wargame I've played, but as with most solitaire-designed games I'd rather play something on VASSAL instead (or even, most of the time, solo a 2-player game) so I'm unlikely to play much more of this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This solitaire game is essentially a combination of a boardgame and a choose-your-own-adventure book.  You control eight men, and each time a man enters a hex you may need to look up an event in a paragraph book.  As a narrative generator it's probably unsurpassed; many of the scenarios really do play out like a WWII movie.  Realism is surprisingly good, although the MG-42 is not modeled well and your German opponents will sometimes act like boneheaded stormtroopers from Star Wars.  That's not to say that the game is easy, because the system is quite bloody for both sides.  The game's only major drawback is the tedium involved in all of those paragraph lookups, which means that the game runs too long for what it is.  However, I found that this problem could be tempered by summarizing the key German action paragraphs on a single page.  People that complain about the replayability of the missions (of which there are 24, including the expansions) must have a much better memory than I could ever hope to have.  Ambush! probably remains the ultimate solitaire boardgame experience.

Great solitaire game for sure.  The rules are a bit heavy and hard to understand (took me a few read thrus to not miss anything).  I would normally call a game like this fiddly for all the paragraph checks and what not, but I like it so much I can easily overlook it.

The game has been shelved as of late.  Something about naming your entire squad after friends and loved ones only to have them die in horrific ways mission to mission is a bit offsetting.  I swear critical hits are out to get me, I swear it.

Great tactical solitaire game (one of the best for sure), a little obtuse by today's standards, but superseded its flaws with a great narrative (the game comes with an events booklet).

RATING: 4.5
I was very excited to play this after hearing so many great things but it fell flat for me.  There was simply too much referencing of text, rules, and tables for me to enjoy it at all.  Every step your units take results in tables checks.  Some checks require you to change the current reference sheet which means you have to re-reference every single space your occupy yet again.  The rules for units in vehicles wasn't clear either and it was difficult to remember who was firing at what, who was standing and who was crouching.  I didn't enjoy this at all. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I REALLY like this game.  Its the narrative that develops during play that makes this one stand out.  Checking paragraphs with each hex move tends to be fiddly but worth the effort as thats the mechanic that tells the story.

I can see that replay-ability my be an issue, since once you go through a mission youve essentially seen the narrative.  My plan is to replay the first mission until I have the rules down pat then move through the rest of the game.  It could be that as you take different routes through the mission the narrative changes.  I dont know until I have more plays under my belt.  

Whatever the case, Im impressed enough with my first play that this is well worth the purchase price.

This for-trade copy has been "well played".  It's complete, but he box is in rough shape.  The counters are all there but are in zip locks (not the original counter tray).  Maps are in good shape as is all the cards and counters.  The game is perfectly fine for someone who wants to play, but if you're looking for something to collect, then move along.

This is a fantastic solitaire wargame.  The game mechanism takes a bit of getting used to, but once you do you can play easily.  Lots of suspense, and the personality development / skill enhancement of your troops lends to a highly personalized game.

RATING: 6.5
I like the game so far. I have only played the first Mission, will update shortly. Definitely a keeper.

Update, after playing all 8 missions:

The good:
-I think the game excels at its RPG elements. You create unique squad members, and increase their abilities by completing missions and advancing in the campaign. 
-Many missions tell great stories. In the first mission, a British fighter plane crashes, and your men can rescue a wounded pilot if they reach it in time. In other missions, you capture hidden scientists before they can attempt to detonate rockets, or assault an enemy bunker, or interrogate captured soldiers for the location of important documents, or attempt to immobilize assaulting German panzers. Each mission is unique and offers special challenges.

The bad:
-There is a lot of die rolling. To shoot you must roll to check for jam, roll to see if you hit, roll to see the effect, and roll to see if you lose ammo. The result is that combat starts to feel stale and more than a little frustrating.
-Combat mechanics are very luck-heavy. When the enemy fires his pistol long range, and hits on a roll of "0", and then kills my soldier on a subsequent "9", there is a certain detachment from the story as I mark the soldier KIAed. It feels like I'm playing craps. I didn't get killed, I simply rolled a 9 on a d10. Now, you could say the same for any game with randomly determine combat results, but for some reason it just feels especially arbitrary in Ambush.
-People have mentioned the issue of constant chart-lookup. I remember Mission 7 took me a few painful hours to finally finish. In this mission, there are something like 10 or so enemy units, and each one does a lot of moving. So, for each enemy soldier, you complete the following procedure:
-Roll a die for the German action number
-Check the action number to the soldier's paragraph matrix, find the resulting paragraph to check.
-Look up the paragraph in the paragraph booklet.
-Paragraph has instructions for how the soldier moves.
-Consult the paragraph sleeve to see what hex the soldier moves into.
-Sometimes, in lieu of a hex number, the german's movement is dependent on another paragraph lookup.

That, times 10 units per turn, times 2 turns per round, winds up taking a lot of time.

All in all, this is a great game, but I do not think it is the be-all end-all in solitaire wargaming. The Conflict of Heroes solo expansion is a much improved experience.

RATING: 10
Great game - played at the peak of my wargaming days. Whilst I am mainly a solitaire gamer; I played this with a group of friends who were each represented by a counter on the map - with several support units to form small squads which, were given personalities of people we knew. It was great fun watching their progress over the different missions, the mishaps unfold (One always unluky friend who once parachuted into a well & tried to drop a grenade into an unbuttoned tank only for the grenade to bounce off and land into the same hex he took cover-in - incapacitating him), the great acts of bravery and, unbelievable luck. Played much better as a group than solitaire; halcyon-days. It never fails to amaze me how solitaire games tend to play better with groups and multi-player games play better solitaire.

RATING: N/A
This is one of those games that really tells a story, creating incredible situations you're not likely to soon forget. As an example, the first time I played a mission featuring an enemy tank, I decided to initiate my most reckless and crazy tactic yet, bringing my 3 most veteran soldiers right up to the edge of the map, where I knew the tank would appear (due to the deep rumbling sounds coming from that direction). I really didn't want to lose my best men, but I hid them in the bushes anyway, planning to use two of them (both commanders) to each give the third man an extra timely action, so that my plan would be possible. The minute the tank appeared, I sent my third man charging toward it with nothing more than a grenade in hand. Ha! This probably should have failed catastrophically. But, as the rules dictated, the tank's small hatch was wide open (since the Germans evidently wouldn't expect any resistance at that remote fringe of the map), and by some miracle I was actually able to toss the grenade in and make it land in that tiny opening just moments before the tank could obliterate all three of my best men with its cannon and heavy machine gun fire. The grenade exploded inside and instantly killed everyone, disabling the tank in the process. It was such an incredible David and Goliath moment . . . I think I started jumping up and down from excitement. The rest of the mission went quite smoothly after that!

I'm very impressed by the brilliantly programmed opponents and immersive details (sights, sounds, smells, etc.) in this game. I rarely have the chance to get it out and play it because it takes such a long time (obsess over every decision like I do and you'll generally end up spending 6-8 hours on a single mission); but when I do have the chance to play this, it's a tense, gripping, endlessly surprising experience that rivals or surpasses most any other game I've played.

RATING: 7
This is the first OOP boardgame I ever purchased and also my first solitaire game.

Pretty fun game and can be found on the cheap these days. The action is a bit over the top (not in a bad way) but poor play is most definitely not rewarded. I've had many agonizing decisions and some heart breaking die rolls (as well as some near impossible rolls that literally saved the day).

For a solitaire game this is definitely exciting.

The light RPG elements are nice and make the campaign that much more exciting. It's agonizing to lose a veteran of severl missions.

RATING: N/A
Solitaire WW2 at tactical level.  It shows how Victory Games tried to push the frontier to another limit...if so before the solitaire ASL arrival.  This game posted a good question to me at the time:  why people would ever consider playing games alone? With the system?  Now, I play games alone whether the game system is a solitaire one or not, even more than the 2-player game.  Sadly, more choices and more good games just lead the wargamers to go alone along the road, which is not supposed to be as wargame is designed for two and playing wargame is an process of interaction between two players.  Sigh.

I played more solitaire games these days.  Although games like RAF and Silent War are quite likeable, they seem to be too long to come to a conlcusion for solitaire experience.  Boring comes in if the game play becomes protracted. My no.1 game is Mark Herman's design of Peloponnessian War and it can be completed in a reasonable amount of time.  This speaks the truth that a good solitaire design could still be a very good gaming experience. After Ambush, I have yet to see another solitaire system coming up for a refreshing look at this solitaire game genre.  I hope there is one coming soon. 

I really wish a reprint of the series by Compass Games as John is going to have a new design with the company. It is hard to find a good solitaire, paragraph-based tactical level WW2 wargame today. Therefore, Ambush is really an innovative game system back then and till now. I don't want to hunt down VG copies over the eBay but I would definitely buy new ones from a reprint. I don't think it would be too difficult to translate it to iPad.

Solitaire game simulating tactical squad-level infantry missions during World War II. The combat system is elegant and exciting. The game allows you to personalize your squad and lead them through several missions. The mortality rate can be very high, but squad members who survive acquire experience. Single missions usually took 3-4 hours to complete, which requires a huge commitment in time and energy, but I loved playing this game back in the day.

Ground breaking solitaire game.  Great game with ground breaking AI.  Excellent theme and feel for variations among members of the squad.  You really grow attached to you squad members as the go on missions and level up.  The only limitation is that it may not be fast enough for the XBox generation.

I love the idea behind this game, it's just a shame it couldn't have been a bit less clunky.  There's a chart to consult every time you move a soldier, there's a book to reference every time something happens, a chart to consult every time you roll a die, don't even get me started on moving the Germans.  Not necessarily better than simply playing a 2-player tactical wargame by yourself.

Wow! I finally started playing this and all I can say is Wow! This really is my ultimate game. I bought a copy almost two years ago because I'd heard so many good things about the game but was never able to wrap my head around the rules. I finally just started a game with the plan of learning as I play... And I had a blast.

While my playing days of this are probably well behind me, I thoroughly enjoyed this in junior high school and found the replayability high despite the protestations of the developers themselves. It was engaging due to the one-on-one scale, and had an ingenious programmed opponent. It was lousy history but never claimed to be trying - in fact stated outright that it was inspired by TV shows and comic books. As such, it was every bit as fun as reading Sgt. Rock or watching Combat!

I bought this on ebay a few years ago. I believe it is complete or very close to complete. It is punched.

It is the 1983 Victory Games Edition. It seems to be a very cool game. I wish I had time to play it.

The chits, maps, rulebook, and tables are all in very good shape. The box does show wear. Three of the box top corners have been repaired with scotch tape. On one of the sides you can see the remains from where a price sticker was applied and then mostly removed. One of the box bottom corners is split.

I hope I have given a good description but if you have any questions just let me know.

Near perfect. Just the right balance of complexity and playability, but minimal  replay value. Constant referencing of the paragraph booklet is more annoying now than it was 10 years ago, because I'm used to having a computer do all the bookkeeping, but still...an amazing and innovative system that finally gave the solo gamer a reason to smile. One of the many strengths of this was how personal it was--you became invested in the lives and fortunes of your little squad members. Even though replayability is limited, the scenarios really provide a great variety of missions, making it a terrific value.

There were a ton of great innovations in this one, and it is rightly regarded as a classic.

NONE of my Ambush! stuff is for trade, as I no longer have any extra copies of anything.

Wow, this game is really something.  Awesome system, very tense, I even lost sleep over it last night.  The trepadition as I flip the next page... Still learning to get it to go more smoothly, but I managed to win the first scenario with 13 points!  I can't speak highly enough of this clever design.  I'm hooked, and normally WW2 games do nothing for me.

Jam'16:  Played the third scenario and lost again, with 19 points.  I wonder if I will ever win this game!  The big event was my Jeep being blown up by a tank, but a lucky grenade toss by my second in command took it out.  The stress this game generates is amazing!  It just plays a bit methodically.

I have a second copy to trade.

It's a good solitaire game, and the design is well thought out.  However, I can't get that excited about the game too much because it is a solitaire game.  Even though the tables are designed to keep you from figuring out what's in front of you, I was still able to figure it out.However, on a personal note, you can get awfully attached to your squad as they go from scenario to scenario, unlike many wargames that I've played.One final item is that once you finish the scenarios, the game has limited replayability until you get an expansion set.If you like solitaire wargames, then this is a very well done game to have.  

Edit:  (1/28/2007)  After many years, I pulled out my old copy of Ambush! and took it for a spin (see the session report on this).  After having been away for so long, I'd forgotten the codes in the game as well as the ebb and flow of the battle.  A couple of hours into a session, things moved along much more smoothly, and I had a blast playing the game.  I'm now bumping the rating up to 7, and am looking forward to the next time I get a couple of hours to play.

This would be a truly amazing game if it were just a bit faster playing and had a bit less detail. It does offer an immersive experience with a lot of tactical decision making, surprises, and fun. Unfortunately there's just too much detail and fiddlyness in the way to really get into it, so I don't want to play it as much as I might. Also, every so often, a potentially game-making decision about the Germans' behavior is left up to the player, which I find ruins the immersion.

Hard to rate. I cannot believe that anyone will play this today as it is too cumbersome and has been replaced by PC games (this is Jagged Alliance in WWII without steroids). :-)

An amazing solo experience. The rulebook could use some work, but the game is worth it to learn. You will control a group of soldiers, and use a book full of paragraphs to determine events and non-player actions. For whatever reasons, the game creates an emergent narrative out of pretty sparse explanation; I've never felt more invested in my cardboard chits. 

My favorite solo game.

RATING: 9
This was one of the first games I played as an adult, having loved playing board games as a child. As well as being set in WWII, the period of history in which I'm most interested, the fact that it was a properly solitaire game allowed for a very personal experience, a board game extension of playing with plastic soldiers, recreating scenes nearer to war films rather than war itself.

I still remember the feeling of trepidation when making the first moves of the first scenario; the dread of walking into danger as I advanced each of the 8 soldiers of the squad into the next hex. Having never played D&D or similar, this was my introduction to character progression; apart from the obvious desire to stay alive, the novelty of being able to improve the squad for the next, more demanding, scenario only added to the flavour. After playing through each scenario as the campaign, I played most of the scenarios again, but although none ever played out exactly the same, the replay value was definitely lessened because the main 'surprise' was already known. This only made the anticipation the subsequent modules even more acute.

It's difficult to provide an objective rating for this game as I last played it over 20 years ago. I realise it wasn't perfect (there could often be a point in a game when the objective had effectively been achieved but you might need to seek out extra VP to win the game instead of heading for the exit area); the rules suffer from the usual AH/VG complexity. I based my 9 rating on the sheer enjoyment it gave me at the time. I can't decide whether I'd still get the same from it today, having played countless other games since. But I still look for the solitaire playability rating on every game I buy and I always want to play games with a feeling of story progression. This certainly fitted the bill.

Truly a unique gaming system and experience without equal. A genuine masterpiece. The memorable joy of the storytelling lingers for years and is immensely satisfying. The design of Ambush! successfully blends the cumulative experience and character progression of a role playing game with the best qualities of surprise and fog of war of a tactical experience. There is simply not enough praise for this perfect game experience.

Great solitaire game. 
Had a few problems with the rules but when you get into it the fun is guaranteed. 
But after the forth mission i stopped playing because it was not that game i was looking for . 
Too much dice rolling and chart reading combined with rules i used all the time to look if i play it the right way. It don´t worked for me.
Then i found D-Day at Ohmaha Beach, also from John H.Butterfield, and that is the solitaire game i was always looking for ^^

RATING: 10
A fun game to play. Progress is rather slow due to all the paragraph checking (although I suppose that helps to build the tension). I have been rather frustrated by the rules which seem to be full of ambiguities. I have often found that I need to just make a judgment about what would seem most sensible and go with that.

Still, the missions this far seem to have a lot of variety and it is hard to imagine another solitaire title dishing up the degree of surprise that this one can.

RATING: 10
A 10 for its innovation and the massive work involved in designing it. The supreme narrative wargame. The well-written errata rules are still very over-whelming non the less.
You must start playing it before even beginng to understand it. By that time, the mission secrets will have been exposed. Just keep replaying the first mission anyway in order to learn the system.

The rulebook is not entirely straightforward, and not very interesting.  However, the rules themselves work well and are not cumbersome at all, once you figure them out.  The bonus is, since it's a solo game you'll never be arguing about rules interpretations.  I recommend reading up to section 6, then skimming the LoS and combat rules, before jumping in to mission 1 with the prebuilt squad.

The system works very well.  The "AI" usually provides reasonable reactions, even when flanking the "bots" and surprising them.  There is a substantial luck factor.

A few of my missions have felt easy, but I was most likely just lucky with die rolls.  Avoiding the ambush, approaching from an unexpected direction, and coordinating your squad effectively help a lot.

Single player squad based tactical game. I've watched a play through video and liked the mechanics (initiative, strategic vs. round based actions, hex based events). It has a lot of looking up reference sheet and dice-roll-tables.

This game was recommended as similar to video game "Frozen Synapse".

The game is out of print and difficult to get an original copy. I saw an offer for dvd on ebay that contains pdf to print out the game. But that's a lot of work with questionable quality, I guess.

Still getting familiar with the mechanisms.  This is my first wargame, so the complexity level is not what I'm used to, and neither is the required patience level.  Living with cats, I do not want to leave it out, so I hope to complete the first scenario soon, and be able to give an informed rating.

[Update] I have completed the first mission, and while I did enjoy it, I am leaving my rating a 6, based on the given rubric.  I don't expect to pull this game out very often, but I imagine that I will enjoy it when I do.

[Update] I have played the second scenario and failed miserably.  This game is very engrossing once you get past the bookkeeping involved, and paragraph checks become habit and very quick.  As poorly as the second mission went for my men, I really enjoyed playing it.  I am, however, continuing to leave my rating as 6, since the given rubric defines a 6 as a game you will play sporadically if you are in the right mood.

It's solitare and it doesn't suck. it's just a fact that for me computer games have made this one redundant. Once you work out the clever way to play you're playing more a solo roleplaying game than anything else. There's was a time when this slightly interested me. That time has long passed.

I never really warmed to Ambush. However, it did provide one of my most memorable gaming momemts when during a campaign of Ambush, I lost the hero of my squad to a freak die roll. I was so upset I did not play Ambush again for 10 years. As a card carrrying pinko leftie liberal, I have had the occasional frisson of discomfort about the joy I get from cardboard carnage. That Ambush campaign reminded me that the 4-6-4 Infantry Regiment we commit to a soak off without a second glance is in reality made up of a bunch of Joes and Daves that actually get shot.

Part of my solitaire wargame collection. I'm enjoying this soldier-level game quite a bit. Slogging through all the rules takes some time and good faith -- you'll have to make some decisions on behalf of the German soldiers so they react naturally, even if it's to the detriment of your squad. It's easy while playing this game to get hooked into the narrative.

Old system, but still holds up to this day. I did not grow up playing this and acquired it in 2011. I love the narrative that develops as you play. The game comes alive with the paragraph system and you feel like you are writing your own story. Don't name your squad members after people you actually know, cause you do come to care for them and it really hits you when you lose them.

In retrospect I've replayed this game so often, and the feeling I receive from just setting a game up is still a mixture of wonder and excitement. This is as close to perfect as it gets for solitaire capability and enjoyment.

[i]I regularly answer rules question on this game in the forums. So if you have a problem, just ask.[/i]

This game cured my addiction to computer-games!

People who fancy "theme", "drama", "crucial desisions each and every turn" or "a game that plays like a story laid out before oneself", should try this instead. Or maybe you shouldn't, because most people feel a certain futility of their own existence after finding what they were so desperatly looking for...

I have a serious need for a solo wargame and tactical is a genre that is underrepresented in my collection so Ambush! should be perfect.

It just isn't though.

The paragraph 'choose your own adventure' system takes me out of the game.  I've played the first mission alone and then once more with a friend, I can accept that there isn't much replayability, my main qualm is it doesn't feel tactical.  Spreading your soldiers out to get crossfire and such makes no sense in the game system.  Each hex is like stepping on a land mine, you want as few events triggered as possible and if an event triggers you want as much firepower to deal with it as possible.  So you end up moving you guys in an unrealistic stack around the board like a massive flesh tank.

6 (I really want to like it, and I'll give it another try, but I don't think my opinion will change)

I've been anticipating this game for quite a while, years in the making really.  I've been intimidated by the "oldness" of everything, though, and just recently got through the rulebook and spunked up to play.  And after the first mission, I now know that I would have played this every day of my life back in the 80s if I knew about it.  Looking forward to playing some more missions with my guys before rating.  Absolutely GENIUS system, and I can't imagine how long it took to write up that storybook.

I've not played many solitaire games nor war games, but this game works very well. It sometimes shows it's age, by making you look up charts and through the paragraph booklet and is a somewhat complicated game. 

However, once you get into playing it, you pick it up very quickly, as the rules make a lot of sense. Plus, it immerses you into the story of your squad, which is something no other game I've played so far has done.

It feels like a mix of a lighter war game and Tales of the Arabian Nights. Except I would say that you have a lot more control over your squad's fate than you would in Tales.

Note: Ambush! is my second full on war game and another example that Weight/Complexity ratings of war-games on the Board Game Geek website are not commensurate with board games of different types. Agricola, which is weighted at 3.63 (8/16) I could teach somebody to play in about 15 minutes (and learned from the awful rulebook in about an hour), whereas Ambush!, which has a weight of 3.22 (8/16), I have a pretty decent grasp of only after playing two complete games, reading the rulebook for hours, re-reading some of the book, consulting rules threads (of which there are many), and watching a video, where the player got a lot of the stuff wrong.
Three of my favorite games are complex---Cave Evil (#1!), Codeword Cromwell, and Mage Knight---but still, Ambush! feels much heavier.  Part of the complexity comes from the amount of exceptions to each rule, and part of the complexity comes from some poorly explained and occasionally counterintuitive rules: the many Line of Sight question threads attest to this fact.  But the major part of the weight of this game comes from an uncommonly well detailed combat system that takes into account the firearm, the focus of the shooter, the distance of the shot, the health of the fighters, the terrain of the target, the intervening terrain, the relative elevations of the target and shooter, the likelihood of weapons jamming, the likelihood of accidentally expending too much ammunition, and (my favorite detail) the stances of the shooter and target.  All of these things are taken into account for each minute phase of combat...and other variables may come into play as well.  This system and the event decoder (and paragraphs) are the biggest mechanical strengths of this game, wherein the sense of adventure is quite high.

It is clear that greater comfort with the many systems of this game would make playing Ambush! more enjoyable, but this could never be played quickly by me. The feather weight paper components make the tactile part of the experience an effort rather than a pleasure--- these counters would not stay in place if Ambushed! by a mild sneeze and there is not enough room to actually see the many things you are required to stack in each hex. (If the map were mounted and could accommodate the counters, and if the latter were visible, and if the cross-referencing were simpler, this would be my second favorite board game ever.) Still, there is satisfaction with every small victory, frustration with every defeat, and apprehension with the arrival of every new enemy.  In addition to the detailed combat, the enemy A.I., and the variety of events, the overall thematic success is probably why this game from 1983 is still being played and discussed by war game enthusiasts today.

Overall, Ambush! feels like high school homework, albeit those rare assignments that I found enjoyable to do.

One of the best wargames ever created. Also the best solo wargame ever created. It's WWII man to man, house to house combat. You never know where the enemy will pop up to face your squad. The stories lines also make the game fun. I really like the initiative system because you never now which soldier friendly or enemy will act first. There are some light RPG elements that make feel attached to your guys. When I lived in Germany back in the late 80s, I had my three favorite wargames with me, Ambush!, B-17 and Patton's Best. Since Ambush! is out of print you might want to check out Nuts! Final Version, a solo man to man combat game set in WWII, from Two Hour Wargames. It's not Ambush! but it's very close.

This has got to be the best solitaire game ever. It is fiddly and complex by today's standards, but all of that makes for a completely rewarding solo experience for me.  I love the depth and detail. It takes a long time to set up and play or I would play more.  The play system may not lend itself to great replayability, but there are lots of missions and expansions so it really does take a long time to exhaust.

Update: I can't increase the rating as it was always a 10, but I love this game more as time goes on.  I understand that there will never be a game like this again as computer games are how people do simulations now, but it is a beauty.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 1


Overall - 1

Decent solitaire game for its time, but it's very dated by today's standards. There is still some fun to be had if you managed to digest the rules, but it just seems way to tedious to me. The game is very deep with a lot of flavor, but simple things like moving a single hex can spawn endless dice rolls, paragraph look ups and table checks. Even Combat is a chore with rolling for weapon jam, rolling to hit, rolling for spent ammo, rolling for damage, adding modifiers, subtracting modifiers, it just goes on and on and on. Modern mechanics could really make a remake of this game shine.

RATING: 7
[Rated 2006/02/04, based on 2 plays]

A little bit fiddly in both rules and bits sense, although the former gets easier over the course of a game.  There is a definite story feel to it, your squad are not just abstracted playing pieces, they are individuals trying to make it through the mission.

The system of mission cards with the 'sekrit decoder' together with the thick book of text are excellent for solo play - both adding to story flavour and giving interesting and challenging 'AI' to the oppposition.

Outstanding in every regard. I can't begin to imagine how much effort went into programming the game, but it is brilliant. The game does seem to come alive, which always leads to an incredible solo experience. The Ops vs. Rounds is a nice touch, speeding up gameplay outside of combat while giving the typical depth during combat. 

The only downsides are that the system is a bit cumbersome (but I don't even notice once I get into the flow of the game), and that the missions will never feel fresh after the first play. A few years between playing will likely help, though.

Man, this one can be a lot of fun.  Takes a l_o_n_g time to play a scenario.  Unfortunately, this game is complex enough that when I spend 6+ months between plays, I have to relearn whole chunks of the rules, and gameplay slows down even further.  However, this one is a great way to get completely immersed in a system.  The paragraph system keeps you guessing.  Name your soldiers after people you know for greatest effect.  Make sure you always put the guy you hate on point, so he can find the German bullets first.

Amazing hex and counter solitaire (or 2-player co-op) wargame with a very detailed and innovative mechanism (for 1983). Playing a mission is like watching a movie or, is like someone telling you a story and the story materialize in front of your eyes. But the game appears difficult to beginners and you have to like wargaming, so unfortunately it's not for eneryone. Sometimes you may get tired from the continuous use of the paragraph booklet, but a small price to pay for such a wonderful game.

I've had this game for a good number of years now. Whenever I go away and it looks like there may be no chance of gaming with others, I bring this along. Until you get up to speed well with the system it feels quite rulesey. (but hey it was produced in 1983 for goodness sake). There seems to be a lot of the time minor rules that you can forget about.

In saying that, the scope to be able to recall a scenario that tells an incredible story in the same line as say combat commander. I think it's an incredible game.

I love this game. I enjoy and am a collector of solo games. Took a bit of work and a Q posted here on the geek to figure out the individual soldier turn order but it was really just for confirmation that I was doing it right... and I was. The rules will take some work to get through but it is worth it. It can be a bit tedious to look up the paragraphs but overall it is a very well done game that tells a narrative as you play against it. I can not imagine that was easy to achieve. Choices can be agonizing as you become attached to your squad... I had a squad start out the other day and a grenade malfunctioned and exploded on the first turn... we were bunched up - took out half the squad... I was devastated. Looking forward to grabbing the other games in this series as I find them.

Only wargame I ever played solo without feeling kind of weird and pathetic.

Does not have the original rules or paragraph book.  I had to print one out.

traded .. I just wasn't going to get the time to play on my own and it seemed a little too fiddly. If it was multiplayer the detail would be cool but I've been spoilt by computer games. Its a sad life when you can't justify the time it takes to play a solo wargame.

Traded for Rommel in the Desert.

Excellent solitaire game. I prefer Solitaire ASL, though.

One of the best single player wargames out there. Nice mechanics and not too hard to get trough the rules.

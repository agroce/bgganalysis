(And, for the record, it was traded away...)

RATING: 8
A "structured" trading game. Players are limited in what they can say, and can only "offer" or "ask", but not both, on a single turn. Even though all you do is trade cards to collect sets, it completely avoids being Pit.

Bought used at the WBC auction. Played once so far - it is a typical Reinger Knizia game. Fast, abstract, rules are not well-written, but once you play it it's pretty simple and engaging. Not much depth, but a good gamey card game.

OK, so I really wanted to like this game.  But I didn't.  It seemed to suffer from a "rich get richer" syndrome, as once I got a lead I ran with it all the way to the end.

RATING: 5
it was cheap, that's the only one good thing i can mention. not a brainburner, but boring... :(
there is only one way to win, no alternatives... until none of your opponents builds a city, your best chance is to draw and draw without any trading, since having luck drawing the proper cards and bilding a city 2 or 3 or even more rounds before the opponents do is a very great advantage. if this happens, you are not interested in trade at all...  playing less than 5 this is much more true...

not among my favorites and not among the best of Knizia... :(

Kind of negotiation game to get sets of cards to "develop" your cities.  The point is that the rules for negotiation are quite strict.

As a trading game, the restrictions of bartering left me cold; the ability to steam ahead once you get your first city was quite frustrating to those unable to complete one.  Sorry, Reiner - this one's a flop for me.

RATING: 5
3-5 | (5) | 60 min | 10+ | Reiner Knizia
Interesting trading game, specially because it seems to be heavily dependent on the group of players (e.g. people must be willing to lose some in order to speed up their own development). Rating would increase with the right crowd. On the negative side, I am not sure if comebacks are possible.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is the best trading game I've ever played. Clever restrictions on what may or may not be said in a trade offer lend the game a whole new level of strategy. Best with 5, but playable with 3 or 4 as well. Brilliance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not crazy about this one... there's not a lot you can do.   Everyone's going to roughly tie every game it would seem to me.  It appears to come down to whether you are lucky on the draws, meaning that you need fewer trades to complete sets.  Bleh.

Since you have such a limited number of cards, you can't even employ strategies like acquiring a type of card from one player to give to another. That would make for a better game, but isn't really possible. Initial rating 5, although I did enjoy it (rating 3 for game, 6 for fun, 4 total)

A very interesting trade/barter game.  I enjoy this game more and more every time I play it.  I'm not sure why it doesn't come out more often. I like graphics in this version (Queen Games) much more than the Avalanche Press version.

Avalanche version with groovy illustrations... First play (3-player) was so-so.  I'm not ready to give up on it yet. Runaway leader problem? -Couldn't people just refuse to trade with the leader? The social aspect of the trading is a moderate plus. Maybe better with more than 3... I'm hopeful.

A friend of mine calls this "Go Fish for adults." That's a fair description of this game, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

RATING: 6
Somewhat odd card game. It's a basic set collection / trading game with one hook: On your turn you may make one trade with exactly one other player. But there is no negotiation. Rather, you may [i]ask[/i] for one or more cards (described as specifically or generally as you like), or [i]offer[/i] one or more cards, again with as little or much detail as you like. What card(s) are requested/offered, then all other players get one chance to do the reverse. The active player then may accept exactly one trade.

There's a little more, but not much. For those who like to concoct interesting trades without getting into protracted negotiations, it's interesting. I happen to be in that camp. But it's nothing to write home about.

RATING: 7
Rating based on one play.  Love the deal making and negotiation aspects of this game.  However, I did notice that the start player seemed to have an advantage over others.  1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc place went to 1st, 2nd, 3rd player, etc player.  In any case, once you get behind, it is very hard to catch up.  It requires commitment by all the players to stop trading with the leader.  I would like to try this one again because of my enjoyment of negotiation games, but will hope to see ways around the pre-determined outcome.

RATING: 5
Not a bad game, but fairly uninspired; one of Knizia's weaker designs. In first half, there is a very real chance to be delayed on getting your first set due to opaque competition or luck. Due to the draw acceleration mechanics, this is particularly frustrating, as falling behind even a few turns means losing but having to suffer through a large chunk of additional game. The defined trading is interesting in concept but falls pretty flat in practice, robbing the game of some much-needed tension.

I liked the idea about the game, but did find there wasn't a lot you can do. Just draw good cards and you'll win, because you'll be the runaway leader. The fun thing is you can be really creative in what you are asking for, but that won't really help you any forward. Knizia's worst I'm afraid.

RATING: 8
A remarkably clever trading game where you may only make one offer/counter-offer for every deal on the table.  Deals are made over sets of cards, sets are traded in for settlements, which give you more cards and eventually cities.  A game where you must listen carefully, and carefully consider your limited chances to trade.  A delight to play a trade/negotiation game where you don&#039;t have to shout to get anywhere!

Got any fours??? No, go fish.

This is a game for manipulative people that you never invite to parties because they are so passive aggressive they would make your gold fish slap his own forehead.

It suffers from the following problems.

1. It just isn't any fun. 
2. Breakaway leader syndrome.
3. No one trades so you are 90% of the time just drawing cards hoping to make a set.
4. Its a bore fest...

I just don't get why this game was made or why anyone would like it. Went directly to the free to take pile...

I was happy to see the game done, I almost didn't want to finish it.

This game is outstanding, in fact the rating could go up.  The mechanics are quite simple, although it takes some people a while to get the trading rules.  It almost seems like gin rummy except there's trading involved.  Clever subtleties become evident as the game progresses.  This is a winner, and I will try to play this often.  I own the Avalanche Press edition, with deck protectors on the cards.  I may also try to seek out the Queen edition, just for fun.

The blurry and undifferentiated GMT Games artwork certainly doesn't help this rather blurry and undifferntiated game. Draw card, use clunky trading system to make acquisitions, hope that the cards you need come to you so that you don't have to particpate in clunky trading mechanic, etc. Far too long for what it is, and the decisions are uninteresting. PASS!

The central mechanic for Res Publica is quite clever and beautifully turns a trading game which would normally be given life solely through negotiations and bartering at the table into a trading game without any (explicit) negotiations at all.

An interesting trading/bargaining game.  I appreciated the forced choice between collecting people cards to get more cities and technology cards to build the monuments.  The meat of the game is really to pay attention to the requests of others and structuring your offers/requests to extract at least equal value from the trade while not pushing it so far as to not get a trade completed.  The problem, of course, is the value of a card changes based on whats been played to the table and what other cards have in your hand, which makes trade valuations difficult.

The system of strictly-encoded trade offers/demands generates some interesting choices, but I'm just not convinced that I'm having fun when I play Res Publica.  I admire the basic mechanism that forms the game's skeleton, but the simplistic set-collecting game that surrounds it is rather lean meat.  The goals are too straightforward, lacking nuance or flexibility or alternative paths to winning.  A more engaging theme might help.  Why am I collecting and trading members of barbarian tribes?  Surely there was something more fitting, no?  Most of the times I've played, the winner has been a foregone conclusion long before the game ended.  Whoever gets ahead early is hard to beat.

Definitely not worth it with 5p (each player picks one suit and the game is won or lost on very boring marginal advantages). Constrained communication is always interesting, probably enough to try this again with 4p if given the chance.

Which I guess would make it my least-despised Knizia game.

[Update: Now there are several Knizias I like more, but I don't know if that would make me enjoy this less, or more. If I did play it again, which I probably won't.]

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very interesting trading game that requires some unexpected deduction to play well.

Since table-talk is very limited and the formal trading highly restricted (you can either request something or offer something, but not both), you need to pay careful attention to every trade. In fact, you need to pay careful attention to every offer, even when it's not your turn.

For example, on Al's turn he asks for two Romans and Bob asks for 1 Greek. Both bits of information are valuable and it's important to remember each if you hope to do well -- if Bob later offers cards you need, knowing that he wants Greeks makes it far likelier that you'll make a trade.

This figuring out what other people want (or have) isn't just crucial to the game -- it *is* the game. Many people won't like this as it requires a level of attention unusual in this type of game, but this is also what makes Res Publica unique.

Read the rules, a fun light trading game. My worry is there isn't a whole lot to come back to, but it should always be fun to pull like once a year maybe. 

It would seem it would benefit from being shortened, and it would seem to me that that should be easy to do with no ill effects (just remove 25% of the cards, or put a turn limit). Shorter, I would be more apt to play more often since its kind of long for a filler and what it is (too light me thinks)

Nice ideas but too long for a light filler. Trading is also based on a good idea that just does not work.

RATING: 3
Trading/set-collecting card game. Players trade 'peoples' cards in an attempt to get five alike, at which point a city can be bought. Cities yield 'technology' cards, and five of *these* are used to buy 'wonder' cards. Cities and wonders are the main source of end-of-game VP.

In Res Publica a player can fall behind quite early in the game, through no fault of his own and with no subsequent chance to catch up. It's a game of the-rich-get-richer. Also, the incessant trading of cards gets quite tedious.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (January 2017)

Res Publica was described to me as a negotiation game and I love negotiation so I went for it. After playing the game, I can say it IS NOT a negotiation game, in fact, the rules explicitly prohibit any negotiation by the players (or they lose the turn). Res Publica is a light trading game from designer Reiner Knizia and he is mostly miss with me these days, so I wasn’t expecting anything good, but the game (kind of) surprised me.

The rules are surprisingly simple, you can explain them under 4 minutes. Playtime is fast, around 40 minutes.

The game box is too big for what comes inside (just a bunch of cards) and in an ironic turn of events, the game box is too small for the game rules, they come wrinkled due to this.

The art is ok, but nothing ground breaking.

The decisions needed to play the game are mostly obvious. The best part is when you offer or request something. A bit of memory is good to have so you can remember what other players want. I do like that each player only have one opportunity to offer or request something, that keeps the game moving at a fast pace. 

Best with 4 players.

It seems that the player who first build a settlement have a huge advantage. In our game that player had 3 whole turns before any other player and he finally won the game so perhaps it has “runaway leader” issues. Luck of the draw is very high.

Bottom line, Res Publica is an odd trading game (it is NOT a negotiation game), but can be a good game with the right crowd. I find it too simple for my current tastes. I will sell it ASAP but I would play again if requested. I think the luck of the draw is too much and catching a runaway leader is almost impossible.

I wanted to like Res Publica as I enjoy trading in games and Knizia is one of my favourite authors. But Res Publica was too bland for me. All players ended up with a similar amount of settlements and whenever I was able to complete something, it felt more like lucky draws as opposed to clever trading was the main reason. I probably didn't pay enough attention to what everybody else was looking out for or offering. But being such a light game I don't want to concentrate as much on it as is necessary to eek out better trades than the competition.

Seems like a very fragile game, highly dependent on both the number and types of players participating.  I can see how many would be bored by this, but it seems like you have to be ready to wheel and deal to make progress.  I found it strangely relaxing, a very mellow type game.  I would like to play with a seasoned group, as I'm sure there's more to it than I've seen.

RATING: 7
Fun and different trading card game that it seems I'll like more the more I play it.  The trick is that each person can only ask for certain things or offer certain things, not both.  Each other player then has to ask for or offer something in exchange.  The player can then pick the best offer or none at all.  You have to try and remember what people are trying to get rid of and what people want.  You have to ask for or offer for the right things to win, since how you frame your offers/asks will have a big impact on how successful you are.

Res Publica seems more like a really great mechanic called a game. The trading mechanic really appeals to me, but I think it would be even better as part of a larger game. Still, it's certainly an enjoyable game and I'd even consider buying it (if it weren't out of print!).

One of the most boring games ever. This is just a mild negotiation game, where you make all your deals without having enough knowledge or chances to get something else than 1:1 trades which makes this game dull. Again, it's very important to get your first sets in the beginning, because then you get advantage compared to the others. If you REALLY like trading games, there is one winner: Bohnanza.

A good but somewhat dry trading game.  Here the twist is that trading is restricted — You can either state what you’re willing to trade or what you want, but not both.  And you can’t negotiate once the offer is made.  Memory is essential so you won’t be wasting your trade turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I really don't like this game.  A 5 is probably too generous.  The trade mechanic is annoying since no one ever sees to understand if someone wants the card or is willing to trade it.  The non negotiation element is silly as well.  I played this with AP prone players and it was awful.  The underlying mechanic of gathering sets quickly to get cities and using those cities to get cards to build monuments is a good one.  But it does seem to have a runaway leader problem.  Or people I have played with don't recognize that you need to clip the leader.  

I wanted to like it but this game will likely fall flat with most people.  It is not one of Reiner's better games.

Not sure why it's not rated higher. It seems like a more streamlined form of Bohnanza in that you're trading and building sets. One commenter wrote: "Sort of a slow-motion Pit crossed with Go Fish... Actually, it has some similarities with Settlers of Catan: you trade resources with other players to collect sets that you can spend to increase your resource income (and your victory point total). "


The Queens games edition (2011) should be worth getting.
Once it comes out (along with reviews), considering moving this to a MUST HAVE.

Oddly enough this game reminded me of Bohnanza, they're both card games with trading as the central mechanic. Bohnanza, however, is a much better game in my opinion. The problem with this game is that everything is set up to reward the leader. The leader will be the one drawing the most yellow cards and the leader will be the one laying down sets of yellows first while the score for yellow sets is still high (the score of each succeeding set of yellow cards diminishes). So how much skill is involved in becoming the leader? Perhaps some but in my opinion luck of the draw is the main factor. That can make for a very frustrating game if you fall behind early. I do like the regimented trading mechanic, however. It's something that would benefit Bohnanza as that game can bog down with convoluted negotiations.

08/24/12 Acquired the 2011 Queen edition. I was disappointed the game did not come with English rules; only German. What gives Queen? You put multi-language rules in all your other games. I finally found the English rules about 5 levels down in their hard to navigate (German) website and printed them off. Another Queen feature; the box is too big for what's in it (3 decks of cards). For all of the above the game loses a rating point. Though the artwork/icons on the cards are clear and easy to read. 
 
12/11/12 Played a four-player game. It went over well after everyone finally wrapped their heads around the strict trading rules. Yes, they are unlike any other card "trading" game I've played. That's why I bought it, its rare/unique.

A collection & trade game that was too dry for me.  I want to give it another shot though, it may have just been the group I played with.  My group didn't trade enough & the game dragged on & on while people waited hoping they would draw the right cards to make a group.  I like the mechanics but the game ultimately needs something else to liven it up.  Game also has the issue that the rich get richer but I'm not sure how strong this factor is.

A Knizia trading and set collecting game. Trade cards under certain conditions to collect a set of five, then trade in acquired cards for scarce VPs. I didn't really enjoy this game that much. It invovles a different trading mechanism, which makes it slightly more complicated than normal. Perhaps it was the pressure to trade in your sets the quickest that made me not like the game, since there were only a limited numer of things you could earn by trading.

I'm not sold on this game. As in any trading game, it's always to your advantage to trade with another player as, though it advances one other player's cause, you both improve over the other 3 players. And if you're going to trade, you may as well be open about what you want (there's the option to put out / offer cards blind) so that you don't waste a turn not getting what you need. And you generally can't tell who's getting the better of any equal card number swap as everyone is drawing new cards each turn so their collections / desires change. So how much room is left for good play?

Another downer is that the game has an obvious rich-get-richer problem which can only be circumvented by a trading ban on whoever is collecting most cards each turn. But if that's the only way to improve your own position you have a dilemma.

At least it's got some interaction and the different trading mechanisms make for some decisions.

Played a couple of times: Knizia has distilled the trading mechancic as he has done with the bidding mechanic in Ra: once around swift play and psychological pressure of assessing opponents' wants. Further still, in RP you are restricted in your turn that you can only declare an offer or a trade. You have to closely follow information that is slowly being revealed, so that you can ensure that what you declare doesn't fall on deaf ears. So the game is just alittle too subtle for my tastes, and some trades can effectively hand the game to someone and also the first person to start dipping into the technology deck has an advantage. I guess the straggling players can silently leave out dealing with the leader, but I wonder if there will be unsatisfying deadlocks. The scoring I find just alittle unweildy as you have to add several different values, but in the end I feel that I'd rather play Settlers than this quiet, intense and subtle civilisation building. I much prefer the cartoon artwork in the Queen edition rather than the busy Avalanche Press which makes discerning holdings difficult.

One 3-player game. Seemed like a bit of a rich-get-richer game. Will probably be better with 4 or 5.

A 'solution' might be to randomize the high-value Monument cards using opaque card sleeves. Of course, this makes the game change emphasis from luck-of-the-draw of the 2 initial card decks to luck-of-the-draw of the Monument deck.

Undecided on this one.  Has potential, but needs careful players.  It's kind of like slow-motion Pit.  Needs good players or perhaps a tinker to force more interesting trades than the "I offer a Roman", as otherwise the luck of the draw can play too big a part in determining the winner. The aim is to be the middle man in as many trades as possible.  Very often two players can not manage a direct trade as their wants are not compatible.  If you recognize this, and can work out a way to meet both their wants, you are effectively participating in two trades for each of their one.  More players certainly makes it merrier.

Hey, what do you know?  This game is boring.  

I normally wouldn't rate a game that I didn't finish, but I'd started a game of this and took the first opportunity to leave.  Ask for some cards or offer some cards, get what you want or don't, hope to draw well.  

GO FISH!  

Aw, shucks.  
Now repeat that Ad Infinitum.  

I saw where this was going and I'm glad I jumped off when I did. It made no difference in gameplay with someone entering or me leaving. After checking back in with the group another hour had gone by and they were still going.  Doing the exact same tedious trades.  Just because you upgrade to technology cards doesn't mean the game gets any different.  I never want to play this again. BTW Avalanche really knows how to make a game ugly don't they.

I used to love a lot of Knizia games but he's not really my favorite any more; this one, though, was quite enjoyable! It's a nice filler-y type of game.

--- Summary ---
There are 2 decks of cards. You initially use just one of them, dealing each player a hand of cards. On your turn, you draw a card then try to trade. Trading has a twist: either announce what you have, or what you want; in turn, players announce what they have, following your original wording format. In fact, there are specific rules about how to word things in these announcements. After hearing all the others, you choose a player with whom to trade. The goal is to meld a set of 5 like cards (each deck has 12? cards in each of 5 types); when you do so, you get a VP reward card, and you get to draw an extra card each turn (max 2 extra cards?). You play through both decks, then players earn some extra VP for some of their cards in hand. Most VP wins.

I have played 20-25 of Knizia's games and this is the only one I don't like.  I swear this is almost a glossy version of Go Fish.  I also dislike the scoring system, where the big points are made early, so it's difficult to catch up.  Even Tiger Woods doesn't win every tournament.

One of Knizia's older games and one that I've always found somewhat disappointing. A pretty tame game of set making, where the luck of the draw trumps clever play. Traded my copy away.

I have to raise my rating on Res Publica simply because it has been so, so popular with so many people I've introduced it to!  The peculiar constraints on trading make it work like no other game we know, and the playing time of 30  minutes keeps it from wearing out its welcome. Res Publica turned out to be my single most played game of 2004.  I've got (and greatly prefer the artwork of) the Queen "butterbox" edition, by the way.

[thing=277][/thing] is a light game of negotiation. The whole game is basically this: negotiation, but made in a way that you don't really negotiate - either you accept something offered, or you don't. The game goes like this: in his turn the player can offer something (like, 1 saxon and/or 2 vikings - you can offer up to two different things) or ask for something ("I want 2 huns or 1 shipbuilding"). Then, in clockwise order, the players, one at a time, will either try to make a deal, or pass. If the players tries to strike a deal, he must act in the same way: either offering something or asking for something. So a round can go like this:

- Player 1: "I want 1 Viking or 1 Goth and 1 Saxon."
- Player 2: "I give you 1 Goth and 1 Saxon, but I want 2 Huns for them."
- Player 1: "No."
- Player 3: "I give you 1 Viking, and I want 1 Book for it."
- Player 1: "No."
- Player 4: "I pass."
- Player 1 - turn ends, draw cards and pass the turn to the next player.

As you can see, some of these "negotiations" could be made if the game allowed for bargains, talks, haggle and other things. For instance, Player 1 do not have the 2 Huns that Player 2 wanted, but he had 1 Architecture that Player 2 really wanted, and, therefore, they could make a deal.

However, Knizia made [thing=277][/thing] to work in a smart way: the negotiations, as they are, allow for the game be all about them, without making the game last way too long, something that is rather usual for negotiations game, since these can take a whole lot of time when the players discuss in order to reach a common ground that both will be happy with - and this is because everyone at the table knows it is a competitive game, so the players knows that something that is good for the other player, can be BETTER for him than for you. So the negotiations tend to go in the direction of "I must get more than you, so if you want X I will give you Y, because I think Y will help you less than X and than Z will help me" - and this can take a good while. And, this goes even further, because no one can rise the offer made by someone else - if player 1 offered (or wants) something and you, as the current player, passed on his deal, you won't be able to return to him after the offers of the others went nowhere. Therefore you must evaluate if the offer is fair/good/the best you will have, or risk with the next, then the next; and, many times, you can end your turn, without any deal whatsoever, because you passed on a deal early on, that was good, but you wanted [u]better[/u]. Oh, well.

Not in [thing=277][/thing] - you either give exactly what the player asked for, or you want exactly of the player offered, or you will have to pass. No side deal, no double offer, no "wait, if he wants to give you 1 Saxon, I will give you 2, only for you NOT trade with him!", or anything like this (the butter and bread of [thing=11][/thing], for instance).

Either way, if you made a deal or don't, you will end your turn buying the cards you are allowed (always 1 of the pleople cards, and as many technology cards as you have colonies) and then the turn will pass to the next player. Play will go like this until all the city cards ended or until the deck of the technology cards is depleted (then there will be just one more round).

There are a few types of cards in [thing=277][/thing], but they all serve the same purpose: to build things. You want 5 people cards of the same type, in order to build a colony (each colony will allow you to buy 1 technology card in the end of your turn, and are worth 3 points). With 5 technology cards of the same type, you can build a city, which are worth more points the sooner you build them: 9, 8, 8, 7, 7, 6, 6, 5, 5, 4. With two Book cards you can build a Library (which allows you to build colonies and cities with only 4 cards of the same type - basically is the most OP thing you can build in the game, by far). With two Priest cards you can build a Monastery, which is worth 7 points. And that is it. All the deals you will be trying to make is aimed to get enough cards of the same type in order to build these things. The player with the most points will be the winner!

I really liked the way the negotiations work in [thing=277][/thing], but it is important to say that the game relies in the players to work. If a player appears to be ahead, it can surely be left out in the cold, with no one wanting to trade with him. Also, several times the player will propose something that everyone else will pass, and, because of the cards he took, next turn he will have to try to offer the same deal. But, these are situational things, and the game is made in a way to lessen the effect of them: the not-trading aspect is treated in the most simply of the ways: there are just oh so few cards of each type - just 12 cards of each. So, if you have 3 vikings in your hand, a group of 5 vikings were already used in a colony, this means that there are only 4 vikings left - and you still need 2 to make a colony. So, if the "leader" offers you a viking, you can pass on him, but you will also risking your position as well (he may have 2 vikings, or even 3, making your colony, if you don't have a Library, and there are only 2 that can possible be build in the whole game, impossible to be build, so you will have 3 vikings that aren't worth a damn thing to anyone else, except "leader" and you. So you will probably be better, in an overall way, by trading with him than not). Against the other possibility, well, this all depends on the player: maybe it is time to add something to sweeten the trade, or simply give up and go for another type of cards.

Well, [thing=277][/thing] worked really well for us, beign heavier than [thing=140][/thing], basically in the same league of [thing=11][/thing] (in weight and amount of trading opportunities - though, as I said, it doesn't push for trading as much, so actual trade can happen less often), but is lasts way less (my plays of of [thing=11][/thing] last around 90 minutes, and [thing=277][/thing] stays well into 45 minutes), also it is easier to manage, since many players of [thing=11][/thing] struggle with the "immovable" card in the hands (and the how often mistakes or simply cheating can occour).

So, it is better than [thing=11][/thing]? No. I like [thing=11][/thing] more, if, for nothing else, because I played more, so my experiences affect my rate and view of the game, but also for the reason the forced trade (when if you keep a card you will have to sow a field you don't want to) makes more deals to happen, also because I see more strategy in [thing=11][/thing], since you can see what players are vying for, then you know what not to pursue (you can estimate, in [thing=277][/thing], what cards the other players have due to what they are offering and asking for, but it is harder to have a clear picture).

Also, from what I can see, [thing=277][/thing] has a little more luck into it, because players won't, usually, trade Books or Monks (it can happen later on the game, when technology cards are more available, but in the first half of the game, or more, it will be harder to happen), so a player that have the luck to take from the deck a second Monk or Book will give one important step in front of the others. Sure, almost the same can be said for having a field with one Red Bean and one or two showing up in the two cards you reveal - but this has more in common with taking two of the same technology card, which is good, but doesn't unbalance the game as much (since, by trading, the others can reach the same amount, just like players planting Stink Beans can reach the same amount of points as a field of Red Beans).

Finally, another problem (somewhat connected to the luck aspect above) that can happen is that, in the final rounds, trading can almost die off, because you might don't want to trade anything that won't give you the necessary to complete set, allowing you to build a city, holding on the trade by the chance that the other will complete a set and you will still require one or more cards, and you know you will have to have the luck to have exactly what someone else wants and that this person also have what you want, you won't even have a chance to complete your set until it is your turn again. I add that this is a "worst case scenario" since I have see this occur (the refuse outright to trade) only in the very last round.

Anyway, even with this not perfect aspects, I enjoyed the game enough to purchase a copy for myself after playing - as I can see many opportunities to play a game that is easy to explain and learn (how the trade works can take a few turns to grasp, but once you "get it" you are good to go), plays almost in the time of a filler, while also allowing for some interesting decisions and lots of interaction between players.

As much as I like the structured bidding of the game (no, it is not "Go Fish"), the real downside of this game is the runaway leader effect of the game.  If you start out ahead, you get more cards.  If you have more cards, you have a better chance of scoring (and getting even more cards).  If someone could put the bidding system of this game into a more refined game, it would be a huge winner with me.

To be honest, I don't enjoy negotiation games very much, mostly because I think they bring out the worst in people.  It is a given that nobody likes to lose, and in titles that employ such mechanic you openly try to improve your position by screwing the others in trade.  In order to do well, you also have to advertise yourself and/or your offers to be better than someone else, a lot of times it involve sabotaging your competition, even if it has nothing to do with the current game in progress (i.e. that person always win or backstabbed you during a previous session).

With that said, I did found Res Publica's method for negotiation unique and a breath of fresh air.  Since communication was limited to following the active player's example in wanting or needing something, what you choose to reveal becomes important.  In fact, I think it's down right funny in some cases, especially when someone is stuck on looking for or getting rid of a specific card.

Unfortunately, the set collection is very uninspiried and the game played way too long, which in the end only made it a mediocre experience that I don't care to go through again any time soon.

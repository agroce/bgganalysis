Clever combination of something like Battle Line and to some extent Blue Moon and Blue Moon City. Basically you're competing to place influence markers in various columns, so instead of the quick flag claims of Battle Line, the columns are scored and evaluated gradually. Each player receives an identical deck of minions to play on their side of the locations (flags- columns) with values on them, and depending where you play them, they may trigger special actions. Continuing my Battle Line analogy, its as if the tactics cards and troop cards were combined and instead of having communal draw pile each player receives their own deck. There are some other special rules, mechanics, but at its heart you're trying to gain more influence on your side of the columns before the evaluation markers- if you have more influence in a column during evaluation, you get to place one marker into the location. At the end of the game those locations as well as a few other resources score and that determines your winner. 

I quite liked my first couple plays of this. There are some clever tactics involved with the card play and hand management and the game keeps you enganged as the majorites seemed very slim. (it seems like a tight game) I think I'll be able to find a spot on my shelf for this one, maybe even trying to get ahold of the nicer editions with expansions someday) and it will share playing time with games like Pixel Tactics, Innovation, Battle Line... a sort of catagory of games I can't seem to get enough of.

Imo too much luck dependable. Too much depends on the cards you draw. Draw good, win big. Draw shitty, loose big. I can't really seem to control the game. Could be I'm missing something, but I'm not able to enjoy it as much as I do Omen yet. 

Might change,...

2011. 2p card game. area ctrl, hand mgt, interaction, planning, brain-burner.

Others say: similar to Schotten-Totten / Omen: A Reign of War / Blood Bowl: Team Manager -- players compete over 4 battlefield cards.  Lots of options & tough decisions.  Both decks are identical and card strength is poorly located such that it's blocked when cards are stacked.
Luck of the draw is significant, strong second-player(-in-each-round) advantage. Strategy = timing the endgame trigger to fall when you have the advantage, and this feels anti-climactic compared to the fun and tension of the preceding struggle.

Nice game with some good back and forth, however you are at the mercy of the draw and it gets another hit for being a two-player only game which hardly get played in my group.

After 2 plays...excellent little game.  Good decisions balanced with some luck make it an excellent 2-player game. Even though the basic engine could be seen as similar to other games, the play is different enough to warrant much replay.

It's OK, but I've got it up for trade. In the 'dueling card game' genre, there are so many titles, and other than artwork, this one hearkens back to the heyday of the Kosmos 2-player series, circa 2001 or so. It's just a bit dated in its design, and doesn't bring much special to the table. I don't see this being selected over Lost Cities, Dragonheart, Settlers Card Game, etc.

Another great Small Box Game creation. John Clowdus seems to prefer a design style with simple core rules that lead to lots of decisions with distinct tradeoffs. Hemloch's core is simple enough to pull in light gamers, but the decisions are meaty enough to engage heavier gamers as well. There's a lot going on in this game -- with a lot of tradeoffs and multiple paths to victory with 5 possible game-end conditions. I'm going to keep digging into this one, because every time I play it I learn something new about the strategy and tactics at work.

Nice fast card game with a lot more depth than at first appears. Simple enough mechanics (two actions per turn:either play a card or take a card; play cards for influence in one of 4 zones, whomever has the most influence gets to place a token on the zone), but with some twists (flip a card at the start of each turn, which locks one of the zones, if it's a day card, score influence) and some nifty powers on the cards. With each player having his own deck and both decks being identical, it's more a question of knowing how/when to best play a card/character than being lucky.
Recommended, will hit the table when i've got 30 minutes and a hankering for some card strategy.

This game is pretty fast and I think the graphic design is amazing.  How fast?  Probably about 1/2 the time it takes to play Race for the Galaxy, maybe a little longer.  Each player has a identical 30 card deck which has about 13 unique minions belonging to one of 5 factions in set quantities.  4/5 factions are associated with 2 different locations each... one faction association provides a triggered ability (beyond the cards own ability) when a matching minion is played at the location and the other association gives a played matching minion card a bonus influence at the other location.  Card abilities may dictate that it shouldn't go to either of the locations it's associated with.  At regular intervals you'll compare influence values at locations to place cubes on that location which will earn the player VP at the end of the game.  There are also ways to collect special items: Tinkets & Potions.  They are the second source of VP.  In addition you can reduce the VP these items are worth to use a 'sort-of' one time special ability.  The game can end in a variety of ways which are in control of the players  (having to do with player cubes, locations, players decks, availability of items, etc.).  It kind of reminds me of a cross between Battle Line and Gosu.  I don't know how much I like this but I do like it.  I need to play it more, but I can say that this packs a surprising number of decisions for a game so short.

RATING: 7
The theme really comes out in this game because of the festival and shifting the rounds from night to day.  When to score is a little confusing for new players.  Since each unit in the deck has a unique ability, new players are at a strategic disadvantage to learn the cards.

Excellent game for 2 (experienced) players, but requires patience when learning.

Very much a Clowdus game, which is a positive for me!  Hemloch is fairly simple, and teaches fast, but still has some tactical depth.  Because of the relatively low hand-count and limited card draw, Hemloch is more of a tactical game than a strategic one.  It's still a lot of fun though, and I foresee a lot of play in the future!

Those already familiar with the designs of John Clowdus will find a number of recognizable elements here. The game's multipurpose cards are put to use in a clever area control design, the storyline is interesting and the art work brings the sinister vibe of the theme to life. Still, it’s missing the clean and easy gameplay that characterizes his best titles. Hemloch feels like too many ideas shoehorned into one game. The patchy rule book amplifies the clunky pace of play. SBG has since published three other titles placed in the Hemloch universe. Completists will want all four. Those who are just looking for a cool Clowdus design can skip the first three entries and go straight to Dark Promenade.

I just received Hemlock in the mail yesterday and had a chance to play it for the first time today. I have to say, this game is extremely fun! Now, I don't have much experience playing non-traditional board/card games. I'm just starting to become a BGG. That being said, I really don't have anything to compare this game to. So from the perspective of this N00b, I say this game is awesome. The strategy in the game has multiple layers, from the order in which you play your cards, to how you choose to use each card, all the way to how you position your influence pieces on the 4 game locations. In the end-game, all those decisions will have an impact on whether you win or lose.

Great art, fun game play with interesting decisions, only thing I didn't care for was the day cards which immediately lock out a zone so you can't add anymore cards to compete there, then the zone gets scored. It seems to add a bit of randomness as whoever has that spot one when the card is pulled automatically wins it with no competition. Overall a fun 2 player game though that I am glad to own.

Cool hand-management area-control area-influence 2-player game set in a bizarre dark town called Hemloch. Hemloch is not for timid, keep-to-themselves gamers. Many subtle strategies and tactics to play with here. Good feel to the gameplay. I think it is fun; my gamer wife thinks it is too abstract for her tastes (as she's super picky about any abstracts for her to like them).

I have not played the draft variant, yet. However, I suspect once I do, I'll never go back.

I have not played the reprint, thus I cannot comment on any similarities.

Hemloch scratches my itch to play 2008 Campaign Manager. (Now there's a bizarre statement only a gamer might say.)

RATING: 6
Game is competent as a Battle Line/Blood Bowl Team Manager type game, but Blood Bowl is more fun, prettier, and more easily expandable. Not that this game isn't without its merits: the card play is fun and there is a layer of strategy to it, it's just unfortunate that if you begin your turn with zero cards you get to draw one for free so it rewards you for just playing out and topdecking every turn by giving you more actions for free. I think without that rule it'd be more strategic as people managed their hands waiting for a surgical strike. Hmm... I'm thinking house rules await.

This is a pretty unremarkable 2 player game that while quick playing seems like a less refined version of Battle Line.

RATING: 7
Interesting little card game in the Schotten-Totten/Omen/Blood Bowl: Team Manager vein -- four individual battlefield-cards which players compete over. Having the most influence in a location during an influence check allows you to place a marker (a fun little spatial element since there are bonus points for adjacent markers). Of course there is much more to it than that: different units are stronger in different locations and trigger special effects in others; players also score by collecting potions and trinkets (which can be used, at a cost of points, for bonuses!). Justin Hernandez's art is fantastic.

I like it a lot: you always have a lot of options and decisions are rarely easy.

On the other hand, it's sad (though understandable) that both factions are identical in artwork as well as function. It's also ridiculous that each card's influence number is situated low in the design such that that placing new cards at a location in the natural way will obscure the strength of the previous one -- an embarrassing rookie mistake for a designer as experienced as John Clowdus. 

More seriously, luck of the draw is significant, and there is a very strong second-player(-in-each-round) advantage. Much of the strategy seems to be in timing the endgame trigger to fall when you have that advantage and can be sure of being up in points. Maybe with more experience that's something I'll grow to like, but for now I don't find it entirely satisfying -- games tend to end in a whimpering anti-climax compared to the fun and tension of the preceding struggle.

Hemloch is another game in a long line of two-player head-to-head influence games, like Lost Cities, Battle Line, and Blue Moon (and even some non-Knizia games; did the guy invent this genre or something?).  It also plays around with aspirations to be a CCG, but the combos don't come from playing cards together, since the combinations come from cards played to certain locations.  The locations are fixed from game to game, so it's not like players can toy around with the cards in the game to find the best combos; they're pretty obvious each game.  It makes me wonder if the game will have a lot of replayability over the long run.

That being said, the game divides incentives well, as cards can be played to a location either to bolster support for majority there, or to a different location to activate a special action associated with that card-location combination.  It creates a nice tension, but I get the feeling that the game comes largely down to the luck of the draw, as opposed to clever card play.  I'm still interested in playing it more just to experiment with the game, but I don't see it replacing Schotten Totten any time soon.

Twilight has loomed for decades. Rumors of the coming sun run across the city's dark alleys and corrupted courtyards. Impromptu festivals catch like wildfire as the denizens of the dark city usher in the season of the sun. You have precious few nights of perpetual moonlight remaining to tighten your grip on the city's great districts before the moon sets – and once the sun rises, all of your deeds will come to light, and a new age will dawn on Hemloch.
\13\\13\
In Hemloch, each player has access to his own deck of minions belonging to five different factions: The Courtesans, The Darkened, The Ghouls, The Alchemists, and The Geared. Each turn, players place these minions into one of four locations in the city. Minions grant the players special abilities on their own, but playing Minions of certain factions into certain cities grants the player additional abilities.
\13\\13\
Players score points by acquiring Potions and Trinkets (which may also be used for additional abilities at the cost of points) and by placing Influence markers in the various Locations.

RATING: 5
To put it very broadly, this is sort of a draw a card/play a card style game. There isn't a tremendous amount of planning involved, but the play area is filled with effect triggers based on where certain cards are played, so the end result is a game that plays like something much bigger.

Card play doesn't feel quite as complex as Omen, but the added dimensions of the randomized scoring rounds and the layered area majorities still keep this in the realm of a gamer's game. It's worth a look if you have enjoyed any of John Clowdus's previous efforts.

I love Omen, but I did not find the card play for Hemloch nearly as interesting.

2p card game, the first post-Omen SmallBox offering, I believe.

Play cards to four locations, resolve card and location abilities.  Periodically perform an area control scoring.  There's a minor but neat spatial component to each of the locations too.  There's also a secondary SmallBox scoring mechanism where you can use acquired point cards for bonus effects but then you lose points.

Gorgeous GORGEOUS witchy/Halloweenish art.  Good game.

the first time I was kinda so-so with it, but then I realized we were playing it wrong, now I love it!

Much lighter than omen.  Actually I convinced my wife to play with me over a bottle of wine, and she said she loves it too, thanks again John, you rock!

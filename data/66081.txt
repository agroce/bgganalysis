GAME: Pocket Battles: Elves vs. Orcs
RANK: 2275
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
3/30/13 - First play - Solo as Elves Vs. Orcs. Didn't play the rules correctly so along with some horrible rolls led to a crushing Orc defeat. Really need to play again the right way. From what I saw it is a good little game. Went by quickly. Lot of rules and special properties to remember. Need more plays before I can give it a final score.

I don't think this can be played solo and reach its full potential. I really need to play it Vs. to see if it's a keeper.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fast and easy.  It seemed a bit unbalanced in favor or the orcs, but I only played it once.  The mechanics are solid and the possibility for expansion is exciting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Orcs mirror the Romans in the fact that they are a good starter army and easy to use.  Mostly focused on the charge into battle.  Builds upon the game mechanically but flavorful enough to differentiate it from the Romans.

Elves mirror the Celts.  Again Mobile, fast, and tricksy.  Again builds upon the game mechanically but flavorful enough to differentiate it from the Celts.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
The simplest form of fantasy warfare. Lining up facing each other with flanks but no flanking rules.

It's blade against blade or dice against dice.

The special powers are meant as a modifier or additional dice to reflect battlefield changes and advantages.

No terrain, no ambush. Just pure muscles against muscles. Multiple types of units, but overall, feels almost similar. It's only some initial or engagement bonus here and there that gives you a feel of what that unit can do. In fact, after a few games, what the name and title of unit becomes not important. It's just the icons and what numbered die is on the unit.

It's a good battle by itself, ends in round 2-3 for a 80 pointer. May reach round 4 for a 100 pointer game. Done in 45mins.

Having said that, it becomes low on replayability and felt the overall battle is not fully felt and enjoyed as an fantasy battle game.

Good lunch time game session. Small, compact, simple. 

Not for the heavy Wargamers.

Elves vs Orcs was something of a surprise.  I was expecting a simple line-em-up and slug it out affair.  Well, it is that but there's also a bit more.  Drafting your force is mechanically simple, but particularly for the elves, there is a trade-off between including a host of high powered though brittle characters and fielding enough bodies to absorb losses.  How the powers of individual troops combine is a further consideration in both drafting and placement. Double sided counters featuring orders and wounds model in a rough and ready way reduced capacity to fight when your troops have suffered losses. It generates some tricky decisions around tying up order/wounds or eliminating troops to put your opponent nearer to victory. The action plays out quickly and I've had some satisfyingly nail-biting end games, with both sides needing to inflict just a few more losses for the win.

Like everything else, the artwork is simple, but quite appealing.  Production quality is decent, although I wish the order/wound counters had been a little thicker.

Awesome game system! [u]Fast[/u] and easy, with asymmetrical armies and a high number of possible combinations and available battle tactics. Half of the game is drafting the tiles for your army and then positioning them for the battle. The second half of the game is the battle.

I enjoyed the first 2 games. There is much to think about with the deployment, who to order first, the trade-off between orders & wounds and where to focus the attack or defence. The two armies have very distinct personalities. The Elves with their Queen, Reactive Hero, Fast units and Skirmishing Mounted Archers get a lot more flexibility in command and their bow-fire is scary. So too is the sheer thumping-power of the Orc units. This is a great little game that packs an absorbing battle-game into a little box.

RATING: 7
The small box contains 60 fine tiles depicting Elves and Orcs. The rules are clear for setting up a fast mini-wargame between these two rivals. The game needs some thinking for placing the right troops in the proper zone and some planning for issuing orders to the correct units. A variety of possibilities give each player an unlimited table of tactics to eliminate their foe. Lady Luck has her saying on each conflict as well. A good way to introduce others to the hobby of wargaming and kill some time.      

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
So, the rules are wordier than they should be. That kept the game from the table because I thought there was more to the game. Once I got it to the table though I realized that there isn't much. There's decisions here or there and preparing your army by making decisions on what odds you want your unit to have when they attack/defend is amusing. It is a good and quick time waster and I don't feel like there's massive armies heading towards collision on a field of battle. But it does feel a bit like battle, picking ideal/exposed targets, calling up reinforcements and trying to out play your opponent. Bottom line though it is a fun game and enjoyable.

This game isn't for everyone. I personally like it because I can play it with my son (who is 8) and it doesn't last long. I like the art and the game is pretty straightforward. That being said, if you like intricate war games with detailed rules, this game isn't for you. I own all 4 pocket battles and I found this one the least balanced (orcs seem way more powerful) but I still enjoyed it.

Surprised and impressed by this so far. Despite the dice-can-ruin-any-strategy factor, the variety of available troops and their balanced stats make composing units and armies a ton of fun. The rules are simple, but fit the scope of the game extremely well. The troop-tiles are excellent. My kid loves it - asks me to play often and asks me to get the other PB sets.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (March 2013)

After one play, I can say the game seems meatier than I initially thought, which is a good thing. I have only played this once and only with 50 points so it ended petty quickly. From my limited perspective, it seems the game is good although the Orcs won easily. I have to play again to properly comment on it. 

I prefer the fantasy setting than the historic one, but if this game turns to be good, I will buy all the other armies.

After a while without playing this AND most important without any desire to play this gain, I sold my copy of the game. I still think the game can have a lot of hidden depth, but I didn’t enjoyed my only play. Perhaps I’m not wargamer material if even a light wargame like this put me off. In theory the game is great, but it was a boring game in practice.  

It’s sad that this game got stolen the day I was going to play it so I bought another one and it didn’t clicked on for me. Double loss :(.

I’m downgrading art rating based only on my desire to play the game, it is entirely possible that the rating can improve with another play. 

I will play it again if someone request it, but I already have many superior 2 player games so I see little reason to play Pocket Battles. Perhaps I will evolve into liking this game in many more years.

I love this series. These are not serious war games to be used for the better understanding of historic (or fantastical) tactics. They are light games, with TONS of replay ability since you can change the game size and how you build your army each game. I found that for each set I add to my collection my enjoyment of the overall series moves up exponentially. Also...... it fits in your pocket.

This has a similar feel to Command and Colors for me.  I like the quick setup and takedown.  Also, it seems very balanced, so no need to play twice as in most scenarios for C&C.  Lots of intersting tactical choices.

Pocket Battles is an ingenious little war game that accomplishes exactly what its designers intended: to provide a compact, aesthetically and strategically pleasing war game that can be played on a small table in one hour or less. 

It is filled with creative mechanical flourishes that only become apparent after several plays. The game's biggest flaw is its somewhat disjointed rules booklet. But with a well done cheat sheet on hand, players can jump into the action quickly and easily, and fight a massive battle in the time it takes to have a pizza delivered.

In short, Pocket Battles deserves a lot more attention than it gets. So give it yours, and prepare to be repaid with a heaping helping of fun.

I like this game quite a bit, but I really don't yet have a handle on how to play the Elves. They didn't lose as badly the second game, but they did lose. Working on it....

Considering how much game comes in a small package, I think this is a superb value. It fills a very elusive niche, that of a short wargame (filler length--long filler, sure) with deceptive depth. I tend not to like fillers in general, mainly because I'd rather just sit and have an interesting conversation rather than play a pointless game. But this is something you can sit and play in a half hour or so (with experienced players) and feel like there was something to it.

The portability of this game is a great feature that goes nicely with the low price tag. The tiles are as nice to look at as they are functional. At first the gameplay mechanics seem shallow, but with time and experience there is quite a bit that needs to be taken into account. Troop selection and unit composition become paramount in terms of strategy, I find it particularly fun to hide as many units as I can under Levies (I like the Persians). It has been said that the dice add too much randomness to the game, for some that may be true, but I am firmly in the "more exciting" camp. In my play group there is a longstanding feud between the Persians and the Orcs, so much so that people not involved look forward to the matches. I feel you cannot go wrong with this any in the PB set (although I will admit I do not own CvR... yet) and the price makes it almost a steal.

What wonderful little breath of fresh air this series is! I can easily see myself getting everything they put out (and not having to break the bank to do it!). And I knew nothing about the Pocket Battles series 3 weeks ago.

It's like a card battle game but with counters (which I prefer). It's a very accessible game system that still gives you a valid (if somewhat simplified) battle experience. The asymmetrical armies play very differently without a lot of special rules to accomplish this. It sets up & plays so quickly you can get in several games in a session, and you will want to. Grognards, however, need not apply. Unless you are willing to leave your range attenuation tables, etc., at the door and just have a little fun.

I prefer [b]Orcs vs. Elves[/b], but [b]Celts vs. Romans[/b] is definitely a better intro to the series, as well as being an excellent game in it's own right. Great Job!

Used to rate this higher as the design is quite clever. But after a dozen games or so, I'm convinced this set is quite unbalanced in favor of the orcs.... should try the Romans/Celts sometime.

a really solid war game that is fast to play but has real depth in both preparation and play.  Maybe a tad random with certain factions/builds but still very skill focused.

Nice 2-player-game in which you form your army fronts against each other. Very interesting idea to shuffle different folks and armies if you own more than one "Pocket Battles".

An extremely fast, light wargame. Rather random, but there is some strategy and tactics as well. Seems to play best with 70 points, so that you can cover both flanks and the center, but you can't take everything. I like the asymmetric sides. 

Orcs can make big, strong units that can smash anything on the charge, but they also have a decent smattering of ranged units. They must balance the need for strong melee units with the need for ranged, support, and screening units. Overwhelming is important for allowing orc units to kill more. 

Elves are harder to figure out. If you just use big units, orcs will consistently crush you. The elves need to make heavy use of screening units due to the relative fragility of elven units, intercepting charging units with individual spearmen. Elves have many ranged units, and they can make some decent, though vulnerable, melee units.

Es el segundo juego de la serie. Los ejércitos enfrentados son los Orcos y los Elfos. Las reglas son las mismas que las del primer juego de la serie y es totalmente compatible, pudiendo por tanto enfrentarse en combate Orcos contra Romanos (joder).

See my comments for Pocket Battles; Celts vs. Romans. I like this installment a little bit better, because of the variety in troops (especially the Orcs!). It does make use of some new special traits, however, so Celts vs Romans is more suitable as an introduction game (less icons to learn). Really clever how each army has its own distinct style. The Orcs, for example, are capable of inflicting more damage than any other army, but at the risk of destroying themselves in the process. Good fun.

This version of Pocket Battles is more complicated than the Celts vs. Romans, just in the types of troops and the special abilities. The elves can be tricky to play well, but it is rewarding when you win against a more brute-force army.

A lot deeper then the game first appears.  Lots of strategy here.  I imagine the game would be much more enjoyable after learning how it all works together and having many plays.  Good value

A war game that fits in the pocket!

When pressed for time and table space and the hankering for battle hits, this is the perfect remedy - and it is portable!
\13\\13\
Tiles represent troops and troops make up units in your army: just determine the size of the battle and create your own army from a pool of existing troops.
\13\\13\
Each tile hits on certain rolls, and some can only melee while others can shoot. Some tiles also have special traits which can affect their whole unit or their whole army.
\13\\13\
Armies fight in three sectors - the battlefield. The goal is to eliminate at least half the value of your opponent's army.
\13\\13\
Pocket Battles: Orcs vs Elves is the second game in the series of "Pocket Battles", after Pocket Battles: Celts vs. Romans.
\13\\13\
The series is designed to have each army fully compatible with any other, so it will be possible, for example, to fight with orcs against Romans, or to have a mixed army of elves and Celts.

As good as the first set. I'm convinced this series could be huge if it was supported a bit more. One set a year isn't much for a game of this size.

RATING: 9
A great game!  While the rules are poorly written in the rulebook, once you get it, the game is actually quite deep.  Just make sure you give the game a chance with higher point totals (80 is good).   This provides way more strategic deployment and tactical movement.  A 50 point game just doesn't allow for enough choice, and therefore lacks what makes this game a surprisingly deep game.

RANK: 104

RATING: 8.5
The first euro game I ever played and one of the first I played again upon my recent reintroduction to board gaming. Unlike most euros, planning won't win the game. Reprioritizing on the fly and knowing when to put all emphasis on a single element are skills more valuable than formulaic anticipation. It truly is the stock market- Texas Hold 'Em style. A beloved game that I rated low for reasons I don't understand. Upgraded from 7.1 to 8.5.

If you read some of my other comments, you'll realise that I like games that have mutiple paths to victory and this scores as high as any other game in that respect. I'm a bit down on pure eurogames - like this one - at the moment but this is an exception beccuase it has lots of options, very good player interaction and plays really quickly for a game with so many decision points. Highly recommended and the best eurogame for several years at the time it was published

First game impressions:

Feels like an old-school euro (read: El Grande, Ginkgopolis), not the new age stuff (AquaSphere or Fields of Arle) with little interaction and lots of chrome. Also feels like an old-school euro in that the theme is not only paste-on, but its counter productive. It's ultimately an abstract with a fairly simple ruleset that allows you to get in each others way. Downside is there is an efficiency of sorts in terms of building your player board that helps dictate regional play and hinders more emergent games (the game plays over 2 arcs; efficiency gains on the north/south regions, then pivot to city grabbing). Neat little tactical game, and does well if folks don't over think it. Not sure I'd buy it, but maybe; not many euros occupy this space.

Totally devoid of theme, drab artwork, convoluted ruleset, and yet this is a great game.  It scales from 2-5 players, it offers a myriad of possible strategies, and other than the introduction of bonus tiles, there is no luck.  I have almost no idea how to win this game, and yet I keep wanting to come back for more.  The goal of course is to score the most victory points and this can be accomplished in several ways: 1) bonus tiles, 2) placement of offices, 3) scoring of offices when trading routes are closed, 4) end scoring of controlled offices, 5) longest network of offices at the end of the game, 6) completed abilities, 7) network connection between the two end cities (forget their names), and 8) points scored from closing in the lefthand corner (forget the cityname).

The game also has several end conditions, the manipulation of these I think are one of the keys to winning the game: 1) 20 points scored during gameplay, 2) 10 completed cities, and 3) running out of bonus tiles.  On your turn, you have a choice between several different actions: 1) collect more cubes, needed for valuable placements, 2) move cubes on the board (a very important ability), 3) establish a trading route, 4) placing cubes/circles (traders or merchants),and 5) displacing traders or merchants (a confrontational aspect to the game).  

This is a very deep game and yet it feels easy and "light" to play, gameplay is relatively quick.  It doesn't look original, just the opposite, but in actuality it is quite a unique game.  Don't overlook this one like I almost did.

LIKE: Unique bumping mechanisms make this game, and create interesting interactions among players. Good use of an asymmetrical board, where one area is highly contested over (the increasing actions upgrade), then the rest of the board is built out from there.

DISLIKE: Very dry game, almost themeless. Difficult to find a strategy for first time beginners. The tiles add a luck component that can be quite powerful.

OVERALL: It's good, but difficult to get to the table.

RATING: 8.5
Solid game. It is comparable to Endeavor - and it probably is better for all that. Certainly the strategy is more convoluted and much more confrontational. Lots of take-that in this one. My only take away is there is seemingly a very important early game in the extra action section - and if one also controls the neighboring cities, that player is in for a leading scoring position. Makes the early game a bit too obvious and requires opponents to play against them. In any event, I really like this one. Subsequent games are making me like it even more. When you get a table of nearly equal experience, this game is very, very good indeed.

Kind of a classic euro.  I liked it and would play again, but it seems that certain portions of the board tend to get a lot more action than others.  I've only played one side of the board though, so maybe that would change?  Plenty to think about.

The more I play this game, the less and less I like it. Perhaps it's because I've been playing 5 player rather than 3 when I initially played. There just doesn't feel like enough time to do anything and the game is over before it really gets going. Also feel that the scoring circles aren't worth enough. Need extra circles/colours and to complete a 4 route to get the points.

配件很精簡、設置超快速，卻有豐富的得分路線。背景故事帶入感不強，規則不算太好解釋，大約需講解25分鐘。但遊玩起來相當過癮，4人局玩起來相當有張力，downtime很短，它沒有爆分或combo的爽感，但取而代之的是佔地收租金(分數)&卡別人位置來獲利的爽感，但也就是第二點讓遊戲針對性極強，玩家們相互站對方便宜或是搶走他人的城市，女性玩家不一定會喜歡。

Conceptually, I love the sound of this game, so I happily tried it in a 5 player game. I found that it really took me most of the game to figure out what I wanted to do, and what would earn me decent VP. It felt chaotic and the end game condition of running out of those bonus chits seemed so arbitrary that the game felt like it was cut short and abruptly. However, I still think I want to try the game again before I pass judgement on it because it did seemed nicely streamlined as a Euro with a tiny bit of area control, which I like.

RATING: 6.5
Reasonably amusing, but the map is much too large. It should have been constructed of tiles and expanded as the players needed more space, to keep people together and in active conflict. As it was, in my one play, we had only one town on the whole map with two competing cubes, and we each had a small stack of special action chips allowing us to swap the order of town control cubes - rendering it a pointless exercise to compete over.

I am fairly sure that this is partly due to us playing poorly, but with a tighter map we would have been forced into playing properly and we would have had a better time of it.

The game ended just as we were starting to accomplish things and get to a position where we could start to compete for territory. But, if it hadn't stopped there, probably there would have been a risk of experienced players being able to max out most of their upgrades.

So - decent game, but poorly balanced to create the best gaming experience. Unless you're all experienced players of Hansa Teutonica, the quality of play will degrade.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Many plays: This is about as perfect as euros get. There is SO much interaction, SO many different paths to victory, and every play will wiggle itself out differently. Yes, sitting to the left of a bad player will give you an advantage, but its not as severe as in something like Puerto Rico. But games with a high degree of interaction demand things of you. If you get blown out in a learning game, play it again. And again. And you'll see, that DAMN this game is fantastic. Even when I (always) lose I love it. Without question never leaving my collection, and lowering the rating of many games in my collection just because its so good.

Dry as hell. Yes.
Fun as hell? Absolutely.

This is a game you can punch and teach in about 5 minutes. Takes a few turns to see how it works. Moving cubes around is very unintuitive and it turns the area control on its head. Bumping is also not something you want to do unless you stand to benefit more than your opponent, and learning when this is takes experience. Unique game in many ways that feels incredibly old school, tightly tuned, and very far from the hottness. Couldn't stop thinking about it after my first play.

RATING: 8
2-5(5)

Preliminary rating:  This seems like the real deal.  I'm a mechanics geek and so I love the technology tracks and how they tangibly advance what you can do in the game (as opposed to just boosting you on some VP scale, or open up abilities that are, functionally, not going to affect the game dramatically).

The fact that so many points are scored at the end adds a good amount of mystery and tension to the game, and makes the initial 20 point VP track more a race than the game itself.  The way traders and merchants keep going to "stock" (the unusable pile) is a good dynamic.  The blocking is handled well, the tracks seem well balanced, the decisions about how to use merchants interesting.  And etc.  It played fast, and was short (unlike Loyang, good God), and was fun.

Obviously, the box, theme, and artwork are a bit bland (I think the board looks nice, but route-building in Old Germany???), and the play is still so far abstracted from the theme (could be a problem with the girlfriend), but when I enjoyed it this much, I don't mind.

Need to play with more because the interactions would just be that much greater.  Also, need to play with the 2p "pawn"; we've played without, as the province thing seemed to complicate things, though I can now understand why it's in the rules: to encourage blocking and the like.

An austere Euro whose Hanseatic trading theme is so thin it could as easily have been about the spread of viruses in the human body.

Happily, a good game lies underneath the paper thin theme and the uninspiring artwork.  At heart, the game is classic Euro fare: develop an engine that allows you to do more things more efficiently and keep that in balance with doing other things that score you victory points.  Where Hansa scores with me is by adding a hefty amount of player interaction.  This isn't just about beating opponents to actions they also wish to take, it's   exploiting their actions for your own advantage and making the things they need to do more costly.

The game also feels quite dynamic, with quick player turns in which pieces are placed, moved and taken off the board.  While I may be thwarted this turn, there's every possibility that by next turn my way will be clear.
A good game, with multiple strategic possibilities and yet somehow it doesn't excite me.

Production quality is decent.  The artwork is dull but functional.  The rules suffered somewhat in translation to English.

Ein Kleinod, welches ich relativ spät entdeckt habe. Ich finde hier passt fast alles. Okay, das Thema ist vielleicht ein wenig aufgesetzt. Hansa spielt sich schön flüssig und hat keinen überflüssigen Schnickschnack. Das man das Spielende selber auslöst, macht es sehr taktisch und man muss genau abwägen ob man lieber längerfristig oder kurzfristig plant. Ein sehr tolles Spiel, dass immer wieder auf den Tisch kommen kann.

Played Hansa Teutonica a few times and everybody thought there was a lot to it, enjoying the game.  My only real observation so far is that one player playing sub-par can really improve the position of another, creating an unfortunate power imbalance.  But such is the way these things go.  I quite like that I haven't figured this one out yet.

Well-designed route building area control game with tons of decisions, balancing gaining abilities with scoring points. The unique displacing mechanic adds good player interaction and really makes this game shine.

The more I play this one, the more I like it.  Upping my rating to a 9.  Tremendous player interaction, very interesting mechanics, and smooth game play.  Can be easily taught to non-gamers.  Experienced players can get through a game very quickly.  Can be a bit brutal at times but, hey, it's all in good fun.  Great game.

Build networks of your Traders to score points as a member of the Hanseatic League. Gorgeous board, but I'm a little partial to historical German-based themes, which many will say comes through weakly here...but whatever. Plenty of options to score, this game is all about placement, and with that alone it manages to stay interesting. Love the look of the player boards, not a lot of components or rules so this is actually a fairly solid gateway Euro due to its elegance.

This game is the ephemeral pop song around here.  The first day that I played this, I played it 4 times because nobody wanted to play anything else.  Time does seem to pass very quickly when playing.

I like the fact that there is a gradual learning curve which slowly unfolds as you get more experience with the game.  However I can't shake the feeling that the map is unbalanced in ways that will reveal themselves over time.  I think that the action track on the bottom as well as the city Stade on the top which allows building privileges can be locked up and allow people to run away with the game.  As a result of this you should play with others of approximately the same experience level or suffer from Puerto Rico syndrome.  

Blocking others is a mandatory part of the game, so if you have folks that run away this aspect of gaming, this is not for them.

Not going to recommend for 3, because like many games it is to easy for 2 players to focus on each other, and let the third person walk away with the game.  Likewise, one friend cobbled together pieces for a sixth player using the color black, and I think that the game is a little too tight with 6.  Plays best with 4-5.

It seems that I've been unfair to Hansa Teutonica in the past.  I thought it was a crappy, weak-themed, cube shuffling game.  In fact, it is a mediocre, weak-themed, cube shuffling game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Only played it three times, the rating will likely change with more plays...

The good: 
- Very low luck factor (other than other player's plays)
- Lots of approaches and avenues to victory
- Not too complicated and seems pretty easy to pickup (even if describing the came can seem overwhelming)
- While there is interaction and counter moves (in general) it's light on "fuck you over" moves. The choices are more about whether you want to take the penalty to mess with other players

The bad:
- Explanation can be lengthy and overwhelming
- Kinda hard to gauge how you're doing during the game (for some this is a good thing)
- I'm not entirely convinced it's balanced, extra actions seem much more powerful compared to the other abilities (especially early game).

More to come I'm sure!

RATING: 7
Hansa Teutonica basically has nothing like it. It's route connection... but it's not like a route connection game. It's worker placement... but no other worker placement game is like it. Heck, it's even an RPG!

This game has a quite open decision space, but it directs it - the skills and bonus chips allow you to easily read what moves are viable, and then it's a matter of figuring out how to value those options. Also, how cool is it that there's a game where a strong strategy is "get in everyone's way"?

RATING: 8.4
Playing this as a 2-player game sucks; the mechanism for where you can place is much too limiting. Plays very well with 4 or 5 though; a bit abstract, perhaps, but turns flow swiftly, which is a definite plus (very little downtime). Really a very elegant game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Only one play.  Nice game with simple mechanics, but an apparent variety of ways to score.  CAVEAT - gaining extra actions is such an obvious strategy that I can't see exactly how to counter it yet.  I appreciate that it is possible to fight for the ability, but I haven't got my head around the best way to do this.  Will have fun working it out!

Eredeti, elegáns euro. A szokásos "fejlesztek ezt, fejlesztek azt" mechanizmust feltuningolták a "kitúrás" akcióval, ami igencsak megkavarja a játékosok stratégiáját, és egy erős konfrontációt képez közöttük.

RATING: 9
The games go beyond simply route-building for VP in so many ways. It's a game with aggression... but one where you want to be the recipient of that aggression. It's a game with an engine-building aspect that creates interesting decisions but also a foundation for other players to "block" you. But most impressive, there seems to be numerous strategies to work from. Very good game.

[UPDATE] After playing this game 10 times, I'm moving my rating from a 7 to a 9. Why? Because this game is unique, interactive, and fluid. It's a game where every decision matters and one that develops quite differently depending on the players' actions. And furthermore the game creates a lot of depth/replayability for a light rulset. If there was any strong criticism against the game, it would be that novice/inexperience players can upset the balance of the game. But with a group of equally skilled players, the game is just marvelous to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I appreciate how Hansa Teutonica seems to have some depth, but comes with such few components (a main board, a few small player boards and bunch of cubes and few disks to round it out) and play quicker than you would think it would (the game I played was with two new people including me, and I think it).

Having said that, I got two problems with this game. First, the game is a route connection game combined with an engine building game. You build your engine by removing cubes from your board after completing routes in the corners of the map. So for the first half of the game, everybody was just hanging around those parts, just trying to complete or block somebody's completion of those route. Call me crazy, but I feel like a route building game should focus more on actually building the route

That feeds into my problem with the game. Engine building is already a pretty newbie unfriendly mechanic (you have to know the quickest way of building the engine), and allowing players to block other players from getting the engine upgrades just allows more experienced players to run with the game.

I don't know, these seems to be beginner's problems. I obviously don't have problem with engine building, abstract-ish euros. I even found the map was okay. While I'm not sure that I really like it, I'm not adverse at all to trying this game again.

My most played Essen '09 release (so far).  Nice design.  Moves quickly (unless playing with the AP group.  All but one game so far enjoyable.  The other one was,lets say a concern.  One player legitimately went all out to contain as many tokens as possible as quickly as possible, where possible placing the token between two of their towns.  As a consequence the game was over way too quickly - no one had developed further than level two of the other other attributes.  Will play further to see if this is just a blip, not a flaw.  If the latter, the fix would be additional tokens.

RATING: 8
This game is all about game mechanics, and it does a pretty good job at that. Lots of ways to score points, and to mess around with other players. Game play is extremely simple, add cubes to board, claim routes, move pieces around, displace other people's pieces, use bonus tokens. Solid design. Forget the theme here, this one is just mechanics. But it's a good game.
The rating isn't greater because there's no theme at all.

Abstract kind of route builder with a lot of choices. The board looks dull but the gameplay is always cut-throat because there is a lot of interaction between the players (placing dudes on a map and being kicked out and so on). I really like it but you need to know the value of the action track (don't make it easy for someone to gain more actions).
I look forward to playing it again...

Szuper! Többen azzal riogattak, hogy mennyire száraz játék. Nem tudom, ezt pontosan hogy kell érteni. Tény, hogy nem tematikus, hanem inkább egy absztaktabb, eurogémereknek való darab, de nekem nagy élményt nyújtott (talán mert én is az vagyok?). Az előrejelzések, és a szabálymagyarázat alapján valami ijesztőbbre számítottam, de ez egy kifejezetten könnyed, pörgős játék, csak meg kell szokni a világát, mert elég egyedi! Gyorsan sorra kerülünk (3 fős parti volt), és általában a jó és a még jobb közül lehet választani, nehézségét és ütemét tekintve a rondellásokhoz tudom hasonlítani (Hamburgum), csak itt még nagyobb a szabadság, mert nem köt minket a rondella. És azt hiszem ezzel el is érkeztem a játék lényegéhez: a néhány jól kitalált akció szinte végtelen lehetőséget kínál, és számtalan nyerő stratégia sejlett fel a két parti során. Kreatív emberek előnyben! A játék folyamatosan alkalmazkodást igényel a többiekhez, az is bizonytalan, hogy mikor fejeződik be a játék, szóval erősen taktikai játék! A segédlet jó, a játék teljesen nyelvfüggetlen (bár magyar szabály még nincs), és szerintem kifejezetten szép! Aki tud lelkesedni pusztán egy jól kitalált mechanizmusért, annak kötelező darab. 
Ami engem zavart, az a túl gyors befejezés, a 20 pont elérése elég váratlanul véget vethet a játéknak...
---
5-en is szuper!

Ketten sajnos nem olyan átütő, bár a plusz szabályok nélkül nem rossz úgy se, talán kicsit nagy a pálya. A plusz szabályok viszont eléggé megváltoztatják, megtörténhet, hogy végig csak a tábla egy szegletében zajlik a játék, és a fejlesztések nagy részéhez nem nyúlunk. Ez is érdekes, de teljesen más játék.

This is a pure Euro with a very original and clever mix of mechanics. At first the game seems overtly complicated, due to a sub-par rulebook. Then it seems as dry as Martini.

1 play. not sure if this will end up a 6 or 7.

good: many possible strategies

bad: 

1. the bonus chits seem quite important and yet you might never get a go at taking the good ones if they come out not right-before-your-turn

2. dry. DRY.

3. the strategies seem plentiful, but I see a possibility the only viable one is 'try to make others kick you out everywhere, get the advancements others have you have cheaply, and build a scoring strategy based on what you happened to get'. have to play more to see.

4. with 4+ players I am afraid the game will be over before any grander plan can be carried out.

RATING: 4
I disliked how fast it ended.  Most of the features were not used during my first session.  The actions that I took felt very repetitive and samey.  Perhaps I should have tried out some other actions or area(s) of the board.  However, the game encourages players to compete in the same areas, such as the extra actions area.    

Update: I played a 2nd session with a different group.  The end didn't trigger so fast this time around, so it was nice to see more development, such as more areas of the board in use, more tech upgrades, larger networks, bonus tiles. etc.  However, the actions still felt very repetitive and samey, which isn't good considering that I tried new approaches, different tech upgrades, different areas of the board, etc.

I find Hansa T really, really dry.  I also feel that there is a lack of control when playing with 4 players.  Probably my biggest issue with the game is the blocking of routes.  Although blocking provides player interaction and competition for choice locations, it just isn't very fun.  I hate having to decide between blocking Player A, Player B, or Player C.

Hansa Teutonica rises above the Euro haze as one of the pinnacles of modern Euro design.

Played as an efficiency optimization game, it wouldn't be worth bothering with, as just a slightly more variable version of Endeavor. But played as a cutthroat game of shifting incentives, with every move an offering or a coercion, the game is sublime.

There is almost literally no other traditional euro I would rather play. And that really just depends upon how broad your definition is of 'traditional euro'.

[i]Hansa Teutonica[/i] was the [i][thing=18602]Caylus[/thing][/i] of 2009.  What I mean by that analogy is that it received a ton of buzz.  The world was going to alter its orbit for [i]Hansa Teutonica[/i] as it had for other supreme buzz-generators.  My challenge is that I haven't been impressed with [i][thing=18602]Caylus[/thing][/i].  I know how to play, and I've enjoyed it on [url=http://www.brettspielwelt.de/Spiele/Caylus/]BrettspielWelt[/url], but my face-to-face games have been blasé.  How would another buzz-generator fare?  The answer is as nuanced as the game itself.

Components-wise, this game is a throwback to the Eurogames of yesteryear.  There are a few cardboard tokens, but for the most part there are a lot of wooden cubes and discs.  This isn't a bad thing at all, but the spartan nature of these components made me realize how I'd gotten away from games with wooden cubes over the past couple of years!

First Play: I'd read the rules for this on the way to Essen and decided that there was no game there and celined to buy. Then there was such a buzz I thought I should reread them again, still nothing. When a close friend said how good it was I decided to chip and buy it. Good job I did.

Hansa is a great example of needing to play a game to understand it. The mechanisms are simple but the strategies are incredibly deep. The possibilities to block and thwart are wonderful and the wide spread of point scoring oportunities keep the game open from start to finish. End game points were close suggesting this has been well play tested. 

Subsequent play confirms this has incredible depth. An immediate favourite.

Update: The game fell flat with Jen, so out the door it goes. Traded. 

This game played much faster with five than it did with three for me. I really like the conflict that exists with the players having the sames goals. Players have a wide variety of ways to strategize each time you play. It's one of those games you think about afterwords and think, next time, I'm going to give this a try. Always a sign of a good game.

Probably my favorite game right now. I really like all the different ways you can score. I think the last game I had this much fun exploring was Race for the Galaxy. It doesn't feel too heavy either, which is good for us. Turns go by pretty quickly so the game never feels like it's taking too long.

For us, it's a little meatier than something like Yspahan, but still plays quickly.

Not much there as far as the theme, but that's fine with us.

Excellent design incorporating elements from several other modern games. I like Scott Nicholson's idea of starting everyone off with three rather than two actions to avoid the inevitable scramble for the "Extra Action" bonus route (but where would the additional Trader go?

Worker placement Euro with a lot of depth.  I've played it about a half-dozen times and I'm STILL not sure of the best strategy.  (Well, other than "Get more actions!!!", but that's just Worker Placement 101.)  An interesting twist on the genre, you have to place workers in groups for them to do anything useful.  Definitely gets more fun once players start embracing "griefing" tactics that force opponents to either change plans or give you a cookie.

Be warned, the rulebook is ass; the game desperately needs player handouts with scoring summaries and descriptions of the hieroglyphics on the collectable tokens.

Not sure what to think of this game after one play. While it's another Euro without theme it does have some nice mechanics. There is a good amount of interaction between the players and the actions are varied enough to keep it interesting. But after the first play I had the feeling that the different roads to victory were not really balanced. (could be due to groupthink and one rule we overlooked) Also the game seemed to end before you could really invest in some of the higher scoring elements. Will have to play again to make my mind up. So for now a very tentative rating.

Have played again after several years. The doubts the first game left have not disappeared. This game just seems to let me go through the motions without soul or fun. Not interested in playing this anymore.

I find it dull and the missing theme bugs me in this game too (though it doesn't for some others).  I respect the design of the game, I just don't enjoy it that much.

My one play of this game made it clear to me that this is a very well-designed game that plays very very well. However, since I enjoy randomness and like gamaes that are more forgiving, this will not become a true favorite for me. But I certainly wouldn't mind playing it again. Some parts, like the upgrading of abilities I thought was really cool.

Edit: Well, well. Turns out I can change. After my first play several years ago I have now played it twice, and it´s been great both times. It is immensely dry, rather unforgiving, but also very rewarding. I really enjoy trying new strategies, and the feeling of wanting to upgrade everything buy having to focus. If this game was longer I would not like it as much, but even with new players it plays in under 2 hours, and that is perfect. A very well designed game.

I found this rather frustratingly reminiscent of El Grande in many ways, however beyond that it is a classic 'snowball' type game, where an early lead just gets bigger and bigger. The first two players seem to have a big advantage in getting the 3rd action quickly and it is hard to see past that. Only played once but I know want to be 1st player when I play again.

OK, as a game design, this is almost ridiculous.  A hundred different possible moves, five things you need to build in your engine, many ways to score victory points (and having to choose between scoring victory points and building your engine).  It is pretty much impossible to come up with a plan, there are far too many variables and choices to make.  Caveat AP-or.

After two plays I can see why hobbyists like the game, even if it isn't for me.  There are many options but experimentation will quickly whittle down the options to a handful.  It's pretty much a sandbox game in that the player is given freedom to explore, try out many many different alternative paths to victory.

I still propose that as a game design there are far, far too many things going on here.  The game is short and, dare I use the word, elegant, but it could use more focus.  There are whole chunks that (in my opinion) add YATTTA (Yet Another Thing To Think About) that the game doesn't really benefit from (and I wouldn't say are "fun").

For example, the special action tiles (shaped like plates of food), for me, are "a bridge too far".  I think the design would be improved with their complete omission, and when I play I have no choice but to ignore them, because I have too much other stuff to consider.  Of course, my opponents aren't ignoring them, then all my planning becomes moot because they can one-time break the rules and scupper my plans.  Ugh.  OK, blame me and not the game, if you must.

I like the idea of the game, and it all works together well.  I guess I'm looking for Hansa Teutonica 2, a game that has the same basic idea and mechanisms but a player can jump into their first game and enjoy and not feel overwhelmed.

RATING: 7
Only played with two.  With two, I found the game to be fun and a lot of different ways to go about it. I do think the Action track is huge (at least in two player) as that helps you get more down at once.  Maybe it's different with more people playing?  Well, I will find out.  I imagine this rating going up when I play it with more folk (or just play it more).

update: played with five and I think the action track is very huge, regardless of how many people.  This dropped the rating for me down to a six.

Who needs a good theme when you have mechanics like this? Love action point allowance, love upgrading, love multiple game ending conditions, love little wooden cubes. With all that emotion aside the thing that really makes this game is how you are wanting people to take your spot over. The player getting attacked ending more often then not in a better position then the attacker solves so many problems I have with many area control games. It keeps the player interaction but stops the gang up on the leader aspect as well as reduces the chaos. Every game I’ve played has been very different. Brilliant stuff.

After two plays, my group don't understand this game, I don't see nothing good in it, is boring, all time diong the same and getting nothing. Has richer gets richer mechanics everywhere... I don't want to spend more time trying to see the beauty of Hansa Teutonica.

RATING: 6
Underwhelmed.  A set collection and route-building game that could have been good.  It's too chaotic (and too easy to lose your positions in the cities) and the special action discs are just too powerful.  The fact that you can pick up a disc as well as claim something on the route that the disc is sitting on is a big deal.  Then add to this the fact that the disc is basically a free action that substantially breaks the rules and that you get bonus points at the end of the game for both USED and unused discs... jeez... this game should be called Discs of Hansa.  Perhaps there is something wrong with the English translation, the extreme power of the discs seems to break the game.  It just feels like you're spinning your wheels and eventually someone will win... probably by obtaining more discs or better discs than you.

Nice trading themed game based on the Hanseatic League. You have to choose what to unlock to give you a rotation of cubes/disks into your dead pile and stock (a la El Grande) and where to place cubes/disks into cities to secure ends of roads that gain you points when anyone fills them up. There's an additional bit of bonus tiles that need to be dealt with. In our game, we let one guy have too many of these between cities he controlled. He won easily!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice game, although I am not fully convinced of the sudden end when someone gets to 20 points.
I can imagine a lot of reasons for me to let another player reach 20 points even if it does not bring any advantage to me (I am tired, I don't like the game, I am the last one with no chance of winning...).
In my opinion this creates a big chance of kingmaking and might spoil the fun of other players.

RATING: 9
Although I play horribly in this game, it is one of my favorites!  Even though EVERYONE will be going for additional actions early in the game, you MUST get in that competition.  There is no way to keep up in board position without maintaining equal footing on the number of actions you are taking.  This game does seem to benefit the opponent of a displacement-happy player, but I think that is intentional and ensures that all players realize the benefit for being displaced.  I love the hard decision about taking a politician in a city for early game VP generation, or taking the action board advancement that helps your economy.  Wow, I knew this would be a great game and it definitely didn't disappoint -- even though my play is disappointing!  I wonder if the game would be slightly better if players didn't take ALL of their actions in one shot, but had to intermix those with other players?  Or, at least, if the player order didn't always have to go by table seating position?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The rules are daunting on the first read through, but correct play is very clear after a round or two and VERY FAST.

There are many alternate success strategies; best play seems highly dependent upon the actions of the other players. (I worry that after many plays, one or two major superior strategies may emerge, but we've had some fairly dynamic games so far, so I'm optimistic).

Lots of tiny pieces with no extras and insufficient bags for sorting are big downers here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
What a surprise! 

It's kind of an old game, with a dry cover and a board that is boring as hell... but the game itself is brilliant!

Intuitive gameplay, quick turns, a lot of different strategies... and the most intriguing part of it is the interaction between players. Your move will affect other players moves, you can play in "friendly" mode and you still have to look out for what your opponent is doing and sooner or later you'll have to do something, or in "jerk" mode... and that way is so much fun! This way, your focus is to block each others moves, the game takes longer, but the challenge is much more attractive.

I love the game. Theme wise is zero, but who cares when the gameplay is so interesting?! Another plus to the game. It doesn't matter the player number count, the game runs smoothly around 60min.

Check it out!

RATING: 9.5
I think it's the array of options and strategies that the game allows for that makes this game so great.  I've won using all kinds of different strategies, and I've lost to people using an array of different strategies.  Combine that with how well the game scales from 3-5 players (it's not bad as a two player, but not quite as good) and the fact that there is not really anything I'd consider a flaw and you have a sure fire winner.  We don't play it constantly, but when it comes out we play a lot of games close together.  That spells '9' material to me.

Bought strictly on reputation and hype - I should probably know better by now. FLGS group really raved about it claiming it was "different" from anything they'd seen recently, and it is getting heavy rotation. I'm always intrigued by something "different." A little concerned it may turn out to be another theme-less procedural like El Grande. Anyway, rating is a place-holder until I get to play it some.
++++++
First play - I think this may be a keeper in the middle-weight filler category (if the play time stays at around an hour). Turns out there is nothing radically new here -  a blending of El Grande and Web of Power; but, so far, a satisfying blend worth exploring some more. Rating improved, for now...

"Я гляжу ей вслед - ничего в ней нет, а я все гляжу - глаз не отвожу". Потрясающая игра. Дает гораздо больше, чем обещает. И из-за того, что не получается развиться полностью, хочется сразу же после окончании партии начинать новую, чтобы в этот раз все успеть. Вот так и бежишь, как ослик за морковкой, без малейшего шанса развить все навыки, но получая море удовольствия от попыток. 
При этом она достаточно быстрая, что плюс.

I'm sure many gamers will love this. I don't - dry as dust, abstract (I felt zero connection to the theme, I was just pushing cubes and discs around) and horribly repetitious. I was bored after about 15 minutes and ended up just taking cities to end it, and remarkably didn't come last.

I'm sure it is a quick euro - but it felt drawn out, you get lots of actions but they are so similar the game experience for me was dull. Furthermore getting actions seems the most obvious strategy and it's strong ... possibly with deep thought and analysis other options and strategies will be apparent but I really can't be bothered.

My taste in games is not this sort of thing, for area control I much prefer El-grande, for 'development I much prefer Diamonds Club.

Happily never play this again. Probably if I get forced to I'll drop the rating to a '2' ...

RATING: 8.5
Abstract connection/majority Euro, with pasted on theme and has nothing in common with the historic Hansa.
The art of the map tries to create some flair. But boy, way too much grey coloured. Especially white text on grey background is such dilettantish design that it´s hurt sometimes your eyes.
The used symbols aren`t that clear.

The game itself shines, as it is smooth, with less downtime but deep and satisfying game play. Lot of decisions and also quite high interactions, as the moves of the other players influences your play and can bring vp outside your turn.   
Has some Endeavor feeling.

Juego abstracto donde los haya. El tablero es una red de ciudades en las que los jugadores pueden ir estableciendo oficinas y rellenando rutas que conecten las ciudades entre sí. Cada jugador tiene un tablero propio que le permitirá mejorar ciertas acciones. Al final de la partida hay una puntuación por la ruta más larga, por el estado de tu tablero de acciones, etc. Es muy cerebral. Las reglas son sencillas y se juega rápido, pero tiene una profundidad bastante considerable. Interactivo a más no poder. Muy recomendable.

Lo compre en junio 2013 en juegame store, con el vale de las CLBSK13. Me salió por 8 euros :)

One play. A game that features familiar mechanics, in a different way. Feels like a mixture of Endeavor, China, and several other games that includes the general/personal supply. Not that this is a negative, they are familiar. Quite competitive, with much opportunity to dislodge other players' positions, with a lot of jostling for positions with players' cubes on trade routes between cities. A key feature is using these placements to one's advantage to slow your opponent and gain position when he tries to dislodge you. I feel this mechanic is somewhat of a negative in that a player can get a nice position when an opponent forces them off a road. Although this is a strategic placement by the player, it almost feels kingmaking when an opponent ignores the advantage he is giving to the player being moved. Scoring is somewhat involved, which increases the weight for the game.

This game seems to polarize players: they either love it or hate it. In my case, a lukewarm first impression (beginners are always a bit lost in the first play) has changed to the point where HT is now one of my favorite games in my collection (and possibly best of 2009). I love how each game is different based on the players' decisions. You can use a strategy to win one game, use the same strategy in a second game and fail miserably.
---------------------------------------------
(March 2011) I still consider HT a 9 with 4 or 5 experienced players. However, rating drops to an 8 for 3-player games, which I find less satisfying. The game also suffers when one of the players is a newbie or lets the player to his left get away with his moves (à la Puerto Rico).

This is the poster child of all that is wrong with euros.

It is dry, underwhelming, soulless, abstract, and completely detached of any theme. An uninspired cube pusher which is under the guise of "multiple paths to victory" because of different scoring options. Throw in drab, butt fugly art to boot.

And duh...isn't everyone going to go for extra actions at the beginning?

I really like the idea behind this game, and thought it was pretty fun.  You really do need to be careful about one player running away with more actions.   I liked the tradeoff between building your power through moving your pegs up and controlling the board.

The one complaint in our 3 player game was that it seemed that the incremental points you gain through ownership of adjacent towns really seemed to be a tiny drop in the bucket compared to the big points that are awarded later.   Perhaps that is a problem with the 3 player game though.  Would like to try 4.

Edit to add:  much different experience with 5 players.  Amazingly, there wasn't a whole lot of battles over territory, as there are still a ton of different things that can be achieved on a turn.   It seems to me like the board might be a little too open -- a little tighter board for 5 players would probably make for a better game.

Add Nov 2010:   After a few more plays it seems that there truly are a bunch of different paths to victory in this one.   There are certainly some effective ways to win, but these ways also have counters which stop a player from running away with a victory easily.

I actually enjoyed our first play of this, despite the absolutely hideous board and laughably bad cover art. This might be the ugliest game I own. (UPDATE: No, that honor now goes to Saint Petersburg)

Unfortunately my husband hated the game so much I doubt we'll play it again anytime soon. I think the design is interesting in that it gives you multiple strategies to go for and many ways to rack up points, but the incredibly repetitive gameplay does get boring and I had the nagging feeling that we were just waiting for the game to end.

Very dry. There appear to be several different strategies, but I'm worried that only a very few will prove to work. Though I liked it enough to want to find out.

Three game played and both entirely different also bodes well for the future.

Very good placement game with smart positive interaction. It´s quite abstract but it´s tense and dynamic.

RATING: 7
A well-designed game where it would seem there are multiple ways to pull out a victory due to the number of ways points can be scored.  A few clever things in this one... mainly the bonus you get for getting bumped, encouraging you to get in the way of other players.  It would be interesting to explore the options in this one.  

The main drawback is that it's pretty dry and missing a bit of a fun factor for me which might keep me from coming back often enough to really explore it fully, but exploring the strategy is intriguing enough that I hope to get it played more.

Updated 12/4/10.

What can I say about Hansa Teutonica that hasn't been said already, and better, by others?  It's a beautiful throwback game of cube movement and network building.  Although initially spartan-seeming, the game is quintessentially elegant.  The rules are easy to understand, but the depth is surprising.  There are so many possible approaches to the game (although new players tend to overvalue extra actions), that each game unfolds as its own story.  This is what multi-player chess would feel like if I remotely liked chess.

If there is a notable downside to the game, it's that new players can fail to recognize the significance of their actions and inadvertently and unwisely benefit a particular player.  Fortunately, the ramifications of new player mistakes are not tied to player seating order, so this is less of an issue than in, say, a hyper-competitive game of Puerto Rico.  

The other things keeping the game from a higher rating are trivial.  The game is very abstract, so I lack the enjoyment of thematic immersion that I find in most great games.  The fluidity of the game undermines a bit of tension for me: so many viable options exist that I don't feel the consequences of my mistakes weighing on me like I do in, say, Tigris & Euphrates.  Finally, the two-player rules are simply less engaging than with higher player counts. 

Still, a solid all-around game that I always enjoy playing and would recommend to nearly anyone interested in pure Eurogames.

Don't get repeled by the hideous box, this game is very good. I need to test it more, but it's very elegant, has very interesting and strong interaction, seems to have a lots of possible strategies, several path to victories, several end game condition, every thing I like!
Rate might go higher when I'll play it more

The epitome of the traditional Euro game: Dry theme, uninviting cover art, and drab board. But don't let it's appearance fool you, this is a rock-solid strategy game! Players must build trade routes between various cities to unlock bonuses and establish area control to gain victory points. I love games that incorporate technology trees so I really love being able to customize my engine but upgrading certain parts as they fit into my overall strategy. I also loved the choice of short-term versus long-term rewards when completing routes. The game definitely forces you to play a bit mean by preventing other players from completing routes but it's not enough to ruin plans and cause frustration. This is a prime example of why you shouldn't judge of book by its cover. Excellent game that I'm already looking forward to try again.

A very interesting game based on different actions you can take in order to advance different categories of the game and to score routes on the map. Enjoyed the first game and would be glad to play again but I'm not too sure it will hold the test of time. 1 Play.

Based on 1 play with 4 players:

Pretty impressed with this game, actually! It doesn't look like much but there's a lot to like. The rules are actually pretty simple (once you get past the obtuse rulebook) but there's a lot of different paths to pursue and just the right amount of fun group-think to guide your (re)actions.

Ontop of that the pacing is great. Turns move fast and there's some light opportunistic player interaction without resorting to just dull blocking or cruelty (which... I love mean games, but it's nice to have a variety!)

I think this could pretty easily be a great "next step" gateway game.

RATING: 9.5
This is one of my favorite games! You need to make a lot of tactical moves, but you kind of need a strategy too, and I like this mix. I like that there isn't any overpowered strategy and that you often need to do a little bit of everything in order to succeed, but you can also go heavy in one direction if you want. Sure, there is the extra action route which is pretty important to get early on, but I actually played a 3 player game in which I had 2 actions when the other players had 5... And I still didn't end up last. And I've played a lot of games where I've had 3 actions and another player had 5, and I still won. So this is something I really appreciate, as it's unlike many other games where more actions is crucial in order to win. 

There are lots of hard decisions to make, especially when you want to score a route and you have to decide if you want the bonus power or an office. I also really like how it's an aggressive interactive eurogame because you screw the other players over by placing cubes on their routes and they then need to displace you etc. - this is a huge part of the game, and even though you cannot block anything "for real" as in a normal worker placement game, it's still of huge importance to block the routes other people are building! The frequency and how aggressive the blocking is, varies from game to game; I played one 3p game in which it took almost 30 minutes for anybody to get his 3rd action - such a weird game.
Also, blocking happens of course even more in 5p games, but I actually don't love it at that player count, unlike many others. I really love it with 3p and 4p, but even 2p with my wife is AWESOME!

It usually takes less than an hour with 3p, and I've played games with my wife that took about 20-25 minutes if any of us rushed the ending. "Rushed the ending", you say? Yes, by choosing a strategy in which you build offices in either 1p value cities or between cities that are often claimed, meaning that you'll score points every time the route is claimed (and you can even try to get the 7 instant points by connecting the two red cities). By doing so, you can score a lot of points and reach 20p before the strategies of the other players start to take off; because the game ends instantly once any player has 20 points. But it's a risky strategy for sure, and longterm strategies, when the game ends either because the plate bonus disks run out of 10 cities are full, can often result in blowout wins; I've seen winning scores in the 20's and in the 90's, and this is awesome! In other games you always know that the winning score will be e.g. 40 points +/- 5 points, but in HT you can sort of manipulate how the game is going to end and which strategies will succeed. At least when you've played it 50+ times which I have - and I *still* learn something new in every game I play! In some games the "longest network" scoring can give you 30 points, in other 3. In some games you can get 3 disks in Coellen, in other games you get none. So. Many. Possibilities.

There is so many other things to touch upon as to why this game is awesome... Which abilities to develop, the fight for establishing offices, the fight for the bonus plates, the 5 different ways to score points (fully developed abilities, number of plates, Coellen table, controlled offices, longest route) is truly great, and you can really specify and concentrate on certain paths during the game, and none of them are overpowered. It's a wonderfully balanced game full of options right from the beginning, and no two games play out the same as you can pursue vastly different strategies each time. The player count also has an impact on how the game is played, and while many like it with 4-5, I prefer 2 and 3 (with higher player count, the first expansion map is really great, and with lower the second is pretty good as well, but overall I actually prefer the base map).

A truly excellent game! One of my alltime favorite games - luckily in both my own and my wife's top 5!

Some interesting mechanics and tough decisions each turn though increasing the number of actions available seems to be one of the more obvious ones that needs to be taken as early as possible. I was not impressed with the 'take that' tokens. It soured the game for the group I was playing with.

I have been wanting to play this for some time now, even with it's boring appearance. I finally got a chance and this game did not disappoint. There are so many tactical moves in this game that can go unnoticed, so very well done. After my first play I just wanted to play again and try some other strategies. Very deep game that looks rather simple at first glance and something I can see myself coming back to again because of its smooth and tactical gameplay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An excellent game, and definitely one that I am very pleased to own.  A "route" game with some great "screw you" possibilities, and definitely one that should hit the table regularly.  Easy to play and learn, but it will take a while to learn the strategies of play.

There is a seriously broken rule about the Librae Sophia - the rules state that you can, as ONE ACTION, move as many of your merchants/traders as your Librae Sophia number.  This is broken, broken, broken!  The LS number should represent the maximum number of "Move" actions you can take on your turn, not the number of dudes you can move for ONE ACTION.  It should take TWO ACTIONS to "move" TWO merchants/traders.  DO NOT PLAY the way the rules are written, as it is completely broken and ruins the ability of players to block each other on the roads.  This needs to be fixed and addressed!

Otherwise, an excellent game!

EDIT:  Bumped this rating to a 10.  I always want to play this game, and I never expect that to change.  Easily my favorite game of 2009.

EDIT:  Back down to a "8".  I have a lot of games to play, and I have recently changed many of my ratings to reflect this.  "10" is a tough nut to crack, and I think that I have too many games that I "always want to play".  So, due to lack of continually playing, I just don't see this as being a "10" for me any more.  But I do like the game, and probably won't turn it down if someone suggested a play.

Well outside of possibly El Grande, I can't think of a more stereotypical "cube pushing Euro game". What can I say - the game look boring, the theme is dull, and it has no flashy components. Yet, I love this game. This is a true example of brilliant game play making all the difference.

I've played this a few times now and every single time someone was convinced they found the one and only way to play, and ironically every single time that player lost. There are a lot of variations here and I'm still discovering new avenues of play. I've very much resisted reading the "some strategy tips" at the back of the manual since I think half the fun is developing these strategies for myself.

The downside is the theme does turn some people away, and it does take a few plays before someone can get used to it. When I get the right players together though, this game shines.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Initial rating an "8." OK, so the theme is pretty thin and the game has an abstract feel, but it's a challenge and it's engaging. Lots of options, but too few choices to take advantage of all of them. We'll be playing this a number of times in the near future, and I'm looking forward to getting to know this game better.

There's definitely something "old skool Euro" about this one, from the cubes to the artwork to the theme and game play.

2nd play, and I'm dropping this to a 7. I got crushed in this game, so I'm hoping this is not "sour grapes." Two things that struck me this time were the utter lack of a theme, and the fact that there's some strictly better choices in the opening. Everyone wants actions and the buildings adjacent to it, and I'm not sure how you win without grabbing at least a 3rd action early on. Once you get past that opening though, the game really starts to offer a wealth of choices. It's a good game, one I'll happily play for its mechanics, but I'll let others suggest it.

Update: Ugh. 3rd play, and I'm dropping this to a 5. I must be missing the "hansa" chromosome, as this game and I just aren't clicking. I've got the same criticisms as mentioned above... or maybe I'm just missing something. I'll probably end up playing this again because it's a favorite in my gaming circles, but the problem might be I'm playing against folks that play this monthly, while I'm playing this every 6 months or later and getting pummeled.

(5/20/10) Back-to-back plays in my first session, and I was initially rather excited about this one. Upon further thought about those plays and the game's potential, I am less enthusiastic but still very ready to give it considerably more opportunity. Do the very diverse ways of scoring mask a ultimately thin min-max problem? Does the game rise above a tactical tit-for-tat? Does it take the concept of 'balance' too far, to the point of rendering it an excerise in shaving a point here and there? Given the continued enthusiasm amongst people whose opionions I value, I figure my initial impressions will wear off...

Over the years, my interest level in true Euro designs has waned a bit. It takes something a bit special to grab my attention. I can't remember the last time a Euro design impressed me like this one. 

The game is very abstract (but who cares).  Its got nice production values and I like the board.

The decisions are fun and satisfying....yet a single turn is pretty short.  So the game moves along nicely.

Biggest negative is that there can be a turn-order issue if you follow a naive player. There is a bit of a Puerto Rico quality to the game, where you can tee up excellent opportunities for the person after you if you don't pay attention. I've seen more than one game go off-kilter from one person's questionable play. On the other hand, if you play with a full table of experienced players its pretty brutal and fun.

I flat out don't understand what all the fuss is about. HT is a game that I never would have tried if so many people hadn't been praising it as it looked like a dry, generic Euro to me. On playing it, the random first impression I had from watching it being played seems about spot on.

HT is a game that throws several Euro elements in a blender. You have limited actions, the court/provinces mechanic from El Grande, and the connections value from about 900 other Euro titles. You place cubes on the board during many of your actions, sometimes for direct benefit, sometimes just to block other people as they will then remove the cube which gives you even more resources to work with. There are a lot of subtleties that I won't go into here, but that is the basic concept of the game. You have special powers fueled by completing connections that other players can interfere with for their own benefit. Completing connections can either score points directly or improve powers like having the ability to place more pieces or scoring more for end-game networks.

Though I can see the room for strategic and tactical depth, I frankly don't understand the enthusiasm this has generated. I was playing this with one of the most fun, easy-going groups around, and I still found it dry as dirt and very mechanical. There is no spark or special twist here that makes me want to ask for this game again, nothing that makes it stand out. To me, it is the stereotypical Euro game, everything fits together tightly, but there doesn't seem to be any soul or hook to really differentiate it.

Hansa Teutonica has been on and off my new game radar as a faint blip ever since it appeared in 2009. I remember that reading through a brief German description on some Polish website (talk about language confusion...) left me with the impression of a complex game with some elements which usually ring a few warning bells with me. I put it on the to try-list as a ‘possible’, but regrettably could not find a free spot at the tables of Argentum Spieleverlag to give it a go. Fast forward a year, when Dutch publisher 999 Games announces this title in a Dutch edition and me trying it during a minor games fair.

Hansa Teutonica has a very interesting learning curve for first timers. First you see them struggle with all the rules, and about halfway through you see that the game's mechanic begins to ‘click’, and then they turn into a bunch of homicidal maniacs who show absolutely no mercy whatsoever to whomever is doing the explaining. I was no exception, by the way. And after the first game is completed they either love or hate it. The hate (dislike rather) originates from the game's very dry subject matter. It attempts to portray the hustle and bustle of various cities and towns in the Hanseatic League, but omits the usual elements of trade, making money and shipping goods. Instead the game is far more a logistical exercise where focus is on manipulating the properties of a (mathematical) graph, and this is what bothers the dislikers. If people like the game, they invariably report that despite the first rough half, they already see that there are quite a lot of ways to play this game, and that they will do better next time.

Usually I am not very fond of the growth mechanics employed by the author to drive the game, but Hansa Teutonica is an exception. The reason is that the actions are exceptionally clear and distinct, and come with obvious cause-effect relationships. Doing more actions is obviously good, as is enticing others to kick you out of trade routes (as you get more cubes on the board as a consequence). Getting more cubes in your supply is also good. The game therefore transforms into an ensemble where players are requested to become creative with a lot of small basic building blocks, and that is about the juiciest carrot you can dangle in front of my face in order to get me to play a game. I've played but two games to date, and give the game a conservative rating as a consequence, but if the feeling of short gameplay coupled with creative thinking persists, I can only envisage the rate going up.

[b]Update[/b] The rate is going to stay put, I'm afraid. The inevitable happened: players began to learn to work the action track, and this is such a strong track that all responses to it become scripted. You do not need all 5 actions to be competitive: I've ended up quite close to the winners using only 3 actions to realise this. But Hansa Teutonica always seems to end up in 'actions' and 'responses to actions' kind-of play, with a tug of war gouverning the timing of when the game ends. It's not that the game is bad: but it simply doesn't appear to work in a way I like things to work.

[b]Update 2[/b] That all said, once the game works as it should, it is like thermite and ice (see [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6cMmk8LZgQ]here[/url]), and certainly worthy of an 8. I'm a little conflicted here to award the game this rate, because it presupposes people who [i]really[/i] know what they are doing, and [i]really[/i] take the proper steps to reign in fast movers, or force feed them into lethargy (out of fear of ending the game before they acquire a sufficient number of points). And I don't really like the fact that a big part of the game is simply going to 3 actions, and then copperatively making it very expensive for everyone to get more: this aspect is really fairly scripted. Deviate from it at your own peril. Ack, what the hell, 8 it is. Good design, Andreas. Here's to hoping that new expansion makes the game worth playing at 2 too!

Update: After 5 games, upped it from 8 to 9. This is currently like crack for me! I am terrible at it (4 out of 5 games anded in a last place), but man, do I love this game. It plays fast, is very tactical and features multiple paths to victory.

Update: This is a 10-game for me. In fact, I consider this game to be my personal game of the year 2010.

Do not let the boring box cover dissuade you from buying
this "wunderbare" brain burner of a game. A true gamers game with lots of interesting mechanics thrown into an
euro-licious german stew. Confrontation is a necessity
and unavoidable since tech trees must be cultivated at
a stable rate to succeed. Truly admire games that make you think on your feet and react to changing situations.
After my first game I couldn`t stop thinking about the various paths to victory I could have chosen. Any game
that leaves this feeling in me is good in my book.

This is a game that is much more fun than it has a right to be.  The rules are complex, the theme is barely there, and it seems like it's just another Eurogame involving route building and resource management.  Except it's great!

The agony of choices is potent - a real challenge that might drive some people crazy, but is a trait I really love in a game.  Each choice is often predicated on selecting another action or route first - how far ahead can you plan?  And can you roll with the changes around you?  There is certainly no clear path to victory, and it's very hard to tell who's ahead until you count up points at the end.

My minor complaints are that the game is rather dry and with AP-prone players it drags on longer than it should.  But this won't stop me from bringing it to the table again soon.

(Small note - the Z-Man edition has a misprint in the rules when explaining bonus markers and what they do.)

This may be my new canonical example of a Eurogame: lots of little cubes, bland economic theme over a positional game of networks and graphs, a variety of approaches to scoring points. Doesn't mean I don't like it - quite the contrary - but oi, does it intimidate some players.

Most games that reward/encourage minor and arbitrary interference with other players's plans, I would call  frustrating. Somehow, HT instead simply turns this facet into a lesson: don't telegraph what you're doing unless you're prepared to displace a blocking player. Perhaps it's because the penalty for being blocked is relatively light - only 1/3 or 2/3 of an action even at starting payment tech - and doesn't impinge upon one's immediate tactical goals unless one's supply is riding the brink of being empty.

Nearly every game I've played - some short, some long - has been won by a player with either the most or second-most offices; the one exception was won by someone who put merchants on 3 of the 4 bonus-scoring opportunities. Playing around with tech is fun, but if you don't ultimately turn that into board position, those 4 points/track are not going to salvage your score.

Components: Very busy board and player mats. Too much clutter. And it's too difficult to quickly identify cubes that are in cities vs. on routes vs. in suburbs, and which routes the bonus tiles are on.

Experience: For some reason, I thought this game was going to be similar to Thurn & Taxis; but not so. This is a heavy game of pushing cubes around. And with lots of screwage. It's very easy to get all my cubes tied up on the board; it's very easy to get blocked on the juicy routes; it's very easy to be blocked out of the privileges. This game is brutal. Not fun for a first play, though my opponents say it gets better with time.

I really didn't like this.  A lot of chicken in the form of, "Who is going to stop X from winning?"  Many games have completely deterministic endings where people can decide whether or not to stop the player who's about to win.  But the way the end is triggered here makes it more subject to manipulation than most.  Especially with the "screw you" special actions available---deciding who to target with these felt highly arbitrary.

Yes, it has absolutely no theme, but I love it. The game makes you think in a way that's fun, not in a way that just leads to non-stop AP (analysis paralysis). There are so many paths to victory (and to the game's end) that it plays differently in different games (except the race for more actions in the early game).  And what do you know, it's a euro but has more-than-token player interaction!

Don't bother with the sub-par 2-player variant.

I worried that this game was scripted: fight to get more actions or lose.  That was how my first 7 games played out.  But then something magical happened: a friend won after spending 95% of the game with only two actions.  And then I was able to get a win by focusing on collecting bonus tokens.

Since that point in time, we have unlocked everything the game has to offer, and it is a beautiful, beautiful thing to see.  

This game is fantastic, and I rarely tire of playing it.

Somehow thinking back to this game again and again I realize that if I would have to keep only one game at home - it would be this one (if of course I could play other games outside. Otherwise I would probably chose YINSH).
Not because it's my favorite (though it's in top-10), not because it's most beautiful (it is somewhere in top-300) or fancy - but because it brings the most joy if you play with 3+ people - it's some kind of a defining board game for me:
Smart
Interactive
Highly replayable

People could have nostalgia about Catan, rave years later about Agricola and gather dust with their Chess set - but Hansa is the game that I want to play today, wish I played yesterday and would probably be glad to play in 10 years from now.

Well.  This is a pretty good strategy game, relatively short and fun to play. BUT.  The complete lack of any theme makes it bland, and contributes to making it hard to teach, since explaining the rules requires also explaining the obscure and dull background which no one cares about anyway. It's really just a big abstract with lots of rules. Still, it works, and there's enough in-your-face play to make it better than similarly bland euros.

Update: played a few times recently and enjoyed it enough to trade for it. Despite the bland, themeless look the game is really nasty with lots of interraction and plays quickly. It's much more enjoyable than I remember.

RATING: 7.3
Very, very demanding and competitive game, everybody tries the all time to block (to occupy) roads wanted by others or to reach a place in the town wanted by others.
It´s a little shame that the first half of the game it´s just a fight to reach the upgrades and that those upgrades are so inbalanced between them. The feeling it´s that you just take all the time holding back the others instead of creating your own network of roads and cities. And the game is also unforgiving to those players who get behind on reaching that specific upgrades they need.
Furthermore, is one of those games that comes to an end just when was starting to be fun. Theme and artwork are both weak.
Hansa is a good game but perhaps it´s just not my kind and i´m not very found of it.

My first couple plays of this were "meh". I really had trouble with the displacement rules, and they didn't seem to fit with the Euro style I was used to. Why would I pay twice as much to displace an opponent who then benefits? It seemed to me that players caught up in a competition for spaces would be at a stalemate while the remaining player(s) ran away with the game. 

I have now come to appreciate this additional aspect of the game, and my fears are unjustified. That is the beauty of the Liber Sophia (transfer action) for the displacing player or the player who keeps getting blocked. Just pick up your pieces and go to a different route (all for only one action). 

I really like games where there are mutliple ways to score VPs. This game has many paths to victory, and not near enough time to do everything you'll want to do. Watch out for your opponents though, because if you don't work to bring down the leader (esp. if he/she has 5 actions/turn) then he/she will win handily. 

This game almost seems to end too early. I like it so much,  often want to play it back to back, because it's so short.

This is a terrific game, and is pretty much all I could want in a game.

There are multiple paths to victory, yet at the same time as focusing on one strategy you have to have a bit of interest in each of the paths to victory or else you might be sneakily overtaken.

Strategy in this game is very fluid. If you play three games in a row, with the same people; you will have to change strategy each time, because your opponents will have noticed your previous strategy and seek to stymie you. For this reason, this game has high replay value.

Some have commented how boring the board is. I simply adore the map and would be happy to see something similar framed on a wall.

It scales quite well, though the more players you have, the busier the board gets and the more anxious One gets in seeking points. The scaling is helped by the double sided board which accommodates the different numbers of players.

The rules can seem a little dense at first, but when you get used to it (which won't take long) play proceeds quickly.

So much to pay attention to! It would take more than a few games to succeed, except by fluke. I have not had that fluke in my two plays. The second play seemed kind of long, although the ending was abrupt. Not sure it was that fun, wanting to do everything (same as the Agricola frustration -- are we having fun yet? Wow, haven't quoted Zippy the Pinhead in awhile.) Third play - won! Aha, I've got it now! Fourth play - oh, I lost it again. Not for ADD sufferers.

YAE. Draws slightly on the much simpler (and for me more enjoyable) Hansa, but not greatly. There are opportunities for clever play here to get the extra cubes out on the board, but its very dependent on play order. The player before you can give you a huge boost if they keep leaving opportunities.
But really, I found this a bit dull. In the end, its just another "get cubes out, collect upgrades, score points" without anything really novel, exciting for themey.
(Or I'm going through another jaded phase.)

[June 2017 - 9.7]
Another game that is just pure elegance and now ranks near the top of my list. The rules are fairly simple and straightforward, but the strategy is a lot more nuanced and hard to explain. It's a lot more about adapting and doing what the others aren't to maximize your engine before the rest of the players notice.  

[April 2017 - 9.5]
Still moving up.

[September 2015 - 9.4]
Another big step up in the rankings after playing a couple of times with players that know the game and keep the turns moving. Ditto on everything I've said previously. Even when I lose, I enjoy this game -- it feels like learning something new each time.

[July 2015 - 8.7]
Hansa takes a big jump up after a few more plays. Similar to my thoughts on Quantum, the more you play this game, the more you start to see all the different strategies. Every move seems to have pluses and minuses and I love the subtle interactions with other players in each move you make. It's that perfect balance of interaction and solitaire technology building. What the others do matter and can be sort of a "take that," but it's not too debilitating (at least on a single turn), there's always something else to do, if you're being blocked or displaced. And being displaced might even be the best thing that can happen to you in this game because of the compensation.  

[February 2015 - 7.6]
As a lot of people have noted, there's a lack of theme here ... but at least the board is beautiful to look at. I really like that as you play more, you learn how each ability can be pretty powerful, and you adjust based off what your opponents are doing. While everyone might rush for extra actions, there are ways to be a contrarian and gain points off that, or focus on other areas that will later be of value. It really is a game of markets. All the different ways to score points make it a little tough to teach, but after one full game, most should get the hang of it. This game might climb the ranks the more I play it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Steding has quickly become one of my favorite designers.  His games look so innocent, but in order to win you have to be cutthroat.  And Hansa fits that mold perfectly.  This is a game that I would recommend playing before you  come to any conclusions about it because looks can be deceiving.  It looks like an innocent cube-pusher, but it's much deeper than that and lends itself to a very strategic experience.  This is an amazing game that will stay in my collection as long I continue to game.

RATING: 10
Great game.  I don't see this ever leaving my collection.  Interesting choices with a variety of paths to victory.  The value of actions and locations has been swinging wildly as my group tries to get a handle on what works.  Early reliance on building up extra actions and bag was worrisome but worked itself out with more plays.  Plays very quickly and maintains nice tension throughout.  Beginning of game feels a little scripted with the rush to 3 actions but opens up nicely from there.  Much more confrontational than it looks.  Theme is barely present, but even members of my group who usually give theme a lot of weight forgive this one.

Upgraded from 9 to 10 5/2/16 Still always happy to play, deserves the 10.

Well, this is neither here, nor there, is it? It's far, far too complicated and convoluted to be an abstract, and the less said about the theme, the better. Surely, they had to go and really try hard on purpose to make it so uninspiring, boring, and soulless. I cannot imagine any other explanation. So, essentially, it's just some cube pushing for the cube pushing sake, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever thematically. I'm amazed by this game's popularity - if you want to see how a similar ideas can be done properly, look no further than Age of Industry by Martin Wallace. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is definitely a Euro in every sense of the word.  At first, I thought it was completely abstract, but similar to Tigris & Euphrates, there is a sense in which the theme works when you look at it form a high level.  Each rule is very abstract, but taken as a whole, you do get the sense that you're a businessman / politician vying for power by helping and hindering your opponents / alliances.

While Hansa Teutonica has a mix of many mechanics we've seen before (getting extra actions, placing cubes on maps, making route connections, area control), the feel of the game is very unique.  Perhaps it is a little bit like Notre Dame, if I had to make a comparison to another game, except HT has player interaction in the form of direct conflict.

There is a 1 game learning curve, because there are many different ways to score points.  You get a few points here, a few points there, and a few points you didn't even realize you were going to get.  The winner ends up with 40 points to someone else's 38 points (or something like that).  

Because of the multiple ways to score, there are multiple strategies that accompany the scoring options.  Furthermore, each of these strategic options can either propel the game forward towards its end, or help stall the game to make it last longer.  Some strategies call for a quick game, and other strategies call for a long game.  Learning how to manipulate the length of the game while tactically improving your position is the crux of Hansa Teutonica. 

The game is very compelling.  I found myself thinking about the game after my first play.  I wanted to play again immediately.

The board hurts my eyes, but there is a pretty good game here.  Really this comes down to an economic engine style game.  Take early moves to increase the power of future moves (like getting more actions or cubes back).  Take late moves to score VPs.  The good thing is there are a variety of ways to score VPs.  So the VP progression has some good choices.  However, the early game is about increasing your action count.  I'm not sure a player can score well if he falls behind on actions.  So the beginning of the game felt a bit scripted...I can't say for sure about the variability.  Rating a 7 for now.

RATING: 9
Hansa Teutonica is my favorite game to be released in 2009, and clearly one of my favorite games period.

What makes it stand out for me is the elegant interactions that game allows between players, as players are constantly competing for technologies, kontors, and game length. Individual players are incentivized to claim routes, while other players clearly would like to stop them. Rather than making this a zero sum affair, the designer implemented a genius action point system, where removing a player simply costs the displacing player some of their action points in exchange for giving the displaced player additional board presence, and a potential reduction in the number of actions required to claim a particular route somewhere else on the board. 

Because of this, and other similar mechanics, there are very few zero sum aggressive actions in the game, making it so there is always a question of whether displacing an opponent is more helpful to the displacing player or the displaced player. Is getting this increased technology worth giving your opponent additional points and giving them greater control over the game length? Did your opponent place that piece because they wanted to work towards claiming that route, or is it simply a distraction as they prepare for claiming another route in one turn?

I really do like this game. I do find that there are few routes that are as important as the extra action route and the get your bigger bag route. I need to continue playing this to really explore it. But it seems a bit simple with great mechanics

RATING: 8
Players are doing ... something to do with the Hanseatic League.  Ultra dry cube placement game, where players are trying to link up two cities on the board to either form a network of trade routes, or improve their action ability by connecting certain cities.  Improvement means they get to do more later in the game with the same actions, while networking is victory point investment for late game scoring.  Nice, clean game that moves along at a nice pace.  Lots of different strategies to try - a large game space to explore via a simple set of rules.  However, you do need to get into the actions or perish.  Very good game.

Only played once at a convention when I was exhausted and should have been sleeping.  I was turned off by the lack of theme, but could see that there were some interesting mechanics.  The extra action location seemed over powered compared to the rest, though.  I'd give it another try, but if I don't get a better experience, my rating with move down.

This is 110% pure Eurogame, without a doubt.  I see a mish-mash of very familiar concepts borrowed from El Grande, Blue Moon City, Thurn & Taxis, Notre Dame, and the like.   Roads are claimed by placing influence markers, and when completed, they are wiped clear and cities at the end points are claimed.   Or, you can claim bonuses instead of the cities.   There was a little twist in that shapes are important (round or cubes) but the game feels very derivative for the most part and pretty dry.  It has some back-scratching too, which isn't my favorite mechanic.  The graphic design is weak too (not to mention the worst cover art since Hamburgum), as the bonus scrolls are not clearly linked to the corresponding roads, and they are very small. I suppose it is a solid influence-placing game if you are into that sort of thing, but I don't think it is a game that will have much legs.   Need more plays to see about that.

Pretty awesome "upgrade your track" game in the same vein as Goa, but yet uniquely its own. One of the best parts is the ability to block another player's path, then later get a bonus for when that player knocks you off that path. Great game.

RATING: 6.8
Not a bad route-building, positioning-style game.  It takes a little while to wrap your head around, since you have to figure out the value of the different upgrades available and decide which to focus on.  Then you've got to decipher the blocking aspect and learn how to figure out where other people might go, so you can block them.  Next, how you can fake people out to get the routes you want w/out being blocked, or when to bite the bullet and kick them off your route.
There's a lot to it, with many avenues to victory.  The game can end in a hurry, though, especially if a couple of the players are pushing for it, and not all of the long-term strategies seem like they have a good chance of paying off.  The network bonus, in particular, looks a little underpowered.  I don't think I've ever seen someone max out keys, and if you're doing that, you have to put out so many cities on the board to make use of it, which means you need to unlock at least some colors, and mb a disc…
I'm concerned that there are times when someone will get out to too much of a lead.  If you fail to do enough blocking, and someone gets ahead in actions per turn, they can pretty much go around the board taking what they want.  The person with 5 actions per turn won't always win, but they will if the game goes long enough.  If you haven't been positioning to shut it down quickly, you could be out of luck.  
It still feels like this game has more to be explored, which suggests it has good depth despite the static nature of the board/setup.

RATING: N/A
●Introduced and owned by a friend (thanks!!).
●Played for the 1st time with my gaming group. Rule is simple but the game is deep (medium). It has deep thinking in it and the strategy that it offers is darn brilliant. I love this game.
The routes/tracks blend very well with the background artwork, making it a bit hard to differentiate, especially those who needs to see the board upside down during play.
●The game has low interaction, players will tend to focus on the game to see what other players do and what can he/she do during turn. Tension can come when someone blocks you from completing your route.
●Plays fast for experience players. Bits are just tiny cubes+circular disc, with some tokens. Quality is okay, though I think the cubes can be discoloured through repetitive plays.
●Love this game. If my friend doesn't have it (which he does at this point), then I'd buy this game.

Pure eurogame about moving wooden cubes from one place to another and gaining victory points for that.
But this moves should by smart, mean and vicious if you want to win. 
Few simple rules allow for several different strategies. Maybe not great, but definitely very good game.

Note:
I prefer (and recommend) to play without this two chips, which removes any three cubes from the board.

This is hard core cube pusher euro game in every way. We are merchants/traders who are scoring routes between cities of Hansiatic League, which is middle age Germany. There are many many roads to victory, spending choice of 5 different actiones every turn. Abilities on player boards are upgraded Terra Mystica or Eclipse style which is awesome. It's incredibly deep and fast paced, with game of 5 never longer than an hour, which is a big plus.

On negative side, graphic design and iconography is not very helpful. Also static map mitigates its replayability in a long term. 
Recommended with yodelling music in the background.

Reworked English rules are excellent.

Intriguing incentives that lead to a fair amount of interaction. Interfering with other players can lead to bonuses at their detriment. No luck, plenty of player chaos, but fairly predictable. The game heavily encourages planning for other players' actions. Extremely opportunistic.

Not a bad game, but just not one for me.  Lots of tactical cube placing.

RATING: 9.5
A truly, truly wonderful game. The special thing about this one is that you have incredibly many choices in every move. When other players try to block you or play against you, you still have zillions of other pretty good choices. So you're not easily frustrated, and it's much harder to team up against one player. It's harder to identify bad moves though, but even that helps you to not feel bad. And the major twist is that by kicking out an opponent's cube they get an additional cube, so hurting others also means helping them. It's a [b]feel-good[/b] abstract cube-pushing game, and this is quite an achievement. And it must be one of the most balanced games around, it seems like there is nothing that gets even close to a killer strategy.
It's true what people say that you might not want to play it with AP-prone folks.
But most important: Don't judge it simply from reading the rules, or from just looking at the board and pieces, I'd even say don't judge it from observing others playing it. It feels so different actually playing it yourself.

Hansa Teutonica was a very welcome surprise.  I've played it a few times at 3 and 4 player counts, and all of us were impressed.  There's a smooth flow to the game and it's got enough interaction to separate it from the more typical multiplayer solitaire Euro.  It's a shame it doesn't work so well with 2 but I'm looking forward to playing it again when we can muster 3 or 4 willing participants.

Hansa Teutonica feels more like a multiplayer abstract than a typical Euro.  Can it be compared to another game?  If I had to, I think it bares a very slight resemblance to Endeavor.  That said, I found Endeavor to be boring.

So what's the game about?  It's basically a multiplayer abstract game where you play discs and cubes to routes on the board between cities.  Once you exclusively have your pieces on the complete route, you may activate it.  When you activate a route, this will cause the route to empty but give you the benefit.  This will usually be one of three things: (1) Gain a bonus tile which gives you a special one-time benefit and will also give you bonus points at the end of the game. (2) Advance yourself in one of 5 'techs' which will increase your capability to influence the board. (3) Add a cube/disc to a city, which increases your network, can cause you to gain VP in future route activations as well as end game scoring, and sometimes an immediate benefit.

Gift from Super Secret Santa and Super Secret Elf - thank you both!!!!!!!  :kiss:

Played a learning solo 2-player game 1/2/10 and my reaction was meh.......found it to be a lot of busywork.

1/3/10 - Played 3-player with my husband and 8-year old daughter.  A much better experience and my little one--who got bored with Carc and TtR--developed her strategy and nearly stole the win!!!!

Played twice more, 3-player.  This is a very intriguing and engaging game!!! All of us love it and want to play again and again!!!

ANOTHER UPDATE:  Since my daughter now refuses to play, Mystery Bob and I tried the 2-player rules. We both found the game to be clunky, tedious, boring, unexciting, and with little tension with only 2 players.  Too bad, as we both really like the game, but it definitely requires at least 3 to really shine

Rating will go down to:  8

RATING: 8.5
-Nice balance of long-term strategy and tactical play resulting in a high degree of replayability.  
-Analysis paralysis potential seems relatively low.   Three player game took 60 minutes.  That's huge bang for your playtime buck!
-Variable end game conditions that seem effective in countering specific strategies.
-Novel gameplay despite being a fairly pasted Euro.  Somehow the designers have managed to throw together familiar mechanics in a way that feels unlike any Euro I've played to date.  
-Rather abstract in nature (with very little luck) but avoids being dry owing to five upgrade "technology" tracks, all of which seem vital depending on board position.  
-Confrontation for those who don't typically like a lot of direct  confrontation (like me).   In fact, setting yourself up to have your pieces attacked/displaced by your opponents is necessary not only to hinder your opponents but to gain benefits as well.  This encourages offensive and defensive play without causing irritation for those who don't like excessive conflict.

A typical euro. Nothing really jumps out at you as particularly interesting or innovative. It works, I guess. But too long for what it is (2 hours is a bit much) not helped by the fact that this game has direct conflict.

[1 play] This game probably does not deserve all the hate I feel for it, because wow, that's a lot of hate.  If I were forced at gunpoint to play this or Race for the Galaxy, I'd have to think about it (and would probably get shot for AP). 

I just had a rotten experience playing this game.  This isn't supposed to be a game (like a co-op) where you battle the game itself, but that's how it felt--like the game was evil and out to thwart me in every way.  Everything I instinctively wanted to do was dead wrong, and everything the game wanted to make me do was exactly what I did not feel like doing.  We were both too stubborn to give in.  I did not take one cube off my player mat the entire game.  If I have the misfortune to play this again, I'll try to force myself to take some completely different approach, but I won't like it.  

And Hansa Teutonica does deserve some portion of my hate, for being the dullest, most sterile, themeless, pointless Eurogame ever.  Race for the Galaxy is looking better every minute.

Hansa Teutonica, though a little less meaty than I had hoped for, is a great abstract-euro with a streamlined design, some player interaction, multiple viable and evolving strategies, and very little luck.

RATING: 5
#1 example of the 'too short for what it is' category.  I like the concepts, but it seems to be too hard for a player to extend the game (at least with 4 players).  So much of the board is left empty, there are some serious expectations lacking in fulfillment.  There are some interesting mechanics, but let's call this one underwrought, where it seems like interesting breadth was pared away by the development process.

Seems to be a really fantastic euro - multiple paths to victory, plays quickly, good replayability, simple rules, good depth, interaction without direct confrontation, well balanced, highly regarded, award winning, very little luck, lots of long-term strategy as well as tactical decisions - scratches similar itch as Notre Dame, and I'm sure I'd love it.  But then again, do I want another typical euro, it's quite abstract, perhaps I want something that stands out a little bit more from most euros?  50% recommend it as less than suitable for 2 players, seems best with 4-5 players, so that's a down side as well.  Potential for analysis paralysis in end game might be a concern here?  It's clearly very good, but perhaps not for my situation right now, sad as that is.  Wish I could play this.

Several things make this game stand out:  the wonderful choices between position and tech improvement, the symbiotic aspect of blocking, the bonus chits which aren’t just diversions but greatly influence your decisions, and the different ways to end the game. However, there's a barrier to entry that almost dissuaded me from holding onto the game.  You and your group need to grow together in skill else sub-par play can tilt the game one way early on and give a player to their left an advantage.

The HT death spiral usually begins with the start player who gets into the action track first and frequently; the rest of the table rushes to catch up to this person in actions (no! just go do something else!) and he benefits from them bumping him when they should move their cubes or let them sit there, block the damn route, and play chicken.  When this subtlety is lost, the butterfly effects mean one player jumps out ahead and then someone has to take one for the team to stop the leader in terms of not letting one player get all the bonus tiles (and then set down the next bonus tile on their route) or allow them to set the game tempo (short game vs long game). 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After a first play with two players, I like the different ways it seems possible to specialize. Getting Actions seems like the prime consideration, but the other tracks are important as well, so we will see how it feels after a couple more games.
-
After another play, this time with the actual 2-player rules. It was a bit harder to keep track of everything with the soldier, but the Action track still seemed best. The special actions still are not very attractive, but I could easily be undervaluing them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Hansa Teutonica is my favorite game.  The almost-abstract feel to its play makes for an engaging and complicated game which I have not found elsewhere.

Why Hansa Teutonica is great:
1.  Extremely well balanced paths of victory.  Your actions directly affect how well the other players will do.  Are you clogging up the action spaces so nobody can have them?  Pushing for that Arnheim-Stendal connection?  Maybe you're just taking the Coellen Victory Points.

2.  Because the game is well balanced, you must constantly react to situations as they arise.  This is the most difficult and rewarding aspect.  Your opponent can completely screw up your plans, just because they want to.  You'll then have to decide whether that was worth it, or maybe choose a different option altogether.  The other game I love the reactive nature to is Race for the Galaxy; work with what you're dealt, as best you can.

3.  People love talking through the strategy, and meta-game is created and destroyed constantly.  New players tend to overvalue actions, groups go in and out on how they feel about networks, etc.  It's a game that begs to be 'solved', and is nearly impossible to.

If you want a dry themeless euro with a ton of interaction, and difficult choices, this is your game.  Not advised to play with people who have significant Analysis Paralysis, or it would take 2.5 hours.

Wow. The game totally changes when a few of the players have played before (newcomers quickly pick it up).

I didn't care very much for this game.  In addition to feeling fairly snowbally, it also felt like it was far too encouraging of players being a dick in contesting the extra actions section of the board.  By getting ahead on those actions, it became easier to crowd into that space, forcing other players to give you tons of free cubes on the board if they wanted a piece of that action, potentially accelerating your own engine while slowing everyone else's down.  I didn't care for the bonus tiles that gave massive numbers of extra actions as a one-shot, either.

This game pretty strongly disagreed with me - most games with dickery and conflict don't seem to so strongly force you into engaging in dickery if you don't explicitly choose to do so, but in this one it felt basically inevitable, and not in a light and silly "take that" sort of way, but in a "ugh I can't believe we're still playing this" sort of way.

I doubt I will play this one again.

I really dislike how the game revolves around the extra actions spot and the rest of the board is like an abandoned strip mall with a dollar store that you visit occasionally. This is the case in every game I've played. It would be one thing if you could make a go of it ignoring extra actions but you simply can't; you must keep up. Players just dabble in the other action spots and networks either build off those spots or someone goes for east-west connection. So while the board makes you think there's some real network building here it is really more of a side effect; the game is largely just a war of upgrading your abilities (or whatever they're called).

If the network building and usage of roads was better integrated into the game I would like it more but the design feels like a bit of a mess to me.

Rating based upon one play.  Map seems cluttered in it's graphic presentation, and the (yellow) specials might have had some game information presented.  As a newcomer playing with experienced people I did poorly but was learning some of the strategy by mid to end game.  Would love to play again on a cleaned up board and better understanding of end game victory points (indicate them on board or player mats?).

RATING: 6.5
Something of a gamer's game - I can't see most people getting excited about which is essentially pushing cubes around. There are points of interest, but it mostly comes down to knowing and reading the map, and getting into key places. We forgot until the final scoring that controlled cities are worth 2 points each, so maybe we'd have been more tight and competitive in our choices. But the obvious move seems to be to drive your actions up to 4, drive your privileges up and then build a quick network, with your Key being 2 or more points.

RATING: 7.5
A nifty route building euro, but one that feels a little "scripted" (especially during the first opening moves).  I like the player mat idea - which allows players to gain improvements for removing cubes clogging up spots on their individual player boards.

The game feels well engineered, takes a little over an hour to play, and seems balanced with the various actions people can make.  But the gameplay itself is a little bland & dry.  I highly anticipate the 2012 release of Terra Mystica, which uses a similar (but much more advanced) player mat system along with special powers across 14 different races.  But for the time this can play in, it's quite good (75 minutes for a 5 player game is easy) Grade: C+/B-

I am not sure that Hansa Teutonica really brings anything new to the table, in terms of theme and mechanics, but what it does do is take established mechanics and perfect them.  There is so much to do and explore in this very short game.  On my shortlist of greatest euros.

This is a much deeper game than I expected.  There are so many options for gaining points.  I wish I could have played this game immediately while I was aware of several strategies I might not remember if this game doesn't come to the table soon again.  The person we thought had lost for sure, was the winner.  

I like it that there are two game boards, one tailoring the game for 2-3 players, and the flip side tailoring the game for 4-5.

I have played a few more games.  When someone gets ahead it is very, very hard to catch them.  Extreme aggression from the 1st move for the privilege of additional moves seems to be one avenue to winning.

Great Euro that incentivises blocking, has multiple victory paths, and is deep enough to create groupthink issues (eg overvaluing actions). The game is a bit vulnerable to new players handing others points.

More comments later, but I haven't been so excited with a game since Caylus or maybe Dominion.  So many paths to victory, and you get can away with not having a "balanced" strategy where you have to do a little bit of everything.  Not for people who need theme or dilike pushing cubes around.  This is like the meaty, big brother of Web of Power / China that has a much different feel than most route connecting or area majority games. The game allows you to disrupt the plans and routes of other players, but it’s not as mean as it sounds because these disruptions can help your opponent just as much as they help you, which you can’t say for many games like this.

Nagyon egyedi, jól összerakott játék. Szívem szerint 10-est adnék, de egy játék után, nem szabad. :)
----------
6 játék után megjött a 10-es. Nagyon jó, nagyon egyedi. Folyamatosan alkalmazkodni kell, és fürkészni a másik játékosok gondolatát. Semmibe se lehetsz sose biztos, mindig az adott helyzethez viszonyítva kell meghozni a döntéseidet és nagyon meg kell érezni a játék ritmusát.

Egyetlen hibája talán a kaják kiegyensúlyozatlansága. Vannak egyértelműen erősebb és gyengébb lapkák. Ez valamennyi szerencsefaktort visz a játékba, de ez talán azért nem annyira zavar ebben az esetben, mert a többi rész nincs annyira agyonegyensúlyozva, hogy csak ez döntse el a játékot.

--------------
20 játék után jöttünk rá, hogy egy szabályt roszul játszottunk, ám úgy jobb volt a játék. Emiatt meg a bónusz lapkák kiegyensúlyozatlansága miatt, a kezdő lapkák gyengesége, nomeg az értelmetlen városbetelős vége opció miatt 9.5 csökkentettem az értékelést.

Hansa Teutonica ist eines meiner Lieblingsspiele, da keine Runde der Anderen gleicht. Es gibt bei Hansa viele Wege zum Ziel und damit zum Gewinn. Man muss immer die Aktionen der Mitspieler im Auge behalten und natürlich auch seine eigenen Aktionen planen.
Nach mehreren Spielrunden mittlerweile im mittleren zweistelligen Bereich packe ich dieses Spiel immer wieder gerne aus. Deswegen auch die volle Punktzahl!

RATING: 8
Neither the box nor the board of Hansa Teutonica look very exciting. Standard euro fare, one of about a million similar games. Same about the theme or the mechanics: Route building in medieval Germany for fame and profit. Placing your "workers" on roads enables you to score them and place one of them in a city instead which extends your trade network. There's more (bonus chits, a personal player board with upgrades, ...) but that's the gist of it, and you've seen it all before. Pretty much the only non-standard mechanic is that you can displace opponents' pieces from roads (at a cost, and with benefits for the displaced player).

Yet, the way all those little cog wheels fit together makes for a very intriguing game. Plays can run along very different paths with three different game end conditions, and players can focus on scoring points during the game or in the end game scoring. You can try to improve your personal board and make the game last longer, or you can ramp up your score quickly and try to end the game soon.

The complete package is what makes Hansa Teutonica compelling. Awesomeness in a box.

Build a network of trade throughout a map of cities.  Each player has a 'technology card' that can be leveled up during the game.  This card controls things like number of actions a turn, victory point bonuses at the end of the the game, how many traders you can have, and what level of trade office you can build.

Fünf simple Aktionen münden in das beste, härteste Verdrängungswettkampfspiel seit Bestehen der Deutschen Hanse. Bei HANSA TEUTONICA stimmt einfach alles: die kreative Idee, der Look, die Quintessenzialität, der Independent-Faktor, die Materialbescheidenheit. Vor allem Letzteres: aus einer Handvoll Holzklötzchen ein derart dichtes, intensives, konfrontierendes und einzigartiges Spielgefühl zu zaubern ist ein Geniestreich, den der Autor Andreas Steding wohl genauso wenig auf dem eigenen Schirm hatte wie Geburtshelfer Roman Mathar von Argentum und der dem kleinen Kölner Hinterhofverlag 2010 zum ersten Mal in Essen Scheinwerferlicht bescherte. HANSA TEUTONICA ist dabei mit keinem anderen Brettspiel vor und danach zu vergleichen, obwohl es sich formal als Setzspiel in die Schublade stecken lässt. Aber selbst innerhalb dieses Clusters bleibt HANSA TEUTONICA ein charakterstarkes, völlig individuelles Kunstwerk, das Raum und Zeit des Brettspiels einmal von West einmal ungeachtet gegen jeden Markt eigenwillig und ungeschliffen durchkreuzt. Selbst das abrupte, abreissende Spielende passt nahtlos zum Wesen dieses taktischen Meisterwerks. Noch einmal: HANSA TEUTONICA ist faktisch einfach nur langweilig Klötzchen setzen. Aber die Fülle an Bewegung, an Dynamik, an Interaktion, Blockade, Stellungskrieg und Varianz in Offensive und Defensive versetzt mich bis heute in das gleiche Erstaunen und Entzücken wie in dem Moment als es bei mir bei HANSA TEUTONICA das erste Mal Klick machte und sich alles erhellte. Das nennt man wohl Erleuchtung.

Finally got a chance to play this after all fo the BGG hype.  It certainly is dry theme-wise, but I expected as much.  Feels a bit to me like a "souped-up" version of Endeavor in several ways.  You take actions that eventually allow you to either get points or upgrade certain aspects of your playing board.  It certainly isn't a bad game, but not one that is my style.  I would play it again if it were brought out, but I wouldn't request it.

HT is a damn strange game to wrap your head around during the rules explanation, but it actually flows quite well when you get into it. It's quite a punishing game though. Lots of opportunities to screw your opponents and set yourself up in a position where an they might want to take advantage of where you are, but you get points for it. Also, lots of places to block people out and such (though you can kick them out at a cost). There's just nothing about this game where you feel like you've ever got the confidence to do well! Even with all that in mind, it's such a well constructed game that it is truly intriguing to play and get a fix on things. For that reason, I quite enjoy it, even with all the punishment.  I really appreciate what the designers have done here.

A great game for its time. Many games have been imspired by it or other similar games. 
You upgrade your board, removing wooden pieces to improve your actions and get more actions. I love that in Scythe and perhaps it was from this game the mechanic originated. 

It is very dry though. Very very dry, noone can have any feeling for the theme. And it is a point salad that is quite hard to wrap your head around the first time. Also quite AP prone. And not that rewarding for the time spend and the concentration needed. 

Also if you are beind there is no catch ut mechanism...you know you are behind and has no way to counter. 

A point salad with a nice engine building aspect.Great design though for its time.

I love the tension between going for what you want directly and patiently hoping to be pushed. I love that once the game is set up there is almost no board management (for a game with lots of board management see Agricola). I love that you have to play this game well from beginning to middle to end.

This one is growing on me.  The player interaction is very in-your-face, actually providing incentive for players to get in each other's way.  I have seen multiple paths to victory, which speaks well to the game balance.

The two player variant is rather clever.  The players have access to the entire board, but they must move a "pawn" token to the area of the board where they would like to carry out actions.  The "attraction" of the pawn leads to quite a bit of conflict between the two players, preventing the game from turning into "two player solitaire".

While there are some detracting aesthetics of this game,  its deftness and variable paths to victory are undeniably good.   There is a lot of interaction and choices for what you want to do.   Somewhat frustrating to play though, because you basically have to try to work around other players instead of forming you own strategy.   The path of least resistance may be the most successful but not usually the most fun.   Does play quickly even with 5 and while constraining the decisions were of the fun kind.

The problem with this game is that the first 2 people to get an extra action, generally the first 2 players to act,  can easily continue to get more actions and steam roll the other payers with their 5 actions.  Bland art, boring theme, no fun game with lots of sitting around waiting for other players to spend their 5 actions.

What a brainburner! It's really a game that lasts and lasts and lasts if you play with some AP-prone (similirally to Torres or Tikal). But the gameplay itself is great.

There are some drawbacks though: horrible graphics (that's a minor one), to grasp the rules you must play it at least once (I don't find it a good treat) and the most important - the manual is horrible. It's not a nightmare like in one of a previous games by Andreas Steding - Heart of Africa - so he's certainly learning and evolving. But the problem still exists. Maybe he should hire someone to make it for him? It would make many players in the world very happy...

I just love the fluidity of this game: cubes move around a lot, yet the whole remains quite controllable. Also, the way opponents' cubes can be displaced (while paying a penalty) gives some nice ebb and flow. The theme is quite pasted on, but the map looks great.

Rating after first play. The game is clever and I like the structure of having lots of different approaches to try and win the game. The structure of individual turns just didn't particularly excite me. Instead of agonizing over all the possibilities and what to do next, I felt rather indifferent about all my options, the scope of which was really rather limited, so nothing I achieved felt particularly remarkable. I'll gladly play it again to see if the feeling changes (it very well might), but right now the game is off my shopping list.

Very abstract euro.  This is euros at their driest and most painful.  Some twists here with respect to multiple path player upgrades, on top of the banking routes vs. upgrades decision.

But basically a *very* calculated abstract on a timer with no soul or excitement.  Overly incremental play that never lets you feel like you accomplished anything substantial on your moves as well.

RATING: 5
What a lifeless game. There are lots of different things to go for, and different ways to score points. But the whole thing is so completely abstract, and yet somehow so complicated. Most games with this many different options will tie more closely to some theme, while simpler games tend to have less theme. But not here. 

I'm not sure how much of my tepid reaction to the game is due to the rules explanation I got, which was stripped of even a token reference to the theme. I think it helps to grasp a game as a whole to have some overview of what the game is about, even if the theme is very thin. It helps to have some sort of framework to hold the different pieces together, instead of just memorizing that "keys multiply connected cubes" and "bags let you draw more cubes."

Although the game is a fairly standard cube pusher, oddly enough I haven't played a game like this in a long time.

I can see how euro gamers would really love this one, but again a reminder why I am moving away from very euro games. I think I would like this one more with some added experience, I just don't really have the desire to play it 5-6 more times to get it up to a possible 6.

I could consider Hansa Teutonica as "my Web of power for four or five playes" although both games have nothing to do with each other in mechanics, they are wonderful short and easy to learn games that can be finished in aproximately one hour offering quite deep tactical options for their easy rules. The game has its drawbacks: the lack of theme, its too abstract for my taste and I dont like the gameboard a lot but anyway these are very minor and personal gripes. The package is really good and all the good reviews that the game received in the last months were right. Very good game in which you will have to create routes, establish offices and get some bonus points to win at it. The game flows perfectly and I dont think that it can cause any special dosis of A/P situations. Some Endeavor/Goa mecahnics blended in a good way but still a nice game by its own. Thanks to user Deinos for this second chance cause at first I traded it since seemed too scripted for my taste, but I was absolutely (once again) wrong.

HT always takes a while to teach but, after a turn or two, the game play breezes along. After all, it's merely place cubes, move cubes, take actions, or take offices. And the multiple scoring opportunities and the unlocked powers ramp play up very quickly. 

Although being the starting player does have advantages, particularly in getting the extra actions, there's also opportunity to rush the game by placing offices in strategic spots. 

Finally, I appreciate the balance of knowing when to switch from developing abilities to building your route. 

It's a clever game with a lot of options, despite the simple game play. And, most importantly for me for a Euro, HT has tons of player interaction. Lastly, it never overstays its welcome.

I was not expecting much out of Hansa Teutonica.  Although the board is beautiful in its own way, the game had the aura of a lifeless, mechanical game for humorless German nerds.  Well, yes, I did find it nerdy and very mechanical and very, very, very German.  But not lifeless.  What gives it life are the tense standoffs and move/countermove interactions among the players, along with the complex and intertwined strategic paths that open up as you begin to understand what is possible.  This is a subtle, sophisticated strategy game in a plain brown paper wrapping.

Hansa Teutonica is a good and impressive game, but I don't yet know whether it is the game for me.  I'm always wary of games with nothing random to "shake up" the setup or the gameplay.  If a game starts to feel too same-y, that's usually when I lose interest.

[UPDATE] Yes, I'm still enjoying it, and it's not yet feeling same-y. Plus now there's an alternate board to help allay those concerns.

It was quite a surprise for me. While it delivered a dry euro with many paths to victory, it was also a fun and engaging experience. This is an action point connection type of game with different roles and ways to upgrade them.

I so want to rate this higher and I do want to play it more. I think this might be a situation where my expectations were simply not met. I wanted to love this one after hearing so many great things about it. But I was perplexed by this one. In a four player game, nobody ventured outside the four corners of the board, where the upgrade cities are located. The center of the board was virtually empty. I was expecting colors all over the board and I expected more people to push me out of my spots. Perhaps it was the group I played it with and perhaps I played it poorly (which is entirely possible), but I just didn't feel the tension or the cutthroat nature of this game. I want to play it again to see if this was a total fluke or indicative of this game or my game group's play style. The gameplay, at least in this play, didn't make up for the incredibly dry theme and boring art style of the game. Overall, a bit of a disappointment.

This game was the surprise of Essen 2009 for me. I expected a lot from other games and rather few from this, but it has lots of interaction and can be really mean (fierce competition in a 4player game). It's good balanced. Yes it's an abstract with pasted on theme but it's a solid designed Eurogame that should please the lover of medium weighted Eurogames. Only downsides are the written rules and maybe the ergonomy of the icons and the board (colors). This is why it hasn't got 8 rating from me.
Update: after some more games I uprated it to an 8 because it really deserves it.

Why is this so much fun?  It certainly doesn't look fun. Nonetheless, this has steadily become one of our favorite games. Two person is really compromised, but it beats not playing the game at all. Prepare to jostle and be jostled, and to always scan the board greedily for opportunities.

UPDATE OCT 2014: With Terra Mystica and Eclipse there to play--especially in two-player--this just doesn't get to the table anymore. I'm not sure the new Britannia expansion will fix that, but we'll see.

I immediately liked this game for its compact brilliance in spite of a superficially underwhelming theme. Give it a chance.

Very solid Euro design. The formatting and grammar of the rules make this seem more complex that it is. It's an straightforward action point game with 5 available actions that can be performed with actions being upgradeable during the game.

I don't know why this didn't click.  I'll give it another few tries, and probably adjust the rating.  As it stands, there are simply far too many ways to gain points and the special abilities seem rather similar (adjust action efficiency).

Edit: Deleted initial rating of this game.  I had a few misconceptions and need to try it again.  Better than I had originally thought, but I find the early struggle for three actions to put far too much on a tactical emphasis on opening play.  The expansion map might correct this.

Edit Again: Nope, still find it really boring.  The game seems to lack any kind of tension or drama that clicks with me.

This one left our group highly confused.  The game itself introduces some new and exciting mechanics which are fun to play.  However, our test game went seriously wrong.  All players focused their actions on the cities where you could get extra actions, extra traders, extra options.  Nobody went for the center of the board, nobody attempted to build a large network.  And so the game ended rather quickly leaving 3/4 of the board untouched.

As a result I'm VERY unsure about this game.  The idea and mechanic itself would justify at least a 7 or an 8 but the actual game play was so limited in our (three players) test game that it I could only rate it a meager 5.  But this was just one game where we might have overlooked essential strategies. So for the time being [b]I'll stick to a rating of 6 and promise to play the game again :)[/b]

Update after some plays: This game allows A NUMBER OF quite different strategies.  [b]Raised rating from 6 to 8.[/b]

RATING: 3
Absolutely dry game, with no connection between theme and mechanics: place and move cubes and discs on the board while managing your little spreadsheet. There is very little randomness but a lot of annoying chaos. The gameplay is tedious and repetitive. In my only play, after 15 minutes I was bored to death and didn't care for the game anymore, but the suffering lasted almost two hours.

This is one of those games that try to create an illusion of depth by offering so many ways to score that it is hard to keep everything in mind and evaluate the best course of action. However, going for extra actions early is crucial, and the players who manage to get them will leave the others in the dust. To make things worse, having your cubes kicked off actually gives you more cubes to place for free on the board, and if the other players just ignore you for the first few rounds, it may be very hard (impossible?) to catch up.

The graphic design is no better, confusing in some spots and with unintuitive iconography, not to mention the drab artwork.

Despite all that, I might give it another try with fewer players (I played with five), but I'm certainly not looking forward to do it. I was more annoyed than entertained.

Excellent euro.  Plays fast and has great decisions throughout.  You must be able to adapt your strategy and use all of the tools you have to win. Because blocking is integral to the gameplay, you will be blocked - often.  Just go with it and have a back up plan.  

The rule book is poorly done.  It can be a chore to learn but once you do, it is worth it. Print out a player guide from the files section.

RATING: 7
For a medium-light game, the rules are a little overwhelming -- there are a bunch of special cases.  And the fact that you have to pay attention both to the number of dots between cities (2, 3, or 4 makes a big difference), and to the number and types of actions that your opponents can take on their turns means that there is a lot to consider on every turn.  Ultimately, this is a game where you have to work hard to foil other players' plans while still achieving your own.  The only way to learn how to do this is to play... so it's not an easy game to teach, but one that can be learned after a game of getting one's plans foiled by others.

Interesting that there is almost no randomness (except for the bonus chips).

There seem to be many ways to win.  In my first play, I won with 61 points in a 4-player game because I picked up the 11- and 9-point merchant spots in the lower left city and had decent (but not great) city connectivity and 4-point advancements on two privilege tracks.  I only had 3 actions per turn when all others had 4 or 5, so it apparently isn't a requirement (although it would really have helped).  Other strategies include controlling many cities, building huge connected networks with bonus key multipliers, picking up many bonus action chips, and trying to end the game early by getting people to build near cities that you control.  A combination is best -- it depends a lot on the players in the game.

It's important to get lots of pieces on the board, because then even with few actions, you can move 2-5 pieces with a single move action and get lots of things done.  One way of increasing cubes on-board is to place a blocker... if someone needs to remove you, it costs them an extra cube, gives you an extra cube, and leaves you with more pieces on the board to play with.  But the Book track is really important to this strategy.

This is my comment after 2 2 players games.  I will try with 4 players before barbecuing it.
I love euro games, really; I find them to be the superior breed of games, with the occasional (too rare indeed) ameri-style game that manages to be playable.
But Hansa Teutonica is for me the embodiment of the game that the fanatical hordes of ameritrashers loathe; it's a caricature of the less interesting parts of euro.  Endless tactical bickering, total divorce from theme (and I find that Tigris and Euphrates has a meaningful theme), and too many turns you feel you accomplish nothing.  The agression is there, but it's neither engaging like a good old battle, nor particularly rewarding.
If I want an abstract game, Id'rather play a streamlined affair like Keltis; I feel that Hansa Teutonica has a mockery of a theme only to justify it's needlessly complicated engine, but neither of them makes any fun.
Of course my impressions of a game are influenced by my expectations, and after doing my research I was convinced Hansa Teutonica was a game for me.  It was definitely not.  Sure the game is fast, but I was astonished that it lasted only one hour; it felt much more.

I like this game but I'm not as in love with it as a lot of people are.  I'm a bit worried that the game only really shines with 5P.  With less I'm concerned that it's just a race to become "action guy" and that you can't nullify that.

RATING: 6
My opinion on this one is sliding. It seems like there are several strategic options IF you do well in the initial jockeying for extra actions. If you opt to try something else in the early turns, you may as well give up, as the players grabbing up the actions will overtake you in the end. Does the game become good again once everyone knows about this pitfall? Time will tell.

Played at Origins.  Lots of interesting mechanisms in this game.  Usually I prefer spacial games with more random elements, but I think there may be plenty of replay space even with a fixed map.  Main issue is that taking more actions might be a dominant strategy, like most games where gaining more actions is possible.

The theme is pasted on like in most euros, but the artwork of the map is kinda invocative & does the job well.

RATING: 8
Where did this come from? How is it that this slipped under the radar in 2009? This is an excellent game, with many interesting choices, tense tactical play, and thought-provoking strategic play.

It seems similar in feel to the following games:
* Notre Dame -- traders/merchants (the cubes) need to be brought from the "stock" to "personal supply".
* Thurn & Taxis -- need to establish routes between any two cities in Germany (almost same geographical area), to establish offices (to get points from other players who connect the same two cities you already did), or to get specific upgrades to your menu of actions.
* Ticket to Ride -- need to establish longest continuous route of offices (but not driven by any destination cards).

There are only five possible actions:
1) place a cube from personal supply to a route;
2) claim completion of a route between two cities, and
a) get an action upgrade (if one is available), OR
b) establish an office on either end of the route (if available), AND
c) get a "bonus" token that may give you additional actions or different type of action not available in the menu;
3) displace an opponent's cube (which has a cost for you and a benefit for your opponent);
4) move X number of cubes and transfer them to other parts of the map; and
5) move Y number if cubes down from stock to personal supply.

You start the game with 2x actions, but this can be slowly upgraded up to 5x actions by completing a specific route.

Scoring starts out painfully slow, with 1 pt being awarded to player(s) who have the highest-ranking office on both ends of a completed route. Since routes can be completed a number of times, by various players, the offices can garner these incremental points. It is also possible to get 7 points by connecting the two main cities on the edges of the board with a continuous route of offices. Once somebody gets 20 of these points (or 10x cities have filled out their office spaces), the game is over. However, the real scoring then begins, with pts being awarded for:
1) completion of specific action upgrades;
2) specific point claims on the board (I don't remember what these were);
3) 2 pts for having the highest-ranking office in each city;
4) 2 pts per office on the board (only one player's office per city);
5) 1 pt per bonus token collected;
6) N-pts for the player's longest chain of offices TIMES the number of "keys" (another upgrade item) multipliers they have collected.

Thus, just because somebody has scored the game-ending 20 pts, doesn't mean they will necessarily win. This is the exciting aspect of the game, since there are various paths to victory. Since the 20 pts serves as one of the game clocks (the other two being totally maxing out the office spaces in 10 cities and total depletion of bonus markers), this makes the game length variable. However, there is very little downtime, as the decision tree is relatively small (you only have two actions to begin with, the question is what to do, and where to do it?), the game clips along at a rapid pace, clocking in at 90-120 minutes. The sweet spot may be 4 players, as 5 players introduces more chaos, like a 6 player game of Acquire.

There is also the subtle difference that there are cubes and discs, representing traders and merchants. You start out with a lot of traders, but with only one merchant (more can be had by upgrading). However, the merchants are more expensive to displace, and in some cities they are required to lock up an office space. The office spaces are also color-coded, so upgrades to "privilege" must be made to occupy those higher-ranking slots.

Given that players can displace each other in competition for key routes, the game plays like "... a knife-fight in a phone booth." The game could change dramatically in one round, if players have upgraded their menu of actions (and number), so it makes for a tense, nail-biting game. In my opinion, this is a much better and more satisfying game than Notre Dame, especially since one doesn't have to deal with rats and there are virtually no random elements (except the bonus markers), or the "screw your neighbor" aspect of passing action cards--you know exactly what actions you are entitled to. Further, it is far superior to Thurn & Taxis given the high level of interaction, and more fun than TTR since there is "combat", if you can call it that, to claim dominance of specific routes. The only quibble is that the board is fixed (with the placement of bonus markers being the only random element), and everything else is perfect-information, so the game openings will eventually succumb to group-think, and re-playability will suffer. Thus, I'm glad to hear that there are new expansion boards coming out.

Initially a '9', but I expect it to easily go to '10' when I get my own copy. Impressive design, with great integration of several different (and novel) mechanisms. Definitely a winner.

Update (1/4/11) 2 plays: Looks like the keys bonus scoring was incorrect: Multiply the key level by the N total number of connected and contiguous offices. The cities don't need to be a single continuous chain like in Ticket To Ride, but is the equivalent to "largest network" in Railroad Tycoon. Plus, multiple cubes/discs in each city are counted too. This makes the keys more powerful than previously thought. However, I wonder if there is any strong incentive to set up offices early in the game, rather than constantly fighting over the skill upgrade routes.

Update (1/14/11) 4 plays: Game is getting a lot of play at the meetups and at home, as it has shot up in popularity. Played the 3 player board, which is more fluid (much less downtime), but also less tension and chaos. The game seems to be best with 5 players, but downtime is then a few extra seconds of agony and anxious waiting, thus 4 players being the sweet spot in terms of tension and downtime. The game is easy to explain, although there are many small rule details which can be easily overlooked. Further, we have uncovered 3 or 4 rule errors in the English translation, so caution is advised. Aw, who am I kidding? This is a '10', through and through.

Update (10/10/11): Has fallen as quickly as it has shot up. People grumble when I recommend this game, as they are not interested in watching two/three-way pissing contest down around the city that awards additional actions; they have concluded that maxing out on the number of actions is the key to the game. I have seen other strategies win, but it looks like this game needs time away from the table. Downing to an '8' for the time being.

I used to like this more, but I've become rather annoyed by the later part of the game, where it's possible—and common—to populate and claim a road entirely in one turn, making the entire mechanics of claiming roads just a simple action selection mechanism.  If I wanted action selection, I'd play a game that has more meaningful and interesting choices to make (frankly, even Stone Age).

RATING: 6
Players use a limited number of actions per turn to earn VP during and at the end of the game. Mostly actions involve putting ones own traders and merchants on roads between cities (possibly displacing other people's pieces). If you manage to occupy an entire road (usually 3 or 4 pieces) then you can use an action to take off all your pieces and either place one piece in one of the two cities or in the case of some cities or roads gain an alternative advantage.

Quite what this taking your pieces off roads once they are full has to do with the theme of medieval merchants is not clear.  It is also unclear which of the several ways to score points are more viable nor is it clear at the beginning of the game how many turns the game will last or how many turns or actions it will take to earn points by each method.  Hence viable strategies are quite obscure.

RATING: 7
The very essence of the modern Euro: bland, themeless and inoffensive. It's really an abstract game of building connections, then choosing from a variety of prizes: points, more actions or more cubes. The designer was presumably conscious of accusations of overstayed welcome as the game ends with the board still mostly empty. It's well enough done in its own way, but not something I'd request over its more established competitiors.

Hansa Teutonica is extremely tactical.  It feels as if the outcome of the game is determined by a series of many small changes, none of which necessarily has a huge effect.  It's very difficult after the game to point at what made you win or lose, at least for me at this point. I'm still an inexperienced player, though, so perhaps I will figure it out.

I do find the game intriguing and I enjoy the fact that each turn presents a new decision.  I'll have to see how I feel about it after further plays.  

A person might be forgiven for considering the game dry, but I find that when games are so described, I usually like them. (1 play)

Un juego abstracto obtenido de lo que resultaría al mezclar Goa o Diamonds Club + Thurn und Taxis o Taj Mahal.

Los jugadores son mercaderes de la liga Hanseática intentando ganar prestigio gracias a abrir oficinas comerciales, mejorar sus capacidades, montar redes de rutas comerciales y ganar fichas de bonus. Suena a juego económico, pero no es así. Tampoco de colocar trabajadores (a lmenos exclusivamente). Básicamente es un juego de situar mercaderes y comerciantes (cubos) en rutas del mapa para reclamar rutas. Lo distinto es que, una vez completada la ruta, se ejecuta una acción asociada a ella y se retiran los cubos. De este modo, una misma ruta, se puede reclamar más veces durante la partida. Alternativamente, en vez de ejecutar la acción asociada, podrás mejorar una de tus 5 habilidades.

Me gusta mucho la variedad de formas de conseguir PV's: por losetas de bonus (los platos de comida), por situar oficinas, por completar rutas en las que tengas oficinas, la puntuación final por las oficinas que controlas, la red de oficinas más larga, las habilidades desarrolladas al máximo, la conexión entre dos ciudades específicas del mapa y los puntos obtenidos en otra ciudad específica del mapa ("los barriles")

También me gustan las distintas condiciones gracias a las que se dispara el final del juego: cuándo alguien anota 20 PV's o más, al completar 10 ciudades o cuándo se agotan las losetas de bonus ("los platos").

PROS: Los novatos lo suelen pillar enseguida. Buen equilibrio entre estrategia a largo plazo y oportunidades tácticas a corto, lo que genera gran rejugabilidad. Ausencia casi completa del azar. CONS: Muy abstracto y con el tema absolutamente pegado. Repetitivo. Pretende crear la ilusión de ser profundo ofreciendo muchas formas de sumar PV's, para que sea dificil evaluar cuál es la mejor opción en cada momento.

[ENG]

An abstract game obtained from a blend of three games: Goa (or Diamonds Club) + Thurn und Taxis (or Taj Mahal).

The players are traders from Hanseatic League trying to increase their prestige level. To do this they need to open sales offices, improving their skills, developing trading routes and obtaining bonus tiles. All of this sounds like a economical game, but it isn´t, neither a worker placement game (well, at least is not ONLY a worker placement game). Basically it´s a game about placement of traders and merchants (cubes) on the map routes and claim them. The different part is that you can claim a route more than one time during the game. Alternatively, inestead of executing the associated action, you can increase one of your five skills.

I do love the different ways to obtain VP´s: using bonus tiles (food dishes), placing offices, completing routes where you have offices, the end score in offices that you control at the end of the game, the longest office´s net, developing skills to the maximum level, the connection between two specific towns of the mal and the points obtained in a specific city of the map ("the barrels").

I do love too the different conditions that trigger the end of the game: when a player has 20 VP´s (o more), when the bonus tiles are run out or when ten cities are completed.

PROS: the rookie players get the system quickly. There is a good balance between long term strategy and short term choices, so it generates a lot of replayability. There´s no luck. CONS: Pretty abstract game with pasted theme. Repetitive. It aims to create the illusion of depth game offering many ways to score VP's, to make it difficult to assess what is the best choice at each moment.

Well, the first play was enough to get me to buy it while I could.

I really liked how few components there were and how open your turns were.

I'm a little sad about the necessary fight over actions at the front, but I can get over it.

Even in our first game of 3 players we all did something different and all ended within 5 points of each other.  That is damn cool.

So far this has been very solid, but I have not really played it with the right crowd yet. Everytime has been with new players so too much of an advantage for me to see how balanced different strategies are. It has a good dose of interactivity that is made much more compelling because of the advantages for the player being attacked.

Update 8/1/2011: The attraction for me is the multiple ways to score which leads to multiple paths to victory. The downside is the abstract nature and the area control aspect. Two player game is still engaging because of the range of choices that are offered. It may appear fiddly initially which is why I had not tried to play it until recently, but it really maintains the spirit of the game. I can't decide if the multiple paths outweighs the abstract nature for me. Girls do seem to enjoy it despite its abstract nature.

RATING: 9
This is a very interesting Euro game, which feels utterly unique among other games I have played.  The basic core, route completion, is, I guess, similar to games like Ticket To Ride, but everything around it is much more strategic.  One thing that's interesting to me is that, like other Euro games, there are many paths to victory.  However, unlike other games, the level of player interaction here and the different victory conditions means that there are many directions that the [i]game[/i] itself will take.  Some games might go quickly with everyone rushing for bonus markers.  Others might go more slowly with everyone increasing their skills.  One or more players focusing on a given strategy (lots of actions, big network, lots of bonus markers, etc) might require a strong response in the strategies from other players, such that everyone has to work against that focused player (I think).  

The more I play this, the more depth reveals itself. It's possibly too chaotic with all the player interaction to allow very deep, long-term strategy, but it's certainly a game that rewards study and practice.

The theme isn't pasted on, it's nonexistent! And that's not a deal-breaker, but in this case maybe a coherent theme would help me to better grasp the non-intuitive rules.

Very good game.

Played with 3 players, so the board was a little more restrictive as we only had one route for each development (more actions etc).

Would like to play again with 4-5 players, although will probable try the new Brittania board next time.

Again very well balanced, I went to fully unlock my board while others went for routes and was a close score at the end.

RATING: 8.5
Interesting game. Reminds me of games like China or Thurn & Taxis. Have no idea what the theme was. It was basically just pushing tokens around for victory points. But it did that well, was tense and interesting with quite a few strategies. It seems to me to be more of a strategy game where you need to pick your strategy early and push for it, tactically you need to play toward your strategy in some way every turn.

There certainly is interaction with the pieces, but whether that equates to interaction with the players or not remains to be seen. A good length game though. Our 2nd game clocked in around 80mins, and while the first seemed to suffer from AP the second (even with the most AP prone player in our group) ticked along. Once people start to get the idea it probably will do that.

There is probably a lot to unlock here. It was certainly a good game. My only worry is that I felt no connection to its theme. The only thing that will bring me back is the gameplay, and whether the gameplay will bring me back to truly get into the game remains to be seen.

Two plays in a row upon learning the game - so far, it's great.  Looking forward to more, especially as everyone becomes experienced with the game and the scores tighten up.

This game can be quite cut-throat.  Will need to learn strategies to mitigate the effects of blocking, because the last two plays have been less enjoyable.

Classic Euro with a lot of cube pushing. Mostly abstract, and the map is a little busy. BUT this seems to be a remarkable game with few rules and a lot of depth.

Everything works just fine here, but the game just doesn't excite me in ANY way...

Besides it' terribly (I mean, terribly) dry - not often I complain about it...

HT reminds Endeavor in several aspects (filling connections with players' cubes on the main board and players' own mats with development paths = strategic + tactical elements).  In some way it's a similar experience to play these two games.  And I'm not fan of Endeavor either ;-)

EDIT: After 4 plays I find this game very schematic.  Rating down to 5 and absolutely no desire to play it ever again...

RATING: 8
A very good THEMELESS Euro, not that that is something new in Euro games but it is nice when the theme actually matters. 

So quite dry really but everything (else) you want a Euro to be is there which is the important part.

Fast moving, multiple scoring/paths to take, very low luck and its strategic and seems to have some depth. Extra actions do seem to be overpowered compared to the other options so fight for them early, and the cubes help a lot too.  

Only played once so far, rating could rise a bit like 8.5, not sure it could be a 9 for me, possibly.   

[u]Update:[/u] Finally played a second time about a year later, the dryness and soulessness really does hurt the game for me and many others BUT the damn game itself is very good and I might just have to pick it up. With some kind of spark or theme this would be an easy 9 for me.    

The main reasons I am tempted to buy it are: 

 - VERY fast turns; really NO AP what-so-ever which is nice for a game with options and some depth and not usually the case. Also games should be 90 minutes. 

 - VERY low luck; mostly just some PIC (player chaos) but even that has fairly minimal effects so overall low

 - Muliptle paths; very open-ended and several ways to skin the cat here, will be dependant on players too which keeps the game replayable (though a static map does not, hence need for expansion).  

So like my first game I really like it, but if ever there was a prime example of a Dry themeless souless cube pusher, this is it.

I was really impressed with this game. The rules are really simple to learn, but there are pretty interesting things going on. There seem to be a lot of different ways to approach the game. And it really pays to figure out what your opponents are up to because you can get pretty big advantages to getting in their way, and also a lot of points if you can get into a city where they're going to be going a lot (like one with a good bonus for example). And there's also the question of how much time you spend upgrading and when you start to just focus on points since the game has a variable end and so timing that right based on what everyone else is doing is very important. Plus it feels pretty quick to play since turns are so short that there's little downtime.

RATING: 6.7
I've only played it once and the jury is definitely still out on this game but I have serious doubts that further plays will steer me to a more positive rating. HT has a meaningless theme for one thing, which I don't always mind (I love E&T and Goa for instance). This game is all mechanics, tactics and rearranging of cubes. Woo hoo, hold me back from the fun! I find myself steering more and more clear of pure Euros and this is a prime A example.

I'll give it a few more shots since it's comes with such high recommendations and ratings and we'll see how it goes. Frankly, I'll try to get it played a few more times quickly so that I sell/trade this before people realize what a stinker it is.

*Update* I've played it two more times now and I can see a few strategies to work with. You still need to grab at least one additional action fairly early on. It's still too dry and the map just feels too big (I've played all 3-player games though). A few more plays and I'll be trading/selling it.

*Update* My 4th play was a 4-player game.  The game has grown on me a little and my group really likes it.  Guess I won't be trading it after all, at least not yet. Bumped my rating up to a 6.

Hansa Teutonica's biggest sin is a dry theme that feels out of place. Otherwise, it's an engrossing experience filled with strategic decisions centered around choosing to play the long-game by investing in more powerful abilities or the short-game by scoring points as quickly as possible. These strategies are executed via quick turns of tactical maneuvering that encourage constant interaction but not aggressive destruction of opponents. Each game plays a bit differently every time based on the way each player plans and reacts, giving the game a great deal of replayability. It's a game that is close to perfection.

Rated after 1 forum 4-player game and 1 5-player face-to-face game.  While actions do seem slightly over-powered there are lots of ways to score and I've enjoyed my plays.  Yes, it is very much an abstract game but it leaves a lasting impression as you think about things you could have done differently.

Pleasant enough cube shuffler - a bit of El Grande, a bit of Endeavor, a little bit of China.  Not much connection between game play and theme.  No randomness, other than the face down bonus tokens and what everyone else playing is going to do.

I don't like when I do not know why I won. Maybe it should be played more, or there is a problem with the engine. On the other hand it was a satisfying experience to play this game, even when I thought that I am gonna lose big time.

It definitely seems to be something original, and that is not that common nowadays.

Hansa Teutonica gave a pretty good first impression. It's definitely a very old-school eurogame, complete with a graph-like map whereupon players place cubes in order to claim trade routes, establish presence in cities, etc. A private player board is used to track your progress on five different development tracks, each allowing for more efficient play options as they are advanced.

A couple of thoughts: The board is static and it seems as if a couple of specific routes, which allow for special actions, will tend to play a central role in each and every game. I fear this may influence the staying power of the game in a bad way.

The game actually has a lot in common with Endeavor, but in my book Endeavor comes away as the clear winner in almost all respects.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (October 2014)

I went to great pains to acquire a copy of Hansa Teutonica, in fact I bought Hansa thinking it was this game. When I was reading the rules I thought the game was going to be fantastic AND it is one of the best ranked games here on BGG, as of today it is number 66 in the general ranking. So I was very excited to try it and sadly it disappointed me. However I still have some hopes for the game.

First of all the rules are hard to understand from the rulebook, I’m not sure why, perhaps the way they are redacted or something, but I had to re-read them many times to ensure I actually understood them. They aren’t hard to get once we began playing the game (I can explain the game under 12 minutes now) so I think they could be much clearer. Besides, now I know that the rules I read have 3 mistakes, so we played wrong the final scoring, I didn’t understand what was the “office network” so I need to give it another chance soon.

The gameplay was very fast, in fact we finished our game very quickly but most of the map was empty during the game and we always fought for the same routes, namely the one that gives the players more actions. The game ended very quickly via VPs, the other end conditions seem very hard to accomplish. I have only played a 3 player game and I thought it would be a lot tighter because it was the maximum number of players for that map.

The theme is very boring and inexistent. The art is very regular too. The cover of the box induces sleep in everyone who gazes at it. 

Bottom line, I’m disappointed. I will give it another chance soon with the correct scoring this time.

I’m glad I tried again the game. The main problem was the awful rulebook. The rules are pretty simple, but they are hard to read from the rulebook and some versions (the one I read) have mistakes in it. The scoring example is abysmal. Once you pass around that Hansa Teutonica is a pretty good game. I’m amazed that the game plays so quick but it offers interesting decisions each turn. In this play we felt the game was much more tense and interesting, we fought hard for some routes, even though we were only 3 players. it was very fun. You have to attack your opponents routes or the game won’t be interesting.

For now I think the game is best with 3 or 5 players because it becomes more tense. I think I prefer 3 players because the game is fast & furious :D, with 5 players it can be a lot longer. The art is very bland but the game components look gorgeous on the board.

I’m upgrading its rating and now I want to play it more.

Now I’m definitively a fan of Hansa Teutonica. I prefer to play it with 3 players (you can finish a game under 35 minutes) but I’m open to try it with 5 players.

I feel the game has a lot of interesting decisions and depth vs. the playtime. My problem with the game was the awful rulebook.

For now I won’t say no to a game of Hansa Teutonica and I plan to get the expansions.

RATING: 8
There's no doubt in my mind that Hansa Teutonica is a very good game.  The extortion mechanic is brilliant.  I'm not sure I like it, but it breathes new life into what in other games is predictable blocking.

Variable player powers through technologies are also a great deal of fun, and it's nice to see more Euros incorporating them.

I never looked at the 2-3 player board but it's nice to see with HT and Small World a growing awareness within the modern game design community that modifying the board layout with increasing player counts can be every bit as important as modifying starting resource positions.

More than anything my reaction to Hansa Teutonica highlights how much I've changed in my gaming tastes.  Back in 2006 I would have rated the game a 9 and played it 10-15 times.  Now I'm not sure I have the patience for repeatedly playing this style of game anymore.  It's not quite Ra in its theme binding but let's be honest, the game doesn't exactly make me feel like I'm traipsing through the lowlands of northern Germany with my haversack and my merchant's guile.  And there were certain mechanical elements which were never going to appeal to me that much, like the blocking (as interesting as this game makes it) and the network building without anything to deliver over said network.

I need to give this game another couple plays.  I was the only newbie at the table and didn't really know what I was doing, so it's possible some of my negative feelings amounted to frustration.  That should go away with experience.  It's also possible that playing any new game as my first game 16 hours after my all-time favorite (and a very different beast) Advanced Civilization is setting it up for failure with me.  If I can muster enough enthusiasm to make it 5-10 plays with Hansa Teutonica it will be well worthy of an 8.  Otherwise it will fall into the set of good games which just don't click for me.  There are enough that do click so that wouldn't be a great tragedy.

Update 7/2010:  3 plays in and I'm starting to see how this game works.  I'm much more kindly disposed toward the game than I was on first play.  I now rate it 8 without reservations, and I might consider a 9 after a few more plays.

As of January 2017, this is my most recently purchased game. After watching a playthrough video on Terra Mystica, I was intrigued when the video claimed that Terra Mystica shared some mechanisms with a game called Hansa Teutonica. I had no idea what that game was, so I then researched it, and it looks like a gem of a game. (I suppose the player board and how you increase/decrease your resources for the next round after you take a building off the map and the other back onto the player board in Terra Mystica is similar to how you take your cubes for your special abilities off the board and increase your ability in Hansa Teutonica.)
Although I am not really looking forward to reading the rulebook for Hansa Teutonica (I have heard that it can put you to sleep...), I am looking forward to figuring out the specifics of how it is played.
What I really like about what I have seen regarding this game is that it is very interactive and there is a lot of strategy as far as whether you want to kick someone off their route, but if you do, then that opponent will get compensated. So the question becomes is it really worth it to kick your opponents out?
This is the type of game that seems like it would play best with more players.
I cannot wait to start introducing it to my gaming group! (I can think of one person in particular who I believe will really like this game, because he likes another interactive area control type of game which has a mechanism where you kick your opponents out which I have played with him, called "Royals" (another good game)).

I learnt this game two player with my wife and we didn't realize there was a two player variant. The end result was .... it Ok.  
Then I played a four player game and holy crap did the game come to life. It can be very cutthroat but never to hurt your opponent too much ... more to delay his progress a little and they are many ways to be victorious.  We had many different tactics in our four player game and yet the final score was very close (well balanced game). 
I don't know that I would play this with two again but with more players this game shines. It's a keeper!!!

A very engaging low-luck rails/route/network game.

The game has Puerto Rico syndrome - the game is not particularly balanced unless all players play well, especially around the upgrade routes, coellen and end-of-game conditions.

Pros:
- Low luck, low randomness
- Very engaging, with gameplay shifting between tactical gameplay over upgrade routes and strategic play with the upgraded skills

Cons:
- Rulebook is unclear in a few places
- The game doesn't play well unless every player plays well.

Use your actions to claim routes that enhance your prestige or give you additional abilities. It sounds easy, but the balance between each is hard especially when your opponents can push you out to beat you to the score. It plays just the right amount of time too, thanks to three different ways to trigger the end conditions.

Two plays so far one with 3 and the other with 4 players. In both the guy who got the extra actions and route has won. I think the table has to figure out how to manage that better. Interesting game so far.

RATING: 9
Players are merchants trying to gain prestige in the Hansiatic League by proving their mettle as merchants in various ways - by opening trade offices, improving trade skills, building networks, and gaining special favors (bonus chips). This makes it sound like an economic game, but it is not. BGG describes the game has having an "action point allowance" system, which is not true either. Yes you start with two actions per turn and this can be increased, but its not really an "action point" system if every action costs one point. It is a route building game with a Goa-like "action improvement" system. BGG has not come up with a term for this sort of mechanic, but we really need to. It's quite distinct.

Basically, this is a game of placing traders and merchants onto routes in order the claim the route. What makes this game a bit different from other route-building games is that once you claim the route, you use it to perform an action associated with that route and then remove it. In this way a single route can be claimed many times in the course of a game. A persistent route or chain of routes is established by creating offices in cities at either end of a route as one of the possible actions to take. Alternatively, at some cities, instead of establishing an office you can improve in one of 5 skills that increases the power of standard actions. There's actually quite a bit of interdependency and subtlety in the various options that allows for both short term point grabs and long term strategies. It's an old-school euro mechanically but those mechanics come together in a way that fits perfectly with the more complex tendency of recent euros, while avoiding feeling stale and re-hashed. It's pretty impressive.

RATING: 8
Good route-building-engine-efficiency game. I dig how all the tech tracks funnel back to building and reenforcing your presence on the map. This helps to fight against the pull towards points-salad-lets-maximize-all-the-tracks thing. I like that.

Even better is the displacement action. Screwing your neighbor isn’t zero-sum but rather has an immediate cost to the attacker and potential benefit to the victim both immediately and in subsequent turns. I really like that.

But what makes it great is that if played well one can begin to not only incentivize others through cube positioning, and inviting displacement, but can start to manage those incentives in such a way as to determine the board state toward their benefit. Now that I love.

A couple of things I am unsure about: 

1) In both plays I had the most keys and largest network and won both times. Does that mean the game always devolves into a fight over the gaining or blocking the keys? 

2) The bonus tiles allow you to break the rules in various ways. While I’m okay with that in general, the free displacement tiles run contrary to the most interesting decision and dare I say spirit of the game?

Well!  What a good game.  Only two plays with 2 players so far, but I'm pleasantly surprised by this one.  A very well crafted game that feels a bit like El Grande meets Ticket to Ride.

This has room to grow in rating as I think a 3/4 player game will feel even tighter and more interesting.

My best "new-to-me" game of 2010!

A beautiful game design with a relatively pasted-on theme. The penalty for displacing other traders is a really nice and interesting feature.

There's a lot of talk about the first moves being scripted, but I don't mind that (after all, everyone knows e4 in chess, so what? ); I still think it should be played out, b/c that initial fight between 3 players is still interesting, and there are still decisions to be made by the 4th and 5th players; so starting at 3 actions would take away that part of game. 

Bottom line, this is one of those games that sticks in your mind long after the play, causing you to wonder - what if I try this? Or that? These are the kinds of games I'm in this hobby for.

I absolutely love the "medieval map" board, which is commented on and compared (favorably) to authentic medieval european maps here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/507289/like-the-fugger-welser-medici-board

[b]Thank You Secret Santa 2010![/b]

I think I've figured out why people are responding so positively to this Dark Horse title from Essen. It doesn't feel like a new release. It is not a complex, multi-layered, heady blend of several other well-known heavy games. Instead it feels like it could easily have been released 10 years ago. Rather than having a vague sense of its potential after a full game, by turn two everything clicks and you think, "oh, this is really good."

Unfortunately, Hansa Teutonica sounds pretty dull on paper. All you do is compete for short city-to-city links on the board by placing cubes. Once you finish a link, you can either place a marker in an adjoining city, which will score you a few points depending on future board activity, or you can claim a "tech" advancement associated with that city. There are five types of advancements and several levels of each. All of them enable stronger boardplay.

In practice it's a snappy, satisfying game that combines straightforward rules with a sense of fluid, open-ended play. You choose how to develop your abilities as the game progresses. It also feels tight in that you must respond to other player's moves and continually obstruct their plans. The gameplay has all of the engagement and precision associated with blocking but none of the spite or tit-for-tat. You can always "unblock" yourself, you just pay a small cost to do so and give a small benefit to the blocker. So I'll get in your way because I don't want you to have easy access to a powerful advancement. You'll still get it, but it'll cost you a bit more and you'll have to help me a little elsewhere on the board.

It's fast. It's reasonably short (45m). Almost anyone should be able to grasp what's going on and get into it. Gamers like it. Eight-year olds like it. Who'd have thought?

After a disastrous first experience, I tried again and discovered this is a really good game. Lots of conflict, and interaction. But done in a very palatable and "euro" kind of way. Options feel tight, yet narrow. The engine building isn't quite as an "engine builder" as expected, but it has more competition than what was hoped for. It has fabulous pacing and plays quickly for it's weight class.

The game's production has some significant flaws. Terrible rulebook. Confusing and nondescript iconography. Unclear graphic design. Drab presentation. The game could use an overhaul. But all those issues are entirely ancillary to the gameplay itself - which is suburb.

Extremely generic and boring theme and artwork (though I kind of like the individual player boards, which represent desks), even the title sounds drab (and derivative), but luckily the hype this game has produced is warranted.  

People will often say that there are multiple paths to victory in a game, but I rarely find that these paths are all that separate.  In Hansa Teutonica, you can never really ignore what the other players are doing, as a player that dedicates himself to a certain strategy, when not held back, can take you by surprise for the win.  I think you still have to leave open room for little tweaks along the way, but it helps to be focused.

One of the better track developing games I've played because the game doesn't focus on tracks, although often there is maybe too much focus around the action track. This has been nicely addressed by expansions. Generally you're enhancing your possibilities by developing tracks, but you don't lose if you're not fully focusing on some of them. There are many different strategies capable of doing well and winning the game and therefore this seems to develop a bit differently every time. Works well with two players too.

One of the Euriest Euros I've played; pushing and pulling cubes are the heart and soul of this game. Player representation is tenuous, a lot of abstract stuff just sort of happens, and the rules explainers actively resisted elaborating on theme and thematic justification. Score is conservatively positive after one game, a three-player game dominated by the action hogging strategy; I expect a four- or five-player game will bring out more of the game's qualities.

After two and a half years finally played a five-player game, and came in second after a runaway leader. I feel the game is lacking something: most of your turns are spent quickly placing a couple of cubes aiming for something and hoping to still be aiming for it when your next turn comes around, so that two or three turns down the line you can gain a bonus and start aiming for something else. Rating stays put for now, though.

But dropped the rating by 1 after a few more years. I'm just not thrilled by how the game turns on action upgrades and how engine upgrades in general feel like competitive water treading  with respect to the board state. Maybe the expansion map is just awesome though.

What looks to be a dry, cube pushing euro is actually a clever brain burner (in a good way) full of subtlety and multiple paths to victory.  I cannot seem to find a way to do well at this game but I still think it is excellent..

There are many paths to victory and many creative ways to play. The key is adapting your play based on what others are doing. You can't just play your own game here. It hits all the things I like in a game, and does it less than 90 minutes, and around 60 if everyone knows the game well. A terrific game. I can see playing this 50+ times.

Excellent.  A simple ruleset elegantly creates lots of different situations and tactics and strategies.  You can see what the board means at a glance, unlike Concordia e.g..  

Looked like a soulless cube-pusher until I played it.  But it isn't!

Cool blocking tactics give you a benefit for hindering another player's presumed plans.  (Whereas in most games, blocking moves cost you some in order to cost one other player some more; which is annoying, negative-sum, and game-slowing.)

A dizájn kicsit elavultnak mondható, de a szabályrendszer és a jatékmenet elegáns, egyedi. Egy játék után úgy érzem, hogy egyrészt tényleg látom a nagyszerűségét, másrészt viszont hangulatilag nem került hozzám közel. Nagyon magas az interaktivitási szint, állandóan egymás útvonaláshoz pofátlankodunk, hogy a kilökésekkel még több helyre felkerüljünk. Eeee, számomra ez egy kicsit idegesítő volt, hogy jé, oda már csak egy kocka hiányzik, akkor gyorsan beköltözök, hadd nehezítsem meg a dolgát. És valoban sokat számít, hogy ki mennyire tudja figyelni az aktuális helyzeteket, mennyire tudatosan választ az ellenfelek közül "áldozatot". Talán még majd teszek vele 1-2 próbát.

For me, this game shines best with 5 seasoned hansa teutonica players going at one another during the game.

07/2016:
We had a debate after my latest game in which I rushed to a victory by emptying the supply of dinner plates. The debate was over whether or not a quick victory was as fulfilling or satisfying as a win in a long game. I always appreciated HT as a game with many diverse paths to victory, ,long and short. You always have to block the leader and seek out the path of least resistance. If you play long - you have to disrupt the plans of the 'rushers' collectively as a group. If you aim to win short, the clock is always ticking and you have to squeeze out the end game conditions before sheer number of actions by those playing the long game start to overwhelm you.

Sadly disappointed in this. I don't necessarily find the game mechanics interesting, even with the sheer amount of player interaction that exists, and usually appeals to me. The theme is bland and while there are multiple avenues to victory, another appealing draw to me, I found myself just not getting into the game. Hopefully this rating changes after more plays, if I can get it to the table, but this won't see higher than a 7.

Who needs theme?  When a game has solid mechanics like this one, a theme is unnecessary.  I have a house rule for this game:  The remove 3 token has an extra "at most one from each player" clause.  I like the idea that being the target of aggression during the game is generally a good thing, and the remove three token violate that principle.  By limited the damage to one token, the violation is mitigated to some extent.

A true "many different paths to victory" type of game.  A very rare breed.

A Truly Great Game. Playtime, depth, options, ease of play, interaction and variety are all masterfully blended into what I consider to be the best Euro I have played. Even after repeated plays, the depth and variety continue to surprise me. 4-5 players is certainly the sweet spot, but it is also enjoyable with 3 (and decent with 2). It is also great when playing with different groups as the game really changes based on players’ decisions in the game.

I like this game. It seemed a little puzzling while the rules were being explained to me, but after a couple of play turns I got some grip of it and actually won the game.

You have your own board with stats/skills (# of action points, # of cubes to get in resupply etc) which you can improve by building and scoring specific routes.

Nothing new here which is the biggest issue for this kind of games. Hansa Teutonica is a far from the excellent game, because A) there are too obvious first moves, B) hidden information or goals are missing C) not enough competition. Updated 09/2011: rating dropped 6 -> 4 after more plays. First feel was right, I've seen this kind of games a lot and Hansa Teutonica is one of those, which I don't need to play again IF there is any other eurogames available. This is dry and dull AND is missing all the excitement.

Really abstract and just as ultra euro as it gets, both in look and feel.  Interesting mechanic with very simple rules, good flow and decent tactics.  Plays impressively fast (40 mins for a 3 players, 1h for 5 players).  Experience is sadly inferior with 4 because of the map, better with 3 and 5.  Because it plays so fast, the game can be quite hard to read and lots can happen very fast at the end, calling the winner.  Viable long term planning is pretty much useless because of high player interaction (which is why it's fast) but lots is happening on the tactical level.  Simple enough that it's getting old fast for me (personal).

RATING: 5
Some interesting/good ideas but too long and it outlasts it's welcome, for me personally.  I'd like it if it was under 2 hrs.  This is a middleweight game in the time category of a heavier game!  It's also too fiddly and too many layers that lengthens game time in excess (I'd suggest to take out one of the skill tracks and streamline some other layer like replacing the bonus chips in exchange for hidden goal/s card/s).  I was interested up until halfway through and wondered why is this not ending?  With certain groups, there will be lots of downtime or analysis paralysis.  After the first two hours, I thought the fun factor was diminishing severly and wish I was playing something else similar, but much faster (like "Via Romana").  Also, this game is highly prone to groupthink efficiency.  You want to go after things no else is competing with.  Without hidden goals or something like that, if two people go after the same strategy, the lagging player will be severely punished.  For the time it takes to play this, I'd rather be playing a heavier game with similar time length.  I think I understand all the strategies and options available but I just don't feel the fun after 2 hours, nor do I wish to go through the long grind again to find out.  Pound for pound it's simply not worth my time.  Bottom line, most of the game just didn't do it for me b/c I have issues with how they mesh.  I don't hate it, the game mostly "works" (with some issues), but you'd have to do a great negotiation job to talk me into trying it again.

RATING: 9
An excellent game of both tactical and strategical implications as one develops a long term plan but sometimes must consider short term changes and implications.  Only five choices available for action choices make the game simple to play, but the interwoven aspects and many possibilities for how one wants to proceed towards the goal leads to considerable thought.  Some people have locked up at times for a while to think through how to optimize their turn and 2-4 actions.  One can develop four different tracks - one grants more actions on a turn, another allows you to move around more guys on the map, another grants you bonus multiplier for your largest cloud of connected cities, and the other determines how many guys you can bring into your "province" from the reserve (similar to El Grande).  Bonus chits throw in additional motivations to complete certain chits and allows you to place the new chit in a different location more favorable to help you and also allows you to bend some rules.  The beautiful thing about this game is the ability to pursue several different winning strategies and the fact that once you know how to play, the game can be played in 35-40 minutes.

There are many paths to winning the game and this is what keeps the game consistantly interesting and challenging.

Un toque abstracto y demasiada interacción para un euro, pero cumple
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An unconventional area control game that interlocks a couple of different, but related, area control systems. In one, the roads, you must acquire exclusive control of the territory (possibly by bumping opposing pieces at the price of giving them more moves on an adjacent road), the sacrificing your control in exchange for one of a few possible rewards, including improving your efficiency at the various available actions or gaining influence in one of the cities at the ends of the road. Control over those cities gives you money (VPs) when any player "cashes in his chips" on an adjacent road.

It's all a bit confusing at first, and it's easy to latch onto the obvious plan of bumping how many actions you get to take each turn right out of the gate, but I now suspect that the game is just a tad more subtle than that. You're probably better off trying to set yourself up to take advantage of your opponents' plans first, and then work on developing some efficiencies of your own once the rush has died down a little and, hopefully, when you'll get a point or two out of the bargain as well.

My biggest concern going forward, my previous paragraph notwithstanding, is that I'm a little uncertain yet where the balance between strategy and tactics lies. Investing in cities is certainly a strategic move, at least on its face, and there is an infrastructure-building element (those efficiencies I mentioned) as well. Unfortunately, road play is very much catch-as-catch-can. When you're ready to play to a road, you have to look at what's available, and there's a decent chance that your first choice or two are likely to be at least partially blocked.

If another play or two come down on the side of strategy over tactics, Hansa Teutonica will be a must-buy for me. If it ends up being largely an exercise in in-the-moment tactics, I'll still play on occasion, given the opportunity, but I'm unlikely to pine for it.

Only one play, so too early to tell, but I like the high level of player interaction, which is pretty rare for a cube-pusher euro.  There appears to be a lot of game to explore.  For that reason, it has the potential to earn a good number of plays.

UPDATE:  Our group's second play was far different from the first, and scores were a lot closer.  The possibilities of different strategies are starting to emerge.  My enthusiasm for this game continues to rise.  I rate it an 8 for now, and am hoping it holds up.

UPDATE:  We had another two games of this tonight.  No two games have been the same.  It seems like we keep peeling back layers of strategy.  Upgrading actions seemed to be the be-all-end-all three games ago, but now does not appear to be nearly as powerful.  Our games have gotten quite tense, especially towards the end when everyone knows that the game will soon be ending but needs a little more time to complete the last few routes (like upgrading keys).  This game has gotten better with each play, revealing more and more strategic options.

This has the possibility of being a 10 for me.  After our first play we all talked about our strategies, what worked, what didn't work and what we could do better next time.

None of us felt like it was overly complex and I actually enjoy the theme and artwork of the game.

Absolutely solid game. While using a version of the sliding scale mechanism from Goa and Endeavor, yet maintaining yet another different interpretation, this game couples that with what is essentially worker placement, majorities, and hand management; yet in a whole new fashion that I have never seen.

The game is fast paced and tense, and quite fun. I expect my rating to rise.

Elements of Goa, Caylus, and Power Grid resonate throughout Hansa Teutonica, but sadly none of the fun of those three Euros carries through.  This game is about as dry and unfulfilling as Euros go, lacking any cohesive theme and punishing anyone who deviates from the established strategies.  There's not a lot of room for lateral strategy here; merely an over produced game of chicken.

My one play with more was interesting - but the guy I expected to love it instead hated it. So having trouble getting to know this game. I want to love it, I can see there is a good game in there, but I haven't really gotten to explore it yet. Frustrating.

Oh, the Germanity!  I wrote a review of this that pretty well sums up my feelings.  It's a good and worthy title, and the gameplay is fun.  Still, if I'm looking for a "pure Euro" experience, I'd probably turn to something like Tikal first, which at the very least has the advantage of looking beautiful.

A medium weight Euro where you a trying to improve a number of tracks each providing different advantages while at the same time gaining advantages from the map to score points.  The game has many different possible ways to win.  The game can feel dry and it has no theme.  However, I find the game interesting with a lot of good choices and some play where you have to anticipate your opponents moves.

RATING: 9
Just let the bland abstractness wash over you and give in to the tidy strategic play...

(Upped this to a 9 Maybe a 10):  When I need a bland, nearly-luckless Euro fix, this where I go.  It has all the cube-pushing and barely pasted-on-theme goodness you could imagine without all the meaningless noisy distraction of excessive resource manipulation that seems so popular as of late.  It is also playable well under an hour, so doesn't overstay it's welcome.  It is distilled Euro par excellence.  *Cue "Bravo, Bravo!" and quiet, distinguished applause appropriate for a distinguished game such as this*  I still wish it had a theme that fit better with the mechanics and was more interesting.  But, then again, it would lose its bland Euro charm, I suppose.

Update (8):  conflict-heavy Euro that almost has a wargame feel.  Interesting gameplay developing.  Rating is going up as I accept and embrace the abstractness of the game.  This could become a favorite.

After first play (4):  Hansa Tuetonica is every bit as dense, abstract, unintuitive, dry, and derivative as its first impression.  I don't understand the buzz and hype at all.  The theme would be neutral at best, being yet another more or less medieval central European trading game.  Even worse the mechanics and rules really don't particularly suit the theme.  The rules are difficult to learn from reading them.  I think I would enjoy this more as a pure abstract, as the pasted-on theme is distracting and adds to the potential analysis paralysis for first time players.  There is just nothing that stands out except perhaps the blandness and unapproachability of this game.  Still, there's nothing quite like the rush of displacing a wooden colored cube or disc first thing in the morning.  So, perhaps upon further play I will revise my opinion.

A frustrating game, though I enjoy it as a four-player "quickie" quite a bit.  The frustration is the number of little rules which I always forget and this forgetfulness is exacerbated by a lousy first edition rule book.  As a two-player game, there are a lot better out there.

Great BGG rating BUT it's not primarily a family game (aka Gateway game) and therefore sub-ranked in the BGG Strategy game section. As such, it's a bland looking Euro, but garners a lot of positive comments (unfortunately, at times, requiring more than a few plays). That being said, it's not worth getting too quickly UNLESS it appears that it's moving out of print. There are far more welcoming games in the library that need to be played before justifying this purchase.

I knew I was going to like this game and after first play it was totaly confirmed. It is more than possible it will be ranked a 10 after a few more plays when I tried more strategies. 
What I really like is the amount of interactions and the numerous strategies for scoring points. What makes it a bit unik in the mechanism is that you really have to check out on the oponents strategies and block them and simultaneously keep up and redirct your ouw strategy in response of other players success in blocking you.

optimal balance between player interaction and scoring victory points
+ many paths to victory ; there are no preprogrammed victory paths ; everything depends on the moves of the other players. 
There are many player dependend bottle necks in this game ; are you going for the race for upgrade of actions, liber sophiae or kontors ? then another player will have an easy game with upgrading the 'sac' or keys, or he simply makes a chain of city's...
You have constantly be aware of what other players are doing.
This is for a large part a tactical game. 
But don't underestimate the strategical challenge ; do you prefer the city - bonus markers - Arnhem/Stendhal strategy ? this is rather slow.
Or do you like the  liber sophiae - Coellen combo ? faster but more risky...
scales very well for 3-5 players. Optimal with 3 of 5 players. Not tried with 2.
This is  essentially a race game ; upgrade as fast as possible your desired functions, place faster a merchant in Coellen or a kontor in a specific city than your opponents. 
- 
scripted opening turns ; for me not really a bad thing. In chess, the first 10 moves are usually preprogrammed.
Not really inventive mechanics , but the whole system is really better  than the sum of its parts.So who cares ?

Very clean, brilliant, elegant design and the game rocks. A lot of choices, strategy and tactics through all the game. I love that you see all the things at the board and do not have to remember card combos or things like that. Blocking mechanism is amazing. Different ways for scoring give you a lot of choices and even bonus tiles (the only random or semi random element of the game) are marvelous mechanism because it creates competition at the board. The momentum when you start build your VPes not skills is very important and because of seeing and possibility to influance end of the game is one of the greatest mechainisms. Great game.

Any new entry into the overcrowded niche of games revolving around cubes being pushed around on a map that depicts your choice of ancient egypt, medieval germany or renaissance italy has to have a pretty good excuse for its existence. Far as I can tell after two games played, Hansa Teutonica offers two things that are both fresh and, furthermore, very well implemented into the flow of the game.

First is the fact that judging the plans of your fellow players will not only allow you to hinder them, but if they should choose to overcome your hindrance, you will get a substantial reward for it (in the form of more cubes to push around, but I’ll stop the sarcasm now). This can even lead to the interesting dilemma where you’re torn between either just positioning a standard merchant cube into the path of your opponent - small hindrance, small reward - or one of your special super merchants with both bigger hindrance and reward, but the substantial risk that the opponent might forego that particular battle altogether, which means no reward at all. Nice.

Second are the three end conditions with their possibilities for prolonging or shortening the game. Whether you’d prefer one or the other probably depends on whether your strategy focuses on making quick victory points or first building your trading empire (i.e. tech up to push cubes better faster more). The two games I participated in developed in very different ways, but never felt just chaotic, and the biggest compliment for Hansa Teutonica might be that, although it is one of the most strategically open Eurogames I know, it never sprawls.

Played twice.

[b]First impression of the game?[/b]
To be honest, I was a little disappointed in this game after the first play. The group I taught it to seemed  bewildered by some of the mechanics and the array of scoring options. My friend Corey, a notoriously strong player, homed in on the extra actions and by the time everyone started playing aggressively, he had run away with the game. This is unfortunate because he has subsequently declared the game broken—which it is not. Needless to say it took several months before I was able to get this back on the table for another try, and I am happy to report: my disappointment was unfounded. This is a great game.

[b]What are the highlights?[/b]
This is a very tactical game. In the tradition of a El Grande, you need to react to the other players and the strategies they are pursuing. The game rewards clever play and each of the items on the escritoire are vital to success. This is a game you wish had a computer implementation so you could play it over and over to explore the different strategic paths.

[b]What are the drawbacks?[/b]
The game has been described as dry and abstract, but I just don't see that. The mechanics of the game give me a feeling of the cut-throat wheeling and dealing of a merchant network. The only drawback with game could possibly be the group you play with. This is a slugfest and players have to play aggressively in order for the game to really shine.

[b]Who would enjoy this game?[/b]
People who like games like El Grande, Keythedral or LaCitta, where you have to play aggressively and think on your feet.

[b]Who would [i]not[/i] enjoy this game?[/b]
This is a gamer's game, no doubt about it. Casual gamers wouldn't get past the explanation.

[b]Would you play this game again?[/b]
Yes. I think if you had a group that played this game often, you could bang out a game in an hour as an evening closer.

This game isn't horrible, but it's not compelling.  I particularly dislike the special tokens that players can pick up.  Of those, the kill 3 guys seems like the worst, as there is no real way to compensate for it.  Bleh.

I'm sure there are people who love that part of the game, since that is the only real random part to make one game different from another, but it takes a fairly strategic game and adds a layer of random tactical crap for me.

People throw around the phrase "pasted-on" theme.  I believe there are weak themes, but this is the one game that "pasted-on" fits.  Nothing you do correlates to the "theme".  And in turn, this game bores me... a lot.  If the game was nothing but shapes and colors, it would embrace it's abstract nature and I may actually enjoy it more.  But as it is, I do not enjoy playing.  

Still, it's not so painful that I'll refuse it. (especially since everyone I play games with seems to love this one.  I make my own fun and just block everyone constantly in this game.)

One of my favourite games that I don't play very often. I do have the Britannia expansion and this is excellent for the new two player rules. I haven't got the East expansion .... yet. I figured I need to play it a bit more regularly before I can justify getting that.

The game is great. Dry but great. It is no peaceful modern euro with us all moving our pieces and maximising our efficiency and slightly perturbing each other with minor denials of resources. No this is euro engine building warfare, albeit played out by placing merchants and traders on roads. Constantly battling for positions on routes, the game rewards deliberate blocking as you always get to reposition more numerously on the board in an adjacent route if you are knocked out.

It is great. If you don't like interaction, don't worry still try it. The interaction is so constant it becomes normal (I am not sure this is always a great advert for trying something!) and hardly feels overtly aggressive at all. You are always beneficially rewarded. So when you do knock someone out, smile sweetly, apologise to the other player, point out the benefits of them relocating and then gloat in your now control of that essential route!

Definate keeper. Probably in my top 10 games.

Stumbled upon the last copy of this at a FLGS on sale for 20€, thought why not and bought it. Has to be somewhat ok if it's in the top 100 of BGG. Well, it turns out I can't get enough of it. It's just a my kind of game. After the initial impressions I no longer care about the boring theme or dryish art, with these mechanics I would play this game no matter what it's about. 

Yeah, it's quite niche and not really fancy but I haven't played a game that works this well, ever. Every turn matters and downtime is nonexistent after a few games. Looking forward to picking up the expansions, they're quite cheap as well.

It's a bit more sandbox-y than I usually like (and I am TERRIBLE at it), but there's a high amount of interaction, and it actually seems viable to do different strategies. It also avoids the constant cube conversion that usually accompanies sandboxes, and the rules are relatively streamlined. It's an interesting game (despite the almost Euro-satire pasted-on theme) that I continue to think about after I play.

This was my favorite christmas present from my wife in 2012.  The extremely simplistic rules (once you actually get through them) combine into an incredibly deep experience.  I really recommend this for either 3 or 5 players as that's when the board is most 'full' as was intended.

EDIT: 04/04/13:
If you're thinking about buying this game then PLEASE read the FAQ and revised English rules.  We've been playing it for four months and only just realized that we were playing the Bonus Tokens completely 100% wrong.

EDIT 12/18/2013:
Having played the game a good dozen+ times now, each time the game is completely different, and strategies evolve from game to game.  There is no one winning strategy that I have found, and people usually form metas against the previous winning strategies.  I would love to get a regular group of Hansa T. players together to really explore the repeatability of the game.

Because of how great the gameplay is, I'll overlook the dry theme and that the rule book could be clearer and that it would really benefit from a consolidated summary reference card.

Egy játék alapján nagyon tetszett. Nagyon letisztult a játék dizájnja, azt hiszem erre mondják, hogy elegáns játék: kevés alkatrészből, viszonylag egyszerű szabályokkal hoz ki nagyon jó játékélményt. A grafika minimalista, a téma gyakorlatilag nulla, mégis mindezt ellensúlyozza a folyamatos interakcióra kényszerítő játékmenet. Folyamatos a döntéskényszer: a saját utamat/táblámat fejlesszem vagy másoknak tegyek keresztbe (úgy hogy közben egyidejűleg segítem is őket)? Mindezt jó eurogém módjára úgy, hogy az ember mindig úgy érzi, hogy mindig kevesebb akciója van, mint ami elegendő lenne ahhoz, hogy minden célt teljesítsen. Bármikor szívesen játszanék még vele.

Even though the game has little randomness built it, it plays differently every time as everyone plays it differently. Fun, but since other player actions can truly change things (even by accident) it can be hard to say pure strategy. It's different, and that's usually good. Good value price as well.

If they just placed a couple of spare little cubes into the box! Some bits must have fallen victim to the vacuum cleaner. But this is my only complaint.

I love this game.  It doesn't always make thematic sense, but the decisions are interesting and the game is deep.

I like playing the Britannia expansion.  The added dimension of requiring special privileges to play in Wales and Scotland breaks the board up and ensures that there is tension everywhere.  Essentially this creates a few game spaces where only a subset of the players are competing.

This game is quite different than any other I have tried.

To be blunt I am pretty horrible at it.  I seem to spend the entire game wandering through the mud lost and helpless.  In my last game I had all four routes available to score next turn.  By the time it came around to my next turn all of my tokens from that route had been removed.  Sure it meant I got a few more tokens on other routes but this is the kind of thing that frustrates me to no end.  I guess I am the game owner therefore I have TARGET written on my forehead.  The game feels cutthroat and normally that doesn't bother me.  For some reason it does in this one...

I found the game dry, repetitive, and frankly, dull. There was no "fun" factor at all. Oh, everything works, like a fine Swiss watch. But who wants to sit and stare as the hands go around on a watch for 1.8 hours?  I have no intention of playing it again.

I really like the player board mechanisms with different ways to improve what you can achieve on your turn; however, it's otherwise pretty dry. This is a shame as I was quite excited to try it out but, like Vasco da Gama, it turned out to be not what I'd hoped and a little bit disappointing. Having only played it once so far, I'll give it another chance as I'm often thrown when games aren't quite what I expect.

3 games played so far. I can't explain why I like this so much. Paper thin theme (think Torres), and a very tactical game, rather than strategic (ie. you need to watch other players, particularly the player following you extremely closely). I think it's something to do with the elegance of the design and the multiple approaches to victory. One of the few games I'll play back to back.

Fine game, works well, but has nothing to do with Hanseatic League.  Also, I am concerned that certain actions (like increasing your actions/turn) will be necessary to win, which limits your choices.  Plays very quickly, which is a plus.  My wife kicked my butt at it, so that's a good mark.

Favorite game of the 2010 Gathering of Friends.  Paths to victory are well balanced.

We discovered a serious flaw that caused the game to fall out of favor.  Intensely competitive players in one game, while costly, chose to deny invaders with only 2 actions from advancing on the extra action paths.  The blockers were still able to compete but the blocked players never gained a third action and were effectively eliminated.

I'll play this if someone brings it and wants to play it. It certainly doesn't have a place in my collection. It is definitely one of the drier Euros that I have played, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. I just don't find this particular puzzle to be interesting enough for me. Letting someone get away with gaining actions too fast is a big problem in this game and I don't like that my main goal is to prevent that from happening.

I am just not a big fan of worker placement games.  My first experience with this one was bad as the teacher had the rules all wrong plus changed them around while we were playing - of course he won.  How silly to attempt to feel superior by pounding noobs to a game.

The second experience was with a better teacher and I finished a close second.  Still didn't do anything for me as it is worker placement and the bad taste from the first time was still there.

*Sept 2012* Finally! A pure Euro in my collection! Why doesn't the guy on the box rejoice in my feeling of completeness?

*Jan 2013* Finally! Got to play it! One game, 4 players. It's brilliant. Perfectly balanced, 0.001% luck, deep. Tons of ways to score points and they're all tugging you into different directions. This game felt almost chess-like, and some of my opponents called it an "Agricola killer" which, while the two games are very different, I can totally see. It's got the tense VP building of Gric but without the frustrations of the harvest! Excellent game....

Only issue with it is that it's not the kind of game I see on my shelf and am excited to play. Once the decision to play is made, that's when the excitement starts. More of a reflection on my self than the game, but it gets an 8 after one play. Will probably go up, game looks like it is a keeper!

Tons of paths to victory in this euro with a board of Hanseatic League territories.  You play your wooden cubes and discs in houses along several paths between cities in order to fill up and claim the entire path, thereby gaining an advantage from one of the adjacent cities.  Very nice competition with three, with gamers readily dissolving into outright comparison of VP generation strategies.  Could see how the number of different VP generation ideas lends itself well to re-playability.

Thanks to a friend who requested to play this, I finally got around to giving this a try. I really liked it and am looking forward to playing with more than two players. The rules and actions make it seem extremely dry and slow but in fact it was rather dynamic and fun. The different activities come together in a nice way, not as in certain other games (looking at you, Orleans). While there may be a lot of blocking (and interaction!) there seem to be enough different useful things (skills, bonus markers, east-west connection, network) to do. I did enjoy the opportunistic style of play that arises from this, especially perhaps through the old two-player rules (only region adjacent to special pawn can be interacted with except teleportation).

Update: With five players the game dragged a little and there sometimes seemed to be too little space. Well, we were also essentially inexperienced so maybe better play can fix it.

Clever game. At first glance, simple route builder with some take-that. But a deeper look reveals leeching off others. Establish an office on a popular route for steady point income. Spread blockers across the board and encourage your opponents to displace you, populating nearby routes with free traders from your stock. It's a game where you really play your opponents rather than just the mechanics. Seems good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The interesting elements of controlling key offices and blocking routes in order to "tax" other players is overshadowed by a typical euro worker placement feel. The actions upgrade and the coellen bonuses are vastly more important than taking a strategically positioned office, which is disappointing. Clever blocking doesn't matter so much near the end when players have many actions and can move many pieces. The game arc of first upgrades then points also has the standard euro feel. The point salad scoring seems unnecessary. I don't see the reason for rewarding players with 5 actions with yet 4 more points.

Played twice.  A super-complicated game that has a million cool things to do in it, only some of which get you points.  While I love the diversity of things to do, and the many, many paths one can take to victory, I seem to have a total mental block on how to get points in this damn game.  In my first two games I had brilliant strategies that left me about 6 turns away from scoring a few gazillion points when the game ended.

One thing I'm finding is that I don't particularly like how the game ends immediately upon one person getting 20 in-game points.  It seems relatively easy for a person to build up to getting points quickly, making all other strategies fail (with no easy way to counter it).  Until I see a game end without someone getting a ton of in-game points quickly (before, say, network strategies can take off), I'm not too enamored.

1 play.  Not at all what I was expecting.  People said it was like Endeavor or Goa.  Well, only the tech tree seems a bit similar.  A lot more confrontational then I was expecting.  I was fairly confused to try to get a strategy going until about half way through but in the end I won by only a couple points.  I finished on my turn connecting the two red cities.  Also had the 11 point spot in the lower left corner, and a number of offices where you get more actions which collected during the early part of the game.  That seemed to be where I got most of my points.  Felt like it easily could have gone to someone else with only slight changes.  Interesting.  I'm not sure I love it but it's different than anything else I've played.  I have nothing with which to compare it. I really need to try this again.  I like that I'm still thinking about it a lot, pondering the many strategies that could lead to victory.

The folks at BGG Con said it was good, so, as a dedicated conformist, I had to give it a try at the Minneapolis Board Game Marathon in February.

The cover of this game actually attracted me to it, but it turned out to be very different from what I expected. Not an economic game at all. Basically an abstract game with a rather pasted-on theme, but that does not matter at all. OK, so it is a cube-pushing game, but it is tight and suspenseful, and players get in each others' way all the time. You always want to do more than you can, every move is beneficial, but which move to choose? And which of the other players shall I deplace? Will they let me alone?
Great fun for 60-90 minutes.

Interesting game which ends before you can really get the engine to drive your strategy built. Some games leave you wishing for extra actions each turn, this game leaves you wishing for it to continue for a few more rounds.
Most of the action is limited to specific areas of the boards where the beneifts are greatest in the early rounds, leading to a fair amount of conention between players.
A good theme and mechanics which could have been more effectively implemented.
After a second play, I am concerned that the game can suffer from runaway leader issues. Rating adjusted.

This is a solid Euro game.  Which is both good and bad.  The game has good decisions with multiple paths to victory, and seems balanced.  The game is also an abstract with a pasted on theme, which is very weak, and one that I don't care for at all.  It is the poster child for the phrase "cube pusher".  I've seen enough of this type of game, and have had my fill.  I own several cube pushing type games, and would rather play them instead of this game.  So, although I wouldn't have any issue playing this game again, I also wouldn't be requesting it at the game table either.

This game just isn't for me. I see the quality here, but it definitely has that dry, chess-like feel to it. You do the same old tedious actions over and over again, dancing around what you're trying to do and hoping your opponents don't pick up on it, and all the while you're laying down cubes to progress these artificial developments that give this game a sense of progression. This game feels dated, dry, and clunky, which is really disappointing because this game has so many qualities I do like (route-building, getting points through a variety of ways, room for creative play, etc.). This is about the closest thing to multiplayer Chess, and it feels every bit as boring.

Hansa Teutonica incorporates many elements I like in boardgames. There is worker placement, where you have to beat the other players to attractive positions on the map. There is connection, where you have to build a trade network. There is area control, where you have to control cities. There is an economic engine, where you constantly have to decide which abilities to improve next. Add to that the ability to displace other players' workers that not only costs you a worker but also gives the other player an extra worker.

All this is accomplished through very few components (a map, plenty of cubes and some markers) and very swift actions (place cubes to connect and remove cubes to unlock abilities) that makes the gameplay quick and streamlined.

Hansa Teutonica has much in common with other great games like Power Grid and El Grande but in a more compressed and approachable format. A game of Hansa Teutonica is simply a delightful experience full of challenging decisions and cutthroat interaction.

Bone dry cube pusher. Missing anything resembling fun. Couldn't wait for it to be over and won't be playing again. One of the few games I've ever played were I felt compelled to announce that I hated the game 3/4's of the way through.

In old Europe, one is trying to establish trading posts to build offices or upgrade their skills. After getting all their markers between a city, a player may choose to occupy a city, or upgrade. Each player starts with a mat that outlines 5 skills and during the game, earns more cubes and skills as they upgrade their various abilities. There are various ways to score points, including earning bonus markers , occupying cities or connecting cities. 

This is a good game, with many tough choices to make.
Do you focus on skills? Trying to build a road net? The only drawback of this game is people can block you, fairly or unfairly, or they can displace your cubes. Sometimes being targeted can feel unfair, but it is part of the game. 

The two player game introduces a pawn so that players can only take actions where the pawn is located. It's a bit artificial to get interaction, and would not recommend the 2 player game.

Awesome sandbox that plays out so differently each time after the first few moves. Only thing I wish was the theme was cooler and the cities that did improvements could be randomized, rather than the same city with the same improvement in the same area each time. I also wonder a bit about the action track and how good that is for the game. Wish the back of the player boards had different numbers to change the game a bit and some things about bonus markings and cities rulings could be clearer and rulebook better, but still love the game very much. So interactive yet mostly not destructive and just a ton of thinkiness and fun.

But regardless, excellent, excellent game and would love to play again.

My rating has changed from 6 to 4 after the second play. I don't know why but I thought the game was somewhat interesting when I played it for the first time. Now I tried it again and it is just not my type of the game. Everyone needs more actions in the beginning and it is sort of luck whether you can claim action route or not as it is very expensive to knock other people's cube. Also a lot of points seem very unbalanced.

After one play, I don't think I have enough of a handle on this game to assign a rating to it.  However, it is quite obvious that there should be more ways to increase your number of actions per turn.  A player who gets shut out of that particular race can expect to be left in the dust for the remainder of the game;  the game's rather shoddy solution to this is that it's farily easy for a player in the lead to force the whole thing to end before it really feels like it's gotten under way.  I probably won't play this again.  After Heart of Africa, Italia, and now Hansa Teutonica, Andreas Steding is on my DWGSBAWT ("Designers Whose Games Should Be Approached With Trepidation") list.

Based on one play, this has a lot to like. There seems to be many different paths to try with just enough player interaction to make things interesting. ***UPDATE*** A second playing has soured me on the game somewhat. I see way too much of a rich-get-richer thing at play and knew from about 5 minutes in that the game had been lost (it was - the leader won by over 30 points). The game is too boring (there really is only one thing to do in the game, which is place cubes) to warrant being out of it in the early going. There's also terrible downtime with 5. I will play again, but I don't see this being a favorite and could easily drop much lower in the ratings.

Nice middle-weight game offering a lot of choices. Strategical and not only tactical. And after some small perplexities for people that don't like "hard" games in the first game, it goes very smooth. My eight years old daughter plays it without problems.

UPDATE March 2013
Lowered the rating to 7 because recently games have appeared that somehow have a similar feeling (simple rules and deep play, not long to play etc.) that I do prefer much more because they offer deeper and more strategical and interesting choices (i.e. Terra Mystica or The great Zimbabwe)

I remember enjoying playing this game.  In Hansa Teutonica there are many paths to victory and all of them seem very appealing to try out, extending replayability.  The mechanics for conflict are interesting because the person being attacked can make it beneficial for them to get attacked.  At first glance it does not seem like a very deep game because the rules are not overly complicated, but after playing you will start to notice how deep and interesting the game is.  The fact that it can do this in an hour is a huge plus. 

This is a really great game and I can't wait to give it more plays.

Such an interactive euro - Knife fight in a phone booth is an apt metaphor. However, the game would fall flat if all players do no play in the spirit in which it is meant to be played - aggressive and blocking others to further your own ends. 

This is not a typical Euro - but that's a good thing.

Played this once and found it really boring, and it ended too quickly. But I probably need to play it several more times to truly appreciate it, specifically the "so many things to do / so many ways to win" aspect. Puerto Rico, one of my faves, can end too quickly also, depending. Neverthless, I tend not to favor the path-building games.
--------
It was better the second time, although both times I managed to get several rules wrong. I don't think it was because of this, but the two games I played seemed quite different in terms of where the tensions occurred. This suggests that plays vary a great deal depending on which strategies the players employ.

Seriously, put this passive-aggressive optimization exercise in a bag and throw it in a river.  I spent most of the game constantly denied the opportunity to actually DO anything, as nonsensical bidding wars for the movement track neutered me to a virtual standstill. Everyone else said what a great job I did (I was three points out of 1st place).  No one could understand why only having 2 actions for easily 75% of the game was a negative play experience.

And I think that's the problem.  Somewhere along the way to creating a robust Euro-esque exercise in partially claiming routes for Spain, sissy-fight style, someone forgot what fun looked like.  In its place is a whole bunch of middle-aged guys telling you where the best move on the board is, while they cock-block the best moves on the board for 90 straight minutes and the only remaining moves are fairly obvious to anyone who can read at a 5th-grade level, all while staring at a board that even without pieces gives me a headache.

When people talk about not enjoying Euro games, this is Exhibit A.  It's not broken; it does exactly what it says it will do.  It's 90 minutes of playing defensive billiards, which is about 75 minutes too long and saps whatever fun could be had straight into the garbage can.  I haven't hated a game this hard in a while.

The workers are boring cubes or discs, but the concept of pushing an opponent's workers out of the way at the expense of giving workers to the opponent helps to make this game more interesting than it would appear at first glance.

Sort of a souped-up version of Thurn and Taxis, this is a very brain-burny route-collection and engine building game, rewarding optimisation. There are just too many things to do and no time to do them in.

It is a little on the dry side, but that never stopped me before.

I always feel like I'm doing terribly, but perhaps that's because I always am doing terribly. I generally go for upgrading, but perhaps a bit too much; I always pivot to gaining points too late.

It's an action point game at heart, so I like it already. It's about optimizing your engine. I think going for extra actions is the thing to do, doesn't matter if you have to pay more at the beginning, you need to get them. Don't underestimate the power of the tiles.

RATING: 7.75
The rules are deceptively simple; but before the rules, the theme is also deceptive. When you read the manual, all the mechanics make sense in the commerce theme, but when you get to play it, the theme goes away and the game feels totally abstract. 

At the other side of its boring cover, the game is not as simple as it seems. It features many, many ways to victory. Unlike other similar games, you feel totally lost in the first game: you are not sure what to do to in order to maximize your chances at winning, and you don't have enough experience to follow what your opponents are doing. The game features heavy interaction, you will be constantly messing with each other plans and if you disregard one opponent, you might discover your mistake when its already too late.

The other most enthralling feature of this game is its lenght: ¡only 1 hour or less!

A bit mixed feelings about the game. In general Hansa Teutonica is type of a game I usually like much but gameplay is at least as much about blocking your opponents game as it is building your own position - a thing I just don't generally like too much in games. Blocking seems mandatory part of the game because you both slow down your opponents and gain extra resources by doing so. There is also a small king maker effect because those who are being pushed around most gain extra resources from it. This whole back & forth dancing with blocking is what bothers me most about in game. All important routes seem to be in constant state of battle. 

Update (30.5.2010): I decided to increase my rating from 7 to 8 after a few more games even though I seem to have love/hate relationship with this game. Good game with 3-5 players. Haven't tried (and probably never will) 2 player game.

Update (1.11.2010): Math traded away since the game is one of those that are best when played with pretty stable group (or at least everyone knows game rather well) and there was too much hate towards the game in my regular group. (And I had personal issues too. One of the better games I've let go.)

At first sight this seems to be quite prone to group think but once you get past the urge to overvalue the action track, you'll find it's a finely tuned and brilliant design. 

There are way too many ways of scoring for me to have any chance of winning but that does not make the game any less tempting. I'm usually wary about complete lack of random elements in the setup, but so far that has not become a problem with this game.

The graphics are great. The English rules are needlessly cumbersome and likely to confuse readers; The original German rules are a lot clearer.

Theme? Pah, look elsewhere. This a cube-shuffler of the highest magnitude. But what a beauty. Agonising decisions, multiple paths to victory, player interaction, elegance, scalable, (even a shifty looking guy on the front cover); it's got all the clichés covered and more. You're not just maximising points, you really do have to play the other players - often aggressively. None of this sticking to a rigid formula - you need to consider everyone else around the table, see where the game is heading and take advantage of the situations that arise. Brilliant.

Gran bel gioco, ho avuto la sensazione che le partite durassero poco, o meglio che non mi dessero il tempo di ultimare le mie strategie; probabilmente bisogna solo selezionare abilmente quella che si intende perseguire. Mi da comunque l'idea che il tabellone venga utilizzato solo parzialmente e, anche se è un gioco da 'picchiare l'avversario' secondo me prende rende quasi di più farsi un solitario in qualche bordo tabellone. Un gioco che mi fa pensare a diverse possibili strategie. Da approfondire ma mi piace assai.

Great little engine-building cube-pushing eurogame. And I say that with all fondness. Like Caylus, it has some slight randomness (in the bonus markers), but other than that, there is no luck present; just your strategy against your opponents' strategies.

I have not spent enough time analyzing to be confidence in knowing if some or most of the seemingly endless variety of strategic paths are viable or not. There's a lot you can do in this game, and you can spend your time spinning wheels or you can spend it being productive. It's hard to see which is which without giving it some thought.

Upgrading to a 10, as this game has clearly entranced me.

[2010/02/08]

So far I've played this twice, 1st time no-one had played... second time only I had played... In both scenarios I played with gamers...

Immediately after my first game, everyone wanted to play again (we didn't, but we could have)

It's very hard to describe Hansa Teutonica... on my second play I taught the game, and I did great for teaching it... but i still wasn't able to describe it. So without describing the game to you, here is my opinion... I really reall really enjoy this game... This is only my second "newer game" I've rated above a 9... eveyone i've played with really really really enjoys this game too... there are a lot of options, and the game self regulates via "blockage" in the same manor that auctions self regulate...

the only downside I saw so far is that this game didn't encourage much player discussion or chatter.... so your not going to have as much banter as you might in other games...


Turns are exceptionally fast (or should be)... and this game rolls like butta... there can be a few move where you need to think extra hard... but not many... in most cases when it gets to be your turn you already have your turn mapped out...and if everyone does that, then you've hit the sweet spot (hense the little talking due to everyone watching everyone elses moves constantly)


HIGHLY RECOMENDED - For gamers only


I'm excited to play again... I'm hoping that this game doesn't wear out or get predictable.

I really like this game.  I think it's moderately simple and I really appreciate how fast turns go by.  It is as cutthroat as the players make it, and I appreciate that sort of flexibility in a game, simply awesome.

In this instance, I also really enjoy the many multiple paths to victory.  The openness is so great, strategy almost seems opaque at first.  I like a game that needs to be "courted" in order to discover it's hidden "charms".

Interesting choices and it seems like there are multiple paths to victory. The extra action route is highly contested.

I like this game but not as a 2-player. Needs more plays with more players, but I do not like it as a 2-player game at all! I almost feel like removing the soldiers, so that I could get around the board more freely...otherwise the game feels like it is subject to runaway leader syndrome! I find the board, mechanics and game play interesting and think it will definitely be a better experience with more players. This is a good example of a game that maybe shouldn't have been marketed for 2-player capability!

With 3 players this game plays much much better...I knew it would. Still needs more plays.

LOVED the flexibility and multiple strategies.  Gaining points from others' actions is enjoyable.  

We were giving points for each office on routes during our first two games and wondered why the game went so fast.  Caught that mistake and really enjoyed this.  Plenty of strategies to try out.

Now, we almost always take longer at games than the power gamers who post about them.  However, we have found Hansa Teutonica passes very quickly for us.  There are individual turns where someone deliberates between various good moves, but our games are taking 45-90 minutes, depending on player count.  All of the one space cities on the 2-3 player board causes that one to fill up more quickly.  And it feels short too, which is a good thing.  We get depth, variety, and strategy, but it's fast enough that we feel like playing another game afterward.  

In our games, the first few all ended because of points.  Now it's a race between points and cities, with bonus markers also a factor if we have more than 2 and someone focuses on them a little bit.

Wow! I didn't imagine I would like this game as much as I did! On its face, Hansa Teutonica looks heavy, esoteric and not very fun. But the clarity and simplicity of the actions, the swiftness of the turns and the development of different strategies, all make the game one of my favorites. The best part of the game, I've noticed, is the discussion of different strategies, post-game. For some, it's to focus on upgrading actions, for others it's about getting "displaced" by other players to allow for more options. It doesn't work like a lot of Euros; the game itself is so malleable, so open to other players' strategies whereas, normally, the strategy is one-track and too boring. Hansa, thankfully, eliminates all that in its design. Wonderful game.

Very dry game of cube placement, aiming to own all the cube spaces between 2 towns so as to either earn the tech tree improvement offered by the town or place an ownership marker in the town to earn VPs. Tech tree improvements include extra actions each turn, increased cube replenishment rate, more merchants (souped up cubes), etc. There's lots of ways to score points in the game, so it's a matter of finding a strategy that doesn't have competition and being strict about it. There's not a lot of tension but there's enough pussage in the game (a la special action chits and blocking moves) to keep things interactive enough. In fact one of the issues I have with the game is that if players are too intensely focussed on playing blocking moves so as to get bonus cubes out (when the blocks are subsequently dislodged), the game can become one of constant denial and frustration at not being able to make progress. This has made one game particularly unenjoyable, enough to lower the rating and turn me off playing for a while. Anyway, with limited actions, turns go quickly enough so that downtime isn't an issue. Not sure I'd ever want to play this with more than 3 again given you want to keep it pacy. The game doesn't make me come alive due to its repetitive nature (placing cubes over and over again), but it at least works well, it provides a nice mental workout and there seems to be lots of different scoring strategies to explore.

Played this for the first time Saturday.  I am VERY impressed with the game, and would love to play it again.  It's got enough player interaction to keep the screw-your-neighbor person interested.  It's got enough in-depth strategy and tactics to keep the big-picture player going, and it's got enough interesting ideas to keep you hungry for more, and decide what tactics you're going to use NEXT game!  :)

After massive rules confusion, a decent first time play for 3P. Do yourself a favor and have someone explain the game to you that knows how to play, or, if you are teaching yourselves, throw the ruleset in the trash and download the revised rules here. Far far easier to understand then the rules that come in the box. 

Seriously, WTF.

Excellent game once you get past this. Kinda point salady, but I think there is a lot of room to play on this map.

This is the only game I played at Essen I won't give any rating yet did play some rules rightout wrong and we didn't like at all what happened in our gaming experience. I hadn't the time to dig any deeper and will give a proper vote when I really can play this game. Not bought.
Update: Finally played a game again. Not a full game again, because I had to leave early. This time everything maked much more sense and the game starts to shine. Will definitely play this again and than give it's proper rating.
Update: Finally I played a full game and this time everything clicked. This was a fun experience. The game is well thought out and has some great ideas. Definetly a game that can be explored with additional plays.
Update: I can't get myself to play this again. So this game for me will probably stay on a very personal note a 7

2 plays - Initial rating quite high. The interactivity in this game is what makes it great. While you might not be able to do exactly what you want on your turn, you can block someone else's path nearby and be rewarded when they kick you out. Building an engine is satisfying and you ultimately see your rewards, as your engine allows you to navigate and interact with the map, giving you a variety of strategies to pursue.  

I'm not sure if repeated plays will increase or decrease my rating, but initial plays make this very promising!

A standard cube placing Euro where you have to fight with others in order to claim routes to gain points or to upgrade your player board so that your actions get better. The game is very well laid out and for the Euro lovers out there (like me) it is excellent and there are many routes to victory. Player interaction is key, so make sure to keep your eye on your opponents.

I have not come across a single person that I have introduced this game to who hasn’t liked it a lot. I think that says it all for a game with very little theme and ‘interesting’ art (some of my friends actually like it!). It is the core mechanics that make this game so good, the displacement mechanic is brilliant and leads to a lot of interesting tactical blocking, as well as bluffing so that other players help you achieve your goals.

There are also a number of different strategies that are viable and the whole tempo of the game is run by the players themselves, with three ways for the game to end all being actions that players can choose to do, or not. This game is a keeper.

RATING: 5
Way too many interlocking hoops you have to jump through to get anything done.  Also, the more mechanisms you have in a game, the more you need some semblance of a theme tying it together to at least make some sense of what you are doing.  This game does not have enough of anything to tie together what you are doing.  It is far more frustration than fun.

A euro that was more interactive than I had feared (hearing it was a euro where we were focusing on making offices and trade routes, I figured it would be very solitaire and boring).

This game centers around a Goa-esque tech track, but instead of a once-around auction, it features route-claiming on a map.  The game is very dynamic, as pieces are constantly being added to, moved around, and removed from the board.  You never feel stuck or hemmed in as in other connection games, as you can always remove an opponent's piece from a route; however this costs you extra cubes and lets that opponent place even more cubes on the board (albeit in less advantageous positions).  I only have a few minor quibbles with this game: the "actions" track is too strong, and I wish the board gave more indication graphically of which ability was related to which route.

A couple of 4-players some time ago. Rating still stands. Solid game

***

One 3-player as well now. Quite a different game, arguably better but not enough to warrant a raise. Brainburner as I wrote below, guess that playing this on 5 with AP-phrone players could be a nightmare.

***

Hard to rate: Just 2 2-payer games so far, and I can see why others at BBG doesn't recommend this as a 2-player.

But I really like the un-locking of abillities and the beatiful board with a proper map - it prevents this rahter dry game from beeing to alienating.

Some say Hansa Teutonica is nothing like Thurn & Taxis at all, but it acutally is. But its also longer, meaner, meatier and much more of a brainburner.

Cant wait to try this our with more players around the table. My guess is that my rating will rise and this game will prove to have - in contrast to Thurn and Taxis - a "Ticket to Ride:ish"-replayabillity.

Themeless cube shuffling. While the various ways to win are cool to have in this game, the scoring system is way too opaque for me - I have played two games so far: in first I felt like I was doing well but ended up being last, the second time I felt I was not doing too well, but won the game.

Solid game.  I was concerned being too abstract and having too many cubes, however those fears were unfounded.  The game played quickly, provided many different scoring options, had good strategies, and most importantly, had surprisingly good interaction with its blocking mechanic.  I had fun.

While I like quick games, I felt it ended way too early.  It seemed to end when people's engines were taking place.  Also, the player boards should be "more intuitive" for newbies.

So so Dry and yet the mechanics are fun. The game can feel fairly abstract. The theme feels very much pasted on (the re-themes I've seen only prove the point). It's a good thing the play is so good otherwise this would be rated much lower for me. 

Hansa seems like it would be boring and it looks boring but it's far from boring. Even Tom Vassal who is admittedly burned out on "boring brown games" had to acknowledge that it was surprisingly good. Each time I've played so far, the game has turned out quite different. 

I do wonder why these kinds of game choose the most boring, dull, and uninteresting box art in existence to represent them? Don't get me wrong some of them have great Renaissance era styled art, but others are just a bad joke. Hansa's art falls into this category.

For a long time I thought this was an extremely deep strategic game, because I couldn't figure out a strong-sounding strategy or even identify a good move for most of the game.

Eventually I concluded that this game is mostly about screwing people over (by placing your dude where they want to go), but it's subtle enough that people tend to not notice and to think they're playing a strategy game.

Based on one play of a five-player game, it seems like the real strategy here is to be the first to pick up more actions. I wasn't in the fight for actions and finished dismally. Maybe with additional plays additional strategies would emerge, but I wasn't intrigued enough to find out.

I'm so sick of these garbage. This is not a game, it feels like work, I'm not even kidding...60 minutes, yeah right !! It took us 3 freaking hours, such a pain to endure.

RATING: 7
Very interesting game with many different strategies and ways to score points. What sets Hansa Teutonica apart from other multiple-path games, though, is its high level of player interaction. This is done by rewarding players to block each other. So you can follow a strategy over the long term, but from turn to turn you're mostly tactically reacting to other players. You're making moves and counter-moves, not only to hinder your opponents, but also to develop your actions and get more cubes on the board, which you can then use to pursue your long-term goal.

It is very open. You can do whatever; everything you do is worth points. And if you really focus on something and you aren't stopped, then you'll likely win. Of course you will be stopped, especially when your opponents catch on to what you're trying to accomplish. Hindering you also helps them. So you need to be flexible, and try to find out where the openings are, but you also have to commit at some point to score a lot of points in any one area.

I love how the rules that tell you what to do are very simple. You only have five possible actions, and they're all really generic: get cubes, place a cube on a free spot on a route, place on an occupied spot, move from one spot to another, or claim a route and remove the cubes. And you keep doing this until an end-of-game trigger. That's it. But there are so many different places to put your cubes, it feels like the possibilities are endless.

Hansa Teutonica is a great game for people who like to get a lot of plays out of a game. There's so much to explore, and which strategies are winning really depends on what the other players are doing. It also means that if you play this only occasionally, it can feel a bit all over the place.

This lack of focus stops me from rating it higher than an 7; I like tight games with clear boundaries and objectives. And I move on quickly to games that I haven't played for a long time, rather than sticking to one game for multiple plays. But if this ever gets an online version, or if my group requests this a lot, and with more plays I start getting a more complete picture of all the different strategies and everything else that's going on, I expect my rating to go up. For an occasional play it's a little too open and unbounded. Also, if players don't really know what they're doing, they can easily throw the game to someone by giving them many points or not blocking when they should.

I also don't like it with 3 (and I hear 2 is worse). The problem with three players is that in Hansa Teutonica blocking and getting displaced is extremely strong. Much stronger than doing your own thing and letting the others fight it out; you need to be involved. The defense to blocks is not taking the bait and go elsewhere, but there's one track where that's not an option: the extra action city track. It's too strong to let someone have it, so there will be a stalemate. The 'remove 3' bonus tile breaks it, which is why there'll probably also be a stalemate to get that tile. The 'opening game' will be half an hour of stalemate after stalemate without anyone getting anywhere. When the stalemates get broken, and two players get the extra action, they can easily keep the third player from ever getting it too, and the game will at that point be over for that person. So for them the game will be a frustrating opening followed by a frustrating end game without ever really getting to play.

The fix is probably really simple, though: let everyone start with the extra action. Four/five players play on a different board, where there are two tracks that give an extra action, so I doubt there will be much of a problem there.

Quick-ish, too.

A route building game where the road part of the route clears once it's completed allowing multiple players to score points and claim connected rewards over the same route. Certain routes unlock better versions of your actions as you remove tokens from your board and add them to your available route tokens. When you complete a route, you have the opportunity to place a token in one of the two towns the route connected which can score you points each time it's completed after that. Not only that, but there are endgame points for controlling contiguous cities with area-control style majority control rules.

Some of the important routes in the base game map get a little cluttered and hard to complete. I highly recommend playing with the Eastern expansion map if you can, but if not, the base game is ultimately fine.

Not a difficult game to play but the decisions are not easy and multiple playings might be required to really grasp the strategic flow and optimization. In the event, our game ended rather quickly and the game play felt only half developed.

Update: Sadly dropped 2 points as increasing actions is too important, as in Agricola, so that players either get left behind (me) or go into a cycle of bumping each other which only increases the power of both players. No one can adequately teach this game as convoluted interactions and too muted iconography make this a mish-mash of options bordering on incoherence; rules reading and study of the board would be  essential.  The 5 rating is still generous as I'm unlikely to ever play this thing again.

European route-building game.  Nothing that particularly distinguished it for me, other than the actions mechanic.  As you progress through the game, you can upgrade a number of aspects of your play; more points for long routes, more flexibility, and more actions.  Taking more actions can not only give a player points, and the ability to do more things total than other players; it also gives them more room in terms of routes and not being blocked.  Starting out, everyone gets 2 actions.  If one player goes for actions, everyone probably should -- the words arms race come to mind.  Otherwise, one player is taking 5 actions for every 2 by everyone else; in addition they get those five actions in a row, making them much more difficult to block or interfere with in any way.

I have played alot of euros over the past couple of years... and though I am far from being an expert gamer (and I have yet to play 10% of the games out there), I believe that Hansa Teutonica is quite unique and refreshing (granted, I have yet to play Endeavor).  I've played the 5-player, 4-player game and the 2-player game, and every time, I felt the gameplay was excellent.  

The bits were not too fiddly (everything can be setup in under 3 minutes), and after awhile, the flow just seemed natural.  I'm excited to play this again and discover more strategies, combos and nuances to the game.

I've enjoyed this one, I like the network building is integrated with worker placement. The placement activities can be interactive as you can block and get additional resources at the same time. Also like how the game clock is based on victory points allowing players to manipulate placements and the end of the game. 

I also like how development of your personal board releases resources and provides you with more flexibility, but only a few board locations allow for that development. The network on the board can't be ignored either since it scores significant points at the end of the game. The players have to be quite competitive to get items unlocked and to start the network construction.

Absolutely brilliant, easy to learn, easy to play and very hard to figure out how to proceed to victory.

Upgrade the game rate because the game mechanics are really good.

I frequently refer to this as "the best game I've gotten rid of," but I wonder if that's because I have so badly whiffed on a lot of purchases, despite initial enthusiasm and that "this game is [i]really[/i] going to work for my group, just you wait and see" vibe that one gets after spending too much time without a functioning filter in the recommendation forums here at BGG (where everyone eventually gets Lords of Waterdeep as a recommendation). 

Hansa Teutonica has a shared map for some semblance of network building (albeit not permanent, as you remove your presence from the board once you've finished a route), though you're mainly trying to improve several different personal abilities on your player board, which is a sort of...Merchant Ability Tracker? It's highly abstracted, and that counts as a virtue in my world. You can interfere with other players, you can block them. It's not fully a "diddle with your own player board" Euro. But it is still partially a Board Diddler. 

It was very dry, the official 2p variant was awful, and the longer the game goes, the more the player paths diverge until the end sees everyone doing their own thing, cranking on their own personal strength(s), and tallying points. I think this got the interest that it did because interaction has become almost wholly absent from the Eurogameworld, and any little flicker of it causes people to get tingly with glee.

Nov 2017: Played this again with a bunch of Wallace fans. The game totally bombed despite the fact of all players totally understanding all the game's concepts. I think it's because there's a thematic and visual contradiction between what the game looks like (a map with routes connecting cities) and what you're actually doing with your cubes.

Sep 2017: This game rubbed me the wrong way. I think it's because of this: it looks like a network building game, but it's actually a worker placement game. 

It's clever that it reduces workers, contract and building cards, resources, and money to only cubes and a separate player boards to keep track of engines.

At least there are not too many rules or special power cards.

Much, much lighter than I expected. And way, way more tactical than expected as well. I thought players would scatter their cubes all over the board, almost like Go. Instead, players focus on the special powers, then once their engines are up and running, they start spreading across the board.

Luckily, the person who explained the rules to Hansa Teutonica is very good at explaining rules or I would have been utterly lost.  That said, I was not very good at Hansa Teutonica.  Sometimes, when I am horrible at a game it chases me away and I do not want to play.  More often though, my lack of skill only fuels my desire to play a game again.  That is certainly the case with Hansa Teutonica.  It's got many aspects I really enjoy in a game.  First, it has a ton of different paths to victory.  There are so many that it is really overwhelming at first.  I am sure tha I didn't remember all of the different ways to score points during my first play.  It is important to interfere with the other players' strategies while having your own defined strategy.  Hansa Teutonica is a tightrope of a game with almost limitless possibilities. 

***Update***

I raised my rating when I realized how similar Hansa Teutonica is to one of my other favorite games: Notre Dame.  Like Notre Dame, there are almost limitless possibilities for strategies.  Also, what other players do affects which strategies will be the most effective.  I've been searching for a game that scratches the same itch as Notre Dame and I've found it in Hansa Teutonica.  For that reason, I give Hansa Teutonica a nine!

***Update***

I raised my rating to a ten.  I play this game all the time.  It's fantastic.

Very clever game about route building and controlling areas. Maximise the number of actions you get, plus the potential bonuses, and other areas that pertain to cube placement to make the most of your turns.

Clever use of blocking to gain the benefits that come with an opponent removing your cube is a useful tactic ... but it will no doubt be used in return!

Really enjoy this game.

This game balances of the razor thin line of well-designed and completely broken.  An awkward mix of nearly perfect information/control and a few random/chaotic elements to pollute the entire experience.

Now this is my kind of engine building game. Knowing which upgrades to go for first can change based on your opponents actions, so you need to be able to adjust on the fly. This doesn't played as often as I would like since it's a bit dry and has basically zero theme, but this is a fine example of a strategy game that isn't distracted by any bells and whistles. Pure euro.

Upgraded my rating from a mid-8 to 9.7.

Yes, it is JASE(just another souless Euro). So what? How much "soul" does some heavily-themed, kill-or-be-killed Ameritrash epic have without real blood and the smell of singed flesh??

All theme is vanity. Vanity!!

The questions:

1) Does it make you think?

2) Do you have to react to others?

3) Is it any damn fun??

Hansa T. is all that to me.  It requres the utmost of my concentration on the subject at hand, and yet, I must respond to my opponents' subtle strategies.

Hard for me to conceive of a game closer to a '10' rating.

RATING: 10
It's hard to imagine anyone doing a better area-control game than this. For me, Bruxelles 1893 is (possibly) as good and I think both 'scratch a very similar itch'.

It is a really clever game with a short-ish rulebook and few components - but a lot of depth. It is wonderfully un-fiddly, 'immediate' and very interactive.

Essentially you are just putting your cubes and discs down onto the game map in ways that delay other players and set up scoring opportunities, including establishing permanent little emplacements called 'offices'. At the same time you are expanding your options and refining your strategy by levelling-up skills on your player board.

Multiple 'game end' conditions mean players can accelerate or delay when it ends, which creates exciting finales. The minimal luck element creates a strong feeling of achievement when you are doing well.

Despite the dry theme, it is actually very cutthroat. It feels more like you are airlifting troops, laying minefields and building forts ... which is good.

It has a (good) habit of fooling the winner into thinking they've unlocked a 'winning formula', only for them to find it doesn't work on the next game. Players adapt and the 'metagame' evolves constantly.

You are rewarded strongly for blocking other players with your pieces, leading to constant "I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THAT TO ME!" moments. Everyone I know has found this fun, not frustrating, as revenge is swift and easy.

There is huge freedom of movement on the board and you can rapidly switch from one play style to another. As the game progresses it becomes more obvious what each player's 'winning strategy' will be, then there are great decisions to be made about how much you block them or push yourself forward.

There can be temporary alliances too - although usually only towards the end, when players try to keep whoever is ahead under control. I'm pleased that it doesn't have any overwhelming catch-up mechanisms. A player can always find useful things to do, even if everyone wants to stop them.

I also love how the entire game fits into its small box (by modern standards) - including its two expansion maps and mini expansion (as of now, March 2017). We tried the East Expansion recently and loved it.

RATING: 8
(Note: just started rating, so my rating may change.... it MAY go to a 9. I doubt any further down. And the expansion map may just replace it in the 10 spot).

This game is amazing. Scales well for 3-5 (at least). Tech trees, all of them viable. Multiple end conditions (well, probably only two). Strategy and tactics. A small random element which is unlikely to hose a player, but will add enough variance to ensure games play differently, even if people play with static strategies. Which they probably won't... I'm still learning things about the game. The ability to interfere with any players strategy, but at the same time never stop them completely... and they always have the ability to switch gears and punish you for interfering. I could sit down and play this game all day.

I am, however, slowly starting to wonder if player order is relevant... It certainly isn't Puerto Rico relevant, but it may have more relevance then I though originally. This probably won't be much of an issue unless you're playing with people who have a large skill variance. And it [i]could[/i] lead to AP - people could constantly be counting final game scores, since they are computable. Don't play with those people :). Turns should be mostly quick - you have a most 5 actions, each taking no more then 3 seconds to execute, and while occasionally you'll need to think about altering your plans, you normally can figure your turn out before your turn.

An intrigueing game I will need to replay. It is essentially about the placing and moving of small tokens in order to score points, or rather be prepared to cash in on large points values at a point in the game that is triggered by scoring small points values.

RATING: 8.5
This is a really interesting route building game. You are gaining bonus abilities by going to certain cities and allowing you to do more and more as the game progresses. The real key to the game seems to be in getting into someone's way and forcing them to bump you. This forces them to use extra available pieces and also allows you to place the bumped piece along with 1 or 2 extra pieces from your supply. That allows you to get those pieces to the board without taking an action to pull them into your active pile first. Admittingly, we didn't get to finish this game, but we played enough to get a good feel for how it plays. I'll have more thoughts once I get to the end of the game and see how the final scoring works out.

(+) Quickly explained, accessible and very reasonable playtime
(+) Well-implemented gaming mechanics: 'feeling of progress', different ways to approach the game, resulting in good replayability
(+) Good level of player interaction
(+) The game flows strikingly fluent which keeps all players involved. There is no downtime whatsoever.

(-) The theming is awful. The theming is uninspired, unexciting and the game itself feels abstract.
(-) Possibly the 3-player gameplay is more or less broken as the game can quickly evolve in such a way that players are each playing in a separate corner of the board. The game rule that players can score points for completing trade routes between cities they dominate tends to suddenly rush the game forward, not allowing for certain strategies to be fully developed. This has not occured in 4-player games.

I enjoy the number of options available on each turn. In most Euros, on any given turn, players perform only one of three or four possible actions. In Hansa Teutonica, players may execute multiple TYPES of actions on a turn, with multiple options within each of those types of actions.

The "decision space" (as I've heard it called) is much larger than that of a typical euro.

Hansa Teutonica is also more interactive. Without summarizing the whole game, a player can engineer situations in which his opponents can actually help him win.

After my first play, we closed the box, and everybody kind of put their hands on it and felt the glow of energy and beauty just slipping off this thing. I hadn't felt that way about a game since my first play of Taj Mahal. The sheer fluidity of this game... like El Grande, it sort of pulls the strategic layer off of something like Go, while relieving you of the tactical burden.

Shades of Taj Mahal, shades of Knizia scoring, shades of El Grande's watching struggles unfold and dart around to find undervalued stuff, and it's so *slick*.

rating after 1 play - 4/5 - felt broken cos way too short - we learnt we had nto included 3 of the bonus tokens (ended our game)  but still felt it wouldve ended too soon anyway

rating after 2 plays - 6/7 - better 2nd time but still ended with bonus tokens exhausting and lowish scores (3 ppl tied 1st on 36 from 5 players) 

feels unblanced in 5pl - 1st 3 players get 1st grabs at the extra actions which seem the most important and the 4th and 5th players get little compensation

also some areas of the board can locked down and is hard to shift players out of them

would like more randomness to setup and ideally some hidden info to prevet LOTS of calculation towards game end in what what otherwise a quickish game

am keen to play again to see if my reservations are grounded

RATING: 7
Interesting development tree and multiple paths.  While going for actions seems the most straightforward, I think it isn't the only way to gain the most prestige points.  Just need to make sure all your actions support the path you have chosen to gain the prestige points.

With turns only a few actions long, downtime is very minimal and the game moves quickly.  No hidden information makes it easy to quickly evaluate options and move quickly when it is your turn.  

Fun time playing, and look forward to exploring the various strategies that present themselves.

Archetypal euro game with various interacting rules subsystems and slapped on medieval theme. I enjoy it! Pleasing that there's virtually no randomness, but (like Caylus) there's enough going on that it has the feel of chaos/randomness. And various different strategic approaches to victory.

Too bad the 2-player version is generally reviled. I will happily play it when I get the chance at conventions but won't own it due to length/complexity and non-2-player-ness.

Probably my favorite abstract Euro - it's a lot like a Feld game, but not Feld.  Once you get the hang of it, turns go by really fast and it doesn't seem as AP prone as others.  I really like how you are building your own tech tree but there's also lots of player interaction in competing for routes and offices.  It's not really area control, but it similar enough to El Grande and I would always prefer to play Hansa Teutonica. The main decision is whether you invest early in your tech tree or securing office spaces which are in limited supply and continue to generate points off other players.   My only minor complaint is the routes next to the extra action city seem the strongest, but that might just be groupthink.

Strategy is there.  Something about a big board with a majority of it not covered in cubes bothers me.

RATING: 7.7
--Nov2009-- It's an interestingly euro-y euro.  One plays cubes to enhance one's ability to play cubes.  And then the game is done, and one scores points from the, um, historic playing of the cubes.  Now that's not to say it's not engaging:  it is.  But it's also pretty soul-less and abstract.  After a single play, I can both see becoming more interested with this after further play or deciding it wasn't adequately interesting.
--Jan2010-- Ok; so I'm weak.  Ordered a copy.  Now I need to play it enough to decide whether to keep or [-]sell[/-] leave on the shelf.
--Jan2010-- Better on the second play.
--Feb2010-- And still better after a few more.  Nice.

Visual Appeal: (4)
This game doesn't really look like anything special from the outside. Just another boring Euro about merchants or some bunk. The board is nice. Where the design shows through best is in the player action boards. The design of the boards makes it easy to understand how upgrading each type of action benefits you by both increasing your resource pool and augmenting your actions. 

Components: (4)
Nice wooden euro cubes and disks. I wish the player action mats were a thicker card board. They bend, but they haven't taken any serious wear yet. There is plenty of room in the box for an expansion board as well.

Theme: (3)
Like most worker placement euro games, the theme is fairly dry. I am not likely to get many people excited about the Hanseatic League. However, the actions are fairly in line with the idea of controlling trade in certain cities and paying resources to block competitors from your desired areas.

Learning: (2)
The rule book for this game is not a particularly good one. That is unfortunate because it makes a fairly simple game seem really complicated. I hope many people were not scared away from this game because of that. I have made my own player aides and found a method of teaching that works for me, but the rule book is too wordy and unclear.

Gameplay: (5)
It is so tricky to balance blocking opponents and going for what you need with the risk of getting blocked or booted out. There are a lot of approaches to take: you can try to upgrade your actions board first, or go for a large network of trading houses. Whichever you choose, other players can always interfere in the hopes of getting the upper hand in positioning and resources. Either way, the clock is ticking. There is a point cap that triggers in game scoring. Early trading houses in contested areas can drastically shorten games.

Overall Fun: (5)
The more the merrier with this game. There is enough to think about on your opponents' turns that you will likely not get bored. I don't particularly like the 2 player variant. It is truly a 3-5 player game, and my #1 favorite euro.

A solid offering which, despite being a little dry, provides some entertaining decisions and forward planning that leaves me with a rewarding feeling. There's some good player interaction, multiple paths you can follow to earning you your points and best of all the whole thing ticks along at a decent clip (at least with three players it does). The rulebook is a little tricky to read through, but it's actually a very simple game where all becomes apparent after a few turns. One of the better games of 2009.

Two things could improve this:
1. A scoring summary on the board.
2. The bonus markers could have a colourful border so they stand out on the board. The current grey chips just blend in.

I consider it a black mark against a game if its ultimate currency (Actions in this case) can only be increased in a narrowly competitive space.  Naturally, some players get ahead in the race for Actions and they go on to dominate the game.

Which is a shame because everything, and I do mean everything, else about this game is very attractive to me.  There are a wide variety of means to victory, the artwork and design are astounding and beautiful, and the decisions are meaningful.  I just wish there was more to the early strategy than trying to figure out how to upgrade your action track...

RATING: 7
Another cube-pusher where the placement and movement of cubes is governed by a language of rules you just have to be versed with. But setup time is minimal, and the rules are very original, infusing your regular tired Euro with a heavy dose of board-play. This game conveys a feel of 'dominating the board' in a truer way than traditional territorial conquest games. It's also a maverick outta nowhere that didn't cleave to the general direction game development was heading, and found interesting nuances in things that seemingly don't add up to a game, yet do, like a Power Grid or a Tigris. It is still original, though the emulation is coming in other games where you peel cubes of your player boards to acquire skills e.g. Eclipse, Terra Mystica.

Try to connect cities (through a dance of placing one at a time, moving several at once and paying through the nose to displace blockers to somewhere they probably wanted anyway), and collect benefits either as upgrades that give more cubes/discs among others, or owning the route to collect VPs from all future claimants but also give up a cube/disc permanently. Also plan out your network and time the game end (first to 20 VPs).

A bit leery that it's just optimization 101 on your turn, and grabbing whatever chance just opened up.

4+3

This is a brilliant game.  A very tactical game that encourages one to take advantage of what is offered.  Unfortunately, my group seems to think that whoever gets ahead in the actions is guaranteed of victory. I'm trying to get it to the table more so they can see the many paths to victory.

RATING: 7
It's a little dry, certainly not as bad as Caylus (can anything be that dry?), but its definitely not for everyone.  I like all of the different strategic avenues that you can take and the more prime spots are constantly under attack for control, which allows someone who doesn't want to contest them to sneak around other parts of the board without falling behind.  That's what saves it for me.  There are others that I'd rather play, but I certainly liked what I saw of it.

Based on two plays. It seems like my rating for the expansion would be higher - I think the game is great and mechanics are nice, great tactics, some long term planning and replay value is good, but in the original the action space is just messed up.
In both games (5ppl and 3ppl) the guy who won the bumping match for initial control and got the city and actions first ended up winning, and in both games I was the first one to stop competing for it at start and go elsewhere while others wasted resources, and ended up 2nd (I got the actions up to 4 when it cooled down over there). I hear they fixed it in the expansion.

[COLOR=#006600][b]Comments: [/b][/COLOR] 

With the exception of fillers, I almost always prefer to follow the play of one game with a different game.  (Yes, I'll play [thing=5]Acquire[/thing] two or three times in a row — but generally I prefer to switch games.)

Hansa Teutonica is the first game in some time that had me wanting to play again on the same day.  A nice balance of strategy and tactics which is deep enough to satisfy, but quick enough to feel light.  Yes, the beginning can feel scripted, since increasing one's available actions is crucial, but interests will branch quickly enough to allow actual choice into the mix.  And the choices are limited enough to keep play moving, but meaningful enough to impact subsequent gameflow.

Sadly, turn order is rather too important.  Reaching three actions quickly is important, and players starting later are at a disadvantage as regards gaining that third action.  Their additional playing pieces do provide some balance, but falling behind the action-curve can be bothersome.  This was particularly noticeable in the five-player game.

Jesse Dean (doubtofbuddha) really nails it with his comments:
[COLOR=#666666]"What makes it stand out for me is the elegant interactions that game allows between players, as players are constantly competing for technologies, kontors, and game length. Individual players are incentivized to claim routes, while other players clearly would like to stop them. Rather than making this a zero sum affair, the designer implemented a genius action point system, where removing a player simply costs the displacing player some of their action points in exchange for giving the displaced player additional board presence, and a potential reduction in the number of actions required to claim a particular route somewhere else on the board.

"Because of this, and other similar mechanics, there are very few zero sum aggressive actions in the game, making it so there is always a question of whether displacing an opponent is more helpful to the displacing player or the displaced player. Is getting this increased technology worth giving your opponent additional points and giving them greater control over the game length? Did your opponent place that piece because they wanted to work towards claiming that route, or is it simply a distraction as they prepare for claiming another route in one turn?"[/COLOR]

RATING: 1.5
I don't hate it. The best part of the game is spacial element and another which is interesting is needing a few plays to be able to evaluate the map. And it's interesting how your strategy of engine building reflects itself on the map. Interactiveness is quite good for this level - leeching, subtle blocking, actual blocking. 

Problems for me are: I don't find engine building of this type that exciting - a sort of tech tree actually narrows down strategic paths instead of opening the space wide.  The cubage in the game is just ridiculous. The theme part doesn't strike me as important as theme for me matters in terms of connection of gameplay to theme. Here this problem isn't present as there's no theme - this is an abstract game. (as opposed to thin theme) I found the graphics of the board pleasing for an abstract. I'll take T&E any day over this, also Torres, it's on the level of El Grande (and will probably drop to that rating eventually). 

In short: best thing - spacial elements on the map. Worst thing - "tech" tree. I don't get (euro) gamers euphoria over tech trees, plus this one is not really tech, just building up your actions. Where the spacial elements build the game between players, this "tech tree" is a needlessly fiddly solo puzzle.

A very nice game. Deserves an 8, but I'm still on the fence about the "gain more actions" track, which always seems to dominate. The theory is that too much time spent on this track will allow someone else to end the game before you can utilize these actions. Unfortunately, you can generally use these extra actions to continuously thwart someone from doing this. Maybe. The jury is out.

All I know is that I always go for extra actions and I often win.

RATING: 7
Played two 5P games. I have a semi-interesting history with Hansa Teutonica. The fact that there was a 4-year gap between my first and second game notwithstanding, I somehow managed a remarkable score of zero in my very first game... 

Anyway, at the core of Hansa Teutonica, you want to complete routes with your traders, but early game limitations enable your opponents to drop their traders into your turf. These meddlesome traders can be displaced at a cost, and often to the benefit of opponents.

What's interesting is that as the game progresses, the incentives to either stay out of, or interfere with your opponents' plans intensify. Advancing on the tech tree allows you to complete your routes more efficiently in a single turn, but getting traders into cities also becomes increasingly important. The concept of placement and displacement is executed well here. Displaced traders allow their owner to place more traders, so players are likely to interfere with their opponents purely out of spite. This opens up plenty of tactical considerations without being too unbalanced. The rudimentary tech tree and bonus tiles then opens up different strategic possibilities in scoring points.

If there are any complaints about this title, it's because the opening is fairly scripted – going for additional actions seems to be a necessity early in the game. Also, the subject matter is dry and presented in an abstract manner at best.

[18 plays] This is also a great 2 player game.

This game was love at first sight. Although I was quite lost as to best strategy and tactics (and ended with the lowest score), by midway through the game I was engrossed and starting to see all sorts of clever routes to victory with lots of clever ways to get there. I love that there are no cards, no dice, and yet so much going on with basically just cubes and a map.

My second play was again an awesome experience. I not only found out this is also a tremendous 2 player game, but I was now ready to raise my overall rating to a "10". This game is now cemented into my collection.

Update Oct 2014: This is a top 10 all time game for me. So much complexity and depth, yet the moves on any single turn can usually be completed fairly quickly by all players. After 12 plays, I would still say that we are only beginning to scratch the surface of what it takes to play a great game of HT and react well to the routes the other players at the table are taking. LOVE IT!

Update March 2015: The Brittania map is delightful. I can't see playing it any other way for a long time, unless maybe teaching someone new the base game. This is truly a masterpiece of game design. Like chess, the moves and the pieces are limited, but visioning the board several turns ahead and reacting well to what your opponents are trying to do is the difference between reacting to others and forcing them to react to you.

2009-es esseni sikerjáték. Nem véletlenül. Tipikus gémerjáték. Absztrakt, számolgatós, de ebből a típusból az egyik legjobb. A játékosok a Hansa városokban járnak a kereskedőikkel és házakat, útszakaszokat foglalnak el. Nagyon sokfajta pontszerzési lehetőség, óriási szabadság, talán a legszabadabb játék, amivel eddig találkoztam. Nagyon sokfajta út a győzelemig és rövid játékidő. Tényleg minden elemében nagyon jó a játék. Legjobban a dinamikus vége tetszett, pedig a fix körös játékokat kedvelem jobban. Ha valaki eléri játék közben a húsz pontot rögtön jön a pontozás. Nagyon jó stratégiákat lehet kidolgozni, tényleg jól működik a játék. De csontszáraz cserébe. Még a Power Gridnél is szárazabb, nem éppen családi és úgy érzem x játék után egy jó fejű embert nem igazán lehetne benne megverni, max. egy többszemélyesben, ahol bekavarhatnak a többiek. Mondjuk pont ezért volt órási siker a gémerek körében. A szerencse egyedül a bónuszlapkák behozásánál jön elő. Nekem ez nem hiányzott bele, de gondolom úgy érezték ennyit kell bele tenni.

[2011-12-17]
Öten is tökéletesen működik, nagyon kiegyensúlyozott a kétoldalas tábla.

[2013-01-05]
Ez nem kétszemélyes játék, az ötlet jó a kétszemélyes verzióra, hogy tartományokban folyik a játék, de ez sem segít rajta. 3-an már elmegy, de igazából 4-en és 5-en a legjobb egyértelműen. Ketten nagyon nem ajánlom.

[2014-12-07]
Emelek egyet a ponton, mert ez a játék szinte tökéletes. Egyszerű, érthető szabályok, magán a saját kis táblánkon minden megtalálható. A játék egy óra szinte mindig, bármennyi játékossal. 8->9

A nice light little euro.  A fun little extortion game.  Lay some cubes down, pick them up, position yourself in key spots and upgrade your power.  It's cute, but seriously, this game is only about laying cubes down in a line and then picking them back up again.

I fear that my experience will be too clouded by group think to allow for the full range that the game might have.  It seems that the Action power is vastly more important than the other powers.  So there is a constant hotbed of activity at the bottom of the board to get Actions, with the other roads connected to super powers getting some regular decent play and the center getting near nothing unless there is a super power chit that people want.  

Now I know if you are able to make the big connect you can end the game before others can use all their fancy shmancy powers, but, I haven't seen it happen yet...

I haven't played the game enough to say this for sure, but my suspicions are that this game would be far more interesting if the Actions were nerfed dramatically.

Great game in which getting in your opponent's way is intrinsic to the game -- and getting bumped out of the way can benefit you.  I like the balance between the long-game strategy vs. the short-game strategy.  I also like the balance between the early game (of increasing player ability) vs. the late game (of establishing routes) -- and the timing involved in knowing when to switch over. So many good things to say about the game... The only negative is that the rule book is a mess.  However, there is a lot of online help with that.  A beautiful cube-pusher.

I believe Hansa Teutonica to be one of the best games ever made. 

One of the most impressive parts of this game are its tiny amount of components: just the board, the cubes, and some discs, and thats pretty much it. All the wonderful complexity of this game comes from the elegant design itself. Of course, i love games with tons of bits too (what geek doesn't?) but it is so nice to sometimes just open a box, place a small amount of pieces out and bam - start playing. I also respect the minimalist approach from a design standpoint. 

So, what is so amazing about this game, with its little luck, the most overdone theme in all boardgamedom, and seemingly dry gameplay? Tom Vassal said it best when he mentioned that even the gentleman on the box cover looks miserable. So, what is it?? 

Well, in my opinion, this game has all the elements of a great game, but none of the frustrations present in many. The magic here is that in Hansa Teutonica, every action one takes is an excrutiating choice, which is delicious, but, but! Each choice is also a great one. Here, there is none of that familiar feeling of being backed into a corner by one's foe, and having to choose between evils. In Hansa, there is always something great to choose from - it just gives one a fantastic, perhaps subliminal feeling that you are having fun the entire time. Even when one gets jacked by another player (getting your cube bumped from a road) it comes with a benefit for you and a punishment for the them.

Other tasty aspects in this game are common to many great games: tons of ways to win with no one particular strategy reigning supreme, player interaction, very suitable play time, elegant design, tactics and strategy, etc. 

Some have complained about the ugly and unreadable graphic design of the board. I'm not sure if I have a different board than others, but i love mine. Honestly, ive thought it would be cool to print the board on a poster and hang it on the wall - it looks like some sweet medieval artwork to me.

I can't get myself to like this game. I recognize all it's design merits, but for me it seems like it could lose a few scoring layers. I've been told that I should play it a few more times and that it will sink in but somehow, I don't really want to play it that often.

I have the same reaction with Notre Dame which is totally different. It seems that some great games just don't suit me.

I will give it a few more tries.

This has an interesting blend of mechanics, combining a tech tree with route building.  Some nice tension is created by wanting to improve so many skills while knowing that the game could end quickly.  The gameplay itself is quite elegant; my only complaint is that it can get a bit tricky keeping track of all the end game conditions.  Nevertheless, I've enjoyed this game more and more with each play.

RATING: 5
It's hard to imagine an appealing elevator pitch for Hansa Teutonica. By all appearances, it's an abstract overly complex cube-pushing euro, distinguished, if at all, by the fact that it's not the solitaire worker placement game you might expect it to be from the generic box, theme, and components. Actually, though, it's uniquely and deeply interactive. The game is all about getting other players to improve your board position for you. There seem to be multiple viable strategies, none too deeply baked in, and it's not obvious which to pursue.

Unfortunately, there's zero narrative and only the flimsiest pretext of a theme. In a game as complex as this one, that's a problem. I like to have some sense that the parts of a game amount to something, that there's life to the game beyond the math; here, instead, I'm left with the sense that Hansa Teutonica will only ever deliver precisely the sum of its parts and not an iota more.

RATING: 6
An interesting area-majority game where the area majorities are used not only to score VP, but to improve the quality of your abilities (e.g., take more actions, resupply more cubes, etc.). Seems well-balanced, except it depends on players also keeping each other in check: if someone is allowed to jump way ahead on a track (e.g., action track, resupply track) without much competition, or to set themselves up to be displaced by multiple players (and get more cubes on the board quickly), it seems they will have a very significant advantage. 

--- Summary ---
Board shows a bunch of cities connected by routes length 2-4. Each city has 1-4 spaces for tokens (cubes or discs, 4 different colors). 6 Cities also have a banner adjacent to them, corresponding to end-game VPs and the 5 different "powers" (#actions, resupply, privilege of placing in colored spaces of cities, #tokens moved per action, multiplier for end-of-game scoring). Players start with a disc and (3+turn order) cubes in Personal supply, and a personal display full of cubes/discs on several tracks (the 5 "powers"). 

On your turn, take as many actions as shown on your Action Track (2 at start of game; improved to 3/3/4/4/5). Actions are:
- place a token on an empty space on a road
- displace another player's token from a road; return 1 (or 2) cubes to the General Supply if displacing a cube (or disc). That player gets to place the displaced token, plus 1 (or 2) cube taken from General Supply, on a road adjacent to their original location.
- move 2-5 of your tokens on the board
- resupply: take x cubes from General supply to Personal supply (x starts at 3; can be improved to 5/7/all)
- claim a road: only if all spaces are occupied by your tokens. Player(s) controlling adjacent cities (i.e., majority presence; if tied, rightmost token) score 1 VP. If the road had a special token pointed at it, take it; also draw a random token face down, to be placed back on the board face up (pointing at an empty road with no other bonus marker, and with at least one empty space in an adjacent city) at end of your turn. Either place one of the tokens from the road into an adjacent city (if space available, and you have privilege to place into that color space; must use left-most empty space; some spaces give you 1VP immediately) or, if it's one of those 5 cities, improve one of your "powers" by removing the leftmost cube/disc from that track of your personal display (token goes to your Personal supply). Unused cubes go to General supply. 
- May also use any previously acquired special tokens; keep used tokens for end-game scoring. These tokens may provide extra actions for the turn, allow you to place a token in an imaginary space to the left of a city with tokens already present or swap 2 tokens' positions in a city (to give you presence and/or change majority), or let you remove other players' tokens from the board. Using these tokens does not count as one of your actions.
- First player to create a connection (via presence in cities) between marked cities in east and west scores 7 VP (4/2 for 2nd/3rd player to do so).

Game ends instantly when either 10 cities completely filled with tokens, a player gets to 20VP, or someone needs to place a special token but none available. 

End-game Scoring
- for 1 + (# special tokens acquired / 2; round down), score 1/3/6/10/15/21 VP
- 2 VP per city controlled
- (# of your tokens in city-spaces in largest contiguous group of cities where you have presence) x (end-game multiplier; the Key track) VP

Most VP wins!

After one play I rate this "OK".  There are different skills to upgrade and ways to claim points but it doesn't quite all hang together for me.  The topology of the road network doesn't seem to come into play, and the mechanic of getting your worker bumped seems overly important.  I'd try it again, though.  I expect the second game would be pretty quick.

RATING: 8
This is an action selection/route building Euro.  Players take turns selecting an action, each of which typically just pushes cubes from one location to another, in order to build routes between locations and score points.

There is a decent amount of interaction in the game as players can block other's routes and to replace an opponent's cube on the board is not only costly but gives the opponent another benefit.  It is a thinker and it is dry and I resisted playing it for so long myself because of the incredibly drab and boring looking board and components.  However, if you like games about optimized strategic planning then this one is for you.

There is some merit to the claim you can try different paths to victory since players are certainly able to affect one another.  However, because of the static nature and lack of variance in the game I fear the game can be solved and almost always the more experienced player will win this game against newer ones.

Also, a game like this is one that can be kind of ruined by players not taking up arms together against another who is running away with it.  In my first play one player (who was the most experienced) was allowed to complete the entire key track for a whopping 4 points per connected city.  Both players needed to intervene to prevent that from happening but too often players either don't recognize this or don't want to divert from their own strategy and that makes a game like this kind of fall apart.

I think this game is brilliant.  It's so mutli-layered in its depth but so simple in execution.  You have so many paths and decisions to make to score points and keep your opponents from doing so that it can be overwhelming.

Excellent. It seems like a new strategy wins every time I play!

Description: This game is all about filling up routes between cities with your traders and merchants. When you fill up these routes, good things happen. Much of the time, you will establish offices in these cities which will increase your prestige and presence on the map. But some cities give you an option: establish an office, or instead invest in an ability which will increase your efficiency in expanding your network.

It's a pure euro game. This isn't exactly a bad thing to be it's just that after all the hype I've heard I thought this was going to be a different game somehow. Not sure how different but different. Then again, this has nothing to do with the game itself which is very interesting with lots of clever available strategies. 
One of the good things I found is that there are always lots of solutions and they all seem good enough at some point. The way improvements work are clever designed with all players having the possibility of searching for their own strategies. The game seems to have room for everybody to try different things.

The start is slow, very slow, a bit dull I must say, but after that the game can be played fast paced although it could block some players exactly because it has so many offers. 

Hansa Teutonica reminds me of Goa because of the improvement skills chart. Players chose to improve their abilities instead of scoring victory points in order to do better from turn to turn - have more actions, move more pieces... This decision of upgrading skills as opposed to actually score VP's is one of the most interesting things that this game has to offer. Also the skills players have at their disposal are all very valid and good to have so it turns decisions even more tense.

I really have to play this game again just to make sure if I find it average or better than that. For now it's a 7.

Components are generally average but the artwork of the board is awful. I like the box cover but not the board. I also don't like the way English rules are written.
_______________________________________________________

Played for a second time and again with three players. Raised the rate to an 8. I don't think I'll raise the rate again in the future only because I don't find the game fun to play. It really push the right buttons on me and it's really a very challenging game but that is the end of it because the playability, its gaming feeling, it's not something that I especially enjoy. It's one of those rare situations where I like the challenge but really don't find what I'm doing very enjoyable. 
________________________________________________________

Got back to the game (11/10/2013) and although I still find it's a good game, I confess that I no longer enjoy playing it very much. It fell a lot in my tastes as it's too dry and too predictable. The only aspect of the game that it's not obvious or predictable, is the bonus tiles which I completely dislike. Seems stupid but there you have. :)

I can't believe i ignored this at Essen. I think the combo of 'another game with traders set in the Middle Ages' and the ugly artwork caused me to pass it by. What a mistake! Some superficial similarities to Endeavor, but more intricate and more of an area majority game. After first play kept thinking about what i could have done better (especially place a Kontor in the abilities city would have gained a ton of points)

After 4 plays i am little less enamoured of Hansa T. It feels a little more like an abstract than a Euro - the theme is wafer thin. However, i do feel their is much more to be explored in the game as there seem to be so many routes to victory.

5th play restored my faith, despite lack of theme i enjoy the 'rock/paper/scirrors..' tactical battle.

There has been a lot of hype with this game.  Eurogamers have been gushing over this for a while so I was exited to try it.   

It has interesting mechanics, several victory paths, several game end conditions, and very little randomness.  Everything Eurogamers love.  So why does it feel so average?  It seems a little cookie cutter-ish.  And my personal pet-peeve, turn order is highly influential in the outcome.  I give it a 7, and I hope to play it again as I had hoped this would be better and maybe I just didn’t get it in my first play.

This must be the best 'cube-pusher' of all time. It's totally abstract, but for a game on making a network of connections, the theme works enough for me.

Finally, a euro without engine building or worker placement. There are many ways to score points, and you can't simply pick them all. This a game of real and tough choices, constantly evaluating strategy vs. opportunistic tactical play. An amazing amount of game in only 45 minutes. My favourite game of 2010, hands down.

The only problem this game has is that it is IMPOSSIBLE to get other people to play it. The "theme" is the DRIEST sounding thing imaginable. I passed on this game SO many times because I fell asleep reading the back of the box.

Once inside, it is a different story. A quick, thinky, puzzle game where you build a little engine to maximize points.

Also terrible about this game...the rulebook...one of the worst I have ever read...ever.

RATING: 4
The problem with this one is not that it is a hodgepodge of existing game elements, although it is, the problem is that it is a hodge podge of extremely tactical elements that suffer from extreme player-driven chaos.  Every turn requires that you potentially ditch your previous turn's plan to deal with your opponent's current turn.

It's amusing that people call this deep since by its tactical, non-planning nature, it is anything but deep.  It's a matter of optimizing your play each turn based on an almost vacuum-state of current information.  What you do does have a downstream effect, but it does so in a way that cannot be planned for, even superficially, by the players, even a turn prior.

I think this type of non-thinky play is currently in vogue however, based on how well received 7 Wonders and Glen More are.  Though I think both of those do the same style of gameplay in a more focused and streamlined fashion which makes them more playable.

I suppose, at least, it's not completely random on top of it. so at least your current-turn tactics actually do something.

RATING: 9
Dry as dust game of something something Hanseatic League something, but a magnificent example of cube-pushing done right. It's highly interactive by eurogame standards, has multiple paths to victory, and many nice touches like control of the game clock.

I also love the artwork and don't understand complaints that it's ugly or bland.

I'm less enthused about the turn-order binding (it's very easy for an inexperienced player to give the player to their left a series of wonderful gifts) and, again especially with inexperienced players, a lack of care about giving points to players who control privilege cities. Several times I have seen a player establish an early office in the action-point city and rack up points there, with other players saying, "I need an action and it's just one point" -- individually true, but an aggregate problem. These problems make me disinclined to play the game with anyone new.

Still, it's a fantastic game and one of my all-time favourites.

After one play I can assume that this is quite good heavy euro with not so bad replayability. But it is flawed with action I don't like: "upgrade number of actions available to player." When a game gives you such an option it become clear that some player will pursue the path to upgrading, diminishing other strategies. I think this game could be done in perfect way without this option. This is the only annoyance I spotted and beside this flaw I would recommed this game to many players.

Theme pasted on.  Game fairly easy to learn and play, but tactics will take a few plays.  Play offers many tough choices and paths to victory.  Euro with conflict too!

I enjoyed upgrading actions to release new dudes into the supply, as well as the mechanic of cycling dudes up from stock to supply, both of which are similar to Terra Mystica.

[Based on 1 play] Initial Reaction Rating.  This was a fun game to learn and try out.  It was really a hard game to judge.  On one hand I did like how many different ways to get points and different strategies seems to be possible in this game.  I had an enjoyable time playing it and would like to try it again and learn it better.  On the other hand it seems somewhat chaotic.  Too many pieces are placed and too many actions happen between one turn and the next that I didn't feel like I could plan very well.  That could just be because I was a newbie though.  My overall first play feeling is pretty good but maybe not great.

When I first heard of this it didn't really excite me: busy artwork; place cubes to score [i](zzzzz)[/i], but after playing it I'm kicking myself for not trying and buying it at Essen. It's fast, and clever. Limited actions means little downtime (generally). Placing cubes on the board is to satisfy small objectives (join two cities), at which point your cubes come off the board and you get the reward which is progress on some track (so you get more actions, or your actions are more efficient, or your end-game scoring will improve), or an office in a city (which will earn you VP). Lots of ways to earn VP. lots of interaction, and an interesting distinction between immediate VP and end-game VP.

Even the artwork isn't as bad up close as I feared.

Tightly competitive race for limited areas and majorities. Different areas offer improved abilities - each ability is useful, but you can't get them all every game. Some interesting spins on blocking - you often want to block just enough to make someone force you out, but not so much to make them just decide to go elsewhere. My only complaint is that actions bonus are a little too important, but that's a fairly minor issue as long as everyone understands it.

Solid route-building Euro. Players are set the objective of placing pieces on roads between cities, which in turn either allows them to control offices in those cities thereby earning victory points whenever someone else completes an adjoining road, or in certain cities bestows an upgrade such as gaining more actions, more markers to place on roads/cities, the right to control a greater number of offices etc. Points are tight and they key to success is gaining control of offices in cities that are likely to see a lot of action on their adjoining roads. Whilst this is certainly a Eurogame in every way, it manages to implement its theme well and their are a lot of decision to be made each turn with quite a lot of player interaction, which certainly commends it.

Really don't see what all the fuss is about this game - would much rather play Endeavor (and don't know why people insist on saying the games are similar).  But then, I have only had one play, so need to give it another go.  Liked the mechanic of having all the cubes on your player board to start, and as you moved them to the board you not only increased your supply, but also 'leveled up' the various tracks.

After three play, I feel something working well in this game. Different ways to play, althought game length will drive your strategy. This is the key, cause game lenght is defined by how players play, so take care of your moves based also over opponents strategies. Something recall me Goa (growing power categories) and Caylus (scoring point and game lenght influence), but take it only as a weak remind.

A wonderful game about rival clans of wizards fighting for control of the ley lines through a fantasy realm. 

In this game you can make your conclave stronger by extorting control over the ley lines. Different key villages around the kingdom will provide you with different upgrades. Expending influence over a ley line leading to certain central villages will give you better teleporting spells, while control over a ley line to another village will provide you with more arch-wizards, which are harder for rival wizard clans to force off your ley lines or provide better control over villages. 

There are many ways to score points as well. If your wizards have control of the largest tower in a village next to a ley line when completed then your conclave scores a point. If you are able to own a tower along the ley lines between the two main wizard academies then you can score a lot of points.

The game ends when a conclave reaches twenty points or when all of the towers in ten villages are completed.

When this game was being explained to me, I did not think that I would like it. 

About halfway through the game.  I got it, and started to enjoy some of the subtle strategies that could play out.  I think the game is a pretty good game.  Probably not something I love, but something I'll never mind playing.

I'd like to know if the different various strategies are all pretty well balanced against each other or not.  If they are not, it will kill the game.  The action track does seem like it might be more important than the others, but I've only played it once.

Ordinarily I am sure I would have at least appreciated this game, but due to it being a bad experience I don't know that I will be seeking this game out nor wishing to play it again.  All too often I would commit to a path to have someone else bump me out - after several turns of trying to get an extra action - only to be booted over and over again I have been left with a bad taste for this game.  I will not rate however due to the fact that I know this particular play had an impact on my opinion of the game in general.

Easy rules, but many options. Big interaction, many ways to score points, fast game. Some similar to Endeavor, but more interesting.

Interesting mechanic with blocking. You could push away someones cube, but it cost you a cube, and that player who is pushed away can move his cube and a bonus cube. When you have cubes on a map, you can relocate them. That is more powerful than the standard place cube action, but you open someone else a place on the map.

Another eurogame with cubes, but a little bit diferent.

I am on the fence about Hansa Teutonica. I honestly don't know what to make of it. Mechanically, it's fiddly, with lots of interconnected ways to score points and collect bonuses. A strong theme would be perfect for game like this; however, the theme of the game (something I don't usually mention) actually detracted from my understanding  gameplay.

At it's heart, Hansa Teutonica combines area control (disguised as route building) with a bit of an economic snowball. There *is* route building in the game, but it has more to do with a scoring opportunity for most connected cities than the mechanic for claiming bonuses and cities. The core mechanic is sound, but the problem arises when you look at the board. Much of the fighting is going to come in the bottom half of the map as players fight for extra actions. The rest of the board becomes more interesting in the latter half of the game, sure, but by that time the fights are less interesting because everyone has more actions. More actions means they can claim a route in a single turn without much resistance -- especially if they plan out their turn properly.

It's not a bad game. By the end, I finally understood what I was doing and how all the different parts worked together. Yet I still felt like the game was a bit of a mess. Streamlining would help, perhaps. A better effort at graphic and component design would certainly help. Most of all, and surprisingly to me, the theme needs some re-working.

RATING: 8
This is an amazing example of a Eurogame, what with its post-medieval time frame, huge piles of wooden cubes and discs, map with castles and a victory point track on it, and its multiple paths to victory.  Extra actions seem to be required for all players, so there may be a slight balance problem there.

One of those games that takes several tried and trusted mechanics (basically, it's a route building/area control) from other games and blends them into a mixture that is a good game in its own right. However, the game does not really 'develop' at all, which soon gets a bit tedious, especially as it's quite long for what it is.

Fab game - medium euro andvery much similar to Thurn & Taxis with the multiple ways to earn VP's but with amore player interaction, and more ways to score. Also very good with the player board where you can play to release more actions per turn, enable you to score on certain routes and multiply your route scores it certainly feels like there is a lot more options, but with no increase in downtime. Very good game, and resolution.

I enjoyed this very abstract cube-placement and route-connection game far more than I'd expected I would. I need to play this a few more times, but my initial 7 rating could rise. Hansa Teutonica has more depth than is immediately apparent, and I've been itching for another play, which is always a good sign that a game may have some staying power. Update: Rating increased to 8 as depth of this game continues to unfold and its replayability becomes apparent after many plays.

Excellent game. So many options to score points, plus the various strategies seem to be very well balanced. I especially like the eviction action that benefits the evictee more than the evictor. This rule makes the game very confrontational and interactive, but not in an evil way. Board and components are serviceable, but the escritoire is exceptional. Looking forward to many plays of this game.

The front-game can grow tedious as players vie for the same four segments to increase their powers.  For a moment, Hansa is a tactical wargame.  Once that loosens, the rest of the game is very diverse.  It builds momentum swiftly and the end comes almost unexpectedly.  The theme is painted-on but this is the best near-abstract I've played in years.

This is how Euros should play. Fast and intuitive with almost no downtime after you learned the "trick". Sometimes I couldn't believe it was already my turn again. In fact it plays so nicely, I don't even mind the total lack of theme. 

Now if this were a game where the game plays itself this wouldn't be much of a surprise, but there are actually decisions to make. Simple and beautiful game play well worth another try. 
----------------------------
After some more games in, I can say this game heavily knocks at the gates to my Euro-favorites (if it has not already been given access) One of the major concerns I heard, which is that you have to start off the game by going for the extra actions and if you don't, because you have no chance to as spaces are blocked, doesn't seem tenable. It is definitely NOT what this game is about. Just go for a different strategy. Which is what I did in my last session. In which I finished second and the winner also had no chance of the extra actions at the start.

Man I wish I could get this to the table more often. It's just so Euro that my family doesn't see the appeal. It's a highly fulfilling game, though. Tough decisions, high level of interaction, and more paths to victory than I'm sure I even know. If I could just get my family hooked...

::UPDATE::

1/15/12 - After tonight's session, I believe my long quest to get somebody in my family hooked; and it couldn't have been a better person: MY WIFE!

We played a three-player game at our friends' house and all three of us agreed that we want to play it again as soon as possible. It is super tense. There is great interaction and conflict. No other game issues direct conflict in a friendly way like Hansa Teutonica, and that's a really good thing. 

Additionally, all three of us agree that it is a very unique game. There is no other game that plays quite like it. I'm bumping my rating to an 8.5. If it gets any better with more plays, I suspect it will eventually creep into the 9s.

Once you get through the rules, this plays relatively fast - as it should.  I've played twice now and everyone I play with is more impressed than I am.  There just don't seem to be very many interesting choices, and all reasonable paths seem to lead to similar point totals.  I would play it again with experienced players, but this is not something I will seek out.

EDIT: After 8-10 plays, I've raised my rating a bit.  It's still not an interesting game to me, but I'm almost always willing to play it (if required).

This is a really good game. The process of learning strategies is a lot of fun. It's only flaw is that the same maps can start to feel samey after a few plays. New maps are a wonderful solution to this problem. I would definitely play this game again, if someone brought it to the table.

The board game equivalent of a heart attack. I always rankle when I hear someone describe this game as a "point salad".

Really neat Euro where players scrabble around with nice small bite-size actions trying to drag their way up a tech track scoring points along the way.

I was completely wrong about this game. In my GeekBuzz Meets Fairplay column, I dismissed Hansa Teutonica out of hand as appearing to be a dry and bland game. The rules and components are underwhelming, but it turns out the game itself is surprisingly good. I have played 9 times now (at all player counts from 2 to 5) and Hansa Teutonica is solidly my surprise hit of BGG.CON (just as Planet Steam was my surprise hit of BGG.CON in 2008). It's an addictive game. I find myself always wanting to play again so I can try a different strategy or try to refine the same strategy to get it to work. You have so much control over the way the game plays out from beginning to end that you feel as if you should be able to accomplish what you set out to accomplish. And yet there are so many different ways to score points that it's easy to get distracted by a short-term opportunity, at the expense of your long-term objectives. The game has a very nice flow to it as the turns move quickly, with each player only adding a few grains of sand to the eventual beach of the game on any given turn. The most remarkable thing about Hansa Teutonica is how much interaction there. It's a German-style game with lots of wooden cubes and an overused theme, but multi-player solitaire this is not. It's an in your face, almost viciously contentious battle for control of the various trade routes and city guilds across the board. Nonetheless, the game's displacement mechanism is reminiscent yet superior to that of Endeavor, as it doesn't punish the defender for getting in the way, but rather rewards them and punishes the attacker, while somehow still retaining a significant incentive to attack. I'd also be remiss not to mention the fantastic use of a technology tree in this game, which provides a delicious tension between developing each skill a little bit for flexibility and control over your board position, versus developing fewer skills more fully for bonus points. All that being said, this game is bound to disappoint many because expectations are being raised too high in the time it will take for a widespread reprint to become available. I, and many others at BGG.CON, were pleasantly surprised by Hansa Teutonica because there were no expectations. Now that the game is being talked up by so many people, I don't think it will impress people in the same way that I found myself impressed and caught off guard. Hopefully people can enjoy it for what it is and not set the bar too high in the intervening months, but knowing how much I tend to anticipate unavailable games and how often they disappoint, and having seen the impact of delays on countless prior releases, I have significant trepidation over how well Hansa Teutonica will be received by the wider market.

RATING: 7
A smart game, that doesn't plays quite as well with a smaller amount of players - though there is a map for 2 or 3, even with 3 the map can be underused. Still, the game is well done - it allows for a lot of interaction, choices and strategies to victory. The rules are easy to teach, and the game is easy to play, but is hard to master and make a good use of the small (very small with 5 players) windows of opportunity.

The personal boards and how opening sections of it allows for better possibilities isn't as novel today - due to games like Eclipse, Terra Mystica, Great Western Trail, and others -, however [thing=43015][/thing] made this part the core of the mechanisms and achieve a big success.

Overall, [thing=43015][/thing] can be mean and make players clash a lot, but if you don't mind to be bothered and bother the others, [thing=43015][/thing] plays quite nicely.

Most euros gather dust forever after some plays. This is a rare exception.

There lots of different strategies that can be pursued.  Once the players know the game, it plays fast.  This is just an all around fun game.  I'll play it any time.

At the macro level the systems seem interesting enough. However, at the micro level they are just enormously repetitious, so much so that the game seems like an endless grind with little sense of progress. 

My second game was a bit more fun than the first, since everyone involved had a better sense of what to do, but it still did very little for me.

RATING: 8
A much better game than I expected. The amount of cube pushing and the pasted-on theme make the game feel a little dry, and there is quite a bit to remember the first time you play, but it does offer turn angst and I was surprised at the the amount of interaction involved! Every turn, there is a sweet trade-off between unlocking new abilities, increasing your network, obtaining a valuable special action token and setting yourself up to profit from other players' actions. There are never enough actions in a turn to do everything you want. All this in a game that plays relatively fast, and with little downtime. Great.

Interesting little gem. I still cannot fully grasp whether this will be a great game.. Clearly, there are many roads and paths to victory and players can customized their playing style but I am wary of the "action" bottleneck. If it turns out that all paths lead through more actions, then this game will turn out to be one where the initial rush will lead to a winner most of the time. If that turns out not to be the case here, then we have an intriguing game of Goa like magnitude. I reserve judgement on this game until I play it a few more times. For now, I score it an 7.5 based on potential alone.

Replayed this game and decided that it really wasn't for my gaming groups or taste. The game is touted for its depth and endless possibilities, but only if you choose to invest playing the game multiple times. This game is just too harsh for new players who haven't had time to absorb or develop a strategy. They get steamrolled. I am not convinced this game should be labeled as "great". The fact that the game is controversial and somewhat scripted with the "action" selection in the beginning tells me there is way too much emphasis on acquiring actions. Exactly how many players one and two have avoided the action track as their first moves? That to me is scripted. Ultimately, HA may tickle someones fancy but I do not think it is for my gaming group nor do I think it is necessarily a well-designed game.

First Impressions: I really like this one, and I was surprised to find some of my less hard-core friends liking it too. It seems to suffer from the Caylus/Puerto Rico problem of having a "newb strategy" that's unbeatable when everyone is still figuring the game out. Unlike those other two, I might actually get the chance to play this more than twice, w00t!

(Badly needed) UPDATE: This is as close to a classic as it gets. Wide variety of options coupled with fascinating player interaction in a surprisingly fast package has me returning again and again. It feels very difficult to play well, and while it's sometimes agonizing to try and rein in a runaway leader, the tools the game gives you are nonpareil.

My very first impression was this game is an 8/10. But after thinking about it and wanting to get it to the table as soon as possible, I'm pretty sure this game is a 9/10. Fantastic game! I played terribly in my first game, but the second game will be different. :) 

Yes, this is a 9/10 game. Absolutely fantastic. There's some really clever board play and a lot to think about. 3 actions is all you need to win the game and lots of varied strategies.

I love the high-level of non-destructive player interaction. What stands out is the great concept of benefiting from being pushed out, i.e. you get displaced, but you often want to.

fun worker placement and manipulation game; score throughout and at the end; sudden finish scenario by one player so others do not get to complete their turns at that point;  I prefer it with all 5 players or at least 4 players since it can get a little predictable with fewer; the "gain an extra action" space gets the most hits from players in my plays and they are the ones that seem to win the most; still a good go to game for ease of set up

Hansa is an amazing strategy game with a huge amount of depth with many different paths to victory. While direct conflict with other players is possible it will usually help them more than it helps you so you have to think carefully about when to bide your time and when to strike. While the overall strategy can take some time to grasp the actions and upgrades can be picked up in a turn or two, everything you can do in the game you can do from turn 1, the upgrades just make you do that stuff better.

I completely understand the criticism this game receives. The board for some people is bland and boring(though I find it very aesthetic). And the theme doesn’t make a lick of sense. Instead of merchants and traders, think of it as gangs of bandits controlling routes and cities. Very solid and intuitive gameplay with multiple ways to win once you understand everything. I recommend playing with 3 or 5 people though. 2 players kinda sucks and four players is just a little too open on the board.

Played twice, and I like it.  It's low in direct conflict, with the action to displace an opponent's piece being too expensive to undertake lightly and so generally used only in response to another player's blocking move.  It's very tactical, with multiple routes to VPs and with pieces being very mobile around the board, so if you are blocked from one objective it's easy to go for another.

The most fantastic game with the worst theme ever. Seriously, this game player super tight, and is incredibly intricate in it's player interaction.

That said, the game requires every player to be as aggressive as possible, blocking and obstructing whenever they have a chance. Otherwise, one player gets free points and reign over the map and the whole experience is ruined.

RATING: 8.5
This game is awfully good, but it usually takes a few plays before it will play correctly.  Often, if you are playing with new players, the strategy just comes down to making use of what is ignored by the other players.  

This is a game with lots of open choices.  Everywhere you look, you see options, and it can be rather tough, especially for a new player to prioritize how to proceed.  

Based on the strategies taken by all players, you have to determine how long you think the game will go, and then tailor your strategy to work for a game of that length.  I've seen many games that abruptly end when players didn't expect it to do so.

Boring title, boring art, boring board, boring components, paper thin theme, but the gameplay is good enough to save it.  Yes, this is quite neat.  The improvements system is very similar to that of [gameid=9216], and is used very well in this game.  But the main mechanic of this game is in using your cubes to claim routes, and it sounds almost too simple when you're explaining it.  But, what really makes it stand out from most Euros is that you can mess with people, and it will still improve your game by more than just tearing down their strategy.  When somebody displaces your cubes, you get to take a cube from your out-of-play pile, and along the the cube that got displaced, you may place them both on adjacent routes.  It's so blindingly simple, but so critical to separating this game from every other euro.  I look forward to playing it further, to see if the charm holds up.

This one didn't impress me at all. And I'm very easy to please when it comes to games. We played two newbies against two veterans, and the vets slaughtered us as expected. Maybe that was part of it, but the game seemed extremely cold and mechanical. We'd make a move, the vets would go "plop plop plop" and put their cubes on the board. These cubes go here, those go there, now I'm at this level, it just all seemed really scripted.

A bit disappointing first play after all the rave reviews. Upgrading your number of actions seems to be a must from the beginning, and most actions seems to be directed towards a few map locations and in a certain order. So although it seems to offer much more variety (and complexity) than for example Endeavor this may not actually be the case. And the movement of cubes back and forth could become annoying very quickly. An initial 7 giving it the benefit of the doubt and with potential to become 8-9 - or 4-6.

Score lowered to 6 after reading http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/468782 which mostly confirms my suspicions. Will most likely go up or down again when I play it again - or rather if I play it again - not keen to do so. It seems overhyped and too fiddly and too limited, and there are so many other seemingly much more interesting new games to try and better "old" games to play.

What at first appear to be a bunch of random mechanics and scoring conditions thrown together with repeat plays unveil themselves to fit into a cohesive, masterful whole. Hansa Teutonica impresses me in that it crams a deep and variable game into an hour or so playing time. Balancing between tactics and long-term strategy (which is essential to success) is delightfully tense. I'm also impressed by how popular this game is- there's something about it that appeals to people.

RATING: 8
There's a lot in this game that works toward its favor with me: It moves quickly, has a variety of strategies, has very little luck, and rewards good decision making.  It's also not an overly complex game for its depth, so it might even be a good second-step gateway game.  The tech trees are integrated well into the game, and there don't seem to be any obvious strategies to take when approaching the game.  In fact, the more times I play the game, the more I discover different ways to play the game, and they all seem to be well balanced.  Each time I play with a different group, I see a different way to play the game.  That makes the game easily susceptible to groupthink, but the options are varied if you can see them when you play.  I had high hopes for this game, and it didn't let me down.

The players act as traders trying to get victory points for building a network of offices, controlling cities, collecting bonus markers or for other traders using the cities they control. After controlling a line between two cities with your pawns you can decide to build an office (and maybe also establish control and/or get a bonus marker) or to get a skill improvement from some of the cities.
\13\\13\
Players have to improve their traders' "skills" for the following effects: getting more VP from offices in their network, getting more available action points, increasing the number of available pawns, and getting the right to place pawns and get more special pawns.

It's not very often that I find myself drastically outside the ratings norm for a game here on BGG. For the most part, I like the top 200 or so and if the heavy Euro crowd is into a game, it's usually a sure bet that I will be into it as well. Then I met Hansa Teutonica.

Now I'm not sure exactly why I can't get into it. It has a player mat with abilities that unlock as you place your pieces, tactical goals that you can dance around to improve your score and guide your decisions and a primary goal of area control, which is a mechanic I generally like. Terra Mystica features all three of those things and I absolutely adore it. Strangely, those very same features all fall flat for me here.

I don't know if it's that I'm just not into the tug of war thing, placing a guy, then bumping a guy and then having the favor returned as the other players take their turn. I really can't figure it out. I should enjoy the hell out of this, but I just find it so incredibly boring.

I plan on giving it a few more tries when the opportunity presents itself, because I must be missing something, somewhere. Of course, I have very little reason to actually want to buy it, so that may be easier said than done.

This is a cube-pusher through and through, with the theme only really serving to have art on the game board, but trying to out-think your opponents is just too fun for that to matter. Though the extra actions hold more authority than the other bonuses that can be claimed, in general your path to victory can differ wildly from your opponents - or you could be at each other's throats vying for the same resources the entire game.

Pretty impressed so far. Yes, it's Kardinal&Konig + Medieval Merchant + Goa + Thurn & Taxis (pick your mix) in one sense, but it's different enough. Directly interactive, yet in a weird and unique way; I quite like the displacement mechanism.

Only real disappointment is that it just isn't a 2p game. It works, I guess, but really this is a 3-5p with a 2p variant for the desperate, and I'll probably ditch it on those grounds.

Wow.  I normally don't rate games I haven't purchased but after playing this a bit I began to realize the balance is excellent and the possibilities to score are high.  This is definitely a gamer's game with no luck involved.  The decisions are yours to make and you can change strategy to come back from a bad choice or bad position.  This one has got to be the sleeper of the year for hard core Euros.  Be mindful that the game probably isn't for everyone.  If you're looking for lighter fare or a family game, look elsewhere.  This one can be a brain burner.  There's plenty of ways to get points during the game and upon completion but the actions flow quick and the game can be played out in under 1.5 hours with five experienced players.  With more exposure I think this could be a top ten game on BGG.  Well, this line is now an edit as I found a copy at Funagain and am now a proud owner.

RATING: 9
Really clever design, Hansa Teutonica feels unique and unlike anything else. It's a very competitive and "sneaky" area control game with multiple paths to victory. I love the whole system of developing your player board and unlocking stronger actions. You can't win this game "by accident" - you really have to plan ahead and make strategic choices. Hansa Teutonica simply rewards well thought-out playing. 

That said, I have some issues with the game. The opening move feels really scripted - getting that 3rd action is a natural thing to do, so everyone will fight for it. For this reason the start of every game is pretty much the same (the game could use a little bit more variability on the board during the setup). Also, don't bother playing this game with only 2 players, it just doesn't work properly (it's best with 3-4, with 5 it gets a bit too chaotic). Still, despite all those cons I highly recommend it, there's no other game quite like it.

Why paste on a theme that actually makes the game even less interesting? I like China which has some very similar mechanics, but didn't waste time with fleshing out a theme that makes it duller. I understand from others that there's a good game underneath, but a) I do have trouble getting past the theme, b) it seems very dry to me anyway, placing cubes in order to build up an engine to be able to place more cube or get back more cubes so you can, oh boy, place more of them, whoo hoo.

What I love-
The desk-like player-board that as you upgrade, give you more options and viable strategies. Multiple strategies to win make the game fun to explore the many different ways to score points. The blocking mechanism. The way I can get more pieces on the board by blocking the good routes, then use the Book action to move multiple pieces around the board... It's a strategy that most new players fail to see and may dislike it for that reason... Keep playing! My 12-yr old twins love this game.

What I Dislike-
You can definitely be out maneuvered by a skilled player.( but that's part of the game.) game can end earlier than you wish if a player rushes claiming the 'improvement routes' leading to small networks, (but again, it's one of the strategies; I just prefer maxing everything out, but in this game, you need to stay focused or the game will end when you aren't ready. 

After 10+ plays
The most amazing game design ever. Strategic as well as tactical. The most interactive Euro you are likely to play. This game gets better with every play. I cannot say that about any other game I've played. The Britannia expansion adds a whole new layer of strategies and also brings the other game end trigger to the forefront that is rarely reached in the first game, the full cities ending. Loving it!!!

A wonderful game.  Think China with a tech tree that governs how many pawns you can place, where you can place them, and how you score for them.

Like Endeavor, packs a meaty game into a very compact time frame.

VERY fun - VERY interactive. I know this is the definition of "dry, boring Euro" to some, but I think this one should be reconsidered by many. It has direct conflict and isn't just an engine building game.

I need to get some more plays of this! Difficult to get people to play considering the theme (Or lack thereof)

What it does, the game does well.
But there are other games out there that do it better. 
Terra Mystica comes to mind. (Now that I've played TM, I don't see why I'd go back to Hansa Teutonica.)

May 2012:  Game is slightly better, now that it is more understandable.

August 2010: I might try the game a third time, just to confirm that I truly dis-like it.  However there are so many other better games to play for a second time or discovery, so... no hurry

The classic "8" game: original, interesting, relatively simple even if there are a lot of things going on. At the beginning of the first game it's seems there's one way to the victory. At the end you understand there are many. 
Not too long, interesting till the end.
Update: i loved it even more the 2nd time: a lot of possible way to victory, a lot of possible interactions, not too long. Very good game!
This is better and better every time i play it. 9!

Got it new in shrink ding and dent for $22 when it was new.  Learned it by watching it taught in March '11.  Need to get it to the table one of these days.  Seems like a pure Euro cube pushing fest, with a light theme pasted on.  (Which doesn't bother me a bit).

In Renaissance Germany, complete routes between cities to claim an office. Some cities have special abilities or one-use disks. Action phase has interesting displacement worker placement options to change or take control of routes. Player boards with keys, letters, privilege, and bags can be unlocked for action and point upgrades. Pretty interactive.

I enjoy this game even though I only played it once yet. It combines worker placement and majority in a nice way. There seems to be a lot of different ways to win, and the replayability seems good! 
On the downside the theme is not very strong, and I never feel the urge to play it again. 
Gone down from 8 rating -> 7.5 after 2 plays

Een spel dat zo in de rij kan bij spellen als Ysphahan en Stone Age.

De spelers zijn allen ondernemers die de wegen tussen de hanzesteden exploiteren. De spelers hebben maar een paar basisacties om uit te voeren, maar ze kunnen daar zo veel kanten mee op dat het toch ongelofelijk veel uitdaging biedt. Kent jammergenoeg wel een beetje het risico van groepsdenken.

How is this game not fundamentally flawed?  90% of the game takes place on 10% of the board space, and the strategies seem to be fairly rote: going for extra actions if available, blocking, etc.

For me, Hansa Teutonica - and I don't say this lightly - is very likely the single most overrated game of all time.  I was expecting something less-than-stellar, admittedly, but I was not expecting a gaming experience that deeply wronged my soul.

After one play. Lots to do in this one. Claim roads, claim towns, upgrade your abilities, You have action points, number of bits to move, multipliers, and other stuff. It reminds me of the first time I saw Puerto Rico. So many options that I was confused the whole first game. I think this one will be a good one.

RATING: 8
A very good game. A solid 8 if not possibly higher. A great deal of complexity. There are many changing options towards victory. It is not an easy game to teach or learn at first, because of all that is going on. It is good to learn it from an experienced player. However, once learned the game is quite easy. 

The one issue with the game that is of constant concern is the issue where you place your cubes when they come off the board. One must keep track that all players place the cubes that come off the board into their pools rather than with their available cubes. This is a recurrent mistake which is not  intentional, but easy to do.

This game is somewhere between Brass and Terra Mystica to me. Obviously TM came out way after Hansa did, but the interactivity of it just rips.

It is group dependent.  It rewards the more competitive of players as well as cleverness.

Have played 3p and 4p so far and will wait for quite a few more plays before I rate this one. (update) 3p/5p is best IMO.  Keep the board crowded.

It does have legs and soul, I expect it will be very highly rated.

I really enjoy this game.  I'm definitely glad that many at the meetups have and want to play their copies of this game.  It plays in about a couple of hours.  I feel like I know what I need to do but also need to be flexible enough to change my plans based on the new board situation.

This is a fun game, it feels more like a mental duel, or a chess match, than it's supposed theme (putting traders on roads and completing routes) This isn't a bad thing, it is a ton of fun and very thinky, there is also a nice element of Chicken to it - Who's going to bump who from the road first? Or Who's going to pull their forces out and attack elsewhere? (Wait, now it sounds like a war game...)

If I had to re-theme this, it would become a Swords and Sorcery game.
Traders/Merchants == Swordsmen and Knights
The Move Action == Magical Teleportation
Upgrading your Desk == Completing Quests
... I could go on and on.

standard euro with development tracks and action points.  it has the flavor of Endeavor, with a different theme.  it was decent, and there are various routes to victory, but in the end, Euro-designers are running out of ways to make this style of gameplay very interesting.

Interactive abstract combined with Euro scoring. With tons of ways to score points and a cool ability improvment feature this is certainly a Euro gamer's Euro!  A nearly perfect information game that seems to scale well and play quickly with any number 2-5.  What a great game!  Bumped up to a 10 after playing 3 times at a Con and just wanting to play more.

RATING: 7
You know a game is serious about multiple paths to victory when there are no less than three different ending conditions.  Hansa Teutonica is a surprising title that came out of nowhere which feature an incredible amount of strategy and player interaction.  There is a lot to consider in every move, whether it be in the placement (and displacement) of pieces, claiming of routes or occupation of the cities.  Each decision seem to lend itself to the bigger picture and I can't imagine anything being done simply because there isn't a better option otherwise.

However, there are two reservations I have which prevent me from rating it higher.  First is in the seemingly imbalance of the skills.  Actions alone feels way too powerful and as a result usually becomes the most hotly contested spot from the start.  Even though it has been argued that one can remain competitive with just 3 actions, 4 will allow you to claim almost every paths on the map in a single turn unopposed.  Thus, it is essential that no one is allowed to take the action upgrade unchallenged, tying up valuable resources for several people.

The other is in the weakness of the tokens, both in their usefulness and as a direct result of the randomness in which they are distributed on the board.  Therefore, they are largely ignored and seen as a poorly conceived notion.  Why even bother including it if they cannot be employed as a viable strategy to win?

Anyway, these are just impression from a single play, so they may prove to be incorrect later on.  Definitely interested in exploring Hansa Teutonica further, seeing that we had fibbed on a couple of rules as well.

Update #1: Finally got a 2nd chance at this and I've subsequently lowered my rating.  I still think it has a lot of interesting mechanics, but I'm leaning towards the opinion that overall the game is not quite balanced than I would have liked.  For example, if most of the players are interested in advancing their personal skill tracks rather than claiming cities, most of the board remains empty with activities centered around certain routes and the victory condition will be reached ever so slowly.

Yes, there are many ways to score points, but there is usually a high chance that the strategy employed will be lob sided rather than balanced.  Therefore, a portion of the board becomes underutilized and even neglected.  To me, I think that is an indication of poor design, if the game board itself isn't used to its full potential every single time.

RATING: 5
After 5+ Plays: I enjoyed it more at first, but after a few plays I began to avoid it.  I think it suffers a lot from a static set-up, so that each game seems to follow the same path.  The beginning of the game is particularly boring, because everyone must of necessity focus on getting additional actions if they hope to have any chance of winning.  

-----

The expansion may improve this game quite a bit.  Just having a new map makes the game good for a few more plays, but the expansion map also seems to make other strategies viable, which hopefully will lead to more long term variety in how the game unfolds.

RATING: 4
Each plane has different stats and special abilites, and as they take damage, you 'click' them so their stats change.  A little cumbersome, but a pretty good game.  Hard to line up the front guns, and the game often becomes frustrating trying to get a shot off.  Better with more players.

RATING: 5
I really wanted to like this game: pre-painted miniatures, non-collectible, fun pulp background. But it just didn't quite gel for me. You're allowed to vary speed, but in practice I didn't see it much. The person-scale game was pretty much a cost-added distraction. Planes didn't always seem point-balanced. Death of a thousand cuts, basically.

RATING: 7
Own a nearly complete set, including the promo cards, namely -

6 Broadway Bombers (1 Ace, 1 LE)
6 Hollywood Knights (2 Ace)
6 Fortune Hunters (2 Ace)
5 Red Skull Legion (1 Ace)
4 Black Swans
1 Rajin' Cajun
1 Blake Air Security

I find this game to be more fun than Wings of War.  By far Wizkids' best 'clix game to date.

Also own FASA's 1998 ruleset.

This is a fun little dogfighting game.  We average at least one collision a game though, so we aren't the best pilots.  I love the design of the alt-history planes.  But since they never actually launched the booster packs, and there is no customization on the planes, this game just kinda stops getting played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Even using variants to improve the maneuver system, I'm not convinced this is a huge upgrade frm Wings of War. I realy think that what it gains in factions, special abilities, and unique units is kind of lost in the additional downtime. Which is odd, because I should love this sort of thing but I don't feel any mojo happening here.

RATING: 6
Fun game, but it dosen't exactly capture feeling of flight.  In some ways it works -- you have to plan ahead, guess what your opponent will do, throttle your plane's speed up or down, and manuever for a shot.  It feels like planes 'warp' around the table sometimes, as one plane's movement is completed before another begins; this can lead to missed firing opportunities.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Unbelievably dumb game system. How many degrees you turn is determined by how fast you're going. Not the *MAXIMUM* degrees you can turn, but the _exact_ number. No relationship to dogfighting at all. Still worse, they had the opportunity to introduce altitude with the "roller" on the click-base, but they put speed there instead.

This might have succeded with less-dumb rules (not simpler, just less-dumb--Pirates or Rocketmen) and if they'd made this a collectible game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This click base game remains one of my favorites of that genre.  When this game came out, it was unique in that it was collectible but not in the traditional sense.  You always knew what you were getting in the box and you could purchase just the squardrons you were interested in.  While this was great for those that wanted to play, it might not have helped their sales as there was not that "I have to get the rare planes" feeling you get from other games of this sort.  But as a game,it was unique and a lot of fun. I definitely need to play this again.

RATING: 7
I love that it's a collectable game without random, blind purchase--otherwise I probably would've stayed away from it all together.  As it is, I've acquired a complete set of all of the minis including the 4 limited models, Santa, and the Black Swans squadron.  Also I've put together a full set of the cards.

I haven't played much yet--on first impression I found the movement rules confusing, coming from Blue Max and the original FASA game I was used to simultaneous movement, and it seems to operate a little differently here.  Still it seems like a fun game and I'd love to play more.  Also the simpler mechanics make it a more likely game to find willing players.  Definitely the only clix game to grab my interest.

The models are GREAT for playing the original FASA game!

The actual gameplay is great - good blend of strategy and luck, and I like the Wizkids combat dials. Keeps the game flowing pretty quickly.
The main problem for me is the figures and the packaging. Maybe I&#039;m just poorly co-ordinated, but I bought the first two squadrons and the aces set and managed to break two planes on the way out of the box. Definitely need to keep the superglue handy...

The main problem with Wizkids games is that they have excellent concepts that are poorly executed. This game has lightning fast manouvers, and excellent speed checking mechanics, but the movement is awful with the placement of octagons to follow the patterns. Ideally, it would play excellently on a map, but i havent tried it myself...

RATING: 6.5
Simplistic but fast playing 2D aerial combat game.  The movement system is rather interesting as player lay down octogons as per the pattern on their maneuver card to find out where their plane will end its movement.  Firing and damage is straight forward, and damage is applies by clicking the target plane's base, thus reducing its capabilities.  Also comes with a bar brawl sub game.  Anyone who has played a WizKids type game before should have no problems stepping into this one.  But don't expect a realistic battle, as the game is set in the "Crimson Skies" alternate universe.  It is still enjoyable, and a game can be played in under 30 minutes.

This game really should have taken off.  (Heh.)  I love the Crimson Skies universe, but the air combat game is a bit clunky with the multiple tile flight paths.  Wings of War took this concept and did it right.

I got two sealed if slightly faded blister packs in a flea market for 10 euro the pair, and then tracked down a sealed base rule set on ebay for $5 (though shipping took it up to $25. Basically I've got a playable two-player for about the cost of an out of the box off the shelf game, so that's okay. The minis are lovely, and I did enjoy the old XBox game. God knows if anyone will ever play it with me (with X-Wing going strong, it would seem a stretch), but I have a playable game anyway.

In my opinion, the best Wizkids miniature game.  I've tried several, and Crimson Skies is the only one I've actually spent my money on.  The rules are fairly simple and easy to learn, yet complex enough to allow for several different strategies.  The minis themselves are nicely painted, colorful, and fun to use.  All in all, a fun and enjoyable tabletop miniatures game.  I only rated it a seven because Wizkids seemed to have let this game whither and die so there will be no new miniatures or scenarios.

RATING: 4
Fun game with no downtime (if playing on a hex map) or incredibly fiddly and downtime-filled otherwise. Recreates the feel of a dogfight fairly well, although it is on the lighter side of things. Rating would be higher if more diverse maneuver cards were provided with the game. Laying down the path cards can be quite fiddly though, and I don't like the diminishing stats as planes get hit -- this has a tendency to make the first few shots have an outsized impact on the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I&#039;ve played this once.  While the production values are quite slick, the rules seem half-developed. Lots of ambiguities and the rule set is unclear on what else you need to buy to play the game (the rules box does NOT contain any planes).

Due to the simultaneous nature of the movement, the air combat portion can drag on while you try to manuever for a shot. Reminds me of a lesser 2D implementation of Ace of Aces.

Not nearly as good as the FASA rules.  I'm not a fan of miniatures games that don't use a grid.  It just makes fuzzy rules fuzzier.  The gameplay is lacking, but the planes look great.  It isn't really collectible either, so it's not hard to get the planes you want.

I really liked this game.  It has great theme, not randomly collectable, and was great for any number of players but... clicky games are good but this game would have benefitted from card based stats ala WarMachine or Star Wars minis.  Altitude rules are a needed to really appeal to air combat fans.

BTW, I need an extra set of Black Swans and I need the promo silk stocking and signed 8x10 to complete my set.

Loved the setting of this game, a bit "deiselpunk-ish" before steampunk was so vogue. Never played the FASA game but saw this as my entry into the universe. Unfortunatley that entry was as the game was dying. It did allow me to collect a complete set including promo figures and cards. Never really got to play beyond small demo games with half hearted participants. Let it go in gaming purge of '10.

The air game is too slow playing for the air combat it's meant to represent. Wings of War takes a similar approach (preplanned moves) and executes it much better. The ground game is kind of fun, though it boils down to mooks collapsing left and right with just the heroes left to duke it out in the end (fitting for the genre).

Classic FASA-style game: some great ideas that are not fully developed.  In particular, the minis and click base are fine, but the initiative system and choice of maneuvers is far too limiting.  I've done some work on a new maneuver system, and so far it's working.

Have complete set sans AP4 and SP5? It's not a bad clix game really: I like how the game can be played like the original RPG. You can have scenarios and air battles as well as ground skirmishes between personalities. The sculpts are quite decent and the ruleset is well done.

Gameplay is a little fiddly because of the movement tokens used (Wings of War captured movement in a far more elegant fashion) but the clix mechanic makes up for it.

Fun for a "clix" game, with a nice movement system. Our six player game seemed a bit slow, but then we were all learning the rules too. Playing this made me want to try out Wings of War some time.

The secret to this game:  bring your planes in at a slow speed, as it is almost always better to move and fire second - as you can wait to see where your faster opponent ended up, then position yourself accordingly.

A very different feel and rules from other clix games; fast playing, and the non-random is GREAT!  On the downside, constantly checking the combat dial and trying to remember what all the colors mean is a pain.

Bought it because it looked cool.  I was all ready to get going with it, both the character and the air combat games, when it fell out of favor. The story of my life to a large extent.  I have most of the character sets, and even a partial case of one group that I got on Ebay when you could get full case lots fairly cheap.  I also have a complete set of the aircraft packs, rules, and carrying case available if anyone is still looking for these.

Beautifully crafted minis make this game a piece of delightful eye-candy. Game play is straightforward and fun. It would be nice if there was someway to capture changes in elevations between plans. Making it a more than a two-dimension movement game would be a plus.

RATING: N/A
I loved the video game (still do now that it's backwards compatible!), so I'm hoping this is a fun tabletop take on it. It almost seems obsolete with the X-Wing/Star Trek/D&D take on minis dogfighting, but I do love the look and atmosphere of Crimson Skies. It was cheap, at least.

The Aces game seems pretty pointless, especially since I have the TMNT Clix if I feel like playing Clix. 

Have the Fortune Hunters & Red Skull Legion squadron packs, and Aces pack 2 & 3 to go with them.

I wanted to like this newer version.  I really did.  But having played it several times, all I can say is that the superb Crimson Skies boardgame from FASA really didn't need this "merging" with the Wizkids' dial game mechanics.  The quirky cards and clumsy tiles laying system they use for movement in this one just didn't measure up to the original boardgame's maps and movement system, although it's obvious that's what they were trying to copy and improve upon with this inferior game.  

On a positive note, the miniature fighters for this game are near perfect scale for use in the FASA game once you put them on a proper base.

I was really excited when this game came out.  The minis look fantastic, the theme of pulp aviators was right up my alley.  It is an OK game.  I actually haven't gotten to play it nearly as much as I'd like.  I might rate it higher with more plays. - One note - be very careful with the knobs - of all the Wizkids games I've had the most problems with these minis - the paper coming dislodged from the spool - you need to go in one direction only to help prevent this (as I recall it does mention that in the rules but being used to other Clix games I didn't pay enough attention to that at first...)

Crimson Skies is actually two different games in one package. There is an air combat game (which is the primary game) and a tactical skirmish game that uses miniatures of the pilots on the ground. The air game is well designed and does a very good job of portraying the exciting prop plane dogfights that the Crimson Skies universe revolves around. The ground based skirmish game on the other hand, is a joke that was clearly added as an afterthought. The game doesn't support enough miniatures to produce an interesting conflict, so the characters involved are mostly represented with tokens. It's just not visually appealing to have a large pre-painted hero miniature fighting off an army of 2 dimensional tokens. Yuck.

Getting back to the air game, I am surprised that it didn't sell better. The planes use the popular Wizkids click base to track stats and special abilities and the clever simultaneous movement system makes for very exciting dogfights. There is also a simple but exciting campaign system for leveling up your team of pilots, perfect for both raising the stakes of battle and for encouraging ongoing grudge matches . Overall, I think this is one of Wizkids' better games...although it's clearly one of their least successful.

UPDATE: I like the game and have most of the faction packs that were released, but honestly I'm almost never stricken with the urge to play it anymore. These days I prefer the excellent Wings of War from Nexus/Fantasy Flight, it has a very similiar feel but plays quite a bit faster and the historical planes are just far more interesting.

Excellent air combat game, and awesome theme.  One of Wizkids' best games ever.

The movement system can be a little tricky for some people to figure out, but it works great once you know what you're doing.  Vaguely reminiscent of the movement system in Wings of War, but still gives a completely different feel.


I used to have this rated a 10, but it's been so long since it last got played that I've started dropping it bit by bit.

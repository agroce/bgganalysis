Ordered from amazon.it. Got to brush up on my 2nd language!

Received; caution if ordering from amazon.it., the box that the game came in had nothing to buffer the package in the box. Mine had minor scuffs and didn't fare too badly but I could see these coming in damaged.

Worker placement game where you place your ships in a variety of locations (cards, which change each round, workers, building sites) over the course of 5 rounds of play.

The theme is ancient Egypt and the mechanic is worker placement, and it has a feeding of workers phase, as well as a resource maintenance phase (stone), so it doesn't sound like anything different at first glance.  What saves this game is a new twist, which is that once you place further down the river, you can't go back upstream- this has alot more impact on gameplay than you would think.  Also, the fact that the game plays smoothly and quickly helps alot.  Seems to scale well from 2-4 players.

Scoring is primarily accomplished through building a variety of different monuments (for which you need workers and stone), and also through acquiring Sphinx cards, which are end-of-the game condition points.

A very solid and possibly overlooked game.

LIKE: Tense decisions every turn. The cards for each round are powerful and make interesting decisions. One-way worker placement is a great mechanism. The farm-drought mechanism is a nice interactive "take-that" component.
DISLIKE: Hidden goal cards seem overpowered since players can hold many of them, and some seem unbalanced. Being stone-starved seems to be a game-ender. Lots of little rules that are easily forgotten.

OVERALL: I really enjoyed my play of this. Plenty of strategy and interesting ideas that still feels fresh. It's very similar to the game "Steam Time", but I like the farm/drought interaction in this for a slight edge.

RATING: 6.5
Not needed in my collection, but I respect the effort. It is a clean, smart worker placement game with an original mechanic (the up river selection). But beyond this, it has a terribly dull and diffuse theme and no other interesting ideas in my estimation. The Sphinx cards seem terribly over powered since some score highly little extra effort. Over all, a bit too middle of the road and ends up to be just an average, middle-light weight game. Good, but not great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The river mechanic in this worker placement is great (i.e. when taking an action all action spaces upstream from the placed worker are no longer available to you and only playing downstream is allowed on next turn). Thus in addition to the usual element of blocking your opponent, you might block yourself from getting what you need, and at least I found most decisions meaningful. It was also a nice change to the usual cube pushers that you only have one resource (stone) in the game, and you are using more time on building your capability to spend resources instead of trying to get your hands on them. 

Some people claim that the randomly drawn point cards have too big impact on the outcome. I have not played enough to confirm this but I am inclined to believe these arguments. The game does not offer too many any other ways diversify yourself from your opponents to a meaningful extent. I guess that without the cards all games would have very small margins because the basic VP generation cycle is a quite straightforward exercise of seizing the opportunity without too much engine building.

I really enjoy the mechanic of balancing how far down stream you will go but after several plays it seems like luck of the draw (especially the Sphinx cards) determines the winner too often amongst people who know the game well and slow players can drag this on for far too long.

RATING: 6
A pretty decent game.  I like the pawn placement down the nile - it creates some nice tension and balances with opportunity costs.  The path to victory is fairly linear.  Both games of this that I played I won by not having a clear idea of what I was doing and I just did whatever seemed best at the time.  Somehow that was good?  Also, at least in the second game, I top-decked the right Sphinx card in the final round, winning me the game.  That's nice and all, but seems like a flawed turning point.  My winning or losing should not be based on who top-decks the best card in the last round.  Then again, it does mean the game was very tight.  *shrug*  Overall it just doesn't grab me.  The engine isn't actually obtuse but it's not quite deep enough to offer different paths to victory.  The paths are far too similar and you could do a shotgun approach and still do very well.  Meh.

Le mécanisme du Nil est merveilleux et est très bien intégré à la thématique. Vous descendez le fleuve pour choisir vos actions mais vous ne pouvez remonter le courant. A noter que la moitié des actions sont permanents pendant le jeu et l'autre rive sont des cartes qui changent. 1 seule personne par action (sauf indications contraire). On a toujours l'impression de devoir faire des choix déchirants entre descendre plus vite pour avoir les meilleures actions ou descendre plus lent pour en avoir plus.

Deux ressources a gérer : La bouffe et les pierres.  La bouffe pour nourrir vos esclaves qui construisent les édifices avec leur force. Les pierres pour construire les édifices au bord du Nil (tombes, pyramide, temple). Négligé l'aspect bouffe peut être très dommageable...Et il faut que vos esclaves soient forts pour construire les étages les plus hauts

Some interesting twists on worker placement with building up the strength of your construction crews, limiting where you can continue to place based upon how far down the river you've set boats down, and semi-randomized variable cards granting special actions or new income sources that you can claim.

However, the rules are an abysmal mess making things super fiddly to figure out and the game is determined way too much by whatever Sphinx cards you happen to draw. For example, I spent the majority of one game completing a Sphinx card that I ended up missing by one stone (earning no points) while my wife had *three* Sphinx cards that actually scored from my work while she hadn't done a thing to complete them. Because of the cards, I actually spent the whole game winning her the game. It was weird.

It's all right. Sort of a standard worker placement. The river mechanism is clever and can add some tension but with two (likely less so with more) the monuments don't fill up. Feels a bit dry and I'm not sure if this would be an adequate gateway.

RATING: 7
Egizia reuses the Caylus road in the form of the river Nile and adds the neat twist that you can only place workers (boats) down stream from your last placement.  That generates tough decisions between racing ahead to grab that card or spot you really need or dawdling along doing as much as possible.  Aside from that, it features familiar euro elements of balancing a (mercifully) few resources and using them to build things that score victory points. 

A couple of gripes.  First, the rules are perhaps the most horrible set I've come across from the usually reliable Rio Grande.  112 threads in the rules forum speak for themselves.  Second, I find that the Sphinx cards add too strong a random element.  Some reward you for things you were doing anyway (collecting victory points?  Have another 10%) or that others have done (oh look, the seventh level of the Obelisk has been built!) while others demand significant time and effort for no greater reward.

Great game which is easy to play but involves a number of decisions to decide what to collect and what to build while at the same time balancing food with workers. The Egyptian theme works well, and having to place the next worker further down the Nile (not up) makes you think about what you can and can not afford to miss. Not so good with 2 players.

Another enjoyable worker placement game.  Here, players draft actions down a track of available options (from the beginning of the Nile river to the end) with the caveat that players are not allowed to backtrack up the river from where they had previously placed a worker.  

Plays better with more players and plays in a reasonable time frame so long as players prod each other along, minding for AP.

Since this is coming from Hans im Gluck, when compared to Stone Age, I find Egizia to be slightly more complex to teach to new players, but a lot less lucky due to the absence of dice in resource procurement.

Has great art and the components are well designed and laid out (which help to reduce clutter and confusion).

Overall, a good worker placement choice for people who find Agricola too fiddly or too long and Stone Age too linear and lucky.

Este juego estuvo en mi WL por siglos ya que me cost´´o decidirme a comprarlo pues otros 2 juegos de Acchitocca (Leonardo Da Vinci y Comuni) no habían tenido éxito en mi grupo al punto de tener que venderlos.
Sin embargo es un excelente juego que encantó a todos. El hecho de no poder volver río arriba hace que la  decisión de que acción tomar sea bastante ruda. Juego muy equilibrado con múltiples estrategias.

One downside, is that there are many subtle nuances that take a while to absorb.

Yes. Another worker placement game. How original.

Or isn't it? Egizia breethes fresh air into the seemingly stagnant worker placement genre by introducing cool new concepts, and by integrating some other tried-and-true mechanics, which until now were absent from WP games.

The "downstream" limiting factor of where to put your workers make for a very agonizing decision-making of whether to go for that special something you really need and lose the chance to get some other stuff, or wait and hope no one else takes it from you.

Plus, the scoring extras, while a bit random, add a nice bluffing element to the game.

Rating might go up with further plays, but for now, it's a solid 8 for me.

Update (July 29th 2011): I still enjoy it, but I haven't been able to come around the fact that the complexity of the game comes from sheer amount of possible decisions, not from an agonizing, manageable decision set (as do all games I rate really high). Down to a 7, because I still enjoy it.

Nagyon jó Egyiptomos játék, enyhén Caylus-os beütéssel. Ami tetszett, az az akciók felhelyezésénél a folyó irányából fakadó korlát. Az aszályos és csapadékos terület megoldása egy kicsit az Amun re-re emlékeztetett, de amott jobb volt. A kártyák nagyon nagy hangsúlyt kapnak, ha nem szerzünk szinte minden körben egy jobb fajtát, akkor nehéz nyerni.
Egy hibája a játéknak szerintem a sírhelyek. Mivel az elején randomra kerülnek a helyükre, így előfordulhat, hogy túl nagy lesz mindjárt a legelső, így végig hozzájuk se nyúl senki.

Nice game in the lines (and looks also) of Stone Age. Deeper than Stone Age since more cards and more spaces to put workers on exist, no luck involved, all strategy here.

I must admit: I am a sucker for beautifully illustrated boards. Egizia has a wonderful board, reminiscent of the best Michael Menzel's, so it was a no brainer buy for me.
Beyond the graphics, though, there's a nice and very playable game of worker placement: a genre my GF and I love playing together.
The game is probably not at its best with only 2 players, but it will probably see a lot of play with that number. Initial rating is a 7, but could raise if it stands repeated plays and if it will prove even more engaging with 3-4.

First Impression: This is an interesting workplacement game with simple enough mechanisms that it can act as a gateway game.

The creators of Leonardo have followed up with another winner.  There are definitely some random elements such as the drawing of Sphynx cards and also the order in which the Nile cards appear.  Egizia is sort of the worker placement version of Amun-Re.

First Play. Rules were explained by a player who had played once before. The game structure seemed logical, he had identified the rule glitches and we just needed to check a few points during the game.

With a full compliment of 4 its a tight struggle wanting to do more than the options allow (always a good sign). With multiple paths to scoring points its tricky to monitor what opponants are up to but there are opportunities for very effective screwage.

There are very clever balancing mechanisms and our game ended with a first to last 5 point spread. 

A very impressive game and definitely my sort of challenge.

I initially wasn't very interested in this game as it was another worker placement game and another game set in ancient Egypt. But after playing this I have to admit I was wrong. While it may not be the most original or engaging theme and mechanics, the designers have managed to give these elements a whole new twist. The fact you're only allowed to place ships downstream makes for really agonizing decisions. There are a lot of different strategies possible as there are tons of ways to score points. Gambling on the Sphinx cards can really pay of but you have to have a bit of luck. All in all a very solid worker placement game which in my opinion has earned its place in the genre.

There's enough going on in this one to make it pretty interesting.  The role selection down the nile is quite clever.  After one play where I benefitted from the sphynx bonus cards late, I feel like there could be a bit too much swing with these.  Overall, a quality game!

Fun worker placement game. Stone Age players who want more of the same, but different, should look into this. The Nile mechanic makes for a tight game. It doesn't scale that well, in fact, few things are changed when playing with fewer players which means that it is a bit too easy to get what you want in a 2 o r player game. With 4 players, the game is really tight and works best IMO.

Only played on Yucata.de so far but I found this very enjoyable. An almost pure worker (boat) placement game with the twist that you must always place your next boat further down the river than your last one, so you are caught between racing for the few places you really need to get or placing slowly and hoovering up more resources.

I am sure this will get several more plays.

As unoriginal as a multitude of identical games are, Egizia doesn’t feel any different from any other cube-pusher you already chanced to stumble into: over the game you’re allowed to take a series of actions provided that you follow illogical rules and, of course, you feed your people. How exciting!

All in all I can’t nor will say it’s a bad game: it’s simply devoid of any fun.

A different type of worker placement.  Similar to alot of other ones but still felt different.  This could go eitherway, it could be really good, or just good. The selections are tense and you can snake points out of everything.  I can see  where this would be good for all numbers. 

Bumped to an 8.5 fm 7.5.  Now that I've played this it does work well with all numbers.  Most of my plays have been with two.  Still very good and with two you can have more control on getting to places.  Awesome game.  At one time, I thought it needed more cards but it has the right number.  Only a couple of cards do not make the board but you know what is coming for the most part...just not in what order.

Nice building and worker placement game. The place-only-downstream mechanic always keeps it interesting and the idea that turn order is based on your current score makes this even more tense. However, the Sphinx cards are seriously imbalanced. First, you need them to stand a chance of winning, but every turn one player doesn't get one, second there are some which are much better than others (+10 % points, for example). Draw + 2 Sphinx cards further advances this problem. Take these 2 out of the game and you will be fine.

Update 2011... Too intense and too long, considering that much of the game hinges on luck-of-the-draw for Sphinx cards.  Also, the 1pt for every 10pts Sphinx card should be removed since it's pretty much an automatic 8-11 points. 

I wanted to like this game, but doing well in the game depends too much on luck of the cards (in the Nile decks and the Sphinx deck).  The game has lots of tactics... tense moments and tough decisions... but, ultimately, it feels like the lucky person or the experienced player who knows a bit more about the types and distribution of cards will end up doing better.  The point swings from the Sphinx cards can be quite large... in fact, it feels like the point values on the Sphinx cards are unbalanced.

For newbies, the rules are fairly complex and you cannot just gloss over them and start playing or else you end up with tons of questions that bog the game down.

The mechanics of this game are well constructed.  Not a lot of new things here.  However, I liked the game as I had a good idea of how to function smoothly and do what I wanted to do.  I was also able to identify when I made mistakes.  The decisions are not vast and tend to be linearly affected.  Most of the time, it's take the best choice of the next four options on the river, with building sites weighted more.

RATING: 9
Really tense and interesting game from the very beginning.
The river down mechanic for worker placement is brilliant!
Best experience imho with 4 experienced players. Very tight then, best balance for the sphinx cards and highlights the enjoyable deduction aspect which might be overlooked often enough. 2 players is totally different and still very good for introducing the game, but I prefer 4 players clearly.

A bit more editing for balancing cards better would have been great imho to reach the full potential of the game. 

Imho that's why it is not as well-known and high rated as it could have been.

Update: I've learned to enjoy 3 player games as well. My strategy article:

Another worker placement game where you try to convert resources into victory points. The main novelty is the river mechanism, which provides tougher choices than  games of similar weight, such as Stone Age. It feels like some bonus cards are stronger than others, so luck of the draw could be a factor.

RATING: 8
The sleeper under-the-radar game of Essen 2009. Nothing original here (another worker placement mechanic) but it seems to come together.

It was a pleasant surprise discovering this little beauty. An interesting cascade of action selection.

The game presents with a sequential order of some 20 actions. In turn order,you select an action. Once you've gone down the list, you cannot go back up the list of actions.So there is rush to be the first one to get to an action, but that means bypassing other actions and having less actions in total because you have gone further down the list. The angst is quite good.

Update: 7.5 -> 8.0 the angst is very good. The group liked it. It plays in 1h15m to 1h30m!! 

Update #2:  
I've played the game 10 times now. Experienced players know that sphinx cards win you the game. So naturally, everyone goes for their share of them. If players get their proportional share of sphinx cards, it comes down to the luck of the draw. The swings in the sphinx cards are too large IMO. I've played a game in which I had 6 sphinx cards that were fulfilled whose total was less than another player's 3 cards. My 6 cards  were worth 3 to 7 points each, which again was less than the winner's 3 cards that were worth 10+ points each. (I drew 4-5 cards each turn). I've also played games where I had the "+2 sphinx card" and on 2 occasions drew 5 cards each time and NONE of the 10 cards' conditions could be filled by me, thus causing me to lose the game to another player that had 3 cards that were worth 10+ each. 

It comes down to luck. To me, this makes Egizia a good game instead of a great game. I still like the game a lot for the anxiety of the decision making. But I know that my best choices will beat another player's best choices only because I got lucky with my sphinx cards.

YMMV.

Update 8 -> 6. Revisited this June 2012: dropped rating from Aug 2010 from 8 to 6. The Sphinx cards just totally break the game. I love everything else about it. SN has suggested drafting face up sphinx cards. Willing to give it a chance to see if that fixes the game; otherwise I'm through with it.

Update March 2013 (raised from 6 to 7): Played with variant of face up Sphinx Cards, so made the game better.

Update January 2017. Yet another revision to its rating. Bumped from 7 to 8. We played with the face up sphinx cards again and this seems to do the trick. It largely balanced the huge luck swings.

RATING: 4
Only played online (with 2 and 3 players) and I didn't like it.

The random drawing of Sphinx cards throughout the game bothers me a lot. This game has a similar feel to Stone Age, both being worker-placement games with a (pre-)historic theme, where you have to feed your workers to build stuff and and to buy cards that grant you abstract ways to gain victory points. And I would always choose Stone Age over Egizia, because the open market of cards works so much better than drawing Sphinx cards at random.

Pretty much the only mechanic that I really like in this game is that you're only allowed to place your workers downstream along the Nile. This makes interesting decisions where when you want a card badly (such as the almost brokenly good "+2 Sphinx cards" or "+10% VP" cards) you can jump ahead to take it, but in turn you lose access to the options upstream. But I feel like this lacks a way to make good card appear more towards the end of the Nile, like if the remaining (i.e. unwanted) cards from the previous round be placed at the top of the river for the next round.

It's fun and can be a bit of a brain-burner while you are trying to guess where the other players might move and how best to optimize your moves.  That is typical of most worker-placement games, but it seems even more intense in Egizia.  Having to give up stuff you want in order to ensure you get something you really need is classic.  I like it!  Sphinx cards are a bit of a crap shoot, but I don't mind them.  Now I need to go back and play Stone Age again!

Similar to a number of Egyptian themed games - build up your workforce and gather enough food and stone to feed them and build pyramids and other monuments - and mechanically similar to other worker placement games - use your men to choose actions or card or turn resources into victory points - yet the 'sailing down the Nile' twist adds that little extra dimension and the rest of the design is so smooth that it still feels fresh.  An enjoyable experience, once you get past the rather woolly rules.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another cool take on worker placement.  Players are placing workers along a path of options.  The "catch" is that once you place a worker on the path, you next worker must be placed further down the path than your previous one.  Since there can generally only be one worker per space, this creates some interesting tension, since if you reach for a space that you really need, you may have to skip over a whole bunch of other spaces, with no opportunity to go back and get the stuff you had to skip.  However, if you go down the path too slowly, there is a good chance that someone else might get something further down the path that you really wanted!

Other than that, the game is pretty standard fare.  The action spaces mostly grant you workers, stone, spaces to turn those workers and stone into points, and food.  You'll need workers and stone to build stuff for points, and food to feed your workers to keep you from starving them and losing points.

Overall, I like these sorts of games, so I enjoyed it quite a bit, and there enough twists to this one to make it worth owning alongside other worker placement games.

See my review for details.  Egizia is a good game, does some things very well and plays well with 2, 3 or 4 people.  My main beef is that there is too much luck in the Sphinx and between players of comparable skill this will frequently decide the outcome.  The problem is reduced (but not eliminated) by removing the +2 and +10% cards, as discussed in the forums and in my review.

[i]Egizia[/i] is the kind of terribly generic Eurogame that often makes me ashamed of self-identifying as a Eurogamer.  Nothing more than a collection of assorted mechanics of varying cleverness and novelty slapped together as if to cohere in their lack of synergy.  At least it’s short and innocuous.  If I had to play again, it’d have to be at the request of a friend.

Franken-game combining the Caylus-type placement mechanism of moving down a path, Caylus-type favour tracks, Stone Age-type collection of resources for VP, card-drafting for end game bonuses a la Princes of Florence, and Blue Moon City-type first in line gets to build for cheaper.

If you have been playing games for a few years then there is nothing to see here and you would likely enjoy the standards listed above more than you would enjoy Egizia.  If you are new to boardgames then this may hold some interest.

This is basically one of those soulless mechanical little euros, but with a fantastic mechanic that lifts it out of the muck. Kind of reminds me of stefan feld games in that regard. Being forced to move downstream creates a real tension between getting there first, and getting lots of stuff. It also creates meaningful interaction, as you always need to guess other people's plans and try to take advantage, and also try to shut people out of stuff they need. I do feel like this could eventually be used in a better game, but for now, I am enjoying it.

Personally I find Egizia quite interesting; so does my brother, but we are the only ones in our play group and in our family who do so. As it doesn't play particularly well with just 2 players (for instance because you can both build in each spot so a lot of tension disappears), and since Egizia OOP and I therefore could get a nice amount of cash for it, I decided to sell it as one of the very, very, very few games I do like a lot but have still sold. 

What do I like about it? Well, it's a worker placement game, which is my favorite mechanic. Egizia adds a different perspective on the genre as you can never go back once you have placed a worker, which was a mechanism I loved!

The secret goal cards were very interesting and made for vastly different games and strategies. Most of them are balanced though the one which gives you a point for every 10 points is certainly not as you don't have to do anything to achieve it... I know people say that it should be removed from a 2 player game or nerfed, and I definitely agree. But I also think it's too powerful even in a 4 player game, as you probably score ~80-90 points and hence it's on par with the other point scoring cards, but again the difference is that you don't need to do anything to achieve it... Other than this card, I do feel that most of the cards are balanced (though the grave cards are often hard to accomplish). 
Speaking of cards with unequal strength, I also need to say that some of the nile cards you can get along the way seem way more powerful than the others; especially the "draw 2 extra sphinx cards" seems very good, but it's not the only one. If it turns up as one of the first cards, I think there is a small first player advantage which isn't made up for with the 1 additional stone the other players receive in clockwise order. But I guess that if people really want a card they sometime have to skip other good stuff, so it's not that bad. And after all I put Egizia on par with Stone Age as a gateway worker placement game, and Stone Age definitely has a lot of luck too, probably even more.

The building of the monuments and the decisions you have to make about when to place your ship and where to place you building materials (I guess especially in the Pyramids) were big plusses in my book as they were very interesting. In general the way the WP works is tense as you can never go back, so you have to decide if you want to go a long way down the Nile for a good card/position on a building track or not.

Finally, in general I liked how you needed to keep a balance between your workers, food and stone production and how you are punished if you cannot feed your workers (which is a great mechanic, just take a look at Agricola)!

The game only lasts 5 rounds and takes about an hour (one and a half max with 4 players) which is a great length for a game of this (medium-low) complexity. Now that I write this I see how much I actually like Egizia, so if it ever gets a reprint, and I can play it with another group who likes it, I will most likely purchase it again.

Interesting worker placement game that I have grown to like a lot. Love the hidden goal cards in the game it allows for mystery of what players are working towards. It also makes the score unpredictable, which I like. It's different than anything I have played. The card row changes every game so it should make the game replay value good. Some cards do seem overly powerful but I still like what this game brings.

RATING: 8
A unique blend of a few different game mechanics, including worker placement, resource allocations, and card (not hand) management.  With a finite end, and a limited number of actions, this game plays very well to my liking.

If you hate games whereby people can interfer with your strategy without even trying, then this is not the game for you.  Many times, the best option for you is the best option for your opponent as well, and the screwage just comes naturally.  If you don't like games like that, then avoid this altogether, as it will innevitably happen more than once.

Nothing incredibly new here, but a pretty solid game. Yet another worker placement title, but the "wind down the river" mechanic is clever enough that it felt like new decisions to make (and as an aside, have I actually played enough games now to say 'nothing really new here??' Yikes. I'm such a pompous hardcore gamer!)

Outside of winding down the Nile, the rest of the game is pretty abstract, and there's a few layers of scoring that add to decision making but didn't have an immediate tie to theme (at least for me). Solid enough that I'd certainly play this again.

Stone Age 2.0?
Uh, no.  More like "Fully Euro-ized Stone Age" with its lack of dice, multitude of status tracks and detailed in-game/end game/shared scoring.  Put away the fucking spreadsheet and gimme some damn resource bits!  This game is for people who like dry toast.

First play was a 2-player game.  The soil hydration ring was never a factor and didn't limit grain production for either of us.  With 2-player, the rule of not taking further actions from up river wasn't a real issue either.  The game is solid, just not fun.

This is more like it Hans im Glück! A real game here. Unlike the "other" new HiG game, the terrible Titania. Egizia is about the same weight as Stone Age. But rather than fighting over scoring bonus cards for big points at the end, you can acquire hidden bonus cards. Lots of ways to get points. Nifty mechanic here is that it's worker placement, but it follows a path (river), and you can never place a worker upstream of your last worker, which means the faster you go down, the fewer workers you will place. Much less randomness than Stone Age, but a little less aproachable as well. Still a keeper I think.

RATING: 6
My first game of Egizia was a bit of a disappointing occasion, but as I write this comment I realise what tripped me up. But I can be objective to a point. In short: Egizia is a fairly short yet fairly intense worker placement game set in ancient Egypt ... (you there! wake up!) ... where the players place workers to a) construct the various major future tourist attractions; b) feed the workers; and c) obtain bonus cards which get the rabble more points. I found it interesting to reflect on the difference between Egizia and Acchittocca's earlier attempt to do a worker placement game, Leonardo da Vinci. There isn't even competition. Where Leonardo is clunky, constructed and creaking like a rusty chain over worn cogs, Egizia purrs along with smooth and satisfying little clicks. Think of [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0uoeZwCOCY]this famous scene[/url] ... (what do you mean [i]I don't know that scene[/i]?)... and picture Leonardo as the crummy revolvers, and Egizia as Tuco's new piece. 

The authors have decided to make the game of Egizia 'compact' (or intense or...) in the sense that the game is over once the (very) small player engines seem to be running at speed. There are no pauses, you do what you have to do and then the game is done. That is a fairly pleasant feature, but also brings up the question of the influence of randomness in the various numerous card draws. There isn't much room for taking it slow for a bit, but the game might still push you on to do stuff you don't really want to do. The jury's still out.

Now we come to the part I didn't really enjoy. I was mostly locked out of food for most of the game, and picking up some would have forced me to skip about three-quarters of the Nile on two occasions. I felt that was too great a sacrifice. So whenever the other players got into a bit of a scrape over a few points due to lack of food, I got [i]royally[/i] shafted. The winner clocked nearly 90 points; I didn't even make 60. I had lost about 25 points due to not being able to feed my worker force. Later I realised that I had taken Egizia's subject too seriously: it allows for 'rock dinner' strategies just like Stone Age. Personally I'm not fond of such an illogical way of playing the game, but it would probably have worked a lot better than what I eventually ended up doing. Food is merely a penalty you can be flexible about, nothing more.

Would I play again? Yes, likely. I'm not sure whether the point engines offer enough replayability for more than a dozen games or so, though.

[b]Update[/b] Second game in, paid attention to food and point sources this time. Was in the lead for most of the game, but lost by 10 points to the eventual winner(s) who focussed more on building later stages of monuments with strong work forces, and having a shitload of prestige cards. That is now one aspect I'm not too fond of: there's too much stuff here, stuff there, stuff everywhere in these cards, and playing well depends greatly on knowing what is still in the draw decks. But it all seems to work together smoothly in a way which had me grinning at what I previously wrote about the scene from [i]The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly[/i].

4 players: Extremely high tension, and competition for the cards and spaces.  Really enjoyable.

3 players: (Have not yet played yet)

2 players: Tension is low, but due to the various options in building and different ways to acquire points, strategic play is still required (Similar to stone age in that aspect).  Still is balanced though, and the game comes close when players of similar skill level are playing (my wife beat me by 7 points in our first game).  

Update: Traded away. For this game's type and weight, there is another choice I would always rather pick before.

I want to like this game.  I really do.  But it just doesn't feel like it's different enough from the worker placement games I've played before.

The one unique mechanism is players place their ships (workers) along the Nile, but can't go back along the river (unless you have a special card).  Along the way you collect stone and grain, feed your workers, and contribute to building monuments.  Guiding your progress are Sphinx (bonus) cards.

It's a perfectly fine game, but I don't see a reason for me to own it.  I've got a number of other games that I think do the same thing better.

However, many of the cards seem to be balanced for 4 player games only. In 2 and 3 player games, too many cards are next to useless and some overpowered. This is a problem especially due to the importance of the randomly drawn Sphinx cards.

This is a great game.  The board guides the game very well for most of the play.  The instructions are less than perfect, though.  After two plays there were still rule checks, but most were quick and painless.  It is a very competative game with a lot of choices and special power.  The hidden scoring at the end is well done.  This one hits a good spot for me.

An interesting euro. The go down the river and can't come back mechanic is a good one, especially combined with the playing chicken aspect of trying to get the best spots before they were gone. Unfortunately the other half of the game and the point of it, the building, is not interesting at all and detracts from the rest. The uneven scoring cards also give the feeling that the person who wins got the luckiest draw. All in all, ok but nothing special.

Very fun little worker placement game. Having to take actions in "downstream Nile" order makes for a lot of good decisions.

There's one bonus card (the endgame 'add 10% to your total score') that is twice as powerful for 2 players as it is for 4 players. We cut that bonus in half playing with two.

A solid worker placement game. I am curious about replayability as the board doesn't change and there are only two cards in each round that don't come out. It's good game but didn't blow me away. I actually like Stone Age better.

After 1 play:
I enjoy the mechanic of trying to decide whether it is better to make 1 really good move, or lots of mediocre ones.  That's what the game boils down to.  Which actions are a must...and how much you want to press your luck to pick up other actions in addition to the one you really want.

The cards seem very powerful.  Definitely need to place a good amount of focus on them.

Egizia is a light worker placement game that was released in Germany at Essen 2009, but did not make it over to the USA until recently. In it the players are each involved in building some of the monuments of Egypt, using various spaces to advance their stone production (required for the building of monuments) or food production (to feed work crews), or various special power cards. Players earn points by building monuments, with stone to victory points being a straight one to one conversion, however there are enough twists based on individual sites, to avoid some of the blandness of Stone Age. 

Overall I liked the game well enough, but it did not engage me enough to be a game I would ever describe as a favorite. As it currently stands this is a game I would willingly play on occasion, but I do not need to own. This weekend I am passing my copy on to a friend who will enjoy it more than I, with whom I can still play it periodically. I think this is the ideal situation for all involved.

Players manage a workforce, quarry stone, and participate in building projects along the Nile.  Players on their turn place their ships on spaces along the Nile to action those spaces, and deny them to others.  Spaces are either round (grow your workforce, and play with the local markets and harvest conditions), rectangular (take a card for some sort of bonus ability), or a building site (construct the Sphinx, Pyramids, etc for victory points).  Fairly standard worker placement game ... place stuff, gather stuff, feed people, build stuff.  A couple of nice things are the presentation, which is glorious, and the "downriver" placement restriction which creates some real anguish.  I'm a little concerned that you MUST visit the sphinx every turn, as those end of game bonus cards are very lucrative.  A real melting pot of other games ... I can see bits of Keydom, Blue Moon City, Princes of Florence, and so on inside this one, but hey, with that to draw you're going to end up with a pretty solid game.  Plays as on open and friendly two player point grabbing game, or a tense and tight four player game.  Worth a look.

I've seen this called "Stone Age 2.0," which I don't understand - there's no real relationship, at least none more than say with Caylus, Agricola, Pillars of the Earth, etc.  This game stands alone with all these names and takes a nice twist on the worker placement element.  You sort of push your luck, but then still have control over the flowing river...beautifully laid out and neat to watch your little economy grow!

A basic worker placement game with a neat mechanic - place your meeples down the river, never able to place up river from a previous placement. I like the idea, but the theme feels weak and plays pretty slowly. Very dry worker placement with some obvious moves that cannot be ignored.

Relatively fast-playing and quite fun. Would enjoy another crack at this.

Sphinx cards too powerful and make it too luck based?  I don't think so.  I consider Egizia to be Stone Age version 2.0 - slightly more complex, but more strategic as well, and a more satisfying game.  Great worker placement with some excellent twists that limit ship placement, and promote variable long term strategies.

This is one of those games with mechanisms borrowed from other games that works well enough, but ultimately doesn't add up to anything new per se to warrant adding to my collection. I liked the one-way worker placement and the choices that mechanism offered, but I was put off by how important the Sphinx is and how varied the bonus point cards were. Seems that bypassing the Sphinx is not an option but a must-do each time you can so you can get the better of the scoring cards. I had some for a few points while my opponent's cards were for number of workers (9) and other things that greatly increased his score. I'd play it again, but my first impression was that -- among equally skilled players -- it'd come down to who fished out the best bonus cards from the Sphinx. 

Reading comments on BGG, it seems that others agree that some of the bonus cards are imbalanced and some people play without certain cards. This reinforces my point about the Sphinx and doesn't excite me to play again.

Nice "family" game, wide possibility you have to choose but light rules. You have do to a lot of decisions and I like the pressure given by the opponents to secure the best places on the way down the river. That's tricky till the end. All five rounds to play have the same pressure, same eagerness, no boredom till the end. This is raw in the most games available in the market. And with all the different possibilities you could choose also in the last round, the game will end most times close between all players. Some small luck is included by drawing the "bonus" (Sphinx) cards, but this you could also stearing a little bit, because you could decide how far you will go by the drawing. (You have to pay each additional card you could choose from, and so you could limit the output. You could avoid "not so good" cards and rise the possibility to get a better fitting card for the ending.

A nice game I could recommend to Euro-Games Groups and Families with "older" children. You should try this.

I like this game a lot. The river mechanic is very interesting as you have to balance getting what you need with timing down the river, go too far and you can’t go back upstream.

The water ring is a little underwhelming in this game but the other mechanics are very nice the stronger your work crews are the more they can build which means the more brick you need but the stronger they are the more they need feeding. Striking the right balance is key.

TH/purchased 2010/arrived 2011

Really excellent rule book with easy to follow rules and easy to teach.  Well supported theme.  Interesting board. Plays in little over an hour.  

Interesting decisions involving the mechanic of taking actions by placing ships on the Nile.  Your ships are coming down the Nile & must be placed somewhere below one another. Each placement selects an action, and then that action is gone.  It is a tough decision when your most timely or important action is near the bottom...and there are lots of juicy choices along the way...but who else might try to grab it first?

Replay-ability: Each game is a different mixture of Nile cards and Grave tiles, and a choice of different goals to reach.  Due varying, secret goals, it is uncertain who wins until the end of the game.  The winner might be someone who trailed behind on the score track the entire game.

This has become one of my favorite worker placement games. The one mechanic of not being able to place a new worker upstream from my last placement adds a whole new layer to the mechanic, and a whole lot of tension. There is significant luck in the matter of which Sphinx cards players draw, but this can be mitigated by spending extra stones at the Sphinx. Games can get mean as players try to limit which food cards can come into play by moving the water ring closer to drought, so it's not for the extra-sensitive.  It can be a little mathy near the end, and it's not quite as granular as my ideal worker placement game would be, but it's close.

I like it slightly better with 3 people as there are more options open to the players, but 4 is fine too.

Nagyon régóta szemezek a játékkal, mivel a szabályok és fotók alapján úgy éreztem, hogy pont nekem való. Online játszottam vele párat és nagyot kellett csalódnom. Egyrészt szerintem feleslegesen túl van bonyolítva néhol: túl sok mindent lehet csinálni. Pl. hogy a kőbányára mi szükség van azt végképp nem tudom, de a többi rész is szerintem erőltett kicsit. ezen felül a szfinx kártyákkal hatalmas a szerepe a szerencsének. Ha egybevágóakat húzol, akkor csak egy helyen való építkezéssel egy rakés pontot szerzel, ha meg kitérőket, akkor sehogyse nyerhetsz. ezen felül a szfinx kártyák egyáltalán nincsenek kiegyensúlyozva a játékosok száma szerint. Vannak kártyák, amik értelmetlenek 2 játékossal (pl. hány játékos éri el a kőfejtő alját), és vannak olyanok, amik irreálisan sok pontot adnak ilyenkor. (pl.: pl a legtöbb száraz földerület után 8 pont. mikor ehhez ilyenkor elég egy kártya).
Adok neki még pár esélyt online, meg azért szeretném élőben is kipróbálni. Annyira vágytam rá, hogy szeretném valahogy megszeretni, de eddig nem sikerült.

Az élő négyszemélyes játék már sokkal jobban tetszett. 6.5->7

Pár újabb játék után egyre jobban tetszik. Kétségtelen, hogy lehet szinte tisztán mákkal nyerni, de azért vannak stratégiák ennek az esélyének a minimalizálására.

Egizia is a resource conversion worker placement game. Oh, one of those. Well, not quite. It does a few things rather differently than other games in the genre and those changes are sufficient to make the game stick out of the worker placement crowd.

The most prominent feature is the Nile that serves as a one-way street for your workers. Once you have occupied a certain spot you can only move downriver from there. All remaining spots upriver are now out of reach. One other thing Egizia gets right is that there are no artificially differentiated resource types. You want to build monuments, and to do that you need stone. Period.

The only real downside probably doesn't even apply to everyone: Card knowledge is a real advantage and quite likely means that new players will always be at a disadvantage.

As a worker placement game, I like Egizia! The Nile idea is real nifty (somewhat Caylus-like) and I felt constantly like I was making valuable decisions into optimal VP gathering. This is a deeper worker placement game than some and has quite a few parts and scoring areas to manage and consider. Some of the scoring methods feel a bit wonky, but overall I believe they are balanced.  They really should have supplied an overview card as one's memory can't be trusted to hold all the little details. The rulebook is also not greatly translated, with a couple of errors and blatant rule mistakes throughout. However, it is a valuable entry into the worker placement/card drafting genre and while there are some cosmetic issues that are irritating, the game really shines.

Classic game that has been imitated by many now.  Still holds up against games that have used its innovation.

Fun and tense as you want to jump ahead and grab good spots but you don't want to miss the necessary ones.  5 rounds goes quick, even with 4.  Where is the reprint publishers?  Please no retheme.. this one is just fine.

A very good game that gave me a lot of good time but I didn't feel thrilled while playing it. 'A hell of a good game' I was thinking, 'it's very good but why is it not great'? I have no idea. All the mechanics works perfectly, the gameplay is smooth, and there's only one problem - the game leaves me cold.

On the other hand there are not so many great games of this kind so if you like worker placement mechanics - give Egizia a try. It's definitely worth it.

RATING: 4
Preliminary rating after one play. Action drafting in a Euro buffet line, with no going back once you've passed something over. The very dreaded Secret Goal Cards make an appearance here, and as in Shipyard, one's success seems to hinge on fortuitous draws.

Update: Must choose Sphinx, must get draw goal cards, must never play again.

RATING: 8
Well constructed worker placement game.  Uses mainly existing tropes, but put together very well, easy to teach and hews pretty well to the theme.  Main concern is around the randomness of the sphinx card scoring, otherwise plenty of delightful decisions to make each turn.  Update - once you are aware of the cards and their range you can make more of an effort there - one strategy to nearly ignore it, but when you do go ensure a good selection seems as powerful as diligently collecting cards each turn.

Our house rules currently are to not include the '10% of all points' Sphinx card, and to place the 'get +2 sphinx cards' card in the 2nd half of the river when it comes out (ie isn't an auto-grab for 1st player).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This game is the perfect weight for me. There are tough decisions, but it's still fun. The mechanics fit the theme. You're not just pushing cubes; You're actually placing bricks to form pyramids, obelisks, etc. The sphynx gives you hidden agendas which could be compared to riddles. Workers are placed in a one-way only, linear fashion down the flowing Nile. This all makes sense. Egizia may have convinced me that medium-weight Euros are my favorite type of game.

I really liked the Nile and how you can only pick 'downstream'.  The Sphinx area ruins the game for me - getting points for other people's actions based on luck of the draw is poor design in an otherwise really well thought out and balanced game.  The Sphinx luck factor is really annoying.

Solid worker placement game. Finally had a chance to try it this weekend and enjoyed the experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The worker placement method is very cool. You must keep sailing down the Nile with each worker you place. So you can skip ahead to something juicy, but you'll limit your future selections in the process. Skip ahead too far or too often, and you won't even have enough useful places for all your workers.

But the cool river mechanism is somewhat wasted on a bland efficiency game. It's okay, I guess, but nothing you haven't seen several times before. Leonardo da Vinci (from this same design team) had more tension and more interesting planning. Egizia has more of the "Gamer's Game for Juniors" feel of something like Stone Age.

The Sphinx cards really drive the game - probably to an unhealthy degree, given their apparent imbalance. Late game Sphinx draws are gambles that might reward you with huge chunks of points, or might give you nothing at all. I found that element to be very poorly implemented.

Three plays with four and two plays with three, plus about four plays online at yucata.de. Great game that presents lots of interesting tactical and strategic decisions. There's a good amount of player interaction, and it's very satisfying when a plan comes off. If I had to critique it I would say that there are an excessive number of bonus-point-scoring rules and there can also be a dumb luck element with the sphinx cards, but I am happy to overlook those minor flaws. Rating could go up.

RATING: 8.5
Great medium weight game. There are plenty of choices but which ones you prioritise is up to you and if you get them is depending on your fellow players. Lots of interaction, nice theme as well. Rating after one tense 4player and one 3player game. However I think that a 2player will have a different feel. Worker placement may be not that innovative but there are enough twists that make it feel fresh and demanding not only because you have to feed your workers.
However I wished that there were 4 levels of water and not only 3 as this is too easy to control it.

Played twice with 3/4 players. Within the last few months I have been introduced to this game, Vasco De Gama and 20th Century. All 3 take 2 hours to play and have the same weight, they are each clever, unique designs and in each case I will probably only play them often enough to basically learn the rules. It is a shame that I can't offer these wonderfully designed games the time they deserve. It is harsh to say that Egizia, good as it is, only rates as average when compared to the other wonderful modern games in this class. Jan 11

Rated highly because it's a great gateway game.  The decisions become fairly automatic with experienced players, and the Sphinx cards often decide the winner.  Still, experienced players will move onto something more complex, so this game serves well.

RATING: 7
The rules and the number of options sound a little bit confusing at first but once you play it it is a rather smooth game.  I like the mechanic of "advancing worker placement":  Basically there is a row of action fields where you can place your workers (called ships here).   The new twist is that the action fields are ordered (1, 2, 3, 4 etc.).  Once you've placed a worker on field #4 you cannot place another worker on fields 1..3.  This adds an interesting new touch to the whole worker placement genre.

RATING: 7.5
One of the Top 5 from this year's Gathering. Interesting choices and nice twists on familiar mechanisms. Some are comparing this to Stone Age, and there are some similarities. It appears to have the same complexity level, and is equally (if not more) engaging.

RATING: 4
Interesting variation on the worker placement mechanic, with the restriction of always going downstream. There are agonizing decisions on skipping important spaces to take an even more desired card, but often luck seems to play a big role in placing the right card just on the right spot for a given player to grab. Luck may be even more significant in drawing the Sphinx cards, which represent a big part of the final scoring. Also, many of these are easier or harder depending on the actions of other players, as they will involuntarily tend to help each other if they have similar goals. But it is the existence of ridiculously unbalanced cards - at least one in each category - that ruins what otherwise would be a decent enough game, maybe worth a rating of 7. It's easy to just remove the overpowered cards, but I rate the game as written.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Impression after first play.  Fairly interesting game with a clever design of moving downstream as you made choices.  I see the room for various strategic paths to victory and it definitely feels like 4 players is the sweet spot.  Luck of the draw on the sphinx cards appears to limit real long-term strategic planning, but overall an interesting experience.  Would certainly play again.

I had the honor of being taught this game after a pleasant dinner and evening with friends. I immediately took a shine to this game. I thought the planning out your turn to make sure you efficiently use your actions, while working around your opponents fun. And the risk reward of going to far down on the ‘action’ track was fun. Plus, it had a great blend of open and hidden VPs.
Evolution: The Origin of Species Rated: 5 after 1 play. I just didn’t feel it was a lot of fun. It seemed like it was purely about pounding each other and I have Nuclear War for that.

I need a few more plays, just to see if the different options are really balanced or not, but I like this one very much so far. The worker-placement mechanism is very well done, so is the rest of this game.

Still not sure about the balancing, as I had no back to back plays, but even after all those years, it feels fresh and unused. It's more like getting better the more plays I have, than getting bored by it.

RATING: 8.5
This one appears to be a light worker placement and resource management game.  After a few plays, one quickly finds out that it's a tad heavier than that.  Randomness is very limited (Sphinx cards), but may be mitigated by utilizing more resources to draw more cards (up to 5, may keep 1, rest are converted to victory points).

One side of the Nile has market and worker upgrades, as well as 3 building sites.  The other side has bonus cards, which you can collect by placing one of your ships (workers) there.

After the placement of ships along the Nile, players must feed their workers (based on their total strength), pays in VP any food shortages.  The Nile has three water levels; the better fields always produce, while the other two types are dependent on the water's level.  This simple mechanic provides enough incentive to increase food output at the same time as one increases his/her work force.

Next, all queries produce stones, which you will need at the three building sites, assuming you were able to place a ship there (there are only 3 spots at each, with the possibility of a forth, if someone is unable to build).

Following this, players receive bonus points based on cooperation at the building sites.  Essentially, you get 1/3/6 bonus points depending on how many sites you worked on.

Each construction provides 1 VP per stone/worker required.  To place 1 stone, 1 worker is required, so having a larger work force then you have stones is only going to end up costing you more food.  You need to use a balanced approach when it comes to Stones, Food and Workers.

Each building of the three building sites requires/provides different bonuses:

- Sphinx (you can purchase up to 5 cards, may only keep one, the rest are returned to the bottom of the deck, and are converted into an immediate 1 VP bonus.  These cards provide end game bonuses (4-10 points), if you have meet the indicated requirement.  There is a similar bonus mechanic in AMUN RE).
- Tomb/Obelisk (there are building constraints here, and when you build here, you also receive a free upgrade in either the food or stone market)
- Pyramid/Temple (similar constraints here, with the pyramid providing extra points for majority in each row.  Further, there are numerous Sphinx cards for this area)

All in all, a relatively simple game, which offers some interesting decisions and a multitude of paths to victory (bonus cards, building, etc.).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There are some interesting things going on here, but the flaws are too apparent for it to rate more than a meh.  The tension going down the river is interesting, but I don't like the turn order being based upon on reverse standings.  In a game about being efficient you shouldn't be punished for being  efficient.  Compounding this is that their are ways to hide points during the game, the Sphinx cards, are overpowered and under balanced.  Individual secret goals are interesting when they cause you to base your strategy around them, but often you are just getting rewarded for what you happen to have already done.  A better way of handling it would be to give the goals out at the beginning the game and let them dictate player strategy.

Yet another Euroey Worker Placement Thing, set in ancient Egypt, no less. I have to admit, it's better than a bunch of the other Euroey Worker Placement Things I've played. If you've had your fill of EWPTs, as I have, this won't ever become a favorite. Yet, there's some good stuff in here and and it feels finely tuned. I wish this had been around at the start of the EWPT craze instead of Caylus, because I like this a lot more.

PL: Bardzo skomplikowane zasady - łódki, karty, żetony, podliczanie punktów, cegiełki, urodzaje. Potrzebowaliśmy dwóch gier żeby w miarę pojąć zasady. Instrukcja i opisy kart w języku niemieckim nie ułatwiały zadania. Rozgrywka w miarę przyjemna, stan punktowy potrafi sie zmienić w okamgnieniu. Pewnie zagrałbym jeszcze raz, ale bez wielkiego entuzjazmu.

EN: Very complex rules - boats, cards, chips, points, bricks and yields. We needed to play two games to understand the rules. Instructions and descriptions of the cards in German didn't make it easier. The gameplay is quite enjoyable, the quantity of points changes in an eye blink. Probably would play again, but without much enthusiasm.

Wonderful family game with slightly less complexity as Stone Age. The bonus cards granted by the Sphinx should not be neglected as these make for a lot of points in the end. 

Having played Egizia with a quite newbie to boardgames recently, I have to admit that it is more complex to learn than other games. The basic mechanisms can be confusing in the first game and it might be a good idea to neglect the Sphinx cards in the first game.

RATING: 7
Of all the Caylus clones that have splurged forth since its release, Agricola was best themed, this one is possibly the most fun. Like Caylus, you perform actions along a road, in this case the road's a one way street, i.e. once you've chosen an action well down the road you can't (usually) go back. There are some luck elements. The available actions are dealt out at the start of each turn, you may be desperate for stone, but if the only stone cards are far along or taken by the start player there isn't much you can do. The sphinx cards give you points for a target that can be inadvertently reached by anyone, you can massively benefit from the actions of others here. I'm less impressed by the overall lack of originality, but this is one lookalike that's worth a few viewings at least.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is really interesting. Heavy but short and very Euro, Everyone mentions that it's a worker placement game that involves only being allowed to place downstream, but I actually think the workers are the most interesting part.  They can only be used in very limited ways, because some can be used together and others can't, so the total doesn't matter so much as the size of each individual crew, which can however be increased -- but then you have to feed them.  So there's something of a balancing act to be done there and it's difficult.  There are actually a couple others in the game, too; it's pretty densely packed with interesting and mildly frustrating things and I'd like to get to know it better.  (2 plays)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An otherwise well designed and produced game is spoiled by over-powered, potentially overly luck-driven scoring cards.  I have an appreciation for luck-based elements in games where your probabilities can be directly influenced by your choices in the game.  In this game, an otherwise tight contest can be won by someone scoring a significant number of points by a lucky card draw in the last round.  Moreso, the lucky draw can be for a card rewarding points for something produced by the efforts of other players, even rewarding more points to the person possessing the card than the people performing the action(s) rewarded by the card.
With some point balancing of the cards or possibly a revision to base them only on actions you have taken some part in, this would be a very solid game.

Production value is good. The game board is a head turner at the table with the lush Nile River banks zig zagging dramatically across the map. I am a huge Stone Age fan. I need to play Egizia a few more times before I can make a decision like my friends. Stone Age is a wee bit lighter than Egizia. I enjoy them both. 7/10

Well, I bought it, played it a few times and then sold it.

I liked it tons better than Leonardo Da Vinci.  I liked it a little better than Stone Age.

In the end, it was just too much of the bad side of a "Euro".

I also can't believe they left the "10% Bonus" card in.  No risk for 10% of your score versus lots of risk for less points in the other cards?  Balance my ass.

It was also a chore to teach the game.


However, beyond those caveats there was a solid game.  You had to balance people, food and stone.  The placement was a weird "worker placement/auction" hybrid that worked great.


But really, the cons outweighed the pros for me.

Not that they necessarily should be, but I suspect you could play this game better than anyone else at the table and still come up short.

Very very good.  Innovative, elegant and fun!

Some problems (unbalanced sphinx cards; 2 of them probably need weakening too) cannot cloud the fact the game is super-nice to play.

Expansions (new cards) would be welcome - the game seems very fit to accomodate them.

And play with the house rule: place only 1-4 valued chits on the first 4 graves!  That acts as an encouragement and ensures the graves path is exploited more by the players.  The balance of the game is improved.

RATING: 7
I know another almost themeless worker placement game but hey it turned out pretty good overall. 

Very good angst in this game due to the action track where you see everything, want everything but know you will never get it. It feels like you are ultimately decided what NOT to take at times so decisions are often tough BUT turns still move very fast. The fact you can never go backwards really adds to the angst too. 

I think the thing I liked the most was the fast moving turns and multiple ways to score, play is very straight forward but there are lots of variables that need to be accounted for. 

The luck, well, it is about an hour to 90 minutes so keep that in mind. Its there, some games worst than others no doubt and there are a couple of cards that offend more than others that can simply be removed with no effect OR tweaked in just a small way depending on player number, many threads on this already and some good ideas mentioned. 2 player needs the most help IMO, other numbers not [i]as[/i] much. I heard in 2 player both players can build at a site (haven't tried 2 only), this might be better limited to 1 keeping the angst up but not sure. 

Rating could drop a point if it becomes too much of an issue but I am also not one to just stand by and do nothing when things can be done. If I like a game that has some slight issues I'll go about rendering them, especially if barely any effort is required. If it needs to be tweaked and can be tweaked then just tweak it and play on! 

(Of course sometimes no amount of tweaking can overcome an issue and I don't know at this point where this stands. If too many of the points relation-wise come from the cards versus others ways (like 33%) and you get unlucky in all or most of your draws, that is a tough one. That's like giving everyone in POF 4-5 Prestige cards each, only those vary from 4/5 to 8 which is much less variance than the cards here which are like 3 to 10)

Not played for a long while but got a 4 player game in. Just managed a win against 3 others. Changed my mind - this game shine with 4 more than 3 - you have to adjust and adapt more. Still a great game. Up 1/2 a point.

Not played for a while (no takers), but have started playing on-line. Dropped a point - still a very good game that I ma happy to play, but there are equally good (or even better!) games available. 
Was Egizia ever really on a par with greatness like Power Grid - perhaps not.....

Moved it another half point. I like this game a lot, especially the risk -v- reward decison process and the often necessary adjustments in strategy during the game.  Easy to teach and plays well at all numbers, if differently.

Moved it up - still like to play and have now won my first game!

Still can not make my mind up about this one.

I like the game a great deal (bought a copy! 09OCT10 before it sold out locally), but not sure it is a great game yet.....! But find that I do want to play it, so it definitely has "something" to it!

I think I enjoyed this game in the moment more than I should have. Looking back on it I had one or two major problems. The evaluations are mostly pretty simple, basically every brick you get should be worth a point (other than the ones that go toward the sphinx, more on that later). The central decision process is similar to worker placement in that you can usually evaluate exactly how good something is for you, but you have to figure out how much of a risk it is to let something slide for a turn and hope no one else takes it. Added to that in this game is an ordering on the action spaces and the restriction that you can only go in one direction along the order. This requires you to be more precise with your evaluation of what you really need and what you can take a risk on, because sometimes the more contentious action is past the safer one. In general this isn't the kind of decision-making that really excites me.

I'm also a bit concerned that the sphinx cards seem too powerful, it seemed like generally you were trading one brick for ~7-8 points, where everywhere else they were worth maybe a little over 1 point, factoring in the bonuses. And at least in a four player game at least one person will be locked out of them in each round. I guess the counter here is that this just makes the placement that much more important in that area. But to me it just feels a little odd.

We played without the card that lets one keep up to 2 spinx cards as we heard it was way too powerful (which it does sound) as it can be just a lucky shuffle for the the start player to get.

Interesting mix/balance of actions... I was actually only 10 points behind the 2nd place guy who had 5 spinx cards that scored (I had one that it it didn't score or I would have been in 2nd)... so I think it *may* be possible to win w/out spinx but it does sound hard w/out any.

2nd play I did even better, came in 2nd but it really came down to a little luck of the 1st place player very near the end of the last round.  Great game!

Old-school worker placement eurogame. Increase the effectiveness of your workers, remember to feed them, get stones from your quarries, and help build monuments and tombs, all of which gives you victory points.

The game is mechanically sound and enjoyable, but possibly lacks that little "something" to really make it stand out. Everything this game does, some other game does better. Perfectly ok, but not a game I'll be playing ten years from now.

Played once as a 4p with 3 others who knew the game inside and out.  Despite my severe disadvantage it actually worked to my favor as the others weren't as concerned with what I was doing and I managed a win.  Very interesting strategies available in this game, hoping to explore further soon!  Tight economy (balancing workers and funds) and very balanced overall though we did omit the Sphinx card that gives bonus points for getting points.

RATING: 7
There is plenty of pleasantry to be found here, but not enough originality to separate itself. The goals of efficient contribution to building, feeding of workers, and collection of goal cards are all very familiar. The potential difference-maker is how half of the actions available each round are in the form of cards that are randomly distributed. This is a good way of improving replayability, for sure. The improvement of construction crews, collection of food (and manipulation of which farms produce), the one-directional staircase of action selection, and building options all provide solid, well-designed play options. My only concern with the game is that cards that allow cheaper and greater selection of goal cards end up being a little over-powered. If one player earns both the +2 draw (permanent) and the +1 keep (single use) cards, they are pretty likely to win. Good game, but I have similar games I prefer.

Solid game, lots of small opportunities to score a few points. Flirting close to one's own feeding limit can be lethal if the fields do not come up.

The design is also not as tight as it could be. It's not intuitive why the different buildings have different scoring mechanisms.

RATING: 6.75
Well, the rule book wasn't the greatest. We made a number of mistakes simply because of the way the rules where laid out. While the iconography was simple and clear, they could have added a few more details on the board that would have made actions even clearer. We could have used a quick reference sheet or something. One suggestion would have been to have the turn steps written on the player boards. 

Also, if the maximum number of sphinx cards you can draw is 5, does the draw an extra sphinx card ability allow you to draw 6?  

The game itself is functional. It's has some interesting choices but I have way more engaging games in my collection. Amun-Re and Stone Age, to name a few.

To anyone who plays this game for the first time:

1. Resolve the Nile cards and the action circles immediately on placing the ship, but resolve the 3 building spots AFTER you feed your people and collect stone.

2. You can only use 1 of your circle worker tiles + the joker on any one building site UNLESS you have a special ability card that lets you add another worker. You CAN'T combine workers.

3. If your quarry or grain field production sites are at max and you cause them to move down by more than 1 step, you get to activate the last step multiple times. This means collection 3 stone x n steps, or 2 vp x n steps.

4. Even if your grain field is at the bottom, it STILL costs you 1 grain per power point of your workers.

RATING: 7
Egizia is yet another game that__________________. I could fill in the blank 10+ times and be done with it.

I won't though, because Egizia seems like a solid game. To boil it down: players need stone to build monuments, and construction crews to haul stone, and farmland to support the crews. That's the gist, and then there are a bunch of minor considerations. Consider stone, for example. Players are limited in how much they can accumulate, so if they are generating substantially more than they can use in one turn, the excess will soon reach the storage limit and go to waste. Stone also has to be used in increments matching the construction project, and you have to develop your construction crews so that they can be flexibly applied to these projects.

The devil is in the details. Farmland comes in three types that vary in yield and risk: more productive fields only kick if the Nile floods, which players have a degree of control over. Players also control the impact of famine, which is steep at the outset but can be blunted considerably as the game goes on. Crews are usually upgraded in pairs, which makes it a challenge to upgrade exactly the right crews to exactly the right extent. Etc.

Egizia is very close to being a completely unoriginal game that fine-tunes old ideas, and though I'm not hugely impressed, I don't mind games of refinement either. For those who do, there is a single flourish in the design that may be of some interest. Essentially, the available actions are arranged along the banks of the Nile, with your workers traveling downstream. Every action you take has to move further downstream from your previous action, which means that if you rush to claim a coveted action early in the turn, you give up everything behind it until next turn. I didn't find this any more interesting than more standard "worker placement" but it didn't seem substantially less interesting either. Certainly it's not a make-or-break feature.

Also, it's a small point, but it really annoys me that the game requires you to spend more and more stone on things of roughly equivalent size. Not a deal-breaker, but definitely a prominent theme-glitch.

This has a nice worker placement mechanic of putting your ships on spots traveling down the nile. Only a couple special cards allow you to go back up during that round. Build up the strength of your workers and collect stones. You also need to collect fields to make food for the workers. Use your workers and stones to add to various buildings and get victory points. You also maximize victory points by meeting conditions on the bonus cards. The game seems really well themed.

Worker placement game on about the same complexity as Stone Age but more tactical. My usual complaint with worker placement is the repetitiveness but Egizia didn't fall prey to it as the card layout, the downstream twist and the sphinx cards function well enough as random situation generators without making the whole game a luck fest. One of the few worker placement games I really enjoy and look forward to playing again.

This would have been a really interesting game a few years ago, but now it just feels like a retread of tons of other games.

A compact worker placement game. The length of the game is quite ideal, the theme is nicely implemented and especially the Nile mechanism is a good one.

An okay worker placement game with pleasing artwork and the great rule that you can only place your workers downstream.

But I don't like the sphinx cards or the whole mechanic of paying to look at some of the cards, choosing one, then returning the others to the deck and getting free points for doing so - this seems odd to me.  These random cards are big point generators if certain end of game criteria are met but there's no penalty for not completing them.  Furthermore, they get picked through as the game progresses and soon you're cycling through everyone's discards.  You clearly have to go to the sphynx virtually every turn in order to have a any hope of being a contender for the win (which in itself seems like a weakness in the game).

Despite the nice artwork and placement mechanic, the sphinx cards kill this for me.

Oddly one of my better games, where more stategic than stone age but not better.   But still not a bad game.   

2 things:

1) 2 player games need a method for filling more bricks, like the Queen games often used ghost player.

2) I like the often argues point for every 10 card topic.  But instead of removing it, they needed other cards like:

If player has that card, reduce their points by half, or you get half of their points, Cards that would make taking the card feel more Mexican standoff-ish.

I was introduced to this game by Martyn and Heather and thought it a marvellous mechanism. It is worker placement and it is a resource management game, but the real skill comes in the brinkmanship of the worker placements. They are placed along the Nile going downstream - only 1 worker per position and you can never place upstream from your last placed worker. So do you leap ahead to gaurantee best placement but get fewer workers down or do you linger at the back placing more workers but getting the dross, or do you gamble getting a couple of extra pieces down before leaping ahead and risk someone else getting there first.
After several plays I think there might be a couple of cards which arer stronger than the others, I am also not sure I have the control I want in a game with the four player version.

You really need to watch what the other players are doing, you've got tons of options on your turn, and there's just enough randomness to keep the game from getting stale but it won't overwhelm the game either.  My only complaint is that the rules could've used another read through before releasing the game - there are a few fairly common rules that are not clear or missing.  Otherwise, a good game to own I think.

Ok. Interesting worker placement game that feels a bit like Cleopatra & Architects with stronger mechanics a la Stone Age.  I really had high expectations for this and it's pretty good but it's not perfect.  Balance wise, we feel that you have to nerf the "+2 cards when sphynxing" to "save 2 stones OR 2 workers when sphynxing", and the "+1 vp per 10 vp" to "+1 per 15 w/ 4 players" and "+1 per 20 w/ 3 players".  The placement itself is really smart and works well.  Lighter than I would have liked it.  Best played with 4 or more.

Honestly, I've resisted playing this one for a long time expecting it to feel like Stone Age which I don't enjoy.  I didn't want to like this one.  

LIKE:

* The tension of sailing your way down the Nile trying to pick up needed resources/workers/food and other special cards and construction opportunities can be painful.  
* The possibility of going slowly MIGHT give you more things BUT might also keep you out of key spots.  You must balance opportunity vs necessity.
* The concept of the Sphinx cards is intriguing.  BUTTTT...look below for a significant concern.
* The way the cards come out for the Nile create diversity in repeat plays.  (IE, my first play was very stone poor as there were at least 3 stone quarries that did not get played.)

DISLIKE:

* Sphinx cards are horribly random.  Yes, you can try to balance out the randomness by paying extra bricks to draw more cards, but that doesn't mean much.  I drew 12 Sphinx cards in my first game and scored 17 points off my four that I could keep.  An opponent drew 6 cards and scored 30 points.

I was thinking I should rate this lower but I just can't; it's simply much better than I could have ever hoped.

I know that sounds negative, but given the glut of worker placement games over the past few years, I'm sure many of you can identify with those feelings.

I think the genius in this game lies in the fact that the people furthest ahead go later in the turn, but the clincher is that the worker placement balances the turn order with only allowing you to place further down the river than your previous placements, making decisions quite tense.

While there are a number of random elements here, there is an equal number of predictable ways to gain vp's. I also like the nod to roads and boats in the pyramid scoring.

Count me pleasantly surprised.

I feel like I should like this game more than I do.  Its Nile mechanic is cool and clever.  Production values are good.  Good theme/mechanic integration, insofar as that means anything.  But I'm not blown away, or even close to blown away.  Maybe I'm just not a worker placement guy after all.  But I prefer the intricacy of Agricola or the simplicity (and maybe dice rolling) of Stone Age.  Egizia is better than Fresco, to say the least.  I can't quite put my finger on why this doesn't hit the sweet spot for me; maybe I need to play it more, and not so late at night.

A very interesting worker placement game, where you place your ships on the Nile and can place them as far down as you want, but cannot go back up the Nile.  Many of the best spots are located further down and so the tension arises from taking early spots which provide resources or strong scoring spots on the river.  

This is a grossly under-rated game.  And an excellent design with very good component quality.    

Medium-weight euro.

A twist on the worker placement style game. After you place workers in certain spots you have to make sure you have enough materials and work crews to get what you need done. It takes some creative management of the two to make sure you can fulfill all your plans. I enjoy seeing the monuments fill up and the way your strategy can change due to the scoring cards you end up with is interesting as well.

5/2011 Another resource handling/worker placement game; though there is a new mechanism making this game stand out from the crowd: "Actions" available for worker placement lie along the river and you CAN NOT move up the river.  So, if jumping for a cool action further down river you might not be able to place all your workers.  Of course, there's only room for one worker per action making the worker placement pretty tense at times.  Resolving actions and collecting points is straight forward; the hidden individual end game goal cards yields bonus points affecting the final result.

Egizia is an OK game, but that's really the problem. There's not really anything new or exciting here. For me, with my already sizable game collection, there's nothing sufficiently unique here to warrant bringing it to the table more often. The theme (Ancient Egypt) is nice, but common. The artwork is pretty, but not amazing. The worker placement mechanic has been done better, but is nevertheless well implemented. In a smallish collection, this would see more play, but in my collection, I suspect it'll probably just gather dust... I don't dislike this game by any means, it's just that for what it does, there's other games that do similar things in a way that is truly excellent.

Only one play so far but we really liked it.  I like how you have to plan ahead as you're placing your boats down the Nile.  So many things that you need...are you willing to jump way ahead to try to get something first leaving the other players to follow behind grabbing everything that you passed by?  Quite a fun worker placement that I would put up there with Stone Age and Fresco.

La mécanique su Nil est excellente!!! Si on descend trop vite le Nil, on va manquer plusieurs actions mais si on ne le descend pas assez vite, quelqu'un pourrait nous dépasser et prendre des actions futurs qui auraient pu nous intéresser! Vraiment une belle gestion! 

On a toujours l'impression de se faire voler une bonne action et on a jamais l'impression d'avoir l'action qu'on voulait vraiment!!! Mais un conseil, nourrissez vos esclaves!

The core idea of worker placement with a fixed direction downward the nile is pure genius, and most of the chrome surrounding it is not too shabby, either. Like most games with a scripted order of action cards, it does suffer a bit from the advantage for experienced players.

Both games I've played so far were with four players, and the odd (read: non-existing) scaling of several sphinx cards was noticed. Four players does seem to be the balance point of the game, but I'd leave out at least the VPs x 1.1 card in a game with fewer folks at the table.

RATING: 8.5
Played many times.  2 players is lighter but decisions are still agonizing and interesting.  4 players is cutthroat!  People WILL go hungry with 4 players!  Very fun game.  Can't ever do everything you'd like to do.

Another note... the rules are lacking.  They could have been written better and there are at least 2 or 3 blaring errors (misplaced text, wrong illustrations given as examples) that can really confuse someone just learning.  There are also a couple of scoring tables (building round bonus and end-game grave bonus) that should have been printed on the board or on reference cards.

There is an FAQ AND printable reference cards available here on BGG to take care of both of these issues.  It's very much worth it to take the time to print these out.  This is a VERY good game if you don't mind "finishing" the job that should have been taken care of by the publishers.

The worker placement down the line concept is nice, place further for better moves but reduce your subsequent options? The whole collecting resources and collectively building where the biggest contributions gain more points is so bland themewise though. The random placement of cards is also frustating as often the best cards just happen to be first in the line so the player sitting early that turn get's the best AND still has the most options afterwards.

I remember being at a FLGS back in January of 2013. I had just received my first couple of Eurogames (Carcassonne and Dominion) and I was infatuated with this newfound hobby. Somehow, possibly through review hopping, I ran across a game called Stone Age that was, at that time, between prints. I waited about 6 weeks, and it had become available again on Amazon. I bought it, I played it, I played it about 20 more times, and decided that it was in my top 3 games. Stone Age ticks so many of my boxes (relatively short, easy to learn and teach, fun "theme," dice rolling, set collection, worker placement, great components, some hidden information, etc.). I was completely smitten with this game.

Shortly after, I ran across Egizia, via BGG. I heard that it was being branded: Stone Age 2.0. So…I had to have it. Unfortunately, I never really could justify spending $80 plus for a copy, especially when I had heard mixed reviews on how it plays with 2. FINALLY, I traded for a copy a couple of weeks ago, played it shortly after, and truly believe it may pass up Stone Age on my top games list. It's Stone Age with more options, less randomness (although it's close, I believe the dice rolling outweighs the Sphinx card drawing), more variety and more theme. Egizia actually has theme. To me it's not pasted on because the central mechanic revolves around the Nile River and how it cultivates the land within the Nile valley. Note: I rate this game so high, in large part, because worker placement is my favorite game mechanism. Nevertheless, every gamer should own a copy of this game. It should be reprinted by Z-MAN, and it should be reviewed by Rahdo/Tom Vasel/Ryan Metzler/Joel Eddy, or some other talented game reviewer. Jeremy Salinas did a great job with his review, but it was primarily component based, and while I love and appreciate Jeremy's reviews, he does not seem to have the same popular following as say Richard Ham. Please, Richard, review this game!

Update 8/14/14: I got to play this for the first time as a 2 player tonight. It was, yet again, an amazing game. So much fun! That said, in addition to scaling the buildings by blocking a spot, I think that all of the building "level" sphinx cards should be removed in a 2 player game. That is, any card that rewards a player only if a certain level is built (e.g. 8th level of the obelisk) should be removed, as it becomes considerably more difficult to fulfill those cards in a 2 player game. With only 2 players, the sphinx deck will probably not be cycled through, so removing these cards would not have a great affect on the game. If this is done right, I think it makes an EXCELLENT 2 player game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of my favorites. I like the "gotta play downstream" aspect and the "feed your people" worker placement mechanic. A couple of the Sphinx cards seem pretty powerful if you get them early (e.g. Keep two cards) but overall I like the game a lot, even with only two players.

The rules are straightforward enough that I rarely have to check the rules after only a few plays spread out over two years.  Something about the mechanics & theme just seem to work well enough to make it all stick and hang well together in a fun package without being overly complex for new players.

Obtained 08/04/10. The rules are sub-par compared to most Euro type games. Some of the problems are translation errors. Some are just being sloppy with cut & paste.  Even with the aid of an extensive FAQ (now up to version 6) from the Files section, I still had several questions. The graphics and components are generally good. The game itself is *very* good, and would have warranted a "9" from me, yet the multitude of rules errors and gray areas knock it down a notch. 
01/22/11 Played a three-player game. I think food and stone are a little too easy to get when there isn't a fourth player. But the game still works well enough. 
11/29/11 Played a four-player game. 04/23/13 Ditto. 09/16/14 Ditto. 09/08/15 Ditto.  10/10/17 Another 4P game.

Not much to don't like about this one except that the cards play a somewhat too big role in the endgame scoring.  I guess it keeps everyone on their toes but I prefer a game where luck is reduce.  As an example, in my game, the best player came in last after the endgame scoring because of his lack of good enough cards...and it's not as if he didn't go to the sphinx to get some.  Anyway, still an enjoyable time to play this game...because of my group, which is fantastic.

Impressive worker placement game with the twist being that there are a number of good things to choose from but you place your workers (ships) down the nile river.  Once a ship is placed your next placement must be further down stream so you cannot backtrack (unless you get the rule-breaker card that lets you do that once per placement round).  So there are some real decisions on whether to pick up good cards while your opponent may jump ahead and grab a better card.  Along with the placement mechanism there are a number of other familiar Euro mechanics: you must produce stones, which allow you to build, the strength of your work forces determine how much you can build, but you must feed those forces, collected goal cards give you extra points if you fulfill them.  All that and a ton of other scoring mechanics + the worker placement mechanism make for a pretty decent psychological strategy game.

neat worker placement game with an innovative mechanic in having to place each worker further down the Nile.  this creates quite a few interesting setups and the way the cards lineup each round make every game feel differently.

controlled luck aspects and plenty opportunities to deny/block players.

2 player was not that great, but a very solid 3 player game.

Just as I may have gotten rid of a few games too hastily after a single play, I think this game came INTO the collection too hastily, after just one play.  Initially, I enjoyed the idea that options faded over the course of the round, as the players traveled down the Nile, but eventually, all the worker placement, resource management and myriad scoring options began to remind me of this game's more elegant and pleasurable grandfather, [b][GameID=34635][/b].  Considering that, I decided to keep the greater and jettison the lesser.

Egizia commits a number of sins that will make me avoid playing it again.

1. It does little to distinguish itself from the gazillion of other worker placement and resource management games out there. Here, you're basically just doing set collection (1 worker space + 1 stone + 1 food = 1 point each round). Place your ships and get your stuff. Place some more ships to turn your stuff into points. There aren't that many decisions here; just take the best spot that's available but not so far up that you run out of options later on.

2. It's long. I have no idea where the 75 minutes listed on the BGG page is coming from. The box says 90 minutes, and our game was at least that long. This is on par with Lords of Waterdeep at best and really should be more like a 45 to 60 minute game. But it's not.

3. There's one action--the Sphinx--that's by far better than all the other actions. You might as well just chop the bottom quarter of the board off; you should always go straight to the Sphinx. You spend five workers and stone, which elsewhere would get you five points, maybe a little more, but here gets you four points [i]plus an insane number of points off the bonus card[/i]. Even if not all your bonuses max out, you're still probably averaging 8 points per card, making your workers/stone worth about twice as much as they are on the other building spots. Why would you ever not go here? Furthermore, since these points score at the end, it's easier to lag behind, always picking first, and beating everyone else to this spot. To top it off, by going here, you force others to score their points by building in the other spots, [i]which most likely helps you score your bonus cards[/i]. Ridiculous!

With nothing new to offer, a laboriously long playing time (relative to the decisions you're making), and a clearly dominant "strategy," I see little reason to give this one another go.

A fine worker placement game. Managing your three kinds of "wealth" well enough and seize opportunity when you can, and you should be doing good. I like the competitiveness in fighting for spaces to take things you need or be the first to build something. There are enough tensions to make this seemingly easy game a challenge. Player order is quite prominent, though it can be mitigrated if you deliberately stay behind in scoring.

This is an Egyptian themed worker placement game with a slight twist. Worker placement spots go from the top of a stream to the bottom, and you can't go upstream of your last worker. Players are gathering brick, gathering food, and increasing the strength of their workers to build monuments. There are also cards that give you scoring bonuses.

I enjoyed this game. It plays quickly, and it is tense all the way through. It uses the bonus scoring cards (reminds me of Masons), but gives you a mechanic to choose one you can use. There is a ton of tension in this game about leaving cards for your opponents if you do not hurry along the river.

Interesting worker placement game.  When selecting actions you don't want to go after the best ones at the end of the river, because you will not be able to travel back up the river to grab that action you wanted.  Multiple ways to score points and a great selection in the worker placement genre.

Worker placement game with restriction on direction of placement. Lots of cards which are acquired on placement, and they add resources or change some game rules. Other cards are drawn and give VPs at game end. During the game most VPs are acquired by building. Not a bad game, but it does not do anything special. There is some luck, and some tension, if it could be played in an hour my rating would rise. It works well as a 2 player game.

First impression (3 and 4 players) :

Overall I like the game, it has good amount of tension with action selection and only real complain is that point-scoring cards draws seem to be often pretty much game winning .. which seems silly as otherwise game is pretty deterministic/ open information.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Definitely a game I'd like to play again, but I wasn't wowed by my inital play. My favorite mechanism in the game, and the one that makes me want to play again, is managing your workers as you travel down the Nile. Since you can't go backwards you really have to consider how far ahead you're willing to go to get what you need which creates plenty of difficult decisions that need to be made. My buddy Mat owns it so I'm sure I'll get another chance to play, but honestly I'm not in any rush.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Definitely a game I need to play again to see how I really feel about it. I honestly don't understand how Egizia is often touted as the heavier version of Stone Age. I agree Egizia is heavier, but fail to see any other connection besides the fact that they are both WP games. To be honest I thought I would enjoy the game much more, but I am starting to realize that I'm not as big a fan of games where you are searching for bonus cards to score (the major scoring opportunity in this game). I much prefer wp games like Targi, Agricola and Snowdonia where there is some resource conversion and all of the point scoring opportunities are known right from the beginning of the game.

I did enjoy the tension created by the wp mechanic; as you progress down the Nile you can never claim an action you already passed. Sometimes you really need to take a certain space, but how much are you willing to pass by to get there? Great mechanic in an otherwise standard game. 

I am sure part of my feelings toward this game come from the fact that I've now played a lot of wp games and I've figured out what kind of mechanics I'm looking for in that type of game. Had I played this when I first got in the hobby I would have enjoyed it much more. As it is I'd probably rather lay Stone Age at this point. I'm glad I got to play and I would definitely enjoy playing again, but it is no longer a game that I want to add to our collection.[/i]

Middleweight Worker placement game, a scoring system with an ancient Egyptian theme very much pasted on. Functional but bland. 

The only potential bomb comes in the feeding phase. If you don't have enough food you lose big points (you can mitigate this by fields/tech track).

The co-operation points seemed too generous (4 player), and it was always the full 6pts, except for the Sphinx (sometimes).

You score by building at 4 different locations, and for Sphinx cards (think Princes of Florence/Amun Re end game cards), and from certain location cards dealt out, and from stones at the end, and graves/pyramid bonus.

RATING: 7.5
Very sweet worker placement game.  The river mechanic makes the decisions very tough, jump to the card that will net you points or hang back and use all your boats to pick up everything that got skipped.  The game still felt light to medium so this might be a good candidate for the family.  Very likely to own this one.

RATING: 8
A worker placement concoction where you can only go down the line (the Nile) collecting stuff. The twist is that once you've passed over spots, you can't go back to them. Spots include stuff like getting crew, building a grain engine to feed them, building a quarry engine to generate stones which your crew use to get VP's, the actual VP earning spots plus a bunch of special action cards. Your aim is generally to keep everything in balance - crew, food, quarry. Your hard decision each turn (which provides plenty of tension) is assessing what everyone else will take and determining whether you can take this close spot, giving you more options for next turn, or whether you need to take the spot further down the line right now because that's the one you really want, foregoing all other closer spots this round. That's the essence of the game-play and about as difficult as it gets. The end-of-game VP cards will drive your strategy in terms of which VP building spots (aka stone-spending) you want to get into each round. One potential downer is that the VP cards are not well balanced – a card that provides average points in a 2 player can be great with 4 players, and others work the other way around. But buy lots of cards to maximise your chances of getting a good one. Another is that your accounting housekeeping can be fiddly. It does work surprisingly well as a 2 player so kudos there - there's less tension in the competition for building but more focus on nailing your strategy correctly. It’s an interesting game that I’m enjoying playing.

Wow, this is what a strategy-game should be about! Great game and also some great artwork. The theme fits its mechanic very well and the game flows very nicely! Very well done! Top game. Might rise my rating with additional plays.
Update: This game still stands out after over a year of gameplay. For me this is one of the best strategygames out there for people who think "Stone Age" isn't enough. Downsite: The rules are fiddly and are difficult to learn for new players.
Update: After 3 years playing this game I have to say. I can still come back to this game and have a very fullfilling gaming experience. A absolute great replayvalue. So I raise my rating.
Update: Wonderfull game. It stood the test of time. 10!

A worker placement game where half the actions change from round to round and you can never play a worker before one that you have already played on the board. Turn order is key and somewhat in the players control. You increase your workers capabilities and use them to build monuments, dig graves and take bonus point cards. Different enough to be worth a try, we all enjoyed it.

This Euro-style game definitely has a lot going on, but it all fits together very well.  The core mechanic is worker placement on a river: you have as many workers to place as you want, but you can only place on unoccupied spaces downstream of your last placement.  So you can jet on ahead and try to pick up valuable spaces before other people "get there" (and probably place fewer workers in the process), or hang behind and pick up lots of what everyone else didn't want, or somewhere in between.  It's very clever, and creates a lot of tension in the game.  Of course, the game also has secret goal cards to make sure everyone's not trying to do the same thing, and there are a variety of scoring opportunities.

Solid euro game. Games are usually very close with first and last place only a few points different. A worker placement with a card row that provides benefits. There are a couple of ways to screw players other than blocking them like causing them to fail to feed their workers. Interesting mechanic that forces you to keep going down river making earlier choices disappear. This forces you to make some tough decisions. Game is quick with little downtime.

This is a very fun worker placement game that went OOP even though it was recently made. The river mechanic is very interesting that will give more replayability to the game since one card can be up the river this game and be down the river the next. The game is also designed that not all the cards will show up in a game. 

Sphinx card is very important! It is recommended to start getting them sooner. I only got it starting 4th turn and it was too late. The game controls the play time by only offering 5 turns which is very welcomed. 

One nuance of the game is knowing which worker to upgrade, and juggle the balance between feeding and upgrade.

I want to play again.

Interesting worker placement game where the 'downriver' restriction makes it nicely different from other worker placement game.

Scoring is fairly straightforward: you convert stones into points, you need enough men to do so, and enough food to feed your men. So the more (stone + guy + food), the more points.

After that it gets pretty convoluted. There are cards that let you break all kinds of game rules, like ignore worker placement restrictions, double build, use stones as food, and dozens of other cards. Some abilities are really powerful, so other players need to take those into consideration. Then you acquire scoring cards, which give you points if certain goals are met; some of which [i]you[/i] need to do, others also depend on other players. Get them early enough and you might be able to plan for them; later, you just need to get lucky.

In the end I don't really like the combination of dry efficiency and random powers and scoring.

This is a game for people who enjoy tension and angst from the necessity of placing somewhere before others do so, even if it costs you a lot elsewhere. You'll be thinking "I really don't want to do this, but I see no other choice" a lot. You also need to be ok with people having hidden cards that might or might not give them a lot of additional points, based partially on luck.

RATING: 7
In this game, you place workers along the nile. Each time you place a worker, that action spot needs to be further downstream than your last placed worker. The action spots allow you to take the faceup card in that spot (which either gives you resource income or give some rule breaking ability), upgrade one of your workers, or tap a worker and pay bricks to work on one of the three wonders in the game. The wonders are spaced out along the nile, with one close to the start, one in the middle and one at the end. This makes for some interesting tension as there are end of round bonus victory points according to how many of the wonders you worked on this turn. Spending to build is the way you get victory points in the game, but each piece of the wonder has an increasing requirement in terms of both worker strength and number of bricks spent, so budgeting and upgrading is necessary. 
The game has an interesting push your luck element to it, as each of the five rounds you have to feed your workers, and not all grain fields are equal in terms of their reliability. One of the action spots allows the movement of a token that chances which fields will produce. Overall this is a very enjoyable euro, however the strength variance of some of the cards that you can acquire during the game sours me a little bit. It seems like there are a few things when gotten in combination that can allow a single player to run away with the game. It's not the worst, since players can sort of take on themselves to take sub-optimal moves to grab the cards up first, but it feels a little uncomfortable. I would be interested in seeing what a second edition of the game looks like should that ever happen.

Worker placement type of game with ancient Egypt theme. Similar to Stone Age, but uses randomized cards to advance the production of your workers, grain and stone to build various developments along the Nile. With the exception of a couple slightly unbalanced cards which can easily be pulled, the game plays well and scales nicely with additional players. Also uses a similar mechanic as Power Grid, where the leading player is penalized by going last in each round which makes for some interesting strategies. Played on yucata.de.

Elsőre is 2015 eddigi legjobbja. Sokkal egyszerűbb és izgalmasabb, mint reméltem. Sok komoly izgalommal járó döntés, apró fricska, és érdekes célok.

Nem érzem, a sokak által megénekelt szerencsefaktor sem, mert kellően kiegyensúlyozható. Tényleg erősek a szfinxlapok, de nem érzem nagyon-nagyon erősnek őket.

Deep, well-designed worker placement game reminiscent of Stone Age. Multiple resource tracks to manage (grain, stone, workers) and many ways to score victory points, including short-term (construction of relics), medium-term (majority bonuses on relics) and long-term (fulfillment of hidden sphinx, or "mission," cards). Some interesting innovations, such as "speculation" on building sites, which enables players to utilize a building spot if a previous player claimed it but chose not to (or could not) build. Not worth playing with just 2.

2010-01-19: Interesting Eurogame in the tradition of all kinds of wacky subsystems and various ways to earn points. The central worker placement mechanism (of going in one direction along the Nile) is good. We were taught by Sawka and Tusia who'd only played it once a while before, so many rules were shaky. Playing in Polish with German cards detracted from my comprehension of various rules... I really would like to read an English translation of the rules. But the game seems cool.

But it has a bit more randomness than I'd like in this kind of game.

Exemplifies the euro notion of "not being able to do everything you want." Efficiency is the key in Egizia, and you may burn your brain out attempting it.

Components are excellent, especially considering all the nice artwork on the back of the board and player mats: completely unnecessary, but a testament to the production values of a typical Hans im Gluck/Rio Grande game.

I can see how each play could be quite different, even more so depending on which permanent cards appear during round one. A few key mistakes in any given round can pretty much sink you. This doesn't bother me, but it is aggravating if you make some serious flaws during round one, which is something I regrettably did.

Nice game, there's certainly some depth here I'd like to explore. Much like my first experience with Troyes, after final scoring, I was in a daze from mulling over so many difficult decisions.

--July2010-- Intriguingly constrained worker-placement game, with bonus random factors.  I love the constraints; the decisions are interesting; but the random factors may end up skewing the results more than one might strictly desire for a game of this weight.  It's on that strange middle ground between a nice family title and a good gamer's game:  a bit too random for the latter, a bit too AP-prone for the former.  I'm amused by some of the discussions around revisiting a couple of the Sphinx cards:  it's possible there's a house-rule version hiding nearby that would work nicely as a gamer title.

A decent medium-light game, somewhat spoiled by random bonus cards. Has a considerable toy factor of laying your bricks in pyramid shape. Still, it's less random and somewhat more strategic than Stone Age, provides more interesting choices, but to me it lacks its elusive appeal, even if it's largely due to cool resource bits and Menzel's artwork. In this genre, I'll always pick Ninjato first.

There's some really nice decisions that make you think in this attractively produced game. Nothing too brain burning - similar in complexity to Stone Age and similar too in that you're snatching victory points here and there on your way to a big points reveal through the sphinx cards picked up throughout the course of the game. Turn to turn you're balancing building your workers with food production and building material production. And it's a balance - you want and need it all, and so does everyone else.

The down the river worker placement system works well here with static advancements mixed with a good assortment of cards that change game to game. I approve. Everything seems balanced and it's a good ride. Play with three players and there's some feeling of control with what you're selecting. With four, because there are these three set building points down the river, it feels a little too chaotic and there's too much luck with the card order... but hold on - that's the clever thing you can control by holding back, setting up your special cards, labour, stone supply, etc and then finishing with a sprint over the last two turns.

Update: I'm enjoying this one and it's improved its ranking up a notch since the first learning game. The great thing is that it plays so well and so differently with 2, 3 or 4 players. You can control your luck in this game - a very good game.

Worker placement game with some nice new mechanics, like the Nile flow, by which players are unable to allocate their tokens upside the position they currently are in the river. The scoring is based on the construction of buildings and special bonus.

Take a trip down the nile, five times. Apparently you don't have any oars, so you can only go downstream and I guess some hefty fellas drag it back. You can make as many stops as you want, as long as you don't go back upstream, and you don't re-visit a location someone else visited. Each location provides you with some benefit, population growth in one of four factions, stone, food, or cards to use. There are three build sites that up to three folks can take advantage of (each). Draw goal cards and meet the goals to make big, secret end game bonuses. Or use your people and stone to build one of the wonders of the world for quick VP, and possibly an edge against starvation. You need to increase your population to build the taller parts of the wonders, but that means you need more food capacity or you'll suffer starvation which costs VPs. The people, who I mentioned come in four factions, are curiously unwilling to work with each other except for the guys in the white togas, who work with anyone. This limits your build combinations in interesting ways, and is one of two mechanisms to encourage you to spread your workers to all three build sites if possible.

I enjoyed the game. It gets a little wacky in round five, as some of the civilization cards your ship can pick up are powerful albeit short-lived. The ship mechanism is very interesting -- since there is competition for the landing sites, you might travel far downstream to claim a good site, and since you can't turn back, you'll probably get fewer ships out than other players who are moving slower. It's a nice mechanic. Some of the scoring reminds me of Knizia, although it's not as deep.

Another worker-placement game where you go on all sorts of random spaces to build random things and acquire random abilities. Egizia takes it to the extreme by giving you decks of cards of action spaces.

Cut through the fluff, the nice artwork and the newness of the game, and it doesn't stand up to the classics like Stone Age (elegant), Age of Empires (clean), Pillars of the Earth (tactical) etc. I dislike secret long-term objectives (the Sphinx cards), and I especially dislike the way the game basically forces you to acquire Sphinx cards every turn (don't do it and you're at a severe disadvantage). The down-river placement of workers is a bit of a gimmick, especially since it doesn't account for the balance of the action spaces that come up. It seems like you get 1 VP for every stone all the time, and the only differentiator is how many bonus VPs you got because of random things somebody else did, or random card draws. Player interaction amounts to deciding whether to help myself or to F***-YOU somebody else (with minimal benefit to yourself, e.g. water ring, grain field), and I much appreciate something more layered and nuanced.

Granted, I described just about nearly every worker-placement game, but others have an it-factor. Stone Age is covering your ass from the dice, AoE is timing the collection and use of the specialists, PotE is juggling your resources and craftsmen. Egizia is merely balancing your resources, and build. Every frickin' round.

And the determinant of luck is of the worst kind. Draw 5 Sphinx cards and nothing is good = bad. Having only one of the two "1 point for each of your markers at this site" show up can be severely unbalancing. The game goes for the poor kind of artificial replayability from variable setups and action spaces, instead of the true replayability that comes from meaningful decisions

Fun to keep playing to experience different action cards, but don't think I'll play much more after that.

-----------------------

3-player is most interesting to me so far, because I like seeing two player fight for the juicy spots down-river, while the 3rd player cleans up behind. 2-player would have been most interesting, if there were only 1 permitted space on each building site.

There are some good ideas here that would have been interesting if they were implemented better. Variable turn order is thrown in as an after-thought to help the stragglers, and rarely figures into your decision-making. Some potentially delicious speculation opportunities (like getting rewarded if certain features are built) are wasted because there's no real way to incentivize your opponents into doing your bidding.

An excellent worker placement game that has a few elements that evoke images of Stone Age (which I love).  The Sphinx cards can make or break your game and I don't know if that is a good thing.  I do know that I had fun playing it.  It could go up to a 9 with additional plays.

This is now officially a 9 for me.  There are so many cool decisions that are predicated on where the cards fall on the Nile.  Fantastic.

Play definitely benefits from experience.  We play so infrequently, that we forget which cards are in the Nile deck, as well as which bonuses are in the Sphinx deck.

Even so, we always have fun with Egizia.

RATING: 7.5
Played first 2p game. It is what I would call a typical euro game. Do not look for a theme here. It was all about numbers. Only a very small theme feel comes from flowing down the river and that's about it for me - place your cubes, collect rewards, use your gained special actions, build spending your resources and collect victory points. There are moments where you will need some time to think (=calculate), might not be the best game for AP people.

One of the better worker placement games out there in my opinion. I love the mechanic behind the actions being slowly moved lower and lower on the track, I mean river. Or, is that the Nile? :-)

RATING: 7
My first experience with Egizia was two consecutive 2P games back in 2013. As of September 2014, I recently got a 3P game played. Egizia is a standard worker placement game with two points of interest. First, I like the innovative 'downstream' worker placement mechanism. It poses a dilemma of meandering along the track to pick up as many benefits as possible, or speeding up to snag the best stuff before your opponents do. 

The second point of interest is the game's compactness. The game builds up rapidly and pulls the brakes in the very round that players' engines are running optimally. And yet it is not as unforgiving as it first appears and with some care, it is possible to get a lot of things done within the short span of the game.

However, I have three reservations regarding Egizia. The first is that the rules are finicky despite the game's compactness; this is not a game you can jump straight in after not playing it for a while and expect to wing your way through the rules, and neither is it a newbie-friendly ruleset. The second concerns the luck of the draw. Not only is getting Sphinx cards which complement each other highly advantageous, but the order of the Nile cards also matters, as the player who goes first will luck out if a strong card appears at the beginning of the track. The third concerns the replay value, as roughly the same Nile cards will be seen in every game, albeit in a slightly different order each time. So it seems that there is a lack of diversity in the decisions made from game to game, although it is a little early to comment on this for now.

The last thing to note is that Egizia feels a little too loose with 2P; it fares better with more players on board. For me, Egizia is a good example of how a border-nondescript design can sometimes shine with the right touches.

[3 plays] This is a good game. Not giving it an 8 because I might turn down a game, I'm just not sure quite yet if I can raise my rating.

Nice theme to mechanics overlay. The downstream placement mech is cool. The tension of wanting to do so many things but afraid to delay too long and miss out on things happening below is very draining/invigorating depending on how successful your game is progressing.

I really look forward to more of Egizia now that I have a grasp on what I should be doing.

Munkáslerakós, a legjobb fajtából. Gyönyörű tábla, érdekes játékmenet, nagyon jó téma. Mi kellhet még?
A Nílus partjain építkeznek a játékosok. Obeliszket, templomot, piramist, Szfinxet építve, sírhelyeket feltárva különböző előnyöket adó kártyák gyűjtögetésével szerzik a szkarabeusszal jelölt pontokat. Ezen felül Ticket to Ride szerű célkártyákkal plusz pontokat gyűjthetnek különböző célok elérésével. Kellemes közepesen gyors játékmenet, elfogadható szerencsefaktorral.

[2011-06-06]
Méltánytalanul sokat állt a doboz játék nélkül tavaly óta, örülök, hogy most sikerült két partit is lejátszani ezzel a nagyon jó játékkal. Nagyon sok szép játéktáblát láttam már, de az Egiziáé nálam a csúcs most. A játékban nagyon fontosak a Szfinx kártyák, talán nélkülük nem is lehet nyerni. Ha ezt megcáfolná majd egy-egy későbbi parti akkor még nagyobbat nőne a szememben a játék. A játékostársaim egyedül a Nílus vízmennyiségének változtatási lehetőségét kritizálták. És valahol jogosnak is érzem ezt a kritikát. Alapvetően egy kis konfliktusfaktorral rendelkező játékról van szó, ugye csak a helyek megszerezése lenne ez alapvetően, de a Nílus szabályozásával eléggé keresztbe lehet tenni a másiknak.

[2011-09-26]
Sajnos egyértelműen látszik, hogy a Szfinxkártyák döntenek. A szerencsés húzás, illetve ezekből minél több gyűjtése dönti el a győztes kilétét. Eddig mindig így történt, várom, hátha lesz erre cáfolat, ha nem, akkor valószínűleg eggyel csökkentem a pontszámot.

[2012-01-07]
Igen, a Szfinxkártyák döntenek, de mégse csökkentem a pontszámot, mert az építés összességében fontos és a Szfinxkártyák is idetartozik. Erre fel kell hívni a kezdőjátékosok figyelmét és működni fog a játék.

[2014-09-01]
Sikerült egy olyan partit játszani, amiben csak 2 Szfinxkártya teljesítésével lett első valaki, így kiderült, hogy nem mindenhatók, bár egyértelműen a könnyebb út a minden körben szerzett kártya.

Wow!  This might be my favorite euro of 2009.  It reminds me of a more-involved Stone Age, which is a terrific thing.

Great game.

Awesome game. Really, it may not have tons of new mechanics, and flashy ideas, but it is put together so well, and is really a blast to play. The mechanic where you have to place your workers downstream from the last one placed is brilliant: so excruciating in its choices! There is a tiny bit of math calculation you have to do when planning your building and such, but it's done in a really fun way. Top notch game that i'm very much glad to have in my collection. 

And turns are really zippy too.

Beautiful game, nice components, and really fun, even if it's not that original.  You've got your worker placement going on, but the interesting thing is that you have an opportunity to place pieces anywhere, but the catch is that you can't go back upstream.  I love this press-your-luck aspect to it; Caylus kind of has it, but this one is more obvious and probably a bit lighter of a game.

It is yet another worker placement game. This time, the twist is that about half the actions come in random order each (of 5) turns, and you may not place another upstream of your previously placed workers. That simple change, though, is brilliant! Do you hang back, hoping to get a bunch of different actions, or jump ahead to what you really want/need, forgoing all those other temptations?

The biggest problems are the Sphinx cards (end game bonuses; draw up to 5 depending on resources you spend, keep 0 or 1, returning unused cards to bottom of deck for 1VP each): I think you MUST get some in order to have a chance of winning. That's a little annoying, but not horrible as long as everyone knows. Worse is that the cards can have a pretty broad range in value, and you can get lucky and score a bunch of points for having had good fortune.

Worth a bunch of plays (and it's on Yucata, so that's pretty likely) but I don't think this will be a classic.

Another worker (or boat) placement game, one i like.

The twist is that actions selected must be futher along the Nile, which provides a nasty (or delicious) constraint. 

The other twist is the end game VP objectives - some are semi collaborative, or rather you are reqarded for a coleective achievement. This is interesting as you can try to set this up by timing on buildings. 

The other twist is balancing the construction strenght of your work force.

Getting loads of Sphinx cards seems to decide the game end order, it's an area that needs to be fought over.

decent game with some solid interaction, and a great placement mechanism.  Rules break with special power cards, some immediate, some 1-time use, some permanent.  Rules are often poor, but can be cross-checked with the examples and board iconography.  Some of the rules text is diametrically opposed to icons and examples.

The main problem I can see with the game ever reaching much higher than 7 with us, is that it is strongly prone to AP problems--unfortunately you are required to take a lot of disparate info from your own situation, as well as the other players, analyze it all in relation to relative move positions, and then optimize your placement based on that. 

Even though it is a lighter game than say, Asyria, it plays more slowly, and takes longer due to the AP problems.  And our group is not very prone to AP, but you still must spend some time analyzing the situation each time you take your turn, and pre-planning is limited because the relative situation changes as the other players take their turns.

Overall I'm surprised that this game is rated quite as highly as it is--just outside the top 100 is astonishing because while good, it's far from that good.

This game doesn't really grab my interest as I though it might.  I like the idea of an Egyptian theme but mechanics do not seem to mesh with the theme enough for me.

My score never seems to improve leaving me a bit perplexed, which might also be affecting my opinion of the game.

These odd themes (monuments in Egypt in this one) sort of annoy me, namely because they simply hide the fact that it's a number of abstract mechanics linked together by a tacked on theme. It's too many mechanics to be a "classic" abstract; and it's not historical or reflect a real life dilemma. The mechanics all seem to work, you sort of lay tiles in a bidding war on such things as the Great Pyramid. It definitely works, professional job, takes a little long but willing to play it.

Basically the same worker placement game to get victory points that you've already probably played, the only thing that differentiates this one is that the places you can work are dictated by previous placements that you have already made.  

It was interesting and was fun to play, but unless the theme hits hard for you, or you have some other reason for wanting this particular game there isn't much here to keep you coming back.

Tha path where you can put your pawn is a one way path. When you choose a place, you could put your next pawn only further, so all places behind are unaviable for you. This is an interesting twist to the worker placement mechanic.
The game is very nice, but i don`t see a big replaybility. I think the next games would be similar.

A nice, quick, worker (ship) placement game. A little staged; a little forced into quickness; but with a good economy underlying the game. Get more people: feed them; get more stone for them to work with; get more ways of earning VPs. Egyptian theme, which I always like--no gods and such in this theme, just themed of the famous monuments of Egypt.

With two players, Egizia plays very well but very differently. With eight boats per played, two-player shifts dramatically to deciding which of the twenty spaces are most important to claim. The card allowing claiming of an unused card becomes very powerful.

Nice production quality. Wooden bricks and ships, though the ships have all the detail of Thurn & Taxis post offices (ie, they appear to be inside corner molding, cut into individual "ships").

Fun game. I like the worker placement ones. Cute little boatmeeples. Nice colourful pieces.

Medium complexity. Not too complicated to pick up the gist quickly. 

Competition added with the no going backwards on the river rule. Too many spaces on the board for two players. Really should be played with at least three.

Egizia is a nice worker placement game that has a neat river-themed twist.  Once players place a worker, they can not move upstream to place another worker.  This creates a nifty tension in how fast players want to race down the Nile to the spots they really want, but leaving a lot of stuff behind.

This is a terrific little worker-placement games with some resemblance to games like Caylus and Stone Age. Egizia is quite a bit more complex than the very streamlined Stone Age, a bit more freewheeling than the very structured and mostly luck-free Caylus and has a niche all its own. Experience is greatly rewarded, but drawing the right bonus cards can make or break a player's game. Not sure at present if Egizia has a chance to move up to the elite ranks of the the 9s and 10s in my collection, or even stand the test of time and survive being the flavor of the month, but as of this posting I am enjoying Egizia quite a bit. Update: Rating inproved to a 9: I think Egizia has quitely moved into the upper echelons of my favorite games. Further Update: After five solid years of staying high in my play rotation, Egizia rating bumped to 10. A top-tier game that now has stood the test of time.

Beautiful game that is very reasonably priced (great bang for the buck). Lots of options, good paths to victory options. The downstream only placement of boats makes for lots of agonizing decisions. Play should be best with 3, difficult with 4 and pretty open with 2. Really nice game.

Finally, a fast-moving worker placement game with plenty of gamer cues!  Egizia uses cards for half of the placements so the board changes regularly.  It also integrates farmland, quarries, construction crews, and monuments into one smooth sequence.  Diverse scoring keeps everyone involved until the last minute.  There's a lot of meat here, yet Egizia plays reliably in under 90 minutes.  Very impressive.

One of the coolest implementations of worker placement you're ever going to see.

RATING: 7
Four plays.  I think its a nifty game.  The balance between keeping many ships alive, but pushing further down the river to get the better cards is delicious.  I also enjoy the balancing of currencies.  Actually, the farming/slaves/quarry feel like a tech tree.  I unfortunately think it may be all about the sphinx cards.  I like the game, it reminds me of Goa and Caylus in a blender with a splash of Amun-Re. ) The sphinx cards remind me of the development cards as well.  So it may rise, it may fall but for now its an 8.

I like the decision point of pressing down the river to get the better stuff, versus holding back and placing more boats.  The sphinx cards ensure its a lighter game, but the jury is still out for me if the lighter fits it, or they blew a chance at a great replayable classic.

The game is too friendly with two.  Very open possibilities, and its about managing the nile against one other player with "stops" at the three building sites.

I have tried it with 4.  Egizia is a game that scales from 4-4.  It is the only way to play.

The mathematical underpinnings of this game are too close to the surface for my taste, i.e. the theme is too thin to make this much more than an exercise in calculation. I'd probably play it again if everybody else wanted to, but would never suggest it myself. I like the 'moving down the river' mechanic (also used in other games, e.g. Francis Drake) and the stone/worker accumulation/spending is okay. I don't think it's a BAD game - it's just not MY sort of game (I also don't like Viceroy or Five Tribes).

The game lasts 5 turns. In each turn, the players place their pawns on the board, along the banks of the Nile, getting the advantages shown on each square. On the right bank there are fixed squares where the players may get workers, improve their mercantile capabilities, influence the floods (and thus the fertility of the fields) and reserve the right to build the monuments (that are built only after all the placements are done). On the left bank the players may take cards that are deployed randomly on the 10 squares at the start of each turn; some of these cards are kept until the end of the game (cultivable fields, stone quarries, deities granting special advantages), while others are discarded after the use and offer multiple immediate advantages.

RATING: 6
There are way too many errors and ambiguity for a game published by RGG and HiG. One of the biggest error in our first play is the granary track where even at the final spot, players are penalized 1VP per unfed worker. Why was that notation not printed on the final slot apart from the +2VP in subsequent advancement? Moreover, this particular rule was misplaced in the rule book such that I could not find the entry.

The game's poorly written rules and general ambiguity is ultimately sunk by the hidden objectives power cards. This is one mechanism that needs to be re-imagined by all the games with secret hidden scoring objectives. There has to be a better way of doing this. If picked early, often times, the objectives don't match end-game situations. If picked too late, they are often times useless. Moreover games can be won by luck of the draw which in this case is compounded by the fact that players can pay resources to pick several cards.

That being said, I really do enjoy the "downstream" worker placement mechanism which limits selection. That part was fun and generated a lot of angst-filled moments. The decision to jump ahead and secure a spot vs. playing it slow and safe to pick up cards people bypassed. This is a great mechanism which should be employed by other worker placement games.

Gorgeous worker placement, with a nice "one way" placing system. Similar to Glen More in this way, once you jump out ahead to get a coveted space, you've left the ones you jumped over free for your opponents. This is one of those games where everything comes together perfectly, just a solid game all around. Some folks complain about some of the cards available, we just haven't had any issues with them.

Worker placement game. A lot of my games have been two player. I find playing with modified 2p rules works well.

My 2p "variant" is this: Deal out 5 Sphinx cards; each player chooses one. Each of the building sites can only have one boat... prospecting rules still apply. This "variant" keeps the tension that is found in the 3p and 4p games.

The "moving down the river" action drafting mechanism is fun; the turn-angst is palpable here and I enjoy that. However, I have some issues with the game after a few plays that keep it from being something I'd suggest or buy: 1. the get a sphinx card location seems too strong; my last session there were several rounds when the first two players went there as their first action 2. I'm not a fan of hidden scoring objectives, especially here where other players can unwittingly help you complete yours. Hidden scoring objectives dampen and discourage meaningful interaction. There might be more here to explore, but I'm just not that taken with the experience.

RATING: 6
Well, this is nice enough.  It's not groundbreaking, by any means, but the worker placement mechanism of having to place downstream is clever, and makes sense in regards to the theme.  Balancing the stones and the workers and the food and all that you want to do is what gives the game its tension, and it all works just fine.  It just doesn't make me want to play this game over other worker placement games.  Like BBQ sauce, Egizia has a nice flavor, but it's not something I want to have for an entire meal.  I'd definitely play it again, though, as I see some of the tactical errors I made during the game.

After a difficult start while reading the explanation (full of example but somehow obscure) we had the greatest pleasure playing this game. Acchittocca are masters of worker placement and this is probably their best game.
A lot of things to take into account, interesting elements very well combined among them, some luck but not too much and not too decisive, simply fun and very rewarding.
Have it explained by someone instead of reading the rules and you will enjoy it immensely.

After so many games i must say Egizia is probably in my TOP 5 games ever! Every game is so interesting, tense and just wonderful!

Worker placement. Various ways to gain more workers and food. Once you place a worker you cannot go back up river to an earlier spot to place. You have to scope out what you need and decide how soon to go for it. Bonus cards from the sphinx are the difference with new players. Experienced players can offset this but there is some luck in drawing the cards.

Good worker placement, collect stuff, build stuff sort of game. Much better with four than with three because of greater competition along the river, but more spaces on the building tracks. Overpowered Sphinx cards are a slight negative, but as long as everyone realises the strength of that building site it should balance itself out. I would love it if there was a decent strategy for winning which didn't involve the Sphinx, but that doesn't seem possible.

Much better than I thought it'd be. The down-stream mechanic gives some tough choices whether to reach for certain things or not. Some of the permanent effects really change up what you can do. The Sphinx mission cards are a little gamey and can really swing the scores at end game, but I guess that's what they are supposed to do. We removed the 1VP/every10VP card as it's pretty ridiculous.

6 after 1 play

Rather dry and soulless game, with almost everything requiring 1 worker + 1 stone to gain 1 VP. The theme is really weak and a story arc is lacking. The main point of interest is the downstream worker placement mechanic, which creates lots of indirect player interaction. Iconology on the board is rather poor and somewhat misleading at times. Artwork and game component quality are ok. Not sure if the game is scalable, as the number of action spaces remain static with different number of players?

Hans im Glück….. To us, that name is almost similar to a nice family game. And family games we like a lot. Just name a few of the games published by this company: Carcassonne, El Caballero, Citadels, Dominion, Finca, El Grande, Hacienda, Modern Art, Saint Petersburg, Stone Age, Thurn and Taxis, and so on.
 
Most of the games mentioned above we know, and we like. You can imagine the fact, that we got a bit excited when we got the opportunity to play this game of Hans.
 
The setting of this game is ancient Egypt. Each player has to do 7 things in his turn. A lot of information is in the rulebook, but surprisingly enough, it al makes sense, and this is an easy game to play. We both loved it.

Decent worker-placement entry.  Place your ships, gain resources, convert them into victory points.

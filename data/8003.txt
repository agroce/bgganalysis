RATING: 9
Not the perfect system for ancinet minature wargamming (does it exist), but I now use this system because so many gamers familiar with Warhammer system, always has great support, game does play fast and clean, rewards historical tactis, and is a game and not a simulation.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
A simple set of rules that are generic to most armies. The fast pace game is probably what it was designed for, but lacked some rules clarifications. 

Because it's simple, there is no flavour in the armies. Play it as a set of guidelines for beginners. Move on if you need more meat.

The battles didn't feel to me like their historical counterparts. When two opposing units clashes either unit is running - which is running until it recoveres. So no ongoing engagements with a strike on the flank with another unit. 

The cavalry charges on too great distances.

RATING: 5
Using the very good Warhammer rules (2nd Ed) and using cheap armies. But no one would play! (which is evidence to me that capitalism is the draw with the mainstream miniature wargames.)

I didn't like how the game felt when played. Funny because I like to play Warhammer Fantasy Battle (usually 3rd ed.)

Great set of rules for beer and pretzels ancients wargaming.  Perfect simulation?  No?  Reasonable facsimile with concessions to make it a fun game? Yes.  Too many rhetorical questions?  Sure.

Played a prototype of Napoleonic version, great fun although thought that cannon fire was way underpowered but that might well be lack of period knowledge on my part.

 Why have I given this game such a high rating, even over the rating os other gamesworkshop games? For one big reason, this version of Warhammer has closed many loopholes and ambiguous parts in the fantasy rulebook. I prefer using it along with the fantasy armies, rather than the fantasy rulebook. Excellent.

Maybe not the best simulation but I had a lot of fun playing this, using the 1.0 and 1.5 versions.  Buckets o'dice, which didn't bother me, these smoothed out the major problems in WFB (herohammer, overpowered magic, etc).

I especially liked that each army had its own flavor, and were not so abstracted out so that they all seemed pretty much the same.

Unfortunately GW killed this one on their own.  It was a shame, since the community for this was incredible and created so much for the game itself.  GW doesn't understand a loss leader that can help sustain a brand reputation in the community is a powerful thing.

I'm not a huge fan of Warhammer mechanics (ie, buckets o' dice) but this rule book is nicely done.

RATING: 7
Warhammer without the epic heroes and magic.  Not the most historically accurate game ever, but a good tactical game with the emphasis on maneuveur.
Some imbalances exist (nomadic horde/mongols are ridiculously good) but the expansions books tend to be well balanced to themselves.

Flexible rules system which you can use for any theme.  Worth owning a copy.

It's Warhammer 5th Edition without Magic and with lower powered heroes.  It's not a bad game, but overruns are still FAR too easy for how lethal they are.  That's a relic of later editions of Fantasy, when they wanted to speed the game up.

Not bad.  Not historical either.  Many other better game systems out there from companies that don't try to screw every dime out of their customers every chance they get.  Just my opinion of course...

28mm Norman, EIR, Saxon, Picts, Barbarian/Celts.

RATING: 1
cuts down on the cheese of warhammer fantasy and is actually affordable, as you could just use 20mm plastic mioniatures.
BUT: barbarians are nearly un-fieldable, as they would require about 300 miniatures.
given that the game is thought to be played in 28mm: madness.

old-fashioned, sometimes its fun. impetus is a FAR better game.

liked playing this, not as good as DBM or fantasy battles, but I like theme better than fantasy battles and they are not that different

RATING: 8
great game, simple but detailed and with lots of flavour from existing lists - unlike other systems (DBx) where you seem to control abstract troops instead of roman legions or norman warriors.

RATING: 8
Classic wargaming action - basic rules can be learnt very quickly.  Flexible army list system mean that (with a bit of tolerance) any figures can be used.  
 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Roll to hit, roll to wound, roll to save.  It seems rather inelegant for a historical system.  Still, the army lists are a lot better thought out than GWs fantasy/scifi games.

Well nicely put together book full of inspiring pictures of painted figures, but the Warhammer rules are still very bland and do not give me any feeling for the period.

Fast and simple Ancients wargaming rules. Easy to learn if you're already familiar with the Warhammer Fantasy and/or 40k systems.

RATING: 7
I like the warhammer system as it's fairly scalable and fun, I look to these as the 'pure' warhammer ruleset.  I have real problems with non slotta based miniatures so it's hard for me to consider really going historical.

This suits my changing adult tastes better than 40K or WFB.

Good set of ancients rules. Great reason for buying and painting 25mm figures. Maybe tad too many dice needed, but still fun.

2 / 5 - Fair.

WFB stripped down to human v human combat. While the similar profiles of all the troops make for some interesting tactics the removal of variety and especially all forms of magic does make the game a little dry.

In many ways like Warhammer fantasy, but with a more interesting background, the ancient world and the real medieval age. You will throw buckets of dice, but it is fun.

Simple rules on one level, but a complex mess on another. Badly laid out, overlong and full of cross-references which aren't cross referenced - so you'll be flicking back an forward like loon. 
Roll to hit, roll to save - can be seriously flawed when 1+ save cavalry is involved.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Unnecessary. Strange scale (or really: No scale at all). Fiddly, needs loads of minis to play, takes forever. I do not think I will ever play this again. I tried to like it a little better when it was popular. Since that has faded, there is little reason left for any involvement with this game.

To my knowledge this game is built on the miniature game Warhammer Fantasy Battles 5th Edition.

It is a skirmish or smaller battle game that seems to emphasize particular characteristics of historically based troops using the Warhammer system.

I like this game for it's skirmish qualities but I believe The Lord of the Rings Miniatures Game to be a more streamlined version of Warhammer Fantasy. 

If you want to emphasize individual movements as opposed to those of larger bodies of troops, emphasize the qualities of figures themselves and have fun with scenery and scenery effects, you might enjoy this game.

I find the math involved a bit boring and seeming to lack realism but I believe the volume includes some interesting historical information and art, as well as a very interesting non-geographic but territorial campaign system, to give a nice backdrop to a series of battles.

[i]GW game. The game isn't annoying, but the publisher is, to a degree that I will not play or support their products. Orginally rated this a 7, but GW just sucks the fun out of playing their games.[/i]

Includes a level-counter board. Cane mechanic means you can keep going, and going, and going...

It's another Munchkin game, and not even a particularly interesting one mechanically.  I swear, if they keep putting these tired rehashes out like this, I might rate one a 6 some day.

Game went fast, but sometimes that's just the cards. Artwork was really good.

This was my first time picking up a 'Deluxe' edition for Munchkin, and while I appreciate the board, I do wish the standees were a little better, or plastic minis. As for the Steampunk version of Munchkin, it's kind of fun, I do like Phil Foglio's artwork and have for a long time. The mechanics are pretty much pure Munchkin but the cane weapons you can attach together felt new.

Must have if you are into Steampunk or not so many gears!

No fan of the themes or art of any of the other Munchkins, but, hey, Foglio. And a tried-and-true (if not all that great) mechanic. Interested to see what the "canes" add to it.

Just like all the other munchkin games, but with artwork by Phil Foglio.  And I still can't beat my son.  I need other players so we can team up on him.

Just didn't hit the mark theme-wise with me. We've enjoyed other Munchkins more.

Nice jokes, my favorite steampunk theme. Not to be played too often, otherwise might get boring. A nice way to introduce people to the board-gaming!

Charming illustrations by Kovalik and amusing tongue-in-cheek humor, but the game ceased to be enjoyable once I discovered Euro games which made me more critical of how I spent my leisure time.

Phil Foglio art is worth the purchase. It is also a great Munchkin game.

Same game, just didn't enjoy the theme/art as much as the original.

It's trendy to hate Munchkin, I know. I'm not surprised. But at the same time Cosmic Encounter gets praised. Now I love Cosmic Encounter and it deserves all the praise. It's a permanent top5 game for me. But really BGG? Munchkin is basically gateway version of CE, let's be honest. That's how Steve Jackson made it. Why hate it for that? This is same as Munchkin, Star Munchkin etc. mechanically, but with steampunk jokes. One difference is that Steampunk Munchkin has better artwork than past versions.

This is like the other Munchkin but with elements of Steampunk. I don't think they improve the gameplay much and the theme isn't one I'm particularly interested in. It is not a game I would seek to play.

As is often true with Munchkin it's fun to read the cards, even when it doesn't matter to the game.

This game was "fun" to play, but it was very random. Game length can be anything from super short to super long. I at least like to have a general idea of how long I'm going to be playing something. There were also some problems where a player could easily get stuck early and never get to do anything. With large player counts, games can go on too long as players can keep denying someone to get that last level.

FAMILY

A easy-to-learn game that relies a lot on chance. Similar to Tic-Tac-Toe. Great for casual play with family.

I played lots of games of this with my Grandma Jeane, both in Waseca and at the cabins on Beaver Lake.

Recommended with 2-6 or 6 players (best 3-4). 120 mins.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
A simple enough game which groups of players play against each other to for 2 sequences in the boardgame.  After playing a card, players can place a token onto the board corresponding to the card played.  When a Jack is played, the player can remove any token on the board / add a token to any position on the board.  Once a team has successfully create 2 sequences of 5 tokens each, the team wins the game.

Good points: Easy to play and the game can be explained with minutes.  There are a bit of strategy in play as players can choose to either block other teams or build their own sequence.

Bad points: The luck factor is very important in the game.  There are teams that create many 4-token sequences but just cannot seemed to have the final card that helped them win the game.

A dumbed down version of Sid Sackson's Acquire and Reiner Knizia's Rheinlander; apart from the victory condition (and even then, only sort of), it has nothing in common with Pente.
I think the utter simplicity of the game and the (literally) luck of the draw have led people who have played Sequence only once or twice to think that it's a mindless luck-fest. It can be...but only if you want it to be!

I bought the handmade board by Michaud Toys (www.michaudtoys.org).

The game is quite fun, although it doesn't require much strategy.  Basically, as long as you pay attention and not miss anything obvious, you'll do well.  Mostly, though, the winner of the game is the luckiest person - as it relies on cards, it truly is the luck of the draw.  If you get the right cards, you'll get a sequence.  If you don't, you won't.  Even the most skilled player has to cross his fingers. :)

This is the original game which my wife an I began playing together, back before we became "gamers."  It is still so much fun, as we've tweaked the rules to require three sequences in order to win.  The tension and card-counting is so excellent.  

There are a few old school games that I'll never kick out of my collection--this is one of them!

Adequate as a two-player game, this game shines with 4 or more people playing as teams, as the dynamic can shift greatly while you await your next turn.  Players need to stay focused to keep up, or else the game drags while they re-examine the board.

For whatever reason, every now and then I like drawing cards and putting a chip on a corresponding picture on the board.  Five in a row, and I win.  Hmm.  Will the deck be organized in my favor, or my opponents' favor?  My six year old gets a kick out of blocking my attempts or removing a chip when I am close to winning.  Any game that gives my kids joy is all good for me.  [Thrift $1.09: Deluxe ed.]

[i]Sequence[/i] may be the best pre-crossover game to an acknowledged crossover game like [i][thing=50]Lost Cities[/thing][/i].  Its mechanics are very simple: draw a card, and find its two pictures on the board where it appears.  Place a chip on the card's portrait of your choice.  Each player or team continues this process until you have created a "sequence" of five chips.

The only cards whose pictures are not on the board are the jacks.  Two-eyed jacks are treated as wild cards, while one-eyed jacks allow you to remove a chip of an opposing color.  The deck in Sequence is comprised of two standard decks, so you have eight jacks in total, or four of each type.

The corner spaces on the board are also wild, and can be used by any color as part of a sequence -- meaning a team only has to have four of their chips in a row, leading into a corner.

My wife and her friends who would normally be resistant to board games love to play [i]Sequence[/i].  We usually play with a house rule that each player or team needs to complete two sequences in order to win (in a three player/team game, the rules state that only one sequence is required).  Drawing cards, and managing board position at the same time?  Sounds like the first baby step towards better games!

[i]Updated: 8/29/10, Rated: 6[/i]

What a difference perspective makes.  I was fond of this game when I first learned it over five years ago.  Its ability to bring non-gamers was, and still is a strength.  However, I define a "6" as "Above average. Offers some fun or challenge. I will play if I'm in the right mood. It could be a better game if played with the right group."  That last line particularly applies to [i]Sequence:[/i] it still is quite enjoyable when played with our friends who taught it to us.  Otherwise it's okay, but not great.

Not much strategy in this game.  It is amazing to me how long some players think about their moves when the choices are so limited.  It's a tolerable game experience, but when you don't get any Jacks you can feel so out-of-control of your own destiny.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
No real strategy to speak of; that being said, still a fun game to play with friends.  The game is a 5/10 unless you get a TENQUENCE and then it becomes infinity/10 because you've just stepped out of mortal bounds.

(Tenquence:  This is the mythical state of acquiring a sequence covering the full length of the board, achieved in team play.  Wild squares are out of bounds, and the players must be careful not to win the game before achieving the Tenquence.  To date, a Tenquence has only been rumored to have been achieved once; a pyramid is currently being erected in memory of this event.  If a Tenquence should ever occur at your table, you are advised to (a) immediately stop playing, (b) verify that this is a genuine Tenquence and not a 'Fake Tenquence', (c) take a picture to commemorate the occasion, (d) immediately stop playing, hold hands, and start singing.  They say once a Tenquence is achieved, try making a wish!)

RATING: 3
Initial Rating: 4 (12/29/2008)

It's Pente, only instead of strategically picking your spots, you're given options based on the cards you draw. Each card allows play in one of two locations, and to keep things interesting (?) the jacks do special things like act as wilds or take away previously played tokens.

Initial two games consisted of pair play which strictly forbids table talk. This takes a potentially strategic game and makes it a guessing game of what your partner might have that's useful, which is hard to gague by placement alone.

In the end, I lowered the rating from 5 for a few reasons:
1) The use of a normal deck of cards but not including a use for the jokers is silly. The use of cards to represent the spaces to play tokens on shows a distinct lack of imagination.
2) The game is limited to three players or 'teams' of players, and I can't say that 'team' play really felt like teamwork.
3) Fun factor sucked out a bit by inability to communicate with your partner in any meaningful way.
4) Luck factor is far too high.  The only decision points are where to place one's card if it is the first of a given value/suit played.

Played several times during Christmas. 
Well recieved by the whole family. The young ones even suggest the game, and that is not done often.
Game works well with two players/teams, but I will never play again with three players.
The game bogged down in the end with chips on all cards and the only solution was to get the jacks on your hand to be able to end the game.
Didn't make the game fun. Was more a long waiting stretch to see who was more lucky.

There is luck in the cards drawn, hence determining the kind of Sequences one forms. Draw and play what you have, then pray for the Jacks to flood your way. I think that's all there is to the game. Actually, I'm not sure I will even recommend it as an introductory game.

The "play 1, draw 1" rules need modification.  I want to play around with line drafting, the GMTB Loaf, and other hand management options.

HOUSE RULES: Play for points.  When a line is formed, score points based on length... 1 for 5, 3 for 6, 5 for 7, 7 for 8.  Play to a point total (maybe 10).

RATING: 4
Uhm, it's a classic, but many classics equal old games which again equals not great games... It's good in the sense that a lot of people can play this game at the same time, so if you have a big group of non-gamers, it's a good game to choose. However, for me as a gamer, I find it lacks quite a lot and that there is too much luck involved in the card draws - it's hard to win if you never get a Jack or just never get the right cards... I do like the rule that if you don't remember to draw a card, it's just too bad for you!

Relatively fun, but I wouldn't want to play it all the time.  It's really random as far as what cards teammates get, so sometimes a few good draws will secure a team victory--but other times one is left with few unoccupied options for sequences with one's hand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Sequence is one of those filler games. Its basically cards with a twist. Team play is fun and fairly relaxing for a nice evening of gaming with your *tame* friends. I probably would not actually request to play this game very often, but will  usually play it if someone else wants.

This is a super simple family game which I have played for many years with my family. It is quick and relaxing to play, but there can also be some stressful decisions which will suck you into the game. It forces you to find spatial patterns, which makes it great for kids. My wife's mother introduced it to a 7 year old girl she sits, and the girl really liked it. I recommend this for families with kids 6+ (the younger ones might need some help, but they can still follow).

Sequence can get kind of repetitive, so it's best played with a group of talkative people. At least then you're chatting while playing, as the game doesn't really require too much concentration. The more I play Sequence, the more I dislike it. I suppose I've been spoiled with so many games that offer many meaningful decisions to make, whereas Sequence offers virtually none.

This is an o.k. game.  It is high on luck.  Before finding the "geek" this was seen as a pretty good adult game.  Many people I know would play this during their lunch hour.  If they only knew.

Compared to what I play now, it is pretty weak.  Still, I'd play it with someone if they asked.  Then I would steer them to something more "challenging".

Very hard to play this one in teams without someone ruining it with "table talk".

Bought new for $19.95.  This is my replacement copy, my previous copy disappeared over the years.
Mom gave me Uncle Keith's copy in Oct 2016.
I believe the first time I saw this game played was in about 1989, on what I believe was a handmade board.  Handmade boards used to be common at garage sales, using a large piece of wood with playing cards glued to it and glossed over.
I have always been amused by their marketing strategy.  They sell about 4 or 5 sizes of game boards, each costing about $10 more than the next smaller board.  I think that "Jumbo Sequence" used to cost about $64.  My copy is probably one size smaller than regular.
My copy has some box damage, with the lid caving in a bit, and the inner support giving way as well.
It's a good filler game.  Don Rice and I often play it.  2-4 players.  I'm good at it.

A fun but simple game. Not a lot to say about this one, as a lot of the skill seems to be getting good at reading the pattern of the board and keeping an eye out on what cards were played as the main component to your strategy. That said it can be a little overwhelming to deal with a skilled opponent who can see all the moves from a rather busy looking board. Not that its a bad thing either mind you. Decent but wouldn't go out of my way to play it.

RATING: 5
Not a big fan, but gave it a five because my wife likes it and any game that I can play with my wife is worth at least that.  Easy enough that our six-year-old can play.  For me, it's a filler between games I'd rather be playing.

A decent little mainstream game. Despite the cards, it's not really a card game at all. Fun with four players as two teams. Easily obtained at your local thrift store.

RATING: 7
If you really want to play something, and there's no "game people" around... it's this or Bohnanza.  And this has familiar cards with hearts and clubs, so even the biggest yahoos will probably give it a shot.  With that in mind, it's a fun distraction, there's worse things to do at grandmas.

RATING: 7.25
Surprised this isn't rated higher. For what its trying to be, it does it pretty well.  Which is a simple family/party game that can accomodate a large number of people. Fair amount of luck obviously but thats part of the fun here. Great in teams. I enjoy making fun of people who forget to draw their card after their play.  Slight drawback is that people tend to be silent and stare at the board rather than talking.  This usually  makes it into my family/party game stack.

This game is surprisingly better than it should be (29/12/10). UPDATE: As a game with kids It's fine, and it can handle many players.  But the jacks are too powerful and make the game too luck dependent. A bit old time mechanics, but an ok game for the collection, as it will be used again (rating decrease from 7 to 6; March 2014). UPDATE: I don't care that its available at the toy shop and involves playing cards, I like it! (Rating 6.928, Jan 17)

A family standard at my house.  My recommendation: Don't buy the box at the store.  Make your own Sequence board!  Surf the internet and find creative card layouts (I prefer ones in which the suits are symmetrically placed).  Buy four decks of playing cards (2 normal size for your hand, and 2 "bridge" size for your board), two colors of poker chips and a poster frame.  Add in a little time and glue and you've got yourself a game to be proud of.  Give them away as gifts!

[Original comment] Good partnership game, dependent upon the cards you draw. We always play best two out of three games. Quick-playing and good for almost all ages.

May 2009 -- This continues to be a game that we enjoy occasionally.

October 2011 -- We play this only occasionally. We usually play it with three teams of two players each and have a fun time. We also enjoy two two-player teams now and then, and occasionally a three-player game.

2013-November:  We still like this game, now and then.

I'm not going to lie...I like Sequence. Of all the games I now detest since my introduction to BGG, Sequence is not numbered among them. I know, I know, it is really not that good. Little to no decision making process, luck based draws (i.e. who gets the Jacks.). But I still have fun with it. Simple. Quick. Occasionally suspenseful.

Like most card games, there is a lot of luck.  The strategy is where to place the marker as there are 2 choices on the board for each card.  It is a good mix of luck and strategy.

Very random, but not really all that objectionable. It actually is a bit annoying simply because of the strange numbers of players it requires. 2,3,4,(not 5),6, (not 7). Technically 8-12 works (except 11), but that gives it a bit too much downtime and makes it even harder to feel like you have control. The wild jacks are unbalancing, but fun. Really the nice thing is that it is very easy to teach and fun to play with a non-gaming crowd. Too luck-driven to play on a regular basis though.

My comments were dated on this one.  It's a fun light hearted hybrid card and board game that is nice to play with family or non-gamers.  The random card draws pretty much decide the game but it's nice when you get a few in a row to play out and make sure you don't get blocked in.

Definitely better with more people too.  I can't remember the last time I've played with more than two players.

This is another card game turned board game and has the same type of strategy intensity as other card games such as cribbage or canasta (all very different games, but same level of luck vs. strategy vs. complexity).  Good game to play with her after a hard day at work.

A really nice family game that I enjoyed immensely as a kid.  Now that I've gotten more into gaming as an adult, Sequence has moved down the latter a bit.  Nevertheless, I still like sitting down and playing with my kids every now and again.

First played this on April 12th, 2007.  This is a quick learn and quick play.  There is more than luck than strategy in this, however it does have a decent balance for what it is.  I found this enjoyable and wouldn't mind playing again.  There is a bit of get your neighbor in this which perhaps elevates this a bit.  It's worth a game play or to for you to try out.  It's a stress free game too.

This game sucks.  It's like Tic Tac Toe with a bigger board and a Candyland style card draw.  My girlfriend's family loves it to no end and I mutter under my breath everytime I'm dragged into another excrutiating session.  "WTF are you thinking about you dolt?!  Play a damn card.  This isn't rocket science!"  The fact that people brag about winning afterward makes me want to crack heads.  That's like the equivalent of claiming skill in winning the lottery...  Ugh, hate, hate, hate...

Play a card to play a chip to the board ...first one to 5 in a row wins ... really just an advanced and more luck based X's and O's, however how many games are fun for 9 players playing in three teams of 3? ... not very many! ... so this game get some kudo's just for that fact alone.

It is a very nice card game. Unlike other card games this one also needs a playing board and tokens to play. It is basically like a game of tic-tac-toe with playing cards.

Why do my relatives love this game? Jacks give you some interesting choices to make, but other than that, the 'strategy' is transparent. Also, like many games with 'power' cards/tiles, it's fun if they are spread out, but ridiculous if one side gets them all.

This game is very luck based, as are most card games.  At first the luck was completely against me and I was getting VERY frustrated with the game.  It sucks to never get a sequence in the first two games you play.  But after playing a few more hands it started feeling a little better.

My wife introduced me to this game. It is fun, but suffers from the limitation that the board doesn't change. There is a kind of sequence to the layout of the cards, but there are issues with that (like since jacks are wild, they don't appear on the board, and of course when they switch from one suit, and are they going in a snake like formation).
We haven't tried with three people yet.

Fair amount of luck involved in this game, but the game is about mitigating that luck with chip placement that gives you the best odds of getting 5 in a row. Play this one with my family. Highly accessible for non-gamers with good decisions to keep gamers interested. Major limiting factor is the max play count of 3.

RATING: 6
This game seems to be pretty good for playing with the kids.  I generally play in teams of two with my 3 year old on my team and my 2 grade school age kids on the other team.  The three year old is able to grasp the mechanics of laying down a card and placing a chip on the matching spot of the board.  However, he plays pretty randomly and is therefore a big enough handicap to me that it allows the older kids to win maybe 3/4 of the time.  It seems to be really helping the 3 year old learn his card suits and numbers and the older kids think it is super fun to beat mom.  So in that sense I guess it is a decent game.

On the other hand I really don't think Sequence is all that fun and it would have to be really good company for me to be down for playing a game of it with other adults.

02/08/2013: This was one of the first games I purchased when I got into this hobby.  I wanted a light, simple, family game that I could bring out with, who else, my family.  It's kind of like multiplayer bingo.  Everyone has a hand of cards (standard poker deck), and they play cards trying to get five in a row on a shared board.  You can play up to three teams of 1 to 4 per team.  This is an easy and fun choice to play with any age group and, certainly non-gamers.

With 2 or 3 players, the game is fairly boring.  However, the team-play aspect with 4, 6, 8, 9, etc. players is much more interesting.  The sense of coordinating series without communicating about cards is fun for low-strategy groups (very casual players)

A nice game if I need something to play with really-non-gamers, but it doesn't really do much for me on the whole.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A light family game in which the players are trying to play traditional cards in order to place chips on a board in order to get a sequence of 5 in a row. 

Throw in 4 corner wild spaces that can be built off and Jacks that either act as a wild card or can be used to remove an opponents chip and the game has some appeal.

On top of that the game can be played in teams of 2 with two sequences required for victory. 

This is not mentally challenging in any great way and really only asks the one question - Do you play an attacking move or a blocking move with each turn. 

But of course you have to have the cards in the first place to do anything with purpose. 

This won't satisfy the hardened gamer for too long but with the right group it is light fun and can accommodate a drink in one hand at the same time. 

Want to make those family 'get togethers' a little more tolerable and they are not really gamers? Well Sequence is worth a look.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun & quick filler. It's basically just luck with some pattern recognition short term tactics, but the board and the chips add a nice visual/tactile feel to it. Long-term strategizing is pretty non-existent, mut I simply find it enjoyable to play and prefer it to "Las Vegas", for instance.

I remember having fun with this as a little kid, and so we got a copy at one point without really looking it up at all. Is there any player control in this game at all, except when you use your Jacks?

It's an alright game: get two sets of 5 cards in a row (diagonally, vertically, or horizontally) matching cards to corresponding (standard) card symbols on a board. Players get a starting hand of 5 cards, and play one/draw one. Can be played in teams of players on opposite sides from one another. One-eyed jacks allow one to remove a card of an opponent; two-eyed jacks are wild cards. Games can become fairly drawn-out with blocking or the luck of the draw--the latter of which is probably the major limitation from making the game more interesting than it is. But I would certainly be willing to play it from time to time, although it's nothing I would own.

A classic game of connecting 4 in a row. The board is set up as a somewhat sequential set up of pictures of playing cards. In the game you place one of your tokens on the board that matches the card you play each turn. Once you are able to connect 4 in a row of your color and achieve this twice you win. There are a couple of wilds (one-eyed jacks and regular jacks). A fun game for 2-players that is luck of the draw, but with clever card play the game is strategic enough to balance the luck factor.

A luck-driven Connect 5. Each spot on the board is denoted by a playing card, and each card has 2 valid spaces. So you can put out a piece where one of your 6 cards says. Play 1, draw 1. Try and keep your pieces clumped together and then hope you draw jacks. Two-eyed are wild and will usually be the one to get you the last piece you need to complete a sequence. One-eyed are for defense, allowing you to remove an opponent's piece. So hope to get lucky with your clumps, hope to get lucky with jacks and hope to go out when your opponents don't have defensive jacks. It's pleasant enough as a time-passer and is apparantly best when played in teams, but there's not enough to engage me to want to seek out the opportunity.

Sequence is a partnership game in which players use traditional playing cards to claim spots on a grid board, trying to make five-in-a-rows.  Jacks are special ability cards, and either or wilds or let you remove an opponent's piece.  Teams need to score multiple five-in-a-rows to win.  There are the usual prohibitions on communications with your partner.  While there is a little strategy in your placements, both to maximize your team's options and to give subtle hints to your partner, really this comes down to luck of the draw.

Tried an experiment with this once. Played my dad and simply drew cards and played them without looking at them, randomly. Won a game. 'nuff said. I does have some "grandparent" value, if you are looking for something folks in their 80's can play, along with little ones. For this reason alone I will rate this a 3. (Nah, it's a 2.

A simple and enjoyable game that my parents really like to play, but leaves me feeling a little bored.  I like the teams version better, but when it is head to head, it is really just about the luck of the draw.  There is usually a preferable play to make, so it's just all about who can get the right cards out first.  I'll happily play at family reunions, but that's about it.

7 - Have only played it a few times, the teams make the game fun since you have to work with a partner but like many team games, table-talk is limited.  Without teams, smack talk is encouraged and players routinely gang up on the person closest to winning.

A fun and easy game to play with family. Often your choices can be extremely limited by your cards. The Jacks in particular seems far too powerful with the winner all too often determined solely by who drew the most Jacks. But rounds are pretty quick and it's an easy game to just sit back and play on autopilot while chatting with friends or family. I'll usually try to play something else first, but I can settle for Sequence.

OK five-in-a-row game feels a bit like The Game of 99. However, that game has more control and less randomness to it, and there's more of a chance for strategizing. This game feels like there's not a lot of options. Not bad, but not that good, either. Feels like it would play well with children.

I got this game as a gift. I think it's a lot of fun in pairs, especially if you're constantly smack-talking the other team. There is some light strategy to the game; it's enough to keep me occupied when playing with others who don't enjoy thinking all the time. 

It's not my favorite, but it plays quickly and it's fun. I rather think that's what a game is supposed to be.

This is what I like to call a "bridge" game.  It's an older game that your parents/grandparents will remember seeing, or possibly playing, and uses two standard decks of cards.  This lends an air of familiarity to the game, and makes it easy to suck your family back into board gaming with something familiar.

The game is played with teams, or 1v1, and is quite fun in that regard as you aren't allowed to directly communicate with your partner.

The game itself is a bit random, but there is definitely strategy involved in deciding whether to block another person from getting a sequence or try to build up one yourself.

Overall it's a solid game, and while it may be looked down on at your hardcore gaming group, families will find it a good way to ease into the hobby.

A game with a deck of cards and a board with the same cards printed on it, and a set of chips shared between "partners." It's one of those games where you can see the author's design process a mile away. Still, the chips go down with a satisfying clack, and the use of jacks as wild cards or to remove existing chips adds a little more strategy to this partnership five-in-a-row game.

We love this fun board/card game. Two decks of standard playing cards are used "connect five" mechanics with Jacks being wild. Good for 2-3 TEAMS (which means unlimited players). Once you and your opponents play it enough, a lot of the outcome depends on when you get the Jacks (which is not my favorite aspect of a game.)

I didn't play the partnership version, which may or may not be more fun, but I reached the stage in the game where I was just hoping to draw the right card, a particular game design "feature" that I really don't like. The 10 Days games at least allow you to vary your route, but once you've put your chips on the table, you've set your "strategy". Not much fun.

This game is just Bingo with a small bit of interaction and control.  Each turn players on alternating teams play one of the 5 cards from their hand and place one of their team's tokens on the matching spot on a board and when that team gets 5 in a row they win.

Two-eyed jacks are wild and the one-eyed jacks allow you to remove one of your opponent's tokens (that's the small bit of interaction).  The jacks are the only thing that gives players any kind of control over the game and they are only 8 out of 104 cards.  So really, it's just Bingo where the team with the luckiest draws wins.

This is not a game I would expect to like very much but I really enjoy it for what it is. With no theme to speak of and lots of luck involved in this light game, I manage to have a lot of fun when we just want to play a quick game of something and not have to recall a bunch of rules. Its super easy to play and there are still a relatively decent number of choices to make each turn.

Meh.  An excessive amount of luck for time-to-play, which is fairly short, which also tells you how much luck is involved.  There is a small amount of tactical play however, in timing of plays.  There are much better games, and much better games for non-gamers, which play in the same amount of time.

It's been a long time since I've played this, but as I recall, it was a fun little game to play with a deck of cards and my grandparents.  Any game that both Nana and Grandad will play deserves some credit.  However the claim on the box that it is "an exciting game of strategy" may be a little exaggerated.  The only other people I could imagine playing it with are my friends who say they hate board games.  [Edit: I played it with a friend who says he hates board games, and he loved it!  Go figure.]  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 5/10

My wife loves this game, so I play it quite a bit with her and our respective families, so I have had the chance to put in quite a few hours into this game. With that being said, this is certainly not one of my favorite games, in fact, I've started to like it less and less the more I've played it. Still, I would say that it is a game worth trying and seeing how you feel about it. I rated it at a 6 because I feel like i will play this game whenever I'm in the mood, or whenever I'm asked to.

RATING: 6.9
Luck is a factor, but for some reason the same people always seem to win at our table so maybe it isn't that big a factor after all. A very light and relaxing game to play with more casual gamers. The one real downside is that the board is rather hideous (well, it doesn't look that bad but it can lead to headaches after a while), a version with a reworked aesthetic would probably be an instant purchase.

Sequence can be surprisingly tense. While it offers very little in strategic planning and is more about luck-of-the-draw and blind fortune, I like the tension that builds towards end-game.

One more thing to note is that we always play this game when the kids are sleeping in the same room (weekends at Grandma's always have kids sardined all over the floor). There's a no-table-talk rule, so the game is very--I mean, very--quiet.

Five in a row with card draw - Doesn't really sound like a thriller does it? I guess the partnership thing is a plus but it's definitely a minus that this game promotes not talking to each other at the table.

"Deluxe" edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
A board game using a standard deck of cards that is ultimately a variant on Bingo. You're attempting to get 5 in a row on a board depicting all of the cards in a standard deck, so you choose and play a card from your hand each turn and place one of your colored markers on that spot. First to get 5 in a row wins. The improvement over Bingo I suppose is that you get to choose from a few possibilities where you'd like to put your marker each turn rather than having it dictated to you, but the downside is that it's still Bingo at its heart.

Sequence is very simple and easy to teach.  It works well for a large number of players (although that number needs to be divisible by 2 or 3) as a basic social activity (i.e. something to do together) rather than a gamer activity.  The right game to play when the group includes a wide age range of infrequent players.  But certainly not the right game for smaller groups wanting to play a *real* game.  Lacking in the fun department but not entirely non-existent either.

This isn't a bad game, given a lot of the other family-oriented games out on the market.

The rules say to cut the deck to decide the dealer. Might has well have just called the winner then. There aren't zero decisions, but there's not really anything you can do about a bad hand either, and it takes a REALLY long time for what it is.

I don't mind this game, but I'd rather just play something else.  Luck plays a hugely important factor in this game.  If you end up with more than your fair share of wild cards, your chances of winning went up considerably.

Luck of the draw determines the winners and, unless you have a Jack, you have little to no control over your fate.

I'd much rather play just about any standard 4-player card game.

One of my favorite abstract strategy games.  A great team game to see who can work well together and who can't.  I love the rule of you don't have to tell the person to draw a card and if they forget they forget.  It really keeps you on your toes.  I also like planning and seeing how far you can go on one strategy.

Easy and fun game to play in teams.  Very accessible to people that aren't used to playing a lot of games.  Absolutely fantastic as a team game (2v2)

This is a great game for just about everyone. I recommend buying the set with the larger board because some people have trouble distinguishing the small hearts and diamonds etc.

Card playing on a board to get a sequence of five.
I won the game in 1982 at a demo by playing and winning.

Good 2 player game with Audrey

I'm not a fan of abstract games, but gave Sequence a try. Was unimpressed, and slightly annoyed that they didn't even try to hide the origin of the idea. Felt like playing a prototype.

TRADE INTEREST: VERY HIGH

A 2-6 player, hand management game. Use your cards to create sequences on the board. Can be played with teams with 4-6 players.

Great casual game especially when gamers and non-gamers come together. Easy to find and play with variants too.

Used, and in good condition.

Good family game.  A little luck and a little skill and strategy.  Non-gamers like the game play since it uses familiar bits - a deck of cards and chips.

I'm not a big fan of this game, but at the same time it is nice and simple as a family pickup game and I do find myself enjoying playing it more than I expect I will.  This is turning into my Mother's favorite board game and I got her a copy for Christmas '08.

Erősen gondolkodom a megvételén, megunhatatlan és bármikor elővehető klasszikus. Egy dolog tart vissza, hogy ketten annyira nem ütős, így nálunk sokat talán nem lenne előszedve.

I'm just not a fan of this game. There's nothing wrong with it - it's a bit too simplistic for my tastes, but that's not a game flaw. There's often not too many 'good' choices for your card plays, so you play mostly on auto-pilot.

OMG a game about digging up dinosaur bones and then MAKING UP YOUR OWN DINOSAURS?!  Yes please!  Played this at SHUX and we creatively laughed our way through the whole game.  So much fun.  Really well done, and captures the feel of the dark side of paleontology in the early era.

Biggest issue is that this is not a true 2-player game since it has special rules for 2 players. 3-5 is the real answer and should be indicated as such

Didn't want to spend $50USD on the KS verson for sale as BGGCON when I could get it for $34CAD at my FLGS, except just cubes instead of dino meeples and the character meeples didn't have a hat... Also saved space in my limited luggage.

Looking for dinosaur meeples now.

RATING: 9
A great game with lots of fun at many levels. While there's resource collection, and planning, there's also a dash of artistic creativity that goes into building your dino's. While creativity isn't rewarded with points, it is rewarded with smiles and laughs as you go around the table. I recommend requiring players to name their creations!

RATING: 6
The theme is very interesting and it's a blast to build your dinosaurs but the game is too random and too light for my taste. The variable power payers are also way unbalanced so I do not even play with them. Fun gateway game for kids but not much there for gamers.

An enjoyable game, that by the end has grown adults giggling about the dinosaur fossils they have created.  A 2016 Kickstarter acquisition, doesn't get to the table often, but always ends well.

I find that the initial rules explanation as to how the bone structures work can be a bit confusing for some.  Normally I show a quick run through of a turn, then explain the layout of the bones & how bonus cards work from there on out.

I think it is very clever how you "build" dinosaurs with bones just dug up.  The game appears to escalate nicely.  My boys love to play this game.  The game say that the dinosaurs only have one head, but my boys like to make more than one (which is fine by me as long as they don't use one of them to complete an objective card).

There's just something really satisfying about getting to create something for yourself. It's even better when you get to do that and at the same time getting to be mean to your friends (say, by taking the bones they are obviously after, and thus stopping them from building theirs how they wanted). 

There are cards that give you extra points for building certain features in a prescribed way, and often these lead to even more ridiculous constructions since you're forced to dump remaining bones in other places, and end up with a head that's way too large to possibly be supported by the body. And then you get the most points for having the most ludicrous creation.

And the dinosaurs only get bigger and more ridiculous as the game goes on.

Dinosaurs! The joy of this game is undoubtedly in the construction of your own prehistoric monstrosities. Flavor is spot-on and there's a certain fun in reading about the paleontologists and their discoveries. It's very funny to complete two bonus builds at the same time (this is a Triceratops and a Brachiosaurus... somehow). The concept of "Collect" before "Move" takes a bit for newer gamers to grasp and remember but all told, I enjoy this game quite a lot. It scores very highly on my 'everybody gets to play' scale since, at worst, by the end of the game you've built three dinosaurs!

This game is not without its flaws. After a handful of plays it seems that the scoring doesn't seem to line up with the play. The gap in score is almost the same from game to game and it seems to fall to a paleontologist with a consistent ability or whoever has completed the most bonus builds. Maybe we're just not aggressively pushing down categories enough? The other side is notoriety. The chicken-style mechanic suggests that you should do more dastardly things in hopes of being the *second* most notorious (or anything else as long as you're not the MOST). The balance of notorious actions is highly variable and tend to be polarizing.

Challenges aside, this is a fun game to dig up from time to time. The dinosaur meeples are some of my favorite game pieces in any game.

Why this is not a 10:
-> Good tactics don't always relate to good scoring
-> Being rewarded for being the *second* most notorious is flavorfully neat but unsatisfying play-wise

RATING: 8
Excellent game play. Kind of a hodge of a few different elements that all came together wonderfully. We particularly enjoyed building the dinosaurs of course. The only thing that lets it down is the player powers are very imbalanced!

This was a game I played at a convention and decided to buy after the weekend was over. The novelty of building insane-looking dinosaurs never wore off and while you can choose to hurt other players, you never really had to. A surprising hit!

RATING: 8
This one is just good fun.
I love the build phase where you actually build a dino with the 'bones' you have collected. 
I like the score manipulations mechanic whereby each turn you can adjust what the museums favor and thus which categories will score well. 
It was a bit of a shame we ran out of the dino bonus cards and I would have liked to see a much large deck there, however there are plenty of paleontologists which is good. 
The notoriety mechanic is really nice and you want to be notorious....but not too notorious  as one player will be punished at the end game if notoriety is too high.

Overall really pleased with this one and will definitely keep pushing to get this one played again and again:)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun creative game where you can choose to be an honest paleontologist or you can try to steal and lie your way to the top. Building the dinosaur was the best part and it brings out the inner child dream of wanting to be a paleontologist. 
Good entry game for board gamers I believe. 
The rules are a little confusing but the forums on here helped clarify  a lot of things.

I really enjoy this game. It's fun and the dinosaur designs can be really funny at times. We added a rule where you can name your dinosaur and describe what you think it did when it was alive when you reveal. Adds to the character. But there are some balancing issues with the paleontologists. Some are too weak and some are way overpowered.

Kickstarted this game and very glad I did! It's a pretty unique game with an excellent theme, various ways to strategize, and lets you be creative as well. With the notoriety portion of the game it can be really close as to who will actually win in the end which is another element that I really enjoy.

caveat (1) :
Scott Almes seems to 
be a very kind person

caveat (2) :
would have loved
to be one of them

now, to the point :
1 - the good : the game
is ultra-cute + building
her dinosaur makes my
girlfriend happy !
2 - the bad : to my eyes,
GDR is a triple rip-off :
idea = bone wars (the
cad game
movement = takenoko /
hey, that's my fish
coloured parts of the
dinosaurs = jurassic
jumble
3 - ugly :
many rules 
don't make sense
or are just stupid ...
a) paleontologist cards
are extremely unbalanced
(house rule : don't play 
with the character cards
b) " notoriety " should have
been called " bad reputation "
since it brings you more bad
things than good
c) there is no way to
counter " tit for tat "
during the publicize action
(house rule : if you go that
way, you will get one " BR "
d) sabotage 
might bring " BR " to
another player but ... it
also gives one ... to you !
(house rule : 
action deleted

final note :
no man sincerely interested
in paleontology would have
linked charles sternberg 
with a " bad effect "

Played this at a local convention and was really taken by it. I used to love all things dinosaurs as a kid, so this has some nostalgic and sentimental appeal to me as well.

I like how you have to create the dinosaur skeleton behind player screens and then reveal and score them.

There's a game here, but honestly I'm mostly into building dinosaurs with tiny sticks. That part just tickles me. The whole minigame of being the 2nd most nefarious player is also interesting. But I just want to make up dinosaurs.

The Great Dinosaur Rush is a game in which players move their pawns around on a hex board collecting different colors of bones, which are then used to create dinosaur skeletons in three different rounds.  Players score points for matching goal cards, as well as for having the largest of certain features, such as ribs or head/longest limb, etc.  Players can move a pieces up or down tracks to determine how well each feature will score.  At the end of each round, players will rearrange all of their bones into a new dinosaur, subject to some basic placement rules.  Players also have access to more powerful "infamous" actions--the player with the most infamy points at the end of the game will lose that many points, while all other players gain their infamy points.  I'm really kind of a sucker for the "art project" of putting together your skeleton, though mechanically you could accomplish the same thing with just piles of bones.  I wasn't a huge fan of the "precipice" effect with the infamy.  The game itself is pretty bland, really the main attraction here is building skeletons for those that really like to arrange bits.

I completely enjoyed this game. There's actually a lot of game to the way you are picking up bones, taking on notoriety, and publicizing. Specifically, the publicize action was fantastic to add/subtract value to what you wanted to score high/low for the round. Then to the actual building of the dinosaurs... OMG! That was hysterical fun for me. The bizarre, goofy, ridiculous creature we came up with were fantastic. Using the publicized goals and your secret goals (for bonus points) to maximize your overall score for the round based on the bones you could acquire. What a surprise hit! I'm kicking myself knowing I saw this on a ding & dent discount shelf at one point and passed. Although it is have the laugh out loud aspect to the creature building, there's still a good game with interesting play and decisions. Don't pass up a chance to try this one out.

I'm a little bit sceptical about building skeletons from multi-coloured sticks in secret behind a screen. It sounds like it might become a bit too childish. But the theme is nice, the art looks great, and I'm curious about the mechanic where you get victory points from notoriety, unless you have the most notoriety, in which case you're punished instead.

I'll keep an eye on this as ratings and reviews come in, to see if it might be something for me.

RATING: N/A
Grid movement set collection of fossiized dinosaur bones by paleontologists seeking the greatest prestige where dirty play is not only possible--it is encouraged.  Great scoring mechanic to accumulate notoriety but not be caught with the most.  The "dirty" actions against the other players is a welcome layer of game play that adds a light hearted zing without being too mean.  Bravo on thematic creativity to have set collection of colored wood segments representing different types of bones building an actual dinosaur skeleton.  More interesting than the just collecting colored cubes like many others of this genre.  Pushing up or lowering the public buzz for different dinosaurs also works well with a Biblios feel.

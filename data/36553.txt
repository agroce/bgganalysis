Great great great party game. The only thing that irks me about it is how as the game goes on, some of the teams develop little tricks and hand signals on how to identify who the person on the card is and the game turns into a game of memory. I try to make that illegal but it's inevitable sometimes.

A party game a 10 you say, well this game I love, I don't know why because I'm useless at coming up with clues, especially when i don't know half of the references, and being the centre of attention to think creatively is not one of my favourite things; but it has a great memory element, I can know nothing about the item but can remember the clues of other players to sometimes retell it in a later round and siphon that knowledge to assist our team and learn some more trivia which is vital! Its also just a hilarious game, you can't help but laugh at yourself and the other players for making stupid mistakes or doing an elaborate dance and then your team gets it wrong but they knew what you were on about.

Can't give this less than the original.  It almost qualifies as an expansion, but the subtle rule changes make the game a little more clean in some ways.  Very fun!

RATING: 6.5
+ The building of inside jokes on the clues from round 1 through round 3 are hilarious; Best party game I've ever played.
- Most people in my play group prefer strategy games over party games.


Why it's previously-owned:
We've played through the cards that come in the box so many times that they serve no purpose now.  At the start of the game, we make our own cards coming up with titles from memory to play with.
This will be given away soon to a friend who loves the game and hasn't played with the real cards yet.

I had played this partially once before, but this was my first time playing a full game. We also played with 7 people, and the variant that you receive clues from the right and give them to the left. This meant that there was a lot of downtime between turns.  I think with teams and playing maybe 2 teams of 3, or 3 teams of 2, this game would be better, and I already liked it the way we played. I'm glad I gave this one another chance, I could see it moving up with less time between turns.

12/26 I've gotten a few more plays in - and the game gets better when played in teams or in smaller numbers.  5 is about the max I would do the clues left guess right version with.

Pros
- Active party game
- You have to move around at some point 
- You can't pass in the first round makes it frustrating and fun
- You can at least try to sound it it since it's a pop culture title/person 
- Teams being frustrated at each other
- Shaking your head, watching a team try to get a card that's already been played twice
- Funny callbacks to different clues 

Cons
- None

Found this to be better than the original despite a few hilariously difficult first-rounders.  See Time's Up for more comments, I guess, but I think if you're looking here you're curious about the expansion.  Rules seem the same except the ender of the previous round gets to start the next with full time, presumably because this one comes with a sand timer instead of the (crappy) digital in the deluxe base box.  I like this game's smaller box too.  Superior party game, and virtually everyone with whom I'd want to play seems interested in it.

Szerintem lényegesen jobb, mint a sok tekintetben hasonló Activity! (Érdekes, hogy ez utóbbi a német nyelvterületen és közép-Európán kívül szinte teljesen ismeretlen.)

Ugyanúgy el kell mesélni/mutogatni kifejezéseket, mint az Activityben (itt nincs rajz), a nagy csavar az, hogy egy parti során végig ugyanaz a 40 kártya játszik (a 400+-ból nagyrészt random választott lapokból), és ezek a kártyák mindaddig játékban vannak, míg végre valaki ki nem találja azokat. Ráadásul 3 teljes forduló van, mindig ugyanazokkal a kártyákkal. Az első fordulóban bármit mondhatunk, a második fordulóban már csak kártyánként egy szót, harmadjára pedig marad a mutogatás. De egyre jobban megismerjük a 40 játékban lévő kártyát, így a végén már tényleg egy szó is elég lehet. Szabályozva vannak a passzolási, illetve tippelési lehetőségek (fordulónként változó). És ami nagyon pörgőssé teszi: sokkal kevesebb az idő, mint a többi homokórás partijátékban megszokott (fél percet írnak, ami hihető). Szabály alapján azt hittem, egy memóriajátékkal kombinált Activity, de nem volt zavaróan hangsúlyos a memória szerepe.

Egyetlen komolyabb gond a játékkal, hogy sok számunkra ismeretlen cím volt, ezért mi előre megszűrtük a kártyákat, de javasolt inkább házi változatot csinálni belőle.

Van néhány kiskapu, amit le lehetett volna szabályozni, pl. áttételesen is lehet passzolni... Illetve esőemberek ellen esélytelen a játék, főleg amikor fogynak a lapok:)

De ezek ellenére nagyon élveztük!
---
Activityben szinte kizárólag a kreativitás a döntő. Ebben a játékban más is kell. Első körben főleg műveltség, a 2. körtől itt is kreativitás, de emellett memória is!!

In my experience playing the original, there would be a handful of names that either no one, or one person, would be familiar with.  This would make it extraordinarily difficult to get out of the first round.

In this version, not being familiar with the title isn't prohibitive.  You have many more words to work with rather than a first and last name, and as a result, it is a little easier to get those stragglers.

I have yet to try to optional 4th round, but I think it would be hilarious.

I love when a game exceeds my expectations and that's what this did. I went in thinking this was a pretty strait forward party game but the clever crossover elements that develop as you play through a game (and inevitably make for great laughs) makes this game a keeper in my collection.

Update (April 2017): 8 => 9 
This is such a great party game and really has become my go-to game when I have diverse groups of people over and we want something fun.

[b]Pro Tip:[/b] Remove cards that are super obscure or confusing for your group beforehand. Even the pre-game culling doesn't always do a good job removing enough of them. Having too many clues that people just get completely stuck on can be a real drag.

RATING: 10
Any minor details that I may dislike about the original game are fixed in this version.  The titles are easier for people who don't know them, unlike names that can be impossible if players aren't familiar with them.  I love the way that each round builds upon the last.  Knowing pop culture isn't necessary, as players can always find ways to give clues, plus failure in the first round means nothing for how you'll perform in the 2nd and 3rd rounds.  Young people might be at a disadvantage, but this is a great game to play with adults.

I can't think of a single time I've played this game where we haven't all been laughing hysterically from one clue or another.  It plays great with small groups, large groups, and anything in between.  If I had to complain about something it is the sand timer.  Watching that timer can be difficult because everyone wants to see the clues being given.  I have replaced it with an electronic timer which works much better.  This is the greatest party game in it's perfected form.  It really fits the description of a 10 rated game for me, because I always want to play it and I know that will never change.

I don't usually go in for party games but I have to imagine that this is a serious step in the value of the experience. Usually these games rely a good deal on the enthusiastic contributions of the players and, because of their simplicity, usually get those contributions from a sample of people because of their experience with such games as children. The cleverness of Time's Up is that it observes what makes particular sessions of party games fun - the building inside jokes - and creates a mechanic that supports and enhances it. The gamer in me actually notes that it rewards clever play (!) and, well, the human being in me can't stop laughing whenever I play it. It's a terrific game for opening people up that might have to be dragged into these kinds of games. I was a skeptic but this party game has won me over.

Really enjoy this but we do play with house rule otherwise I would have given it a 7.  Simple house rule is everyone plays against everyone with each person getting to do each of 3 rounds but anyone can answer and if they do they get the card so that both guesser and clue giver gets a point.  Tally by each individual to see who wins.  Keeps everyone more involved and makes it easier but a little longer.

This commercial version of Celebrities is very good. The change from people to book/song/movie/what-have-you titles is nice, as players who don't know of the answer can attack it from another angle. Only the limited number of cards and the homogeneity of the included titles detract from the experience. Title Recall is always fun.

EXPANSION.  Best-with-6.  Updated version of Time's Up, now using titles instead of names. Time's Up is my favourite party game and Title Recall makes it even better.  I play with a lot of people who only play games 2 or 3 times per year.  Title Recall is easier on people who don't play very often as it's easier to use alternate methods to get the title.  The fourth "statues" round is hilarious and we are adding it to every game of Time's Up that we play.  Updated rating to 10.

I'd say one of the better "recall that tv show, movie, actor, etc." game.  Definitely gets you thinking about the last time you saw that one actor in that type of movie where the story was about that thing.  You get the picture.  If your game group or party is into this type of recall then this is a game for you.  I personally don't do well in these games so it is something that I wouldn't avidly look to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Such a blast. This game excels and is worth your time because it switches up the standard Taboo-type formula by reincorporating the same cards into multiple rounds with more tightly enforced limits on the players. This causes reincorporation of jokes from earlier in the game and a hell of a time.

The best party game just got even better! I really hope we see expansions for this, because guessing titles is even more fun than guessing people. At least in our group, a lot of people don't necessarily know celebrities well but most people know titles of songs/books/movies/etc. decently. And since there's so much to draw from in terms of titles, there's a lot less obscure crap in here that nobody ever gets. Love it!

Great game, but I'm knocking it way down due to the component quality in my copy.  The cards have awful pointy edges that make shuffling hard and poke you when gathering them up.

So, Celebrities is one of the best public domain, no-equipment-required party games ever made. Time's Up is essentially a straight-up lift of the rules of Celebrities. (Title Recall adjusts the formula a click by making it about film/TV Show/novel/poetry titles. Whatevs.) So the question becomes -- boost the rating vis-a-vis Celebrities by making a great folk game more accessible? Ding it a bit for being commercially unnecessary? Or do as I end up doing and split the difference?

RATING: 8
Time's Up is a great party game. Title Recall seems to be a bit of an improvement. 

In traditional Time's Up, if you don't know the person, you end up just trying to get them to sound it out.  In Title Recall, if you are completely ignorant of the title, you can still give useful clues. (Like "Whistler's Mother", you may not be familiar with the painting..but you can give good clues, still). 

For that reason, I think the game is worth picking up and I'm glad to keep it in the collection. Given the choice, I'll probably go with Title Recall in the future, but I wouldn't mind going with the 'names' version from time to time.

I rate this a 6 rather than a 5 because it is, like Time's Up, much fun to play.  This suffers in comparison because many of the cards depend upon specific knowledge of pop culture.  While some of the original Time's Up cards have this dependence, some don't, which makes it feel like it penalizes a lack of pop culture knowledge less.  RnR and I also thought this was significantly easier than the original.  Overall, we'd play it again.  But, given our druthers, we'd pick the original or Deluxe version.

Components: Readable cards, and a nice score pad, but really nothing special. The sand timer is difficult to see, and gets stuck; ideally the game would have an automated timer because the person responsible for monitoring the timer inevitably becomes absorbed in watching the active player.

Experience: Almost as much fun as charading people. The optional fourth round is a bit grueling, not only because it is very difficult, but because it interrupts the otherwise kinetic nature of the game. My group will stick to the original three rounds.

Just as with Time's Up!, Time's Up!: Title Recall! has a wonderfully clever arrangement of cards, with similar titles coming up in rotation near each other, necessitating creative thinking to overcome the obvious clues.

Great for a large party as you can just group people into larger and larger teams.  Lots of laughs to be had watching people try to mime movie titles like "Flipper" and "Rambo".

Very fun game to play with medium-sized (6 to 8 people) groups.  If there's an expansion, I'll probably be picking it up.  Even with as many cards as there are, titles sometimes get repeated.  Minor complaint, though.  Overall, a wonderful party game.

Pretty much the quintessential party game. Combines Charades, Taboo, and.... something between those 2, in one really fun game. Plays like a common game called Fishbowl, but adds structure. Makes for a pretty enthralling game on multiple levels. Not just because it's fun to watch someone try to act out Dances with Wolves, but it forces you to pay attention to previous clues to build upon them when your turn comes.

UPDATE: I've now played again several years later, and my experience was different. Part of the change was learning that you are not allowed to hum, which made a big difference (and also made it more difficult). I've upped my rating to a 7, and would consider this on a par with the regular Time's Up. I could even see a case for this having more appeal, since the clues used are more likely to be recognized by more people.

OLD COMMENTS: I'm a big fan of the original Time's Up, and this variation seemed like a great idea-- instead of famous people, you work with famous titles of songs, tv shows, movies, and books. The problem is that the titles are much longer and offer a little less creativity (in my opinion). It just felt like there were fewer clue giving options for some titles. Somehow, this combined to make it both more difficult and less challenging. Certainly less fun, to me anyway.

I like Title Recall better than the original Time's Up, but the "no humming, no singing" rule is a pain.  Singing songs is such a big part of the original that it's tough to remember not to sing in Round 3.

I hate this game. A game of chances. Chances of pairing up with someone who share similar cultural background, chances of picking up easier tasks and chances of picking up some less well-known men but with fewer syllables in their names to force the answer without knowing who s/he is... And the extreme unbalance between those who know a little or a lot of the game and the beginners. Definitely won't play this again.

There's not really anything in the visual of the game to be attracted to, but it's not really a visual game. The cards and timer could be prettier.

I've played this game a couple of times, and it was enjoyable, but I try to avoid playing it. There's just an element of exclusion that's hard to avoid, depending on what people are aware of, and I don't like that feeling.

Dec08:  Not a little bad addition.  Makes for a good commercial version of celebrities.

It takes charades, and makes it fun and achievable.  Why?  Because you slowly get less and less ability to give information each round.  It really is genius.

What do I think of Title Recall?  Well, I think it's about at 75% known items.  Which is pretty good considering how many items are on there.

If you are a party gamer at all, then make sure to at least play celebrities.  If you like pre-made names and a more commercialized presentation, then pick up this!

Up at the top of the crop of the Party games and for good reason (along with Telestrations). 

I played with a group of 12 non-gaming people and everyone loved it and wanted to buy their own copy of the game. The whole game is fun but the 3rd round when no words are allowed really gets hilarious. 

This version is much better than the original as the titles are much more known by a wider audience. Playing Celebrities would also help in that regard (people write the names of the things themselves for the game)

[u]UPDATE:[/u]  Played again with only 6 people and it was still very fun, lots of laughs by all and it was 5 in the morning before we realized the time. Can't ask much more from a party game.

Time´s Up is among my top 10 games. I like this version a little more than the original one. I found some of the players in my game group have an easier time with titles´ names than with people´s names. 

I love everything about Time´s Up. It’s the funniest party game I have played, totally recommended for any kind of players. It is perfect to introduce non gamers to our hobby because its ultra-easy to teach and learn.

I continue to love this game, however Time's Up! Title Recall! is now the lowest rated Time´s Up for me. The reason is that it is very hard to get to the table as many friends (and me) have a lot of problems with it. The reason is that many movies´ and series´ names are very different between English and Spanish.

I still like it a lot and I won’t sell my copy or refuse a play of it.

One of 2008´s favorites. 
Top Ten game.

A great party game. Players will try to get their teammates to guess as many titles of books/movies/songs as possible. The catch is that you can't mention any part of the actual title. Very similar to catchphrase in the respect. Loads of fun. A couple of recommendations when playing this: 1. Only play with people aged 13+ as it can be hard for younger children to understand or explain certain titles. The rules state the deck should consist of 40 cards, but 30 cards seems to give a more manageable play time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Just as good, if not better, than the original game, probably due to its accessibility. I could really go for either game, but if I had to choose, this would be the one.

Update: As I've played this more, I have really come to love the game.  For what it offers, there's nothing better.  It feels so good to be on a roll and to hear your opponents start to groan as you pull down card after card.  The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 is the turn order problem, especially in the final round.  If you are only able to do a couple (or even one) card at the end of the second round, you can really be in trouble, since the third round usually doesn't go more than once around the table.

Giving clues for titles of books, music, movies, etc... is easier than giving clues for names of people you may have never heard of.  At least if you don't know a title, you can clue for it in other ways.

This is not a bad game if this is your type of thing.  But I really hate this game and I hope I never play it again.  I hate the whole charades nature of the game from a form of verbal charades in the first round up through the silent charades in the final round.  Unfortunately, someone in my current group seems to own it and I think they liked it so I'm probably doomed to playing it again.  I can't believe it but if this game is suggested it may force me to suggest Codenames.  Imagine that.

This can be a lot of fun, and the restriction of all clues to popular titles is good. The game is designed to work around the occasional cluegiver who just doesn't know what the clue is--if you don't know it, pass it in the first round, and by round two you'll know what it is. Great way to end a game night on a light, energetic note. The better you know the people you're playing with, the more fun this one is.

Sadly might be trade bait for two reasons. It won't get played in my game group. I don't think I'm ultimately that keen on the gameplay either. Wits and Wages is as close to a party game as I will ever own if I ever do. Vastly bought due to having a well rounded collection, but I have yet to come close to encountering a situation where it is needed.

Very little downtime unlike some other party games where you sit around and wait for someone to finish filling out their answer.  6-8 appears to be the best range for number people.  Some are just better at this game then others because of the gesturing and remembering what cards have already come up.

Basically similar to Charades but upped. But I dont usually like trivia games that rely on knowledge or time based things. For example, children in the future may not get references to Obama or Bush or even popular movies nowadays. I want aims a bit more time unlimited.

I also find that this game is just really similar to trivia or charades esque games and suspect Id rather play other party games over this like Eat Poop You Cat or Resistance or Charades. Taking off my WTP since I only want my WTP to be games Id consider buying in the future.

[i]Time's Up[/i], but with the clues all the names of artworks, songs, films and plays. An amazing party game. The fundamental mechanism is [i]charades[/i], which sounds terrible. But teams work against a clock which adds a frantic tempo. Time's Up is played over three rounds, using the same set of targets in each round, so the game builds upon itself as players remember titles from earlier rounds. Each game develops its own shorthand clues and in-jokes.

RATING: 7
The first round really is just your stock standard but enjoyable Dictionary Game, here using titles of pop fiction be they books, movies, tv shows and such like. As per the standard game, the second and third rounds elevate the game into a great party game, where you work through the same deck using first just one word (riffing off the clues given in the first round, so there's a memory element) and then no words at all, riffing off the pantomimes developed in the first 2 rounds which supplemented the verbal clues. All of which usually results in lots of laughs. One big plus is that it allows more inhibited players to be drawn into the game, probably because it allows players to get a comfort with the deck being used and they can copy what other people have done before - there isn't as much pressure to be as purely creative as other party games require, though there's plenty of scope here for those who enjoy that challenge as well.

Fun Fun Fun!! 90 min party game, but is still a great time for all.  Very energetic and engaging. This game will cause people to come out of their shell. The theme with titles of songs, books, and movies works very well with this game, though no one needs to know any of these well in order to score well.

This game will cause tremendous laughs, and produce timeless memories. This is one of the best party games.

This is probably my current favorite party game.  It's easy to teach, fun, fast, has decent memory aspects, and creates a lot of laughter.

The setup may take a little time vs other party games.  Also has an issue if people don't know a clue.

This version is a nice change to get away from people as movies, music, tv, etc, is more accessible.

This is my favorite party game right now. We first played it with a group of 6 in early 2010, and I laughed harder than I ever have at a game. I didn't know if my husband would like it because of the charades aspect in round 3, but by then we all have such a good sense of what the possible options are, that it takes off a lot of the pressure. And your turn is over so fast that there isn't a lot of attention focused on any one person. We played this again recently with some members of my family as an 8 player game, and they loved it. It is so funny, and even shy/quiet people tend to get into it and have a great time. I gave a copy to my sister and her husband, and they have been introducing other people to it, too.

[b][u]Initial Impressions:[/u][/b]
I have laughed more playing Time's Up than I have while playing all other games combined. People playing this game are hysterical. If you are looking for an excellent party game look no further. 

[b][u]What I like:[/u][/b]
The first round is moderately dependent on pop-culture knowledge, but since the same cards are recycled over the next two rounds, people with excellent memory can also shine in this game.

I think what I like most about Time's Up is the natural progression of the game. I love the clues that arise in earlier rounds and how they get reused in later rounds.

[b][u]What I dislike:[/u][/b]
I tend to forget about the 4th round which I have never played and have absolutely no interest in trying.

[b][u]Overall:[/u][/b]
I find that most people enjoy Title Recall over the usual "celebrities" version and I have to agree with them. The titles version is vastly more enjoyable. This is hands down the best party game ever.

Finally played this game and it was as good as I expected. It does not matter that much whether you know all the titles, in fact, seeing someone describing something or miming a title he never heard about can be a tearjerker, because people only have the words in the title to work with. It was surprise how the scaling down of available options in portraying the clue works, because all players see all clues eventually and you can figure the answer out just because you know which cards are in play. Fantastic party game, A must-have.

Hilarious fun every time I play.  I think this has become my favorite party game.  We always play it as team vs team.  The only reason it doesn't get a ten is because I think it is best with 6 and drops off quite a bit when not at 6.  We can't really do teams with odd players.  4 is too few, and 8 is too much where you don't get as much participation.

RATING: 10
This is a very fun trivia game, though you could easily make it from a bunch of flash cards where you write things on it. Even if I know most of the words on it, a lot of the fun comes from how people try and communicate it across. If you think of it like that, then you can endlessly replay it as the game is different with each person you play it with.

EDIT: I have discovered phone apps that have pretty much made Time's Up obsolete. It's still a fun game, but it's up to you to decide if you want the physical copy.

This Time's Up is *much* easier.  The titles are just easier to describe and act out.  If I'm playing with a bunch of people that are new to time's up, I would play this version.

I find this is the better game to bring out with younger players (teenagers), as they're more able to describe random book titles than people they've never heard of.

An interesting variation of it's predecessor, Time's Up. The only draw back is that, unless you have a well-read, diverse group of players it really does slow up a bit when a team or two aren't as keen on the subject matter.  This is still my favorite incarnation of the game, though.  Currently, I'm using this in a high school speech class as a break from academia.  It's a good way for them to work on their communication skills, both vocal and physical.

Another game that I can guarantee will create lasting memories each and every time!  This is built to create in jokes among people, and it delivers.  Starts of as a regular game of charades, but in the second round, you can only say one word.  Then in the last round, only gestures.  Each game sees it's own break down to one key thing for each clue that is really fun to watch.

I generally dislike charades, but I actually enjoy it in this game.  I love the idea of reusing cards from round to round.  That concept, combined with elements from other party games (Catch phrase, password, charades) turns this into a very enjoyable party game.  I would definitely suggest the "Title Recall" version, as I believe it's more accessible to everyone, especially if you don't even know who a person is.

Update: Finally tried the "Optional" 4th Round: Poses.  Worked really well in party game hilarious fashion. If you're finishing up a game of Time's Up and not quite ready to quit, I'd suggest giving the 4th round a go.  It is also hilarious to watch the other team get into their poses.

Should call this "Hive Mind".

Titles make the game more accessible but make the descriptions lose some flavor and theme. And really, I think the fun and soul is in overcoming hard clues and building 'out-there' associations and making hilarious impersonations in Round 3, not taking the easy way out with 'breaking the concept into 3 words, first word...".

It's reputation as the greatest party game is safe. I really did not know what to expect since I thought Apple to Apples was the best. 
A trivia game about celebrities? Doesn't sound very good. 
Well, within the hour I found myself trying to get my 8 year-old to say "Lawrence of Arabia" without using any words AND SUCCEEDING. It is an evening of laughs for sure. The idea of reusing the same 40 or so names for each round makes it great. Encouraging us to try for "hint" clues like pointing to underwear (HANES) to get a partner to say "Hans Christen Andersen" is what makes it an unforgettable night.

By far, my current favorite large party game. Every night I have a board game night, we draw a big stack and just play for an hour or so to finish the night. It allows for so much laughing and smiling, I couldnt not rate it a 9. I rated this on my pure enjoyment of the game. I did not rate it for components, card quality, or anything else. Just if I had a good time, and I always do!

My absolute favorite party game.  I really enjoy the second stage of this game, where you're just giving one word clues for the answers that you are expected to know by then!  Jasmine and I are great at it, too!  *Update* - 10 plays through and it's an absolute gem.  Love it love it.

Based on the popular game Time's Up!, Time's Up: Title Recall challenges players to guess the titles of books, films, songs, and more. Players try to get other players to guess the same set of titles over three rounds. In each round, one member of a team tries to get his teammates to guess as many titles as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed. In round 2 no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted.) In round 3, no words are allowed at all.

Truly deserves its ranking as top party game.  Three tiered structure captures best elements of 20,000 Pyramid, Password, and Charades.  Having all three rounds operate off same set of phrases is a brilliant equalizer, allowing those less familiar with titles to compete more effectively in 2nd and 3rd rounds.

Really not much different than the regular game.  They are both fun.  If I had to choose, I would pick the standard game just for the variety, but it's so close that my ratings are the same for each.  Update:  I've learned that I'm just not a charades type of guy.

RATING: 8
I prefer this variant.  Same rules as standard Time's Up! except you're guessing titles of famous books, songs, TV shows, and movies instead of celebrity names.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
One of my favorite party games! This takes charades to another level. The game consists of three rounds and a set of words to guess. The words get passed around until they all are guessed and then the next round starts. In round one, you can basically do anything except say the word you are trying to get your team to guess. In round two, you can only say 1 word and act. In round three, you cannot say anything, but can act. This game is great as the game not only builds off the previous round, but even the other team's attempts as everyone shares words. Many great laughs with this game!

This is essentially the same game as "Time's Up!", except the design is slightly better because it has the hilarious "posing" fourth round and apparently none of the repetitions of the same cards that filled the original game's box, and it's slightly more fun due to the fact that it makes much more sense to try to act out titles of movies, books, and songs rather than a bunch of obscure names.  This is the game they should have made the first time around!  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7/10

RATING: 6
In much the same way as games like Wits and Wagers and Timeline have attempted to "fix" trivia, Time's Up is an elegant attempt at fixing the classic game of Charades. The trick is that it is played over three or four rounds using the same set of topics: in round one, the reader can say as many words as they would like except the title itself, so they are relatively easy to guess; in round two, a single word only; in round three only mime is allowed. (The optional fourth round limits the mime to a single static pose.)

The result is the development of a kind of collective shorthand, where successful clues from the early rounds become common knowledge and are abbreviated and recycled; canny players can plan ahead by miming even when it is unnecessary. It's much, much easier than Charades, both for the poor blighter in the hot-seat and for the rest of the team, and as such is something less like torture.

In game terms, experienced players do have a large advantage, and uneven round lengths make it not entirely balanced -- but party games are not intended for the ultra-competitive, and the way it slowly eases players into the harder rounds makes it one of the best party games I have ever played.

My rating reflects a balance between my great appreciation for the design and my feeling that playing "an improved Charades" is like being shot with a rubber bullet -- a vast improvement by comparison with the real deal, but still worth cowering behind a wall to avoid.

I got this as part of the Thrifty Santa Exchange. It fits my game group really well--word clues, acting, memory--it has a little bit of everything. We did modify the length of the game though. My group has a pretty short attention span so we decided that 40 cards made for a game that was a little too long. We found that 30 cards is just right for us.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
I should rate this a 1....  Where's the game?  They should just call this one "Guess what this crap is?".  Its a more fitting title.  Absolutely horrendous.

I'm still searching for a party game that isn't Wits & Wagers that doesn't suck.

Can be pretty hilarious. I'm getting the hang of it: Guess the title (movie, book, art, song). Round 1: you can say anything (Catchphrase), Round 2: one word clue (Password), Round 3: gestures only (Charades).

Much more fun than it sounds like it is going to be.

Best played with friends who aren't worried about looking/acting silly around each other.

Sometimes your best option is to try and just learn the cards for the next time around rather than give any kinds of clues.

I'm pretty sure I like the titles a little more than the celebrities, mainly because the titles are more instantly recognizable.  

And playing the game it feels identical.  I'm sure I'll keep them both and use them interchangeably.  Maybe I can fit them all in the same box.

Oh my goodness, I haven't laughed this hard in a long long time.  An almost perfect party game!  Lifted from 8 to 9 because of long-playing group fun.  Almost nobody has a dislike for this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
I give this an equivalent rating to Time's Up!, however, it has a number of benefits (although some may consider them negatives) - the fact that the answers are titles rather than names means it can be a lot easier to give clues, because it's not too difficult to give clues to many of the individual words in the title.  That makes it more accessible to a crowd, I think.

It deserves a special mention for the game of this played at BGG.con last year, however.  Quetzalcoatl, the Large Male Member, and the Tower of Babel all made appearances.

This improves nicely on the original Times Up by giving the words a pop-culture injection.  For whatever reason, the charades--my least favorite part of the game--became more interesting with this edition.

The classic "Celebrities" party game, with titles instead of names. This makes approaches to clue-giving more flexible and allows players to participate even if they don't know what one of the answers is.

We've played a ton of [gameid=1353] over the years, and find it to be the perfect party game for large, gregarious groups.  Some players in our current group prefer [gameid=36553], but I like the original much better.  I find that celebrity names allow for greater diversity of clues as compared to the "titles" found in this game.

I'm still happy to play this version, but would rather play the original (and create our own names, as well).

This game usually provokes lots of laughs and discussion, but I generally dislike timed moves and memory aspects in  games. Those two factors are the only reasons why I don’t rate this higher. I still welcome invitations to play, knowing that it is providing a good mind stretch. Much in the same way, I also try to exercise and eat my vegetables on occasion.

I like this better than the "people" version(s) just because there is no downtime while players look up people with whom they are unfamiliar.  Also, since most of these are common words you can get to the answers even if no one is familiar with the movie/book/song/whatever.  The points don't matter... every game is fun and produces at least one laugh-out-loud moment.

RATING: 7.5
My first experience with the Time's up! -series. We played with the Finnish speaking players, and we didn't know many of the titles... that isn't optimal, as you really are are sometimes forced to say direct translations of the titles. 

Anyway, we had quite fun and the main concecpt is excellent! I really like how it gets better every round and how the tension grows.

Far better than generic Time's Up, on account of my poor knowledge of most of the people in that game.

In this version, it feels like I have a reasonable chance of guessing (or giving clues for) most of the titles.  

Since they're usually composed of real words, it's also easier to give/receive clues based on the titles' component words.  By comparison, if you get stuck with some name you've never heard of, you're pretty much hosed.

It seems as though you can run through these cards a lot faster than those in the original game.  When we played this weekend, by the time the cards made it to me (for the first time) on rounds 2 and 3, there was only one left for my partner to guess.  We easily got the card...but then my turn was over and the new round was then started by the next player in the circle.  Kind of frustrating.

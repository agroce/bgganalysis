Bluffing game, with not much information to guess. So mainly 50/50 and trying to stay under the radar and target a person to lose before you. Royal cards don't add much.

I've taught this small filler game to many different people with very different tastes in games and some who don't even really game per sei. Most have really enjoyed this little bluffing game and asked to play it again. Hard to just have one (play).

Insanely quick bluffing with simple anti-set-collection mechanics.  Taught in no time, but interestingly complex with added Royal cards.  And the ability to destroy another player with a few correct calls.

Meh… This is the worst game in the series of ”Kakerlak”-like games. It wasn’t a funny bluffing game, and it wasn’t even much of a game. Often you’ll just pass on the card, and yes, there is definitely room for clever play, and I guess for some it is funny to deduce whether the other players are telling the truth or not, but it fell flat when I played it the first time. The second time was better, although 3 players is probably too few for the game and the strategy to really shine. Also, I think it takes too long to play for what it is, and I find it pretty “lame” that a single person loses and everybody else wins as I prefer games to have one winner, but that might just be me.

A companion game to the wonderful Cockroach Poker.  This expands on that concept slightly, by including a royal card in each suit, that functions both as the animal and as a new suit "Royal".  If you take a Royal card, you also earn a penalty card from a mini-deck, hastening your demise.  Two special cards are also included - a "never true" card, and a "every animal but not a Royal card" - to spice things up.  I'm not convinced by the special cards, but the Royal cards spice things up nicely.  A good one for fans of the original game.

It's a cockroach, his name is Steve and he dreams of one day being a Nascar driver.

Cockroach Poker is my favourite social deduction game, and one of my favourite games. It has lovely humour and art, but the main reason why I like it it so much is because of how well it does what it sets out to do. 

Social deduction games form an interesting genre. Games in general provide interesting frameworks in which you can interact with your friends and family, recreationally and socially. Social deduction games provide an acceptable way to experiment in a social space in which I would not generally operate: deception. Or, to use a friendlier term, bluffing.

That said, being the bluffer is not what I find interesting about social deduction games. I enjoy interacting with my friends. I care about how they feel, and, it turns out, I like seeing if I can tell if they are bluffing. For me, this is what social deduction game generally boil down to. Is this person telling the truth? Whether it is a 3 hour game of Battlestar Galactica or a 10 minute game of One Night Ultimate Werewolf, that, for me, is the appeal.

Cockroach Poker has this, in the form of direct player communication. Dan looks me in the eyes, slides me a card, and says "This is a bat." And that, there, is it. Is Dan telling me the truth? Everything I like about the genre, distilled down and direct. Do I believe him? If I want, I can make a decision right now.

It also has indirect player communication. This time, I choose to look at the card and pass it to Kirsten. "Kirsten", I say. "It's a rat." Kirsten may have no idea if I am telling the truth, but she may have a better read on Dan, and so she may go off that. And that, to me, is a beautiful mechanic.

The ability to look at a card and pass cards round also provides a social safety valve - you are not usually put on the spot to make a decision. You are also not compelled to lie, if that is something that you are not comfortable with. As I write, it has dawned on me. This game helps to develop social skills and could even be used in a therapeutic environment. It helps the players to become more socially perceptive, robust and well-rounded.

The last few things that I like about the game are also social aspects but are more personal preference. There is no player elimination, and there is no pseudo player elimination. In other words, you can't get kicked out of the game, and you can't get kicked out of the game while still playing (example: when you only have your skull left in Skull). I also like the fact that there is no winner. There is one loser, but as long as no one is being picked on (I have never seen this happen) it's not an issue. Everyone is in it together to the end.

If you have enjoyed reading this, I suggest you try (or go play) Cockroach Poker. It is a fantastic game. I recommend playing my variant - one of each animal is an additional loss condition. It generally makes games a little shorter and a lot more fun. I also don't bother with the Royal and special cards.

--

I remove the royals and specials because they add an extra layer of complexity. This is not intrinsically a bad thing, but I feel that they dilute the conciseness of the experience and add extra rules to explain and remember.

Why I play with the Royal set: having 7 suits instead of 8 shortens the game, which is a good thing in my opinion. With 8 suits it simply takes longer for anyone to lose the game. If you are playing 4+ players with a lot of passing, the game is going to take long enough as it is. I am of the opinion that it is better to have a game that runs a bit shorter, and everyone wants to go again, than to have a game that drags on too long, especially if you didn't feel that involved.

So that is why I introduced the one-of-each loss condition variant when I play. It helps to shorten things out, without being oppressive - the game still runs for a good amount of time. In my humble opinion, it makes things way more interesting. More of the people playing feel invested, as it is quite easy to gain, say, 4 different single animals, and start to feel involved sooner in the game.

The one disadvantage of using the Royal set instead of the original set is no suit pictures on the back of the cards. But I feel that the benefits outweigh the disadvantage.

This is a very quick bluffing game. A player passes a card and lies or tells the truth about what it is. At this point, the receiving player tries to determine if they can read whether the passes is telling the truth or lying. If the receiving player can't read them or just don't want to risk it, they can try and pass the buck unless they're the last person the card is handed to. Each time someone passes the buck the receiving player needs to try and read them and other players previous claims. Kakerlakenpoker Royal introduces a number of 'wrinkles' that, in my opinion, make it better than the basic Kakerlakenpoker.

I like this more than coup because there is no player elimination.  By adding tokens to a game, you could play 2 other bluffing games: Waka Tanka and Skull (Royals being the equivalent to a Skull), so this is a pretty useful game to own. Especially, when you consider the wonderful artwork.

Made a custom deck.  Reimplementation of [gameid=11971].  Changes: has 7 creatures instead of 8, and adds one "royal" card for each creature (if you take a royal creature you have to take an extra `penalty card' in front of you), plus 2 special black cards (one is a wild that counts as every creature, the other is a blank that counts as no creature). See discussion in [thread=851700]this thread[/thread].  

I initially preferred the Royal version because of the extra twists, but the original is probably easier and more accessible for non-gamers.

The two special cards perhaps overcomplicate things, and aren't worth including, but the royal cards up the stakes and are good.

BGG houserule for points: " Loser loses. Each set is worth the number of animals in it squared. Person with least points wins. I liked how the addition of this rule encouraged folk to pick on the winner rather than the loser."

On the one hand, I disapprove of the crown cards--they dilute the suits just enough to significantly favour the empty hand endgame, which is less satisfying--but on the other hand, you can easily play the base game with this set; so same rating.

This is pure bluffing & nothing else. (i guess kinda like a distilled version of Sheriff of Nottingham maybe..?)

I don't know why this game worked as well as it did for me. It's essentially the same as the traditional card game BS but with more freedom/control to decide when and how you lie. But the entire content of the game is just either deciding to lie or tell the truth and then having someone look into your eyes and guess if you're lying or telling the truth. But for whatever reason I had a really good time. I think that because different things are less bad or worse for different people at different times, that does add a small element of thinking to the game. But I still can't really explain why I enjoyed the game as much as I did.

This game is lots of fun. The only flaw is that as a social game played for laughs it doesn't really engender memorable narrative. No one is ever going to say "remember that game of kakerlakenpoker when...", and as a result it's never at the top of the list to play, despite being good solid fun.

Its most distinctive virtue is that it makes looking someone else in the eye and bluffing them the central game element, where other bluffing games might only support but not require the activity.

Also if people don't have the energy for it, it can fall a bit flat. There's not much more to it other than bluffing and laughing.

Good bluffing game.  It is a one trick pony, but what it does it does it well.  Lots of opportunities for laughter, definitely an excellent beer and pretzel game.  Only one elimination keeps everyone playing.  Quick, so it can have repeated plays.  My main quibble is the fact that there appears to be little strategy involved, mostly it's poker face, facial expressions, bluffing, and surprises.  A hit with everyone I introduced it to.  Also nice that it's not very well known and a bit of a novelty.

Fun, light bluffing game in the vein of Skulls.  Royals mechanic makes it more interesting than the base game without any real added complexity.  This one is fun with kids (my 4- and 6-year-old girls) - they love fooling their dad - and some good sportmanship learning going on too when things don't go their way.  Nice game.

Cheatsheet on the back of the rules lists the cards in several languages.  We say all of the card names in German while playing - "Fledermaus" is such a better word than "bat".  How could you not?

Great new version of a fun little game. The addition of the royal creatures/penalty pile adds an extra bluffing dimension and increases opportunities for nasty tactical strikes (if you collect a royal creature you also have to take a face-up card as a penalty). 

The special cards also add an interesting twist - there is one blank card which counts as no creature, and one wild card which counts as every (non-royal) creature. When you collect one of these cards you add it to your hand and have to put down either one of the last-named creatures or any two others - this is simpler than it sounds and also adds sneaky tactical options. 

I'm happy to own both versions, and will still use the original with people who don't like games that take more than a minute to explain, but although this version adds a little complexity and explanation time to the game, it's still easily manageable and I think it is rewarded with a slightly more challenging experience.

RATING: 6
8+(8+); 2-6 (4-5); 15-25mins

Not sure about my first play (minus the royal cards to reduce confusion), the concept of not wanting to be caught out telling the truth or a lie is conflicting so throws you off in establishing a grasp of what you should be doing to avoid being caught out. 

Thankfully it is only one of a few small hurdles, much like applying the names and the deck distribution. Much like Ghost Blitz, the repetitive mechanism combined with deck size almost overstays its welcome, which is why maybe the royal aspect has been added to speed up someones demise.

Having played Skull afterwards, in retrospect this design felt inelegant despite its simplicity, but for now I like the fact the bluffing is verbal and more in your face, rather than Skulls bidding mechanism to fish for the truth.

They have changed the original into something with a bit more meat, something my gaming crew likes to play. The original is still better, though, for your softcore friends.

Silly, but fun, bluffing game. Artwork could have been clearer as the question "What animal is that?" comes up too often, but the Royal variant definitely adds to the game. Good filler and, even with player elimination, can be interesting to watch to a conclusion.

I've never played the original Kakerlaken Poker, but this is apparently just a minor variation on top of it. It's a game of pure bluff, designed to be played with friends over a beer or three.

Played Kakerlakenpoker 1 year back and had much fun with it, so I bought an opened but not played Kakerlakenpoker Royal and it was equally enjoyable, but slightly more confusing to teach for a supposedly very light game.

Some prefer the variant with no royal animals and special ability cards.

Non-gamers love this, I always use this game (basic variant) to introduce to them.

Just like regular Kakerlaken, but with more fun art and a few bonus cards. Great if you want to shake up the classic game a bit.

Jogo estranho e que não me parece que atinja o target com um artwork tão escuro e repugnante… A jogabilidade não é grande coisa, até porque recorre a mecânicas já antes vistas e que são sempre viciáveis. Não me agradou!

A variant of the old traditional card game called in Spanish "Desconfío", set in a bug world. Nice game to play with kids.

Only played once with 6 people, but I thought the bluffing would be more dynamic than it actually was in this game...

The fun here is not universal, I'd say; it's gaming-group-dependent.

May revise rating after more plays.

Update: This went over much better with a different group of friends to whom I introduced it recently, so I've accordingly upped my rating from 5.8 (some of these friends liked it so much that they expressed a desire to buy the game in order to play with their families over the winter holidays)

Simple game of lying. So simple I needed 6 playes to actually play it properly because those 4 sheets of übersmall format is clearly too many. 

Was not much impressed with fisrt play, but subsequent plays proven this is a great game of bluffing and double think. Plenty of lying. The beauty of this game shows when you play it with the same crowd over and over again, then it gains tremendous depth. Metagame and how people evaluate lies and bluffs constantly changes. It seems that I'm all the time discovering new nuances and it's a kids game, right? A small beauty of emergent game design. And looks cute as well. 

As for royal VS nonroyal: more risks, more twists, more panic. Original is probably better for kids though.

The royal aspect adds some good fun to the game.  A little easier (in theory) to direct specific animals to specific people.  Actually works great with seven players.  My family loved it.

Takes the fun of the original Kakerlakenpoker game and adds a layer of depth and confusion. The extra cards (a royal in each suit; a wild-royal; a nothing) do give you more to think about, but for me they don't add enough to what was already a pretty fun little game. Really, neither game is my style (light, fluffy, with only one loser) so I prefer the simpler version for when I do play it. Anyway, I can't read people at all so it's always just a guess!

A very simple game bluffing game. Pass a card and make a claim about what it is. The recipient can either call the players bluff or look at the card  make a (different or the same) claim and pass it on to another player. The last player will have to call the bluff. Whoever is the loser of the bluff call takes the card. Once a player has 4(?) of the same type of card in front of them they lose and everyone else wins. There's some additional Royal rules but that's the basics.

Works well, is fun to play and usually ends up with everyone picking on one or two players which can be funny in its own right.

There's really not a huge amount going on here, but for some reason, it's immensely fun. The bluffing and mind games that go on here are great fun and both groups I played this with were laughing all the way through.

I can see it falling flat with non-gamers and I suspect that simply not calling is the way to go if you want to guarantee you won't lose, but this is all about the laughs when people do call.

The play of this game feels almost like a simplified, themeless Coup: choose a player, they decide if you are lying or not. Eventually someone makes enough wrong choices that they are eliminated, and the game is over... It is the essence of bluffing.

If you like when the game is not on the table but in the heads of the players you probably will enjoy this bluffing game. A good game to round off your game night after a heavier game or two. Quite cool artwork too.

In this game, you pass a card face down to another player, and make the receiver guess if the card is what you say it is or not. A third option for that player is to pass it to someone else, repeating the same information or changing it. A few special cards add spice to what otherwise feels like a card based version of Perudo. I like the game's ending conditions (a player collecting four of the same penalty cards or being unable to play one), but I am not a big fan of the "one loser" instead of "one winner" concept. That being said, I am not a big fan of any game that revolves completely around bluffing, but it is nice to have at least a small one in my collection that is suitable for a large group.

After reading the rules, I thought "Is that it?". But it these simple rules are all that is needed to set the stage for a quick bluffing game, where reading your opponents is paramount.

A reasonably short bluffing game that's not meant to be taken too seriously. Nonetheless, a bit of deduction comes in during late game and that may dictate which card and which player to attempt a bluff on. The addition of the Royal and Special cards makes the game slightly more interesting than the original version.

I enjoy playing with friends for pennies.
I am going to try to get them to play Texas Hold 'em, which I haven't really played properly.

Update:  Had a 4 hour session of Texas Hold 'em on Saturday night.  It was great!  Updated rating from 6 to 8!  Played with chips, but still had low bets.  The chips made even small bets important.

Don't under-estimate poker! It is one of the games with so much strategy, and the excitement to win or lose money really makes it more fun. If you are afraid to gamble, I recommend playing poker tournament-style with a $5 buy-in where the winner takes all. Never play poker without money being involved. It will be boring and people will not play strategically.

A dangerous dangerous game - because it's so good. So many of my college nights became mornings without sleep because of it.    And still every now and then my best friends and I gather round a table and rather than spending these rare precious moments catching up and chatting instead try and take a weeks pay off one another. There's a moral there somewhere but I don't know what it is.

I like Hold 'Em for 4 or more players.  I like Liar's Poker for 2-4 players.  

Dealer's choice can also be fun.  This is when I teach people how to play "Indian Poker" (I suppose this should be called "native-american" poker.  Although it is still offensive at that point.  Everyone holds up 2 cards on their forehead [like feathers], so that players only see everyone else's cards, then a single betting round commences)

I just had an idea: Hold 'Em poker played like "Indian Poker".

Poker is a game that enjoyed a lot of hype thanks to wide media coverage. Thus it is easy to find people to play with. However, because the game itself is based solely on luck there is very little point to it without the bluffing element. And bluffing won't work unless there is something at stake. Therefore you need real money to play.

The thrill of actually winning or losing something is exhilarating and this is the only reason to play, for me at least.

RATING: 10
A Fantastic great game that has so many variations with easily found components, cheap or expensive as you want. Downside is the need of the stakes has to be meaningful to either the better or the opponent, if not the betting is somewhat redundant. Also nowadays, among regular players, there seems to be less fun and more bad tempers if a person loses a pot to a 'bad play'. But overall, endless customization, many games in one and works with 2-10 players without losing any of its fun.

One of my favourite games to play - with the right people. Simple enough to learn but difficult to master. The balance of luck and skill through bluffing makes this a game that I regularly play with friends over a few beers.

Almost pointless if you don't play with some incentive to win though. If you have nothing to lose, the art of bluffing and raising kind of goes out the window.

This game embodies the quintessence of all the bad traits of the human race. It is a game of luck where the house wins most of the money, 90% of the people that play this game are losers and despite all these facts people continue to play this and defend the "strategy" and "superiority" of the game. Einstein was right, human stupidity is endless.

I don't like gambling and it's fair to say that this game loses a lot without that.

I also don't like games that require lots of memorization of specific, game-related patterns in order to be proficient.  (Odds of drawing cards, etc.)

After that you're left with some competitive bluffing, but mostly you spend a lot of time shuffling, dealing, folding.  And you have player elimination.  I'd rather play something else.

how exactly do i rate this?  i used to play holdem online because i loved it, then grinded for years strictly because of income.  i still enjoy live play, but online is much more profitable.  if money weren't involved, i wouldn't want to play holdem.  there are lots of games that i might only find interesting if betting were involved, and i would say that's a bad thing.  i don't consider it so much of a game flaw with poker because gambling is built-in.  it would seem silly to say that i wouldn't play liar's dice without dice, you know?  anyway texas holdem is what's popular, but my heart is more into seven card stud.  chinese poker is great for heads up play, and works great without money.

This one's loaded with thrill, and, sometimes, it can also be fun. We use to play it with low budgets, though, as we're not very fond of betting large amounts of money.

UPDATE: I discovered the joys of Texas Hold'Em, where I can strip my friends of their hard-earned cash by being more clever (and not more lucky) than them! Rised it's rating to an 8.

UPDATE: I still like Texas Hold'Em a lot, but I frankly prefer not to bet while I play my games. While I still enjoy a Poker night once in a while, it's just not something I crave for. Down to a 6.

Tournament Texas Hold 'em that is. Really really fun game. I doubt it that money would be necessary though, then you might aswell play Settlers for money. It's probably only non-gamers without the drive to go for the win who needs money to motivate themselves.

Went over to my friend's place and one of them taught me 2 new games involving poker cards. The first one is Gin which requires 2 decks. The idea is to first get a set of running numbers (passport) which then will allow you to put down sets of 3 of the same kind, more running numbers or add cards to other player's running numbers.

The second game Hearts is a 4 player game. In this game you are trying to avoid getting hearts and the queen of spades. Each player plays a card and the highest card in the suit played will win the entire set. Getting any hearts card is 1 point while the queen of spades is 13 points. The winner is the one with the lowest points or no points at all.

From all-night sessions in middle school and high school to, well, all-night sessions in college and beyond, poker has been with me for a long time.

I love playing, but unless there is money on the table to lose I just can't get into it and would rather play a different game.  But with the money there, the intensity of the game kicks in making it excellent.  I love the bluffing involved, best game out there for bluffing.

It's rather a money game using cards than a card game using money (chips).

[i]Posted: 5/12/08, Rated: 9[/i]

Saying I "own" [i]Poker[/i] is silly, since I'm basically stating that I own a deck of cards.  And some chips.  And a willingness to risk my own money when playing.  And that's the real catch when it comes to [i]Poker:[/i]

It just isn't as much fun if you're not playing for cash.  Even playing for chips-only without a buy-in isn't as much fun.  Minus one point for this limitation.

Beyond that one drawback, [i]Poker[/i] is an amazingly fun and absorbing game.  Especially so if you have a regular group of friends with whom you play.  Learning to read each other, or at least altering your play to accommodate their unexpected plays.  Yes, you know who you are: you folks who stay in with a pair of sevens against my strong bluff of a flush.  [i]Poker[/i] can definitely be a whirlwind of emotion from hand-to-hand, with the need to hide those same emotions.

There's one last item worth mentioning, for those of you who haven't played much before: watching the [i]World Series of Poker[/i] on TV is nothing like playing the real game.  You (usually!) won't see so much drama in a half-hour of play as you will while watching that show.  Please keep in mind that you're only watching those players play their good hands!

Played as a game of strategy and patience, and against players who do likewise, the game takes on a whole new dimension.

Played mindlessly, as in No-Fold-'em Hold-'em, the game sucks.

I have played a lot of poker over the years but this is the first time I have played since "becoming a gamer" (sounds like being born again)and tracking my gameplay. I have resisted the latest poker craze now that I have moved away from traditional card games (not that there is anything wrong with them, I've just been too excited about the new themes and mechanics of board games.) I went to a neighborhood Texas Hold'em party last night. I came in 4th out of 14 and had a very good time. I may accept more poker game invites in the future.

In the warm months the neighbors and I set up a card table in someone's driveway and we play Texas Holdem' while we "Watch the Kids".  Meanwhile, the ladies of our street mix a pitcher of some fru-fru cocktail and kibitz.  A game with friends in the warm sun, with cold beer at hand, while the laughter of children rings in the background.  There may be finer things in life but none spring to mind.

I've played my share of Texas Hold'em poker, it is fun to have a poker night once or twice a year instead or a board game night. But I've also seen how bad can gambling with high stakes be for a person, so would not recommend that.

Good chip and card sets owned by several friends.

I always enjoy playing Poker, however I don't play nearly as often as I used to.  I find that Poker is only fun when there is money on the line.  It doesn't need to be much.  Without money, Poker just isn't nearly as fun, in fact I would probably rate it a 4 without playing for money.

BORING!!!!! So little between each shuffle. Maybe it's the "tuff-guy" wankerism that became associated with this game I acquired from late 20th century media that turned this game off to me? Who knows. But because of this...., you've got to constantly shuffle the dang cards too. eeerrrrrggghhh. Tick me off

I dislike Texas Hold'em and am amazed that it's become the most popular form of poker.  Give me 7-Card Stud, which gives you information on each player's unique hand, and is actually fun.

Here's the comparison, folks:

* Draw poker:  American-style board game.  Extremely luck-based, but the wild swings can be sometimes fun.
* Stud poker:  German-style board game.  Fun in a different way.  More options, more to think about.
* Hold'em poker:  Abstract board game.  Not even a game anymore, it's a calculating activity that is challenging but I wouldn't call it "fun".

Would be a 10, but as some have noted when you take the actual gambling out it loses a bit of its... intensity.  For those who think there is no skill involved, let me point out that there is just enough luck involved to keep the best con artist from always winning (which is what happens more often than not).  If poker was _just_ math and odds, then Howard Lederer would be a world champion.  As it is, he makes a decent living.  There's a ton of skill... it's just not in the cards.

It's a very interesting game, both mathematically and psychologically, if played with real money. Otherwise it's pointless (not because I'm a big gambler, but because in my experience when playing without real money players don't take it serious enough and their bets become arbitrary.)

I don't have a group to play with, which is not easy to find, as you need to have a similar income and willingness to spend so that all players can enjoy it.

Seems odd to list poker as an owned game, since it's just a deck of cards.  However, I list Cribbage as owned, since I have a score board for it. Thus, since I have a decent tabletop poker mat, I'll list the game as owned for similar reasons to Cribbage.

My personal preference is for no-limit Texas Hold'Em, at least at present.

I can't help it.  I didn't think I'd rate anything a 10, ever.  I didn't even want to.  And heaven knows, I'd rather it be an actual board game, as opposed to something I can play with a 52-card deck.  But it's just too doggoned addictive.  It's the only game I can play for hours on end, several days in a row, and wonder where the time went -- and how soon I can get back to the table.  And while I despair of ever being able to play Go or chess long enough to master them -- and therefore they don't really interest me -- that disturbs me not at all with poker.  I WANT to spend the rest of my life getting better at this game.  (Sigh!)  I've truly gone over to the dark side.  Curse you, Vinny!

The rating is only texas hold'em (pot limit or no limit) tournament play without rebuys. In that game, this is an interesting game of reading, bluffing, expected value, and psychology.

With rebuys or simply an open table, you can bully your way to victory (I've lost to bad players who just have infinite money and I'll take down a bunch of big pots, but eventually they just suck out on something they never should have gone in with like 3 5 off, and, yeah), essentially buying victory. That games rates a 2 from me.

All of the heart-pounding tension of gambling combined with the tactical and strategic nuance of great card games. I have played well over 1 million hands, and am still learning new stuff all the time.

A hand of poker is basically a logic puzzle, but one where you have to actually understand and consider the motives and logic of other human beings. What can I infer from the actions of this particular person (or people) about what range of hands they are likely to hold, and how then can I best manipulate them into making mistakes given that range? 

Whereas a game like bridge, through bidding conventions, tries its best to remove the human element from its logic, poker achieves far more depth, at a loss of confidence and control. No game is as exciting.

I've played Texas Hold 'em casually, for little or no money. Recently played this with a couple that was totally new to board games, so that we could play one of "their games." Honestly, I was surprised how much I enjoyed playing this for "ownership of the galaxy" (i.e. nothing). It's not as automatic as Euchre and hinges on how effectively you read people.

Update: played this with coworkers for money. It's much better when cash is on the line, though that makes it a bit different than "just a game."

Update: Played 3-6 limit Texas Hold 'em in Las Vegas. Man... how does that compare?? With money on the line, give it an "8." Honestly, there's a lot of folding. But, I can't think of any other experience that compares regarding the element of reading people and second guessing.

Most of the skill in this game comes from the betting, not the cards.  Knowing when to bluff, fold, bet, check, or raise is critical.  Combined with reading your opponents, it can allow you to win with an inferior hand.

One really needs to be patient and play others as well and not just the cards in your hand.  I would compare it to like being in a war, long periods of boredom with quick periods of rushing adrenaline. 

My favorite variant is Hold'em, but do enjoy Omaha, 7 Card Stud, and H.O.R.S.E.

I only play Texas Hold 'em to make my girlfriend happy. Imagine a Eurogame with a decent auction/bidding/bluff mechanic, player elimination, luck, an intense sub-culture, cable-tv trendiness, lack of facial expression considered good play, and a requirement for real money "to make it interesting".  Sometimes I'm willing to play it to make other people happy.

RATING: 4
Poker isn't a bad game with the right people, but it's a hard game for me to rate on its own merits. Playing Poker well amounts to two things, being able to calculate probabilities, and being able to bullshit people effectively at the right time. 

I enjoy playing it on rare occasions casually with friends for a random, small throw-in pot, but dislike playing it with people who are at all serious about the game because I don't care to spend the time and effort learning odds and all of that; the game just isn't interesting enough to invest that kind of time in. The problem, of course, is that Poker has been huge for the past decade or so, ergo, finding an entire table of people who are both willing to play it and not serious is hard to do.

On the balance, I give it a 4 because in an absolute sense, the game itself is something that doesn't fit into my wheelhouse well. That said, with the right people and context I'm willing to give it a whirl.

I used to be really down on this game.  I mean really, it has all the charm of Tic-Tac-Toe as a game... non-game, almost.  And yet, the more I've considered the actual card play as the irrelevant distraction that it is and come to appreciate the core game is the bluffing and calling of players, up from the bottom has come my rating.

But no higher than this.  Because this trite bit of history is really thin on the ground for interesting game play.  I mean, how the hell does this wind up on TV?

I have played Texas Hold 'Em every Friday night for the past 5 years with my poker group - 2010 Runner Up and 2011 Player of the Year!  Player counts ranged from 6 to 10, but I think 7 is the sweetest spot.
Started playing every Wednesday night in 2011.
I try to play in at least one tournament per month at the Mohegan Sun casino.
With the right group, this game is an 8.  With the wrong one, a 5.
Got burnt out on poker.  The strategy became same old, same old & the randomness too annoying.

Staying up late one night, zapping through random channels, I chanced upon some poker tournament registration which, according to the commentators, was 'very exciting'. I couldn't disagree more: I found it boring as hell. There is some skill in reading your opponents and working out whether you should call, raise or fold, but in the end I've seen far too many encounters which ended in disaster or victory (depending on which player you'd ask) just because [i]randomness[/i]—worse, [i]uninfluentiable[/i] randomness—decided the outcome. Frankly, I think it's borderline stupid to bet such large amounts of money on such capricious circumstances. 

Now, to be honest, Poker is more than just randomness. It is fairly obvious that a player's skill is a constant positive (or negative) influence, whereas randomness in the cards should, if the number of hands played is sufficiently large, cancel out. [url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128324.500-online-poker-staked-out.html]Some blokes[/url] worked out the numbers based on a sample (online) database of well over 50.000 players and many millions of hands, and came to the conclusion that a [i]bad[/i] player needs about 1500 games to discover he is, in fact, bad at Poker; whereas a [i]good[/i] player needs 30.000 to even over 200.000 games to know he is good. In other words, it is much easier to lose money than to gain money. And now the kicker: bad players invariably played less than the bound of 1500 games; and good players invariably played more than 30.000 to 200.000 games. So if you're bad, you're playing a game where randomness dominates; if you're good, you're playing a game of skill. But still: that TV registration featured far too few hands for skill to show through. So in that respect it was a fluke: players need to spend months doing nothing but Poker in order to find out who can truly take home the cash and the Poker babes.

Personally I howl at the idea of playing a game that many times, so for me Poker is a horrible random game I want to have no truck with.

I love poker, but my friends also love poker even more than me.  They are extremely aggressive players and typically run 25/50 cent no-limit games where the pots can grow to absurd amounts that I am not comfortable with.  It is during some of these sessions that I realized that I hate the feeling of losing money more than I like the feeling of winning some.  So my poker days are limited to cheap tournaments or low-limit games, although I'd happily jump into a low stakes no-limit game.  I strongly believe that poker is a game of skill and I deeply respect players who are good at it!

Production: Casino-quality cards have the same linen-finish that Amigo cards sport, so a simple deck of cards can be nicer in quality, and have a nicer feel and snap, than those cards in most games.  Play: I would not play Poker as a game of psychology and bluff; as such, I know I am missing out on what so many enjoy about it.  Nonetheless, with a small enough pool of chips (and thus a short enough game), I have enjoyed playing this game, simply because of the set-collecting aspect, and the betting based on hand-assessment.

Once they come to your house to play poker, you slip in a board game here and there.

So far, rated by most popular by the poker buddies:
Settlers of Catan - Loved it and played it twice in one night!
Alhambra - probably not the best choice at midnight after 2 games of Catan.
Formula D - okay warmup while waiting for everyone to arrive.  I should have let some else win, though.  (One guy crashed out before the end of the race).

Wits & Wagers - fantastic choice for poker lovers.

My favorite card game, and my favorite game.  

It is probably a little over-exposed right now with all the games on TV, but to me it is the greatest game.  A pack of cards and poker chips might be cheap compared to other games, but that doesn't mean it isn't one of the best games of all time.  You don't need to go to a game store or order on-line to get the game, and it can be bought anywhere.  You just need a pack of cards and some beans for markers at the cheapest level, but you can upgrade to elaborate Poker Tables, and expensive Poker Chips.

Poker is played at all socio-economic levels.  It has been played in Senate offices, elaborate game rooms of the rich and famous, and it is played on small kitchen tables of the smallest apartments.  It is truly an American Game.  Cards were an immigrant to America, and Poker is based on some other games, but it was in America they blended together in the Melting Pot, and produced this great game.

There is great skill involved, but just like America, it is possible to improve on the hand you were dealt, and even overcome a bad hand.  It even incorporates the Capitalist system, as Poker can only really be played for stakes, and the risk and reward that is so similar to Wall Street (I love to play low stakes Poker; just enough to make it interesting, but making sure we spent more on the food and beer than any bets we might lose).

No-limit Texas Hold 'Em has become my favorite version of Poker.  It is the best get together game in the world:  Alcohol, tri-tip, brauts, snacks, a bunch of your best friends, and Poker.    

Poker has everything; it has skill, chance, social play, excitement, simple rules and setup, an ability to come from behind, casual play or serious play, and attacking and defending.  It is never the same game twice.

Poker is a Classic.

Today, you can even watch Poker games on TV if you are an amateur or professional!

I don't play no more, but I used to a couple of years ago whenever I went to see my cousin. We never played for money too. We had an interesting group of players

We always had a good time. I have very fond memories playing Poker with them.

Traded 300 Poker Chips and Traders of Genoa for Stephension Rocket. They were rather cheap. Looking into getting more quality Poker Chips in future if I plan to get into playing Poker again.

Just got a limited edition Poker set of the new Batman movie. It's a Joker set! Hahahaha!

*UPDATE*

Bought another Poker chip set. This time in Lancaster when I went to the WBC in 2010. We stopped at Target for gifts. Nice little briefcase of 200 Poker chips.

I just want to say, look a little down and to the left.  That's right, I OWN POKER!  C'mon people, I love board games, but how can you choose Robo Rally over a game of good old fashioned Texas Hold 'Em.  After all I need some means of financially supporting my board game addiction.  So until money starts changing hands at my Puerto Rico game night, I'll stick with my 10 rating on poker.

I really like the bluffing and betting and the wonderful chips of course - BUT it is awfull to bet mostly for some pairs, not having any chance to influence the cards you get. After a while it is quite boring to play (Yes, I never play with real money and I won't do it). I also don't like the various types of hands (not to mention the freak hands!). I don't like playerelemination, but of course the rising blinds and bets shorten the remaining gametime a lot.

BUT there are so many variants - maybe someday I will find one thats suits to me.

They say poker isn't a card game played for money, it's a money game played with cards.  Well, since I'm not a gambler, there's nothing more to say, is there?  I've played a little slumber-party poker in my time, but nothing more serious, nor do I wish to.  This whole game seems to revolve around a skill set I don't possess, and it has no appeal for me.  Though I would suggest that every kid should learn the different types of poker hands so that they'll be familiar with them when they're old enough to play Gang of Four.

The classic! I find it interesting with this game how playing well can often require an extreme level of patience - it can be a lot more fun to play this game poorly as you get to be in more hands.

(Rating for Texas Hold 'Em. Rating also based on online play)

Used to play more, now only play every once in a while. I mainly dislike the huge downtime in live play if you happen to draw bad hands a few turns in a row, which is rather common. Also, gambling is not gaming and I'm a gamer not a gambler.

This entry encompasses my love of almost all the major poker variations (and many of the minor ones), to include Texas Hold 'Em, stud, and draw. When I go through my poker phases, poker easily hits 10/10 but typically relaxes back to a comfy 7/10 or 8/10.

RATING: 7.5
Poker = Psychology + Probability

Perfect combo of psychology, bluffing, probability, statistics and luck.  If you need money to enjoy it, then it's the gambling not the game that entices you.  For me it's a worthwhile game not for the money nor for the cards you get, but for the bluffing and psychology.  

Do note that when not played for real money people tend to bluff more and call more recklessly.  Good discussion [thread=390783]here[/thread].

Main forms:
- Straight Poker
- Draw Poker
- Stud Poker 
- Community Card Poker

The three most common variations of hold 'em are limit hold 'em, no-limit hold 'em and pot-limit hold 'em.  No-limit hold 'em is common on TV, but limit hold 'em has historically been the most popular form of hold 'em.   No limit hold'em typically features more intimidation/bluffing/chance - hence good for TV - for some good thoughts, see [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/article/45215#45215]this post[/url].

In limit hold 'em, bets and raises during the first two rounds of betting (pre-flop and flop) must be equal to the big blind; this amount is called the small bet. In the next two rounds of betting (turn and river), bets and raises must be equal to twice the big blind; this amount is called the big bet.

Limit games only allow betting to 4x the blind pre-flop and flop, and you bet double the blind turn/river so you can get 8x the big blind in. i.e. if you play 1,2 you bet 2,4,6,8 pre-flop and flop. Then on the turn you bet 4,8,12,16.

NB: On the east coast, the limit in each betting round is a bet and three raises, for a total of 4x the bet size (which is the big blind in the first two rounds [i.e. small bet], and which is double the big blind in the last two rounds [i.e. big bet]). On the west coast and in Las Vegas, the limit is a bet and four raises, for a total of 5x the bet size. 

Limit games have some advantages, but also eliminate some strategies.

Also you can increase the blind size progressively as you play, for example:
0h00 1/2
0h20 2/4
0h40 5/10
1h00 10/20
1h20 15/30
1h40 25/50
2h00 50/100
2h20 100/200
2h40 200/400
3h00 400/800

Also, bluffing, reading people, and number-crunching probability are skills that aren't the most interesting to me.

Yuck. I know the game is more about the table-talk, bluffing, and gambling than about the actual cards, but I just can't get into it. I'm a great player and reader of people; I just find the game itself to be way too luck-dependent and not in any way fun. Plus, I hate gambling.

I will, however, add 2 bonus points specifically for the Texas Holdem variant (rating it a 5), since the additional betting windows and community cards actually give you information you can work with. Still a dull game that is usually won by non-participation (being patient and folding more hands than you play). Meh.

4 July 2007: I primarily play Holdem.  Plays listed is 1 for each tournament or gaming night.  Usually sessions last 1-3 hours.

Aug 09 - Fantastic game about bluffing and reading people.  I play about once per 1-2 months with friends in a tournament style and the rest of my plays are online at the cash tables or tournaments.

Version: About 600 plastic chips and lots of card decks.  I'd like to get some decent 13.5g chips someday.

You can say what you want, but this game is pure chance. The fact that it requires money to be any kind of exciting also doesn't help.
Spend that money buying better games to play.

Also to all those that claim that this is a game of skill because they read "book x" about poker and it had all these numbers and complex mathematical jargon, take into account that monopoly also has several books of strategy. It doesn't make it any less luck dependent.

Funny card game, but I found it a little boring already after a few matches.

You wait a good hand for so long time, and when you have one, the other players have none and immediately give in.

The only exciting thing that you can make happen often enough is trying to bluff... but after some turns even bluffing becomes repetitive.

Played 50+ I have only tried Texas Holdem. I like the way you can tweak the blinds to adjust the game length. I was suprised to find that it requires a mathematical brain more than the ability to bluff convincingly. *UPDATE* I know people who are embarrisingly bad at this game. *UPDATE* No limit Texas Holdem is on its way to a 10 for me. I get such a buzz out of playing, I have never played for money. I like Poker table banter. I like it that it plays with any number of players betwen 2 and 10 and you can fix the game length. *UPDATE* Been playing at a local pub for small money. "Normal" people are so bad at this game letting emotional impulses decide their moves rather than rational thought. July 08

Because we don't play for real money, this suffers from a lack of tension and tends to conclude with one of us getting impatient and making a crazy all-in bet just to end it.

Still, the endless variations of the game allow us to mix it up every so often and keep it reasonably fresh.

This game is surrounded by the myth of big money. There's hardly any rules, and cards are dealt randomly, negating any kind of game tactics. The actual rules are so simple that Joe Potatoe can play it, and the goal of the game is for Drew Shrewd who has some insight in human behaviour to exploit the flood of doofuses that are drawn to the game by aforementioned myth.

I hate losing money, so this is probably not the best game for me to play. However, I do LOVE winning money, so maybe this game is not so bad after all?

So, let me say off the bat that I am pretty bad at this game, I don't quite know all of the rules or nuances, but I enjoy playing it. 

I've only played it several times. I've played in a charity casino environment with what I would call "semi-professional" players. They go from charity tourney to charity tourney looking to win some money off of dilletantes like me. For me, poker played in this environment is quite thrilling in a dreadfully dry throated, clammy hands and cold sweat kind of way, because no matter how well I do at the beginning, it is only a matter of time before the more experienced players hose me for what I have.

On the other hand, I've played in a friendly, $20 to buy in, drink too much beer/scotch/whatever else is at hand and smoke a pack of cigarettes each in a poorly ventilated room waking up with a splitting headache and smelling like Satan's own personal ashtray-type of game, and I really like poker in this setting. My erratic play is only marginally worse than the better players and my ability to make half-decent decisions on when to bet and when to fold is marginally better than the weaker players, and so I tend to be able to come out a little bit ahead. Never really risking losing too much, but still getting a taste of the thrill of winning.

The only version that I've really played is Texas Holdem aside from some likely incorrectly played games of five card draw in my youth, and some crazy-assed version that an acquaintance once showed me at a stag party, where the bets escalate exponentially and where suckers like yours truly lose their entire evening's cash allotment on the first hand and still don't quite know how it all happened. Won't be playing that version again anytime soon!

So thumbs up for Poker.

I love poker.  Another game I am definitely not very good at, but still really enjoy.  My favorite variations are no limit hold em, omaha, and greek holdem (progressive pot omaha high-low).  I don't like these because I think they are better games, I like them because I think the hand evaluation is easier, allowing the players to concentrate on the fun side of the game: the players, not the cards.  I want to spend my time trying to figure out what you have, not trying to figure out what I have!  Poker is a timeless classic that for whatever reason is hugely popular with non-gamers.

There are definitely games I would rather play, and there are better bluffing games. However, so many people know how to play this (especially Texas Hold 'Em) that it is very easy to find players, and even find good players. It can take a fairly long time to play and sometimes when money isn't involved, the motivation to win is not nearly as great as the motivation for the game to end, which detracts from the fun. But with the right group you can have a good time. Luck plays a factor, but the wagering aspect means you can win consistently, but not every time. Simple rules, reasonable amount of control for a card game, and some fun psychology.

The game Poker is OK in many variants.  My complaint is the social scene that is usually involved with Poker.  I am not much of a gambler, so that is one strike.

RATING: 10
I came to poker late, but for over 20 years I had an absolute passion for this game.  I thought about it constantly, read everything on the subject available in the English language, and have wonderful memories of wins, and nightmare memories of horrible losses.  I gained a respect for many of the poker players I played with, and acquired friendships that will last a lifetime.

To be a consistent, significant winner is very hard (only a tiny proportion of players are clear winners, despite what many of the 'winners' might believe), and there came a point where I just couldn't continue to devote the time, particularly when the on-line boom began and the number of skilled, professional players increased exponentially.  There's a saying in poker, "if you look around the table and you can't see the 'value', you're 'it'".  Consequently, I no longer play, although I might be interested in a social game if the stakes were high enough to be ... interesting.  Poker is best played for amounts of money you can afford to lose, but would really, really rather not.

This game will exist when almost all others are lost in time; with sufficient at stake to make it matter, it is as near to perfect as a game can be.

Plays is for separable sessions, although poker can be regarded as one long game with intervals for living a life.

For me, Poker is barely a game at all as it consists of little more than betting that your hand will be the best at the table. My personal view of the gambling aspect is that if a game needs money to spice it up then it's not worth playing. I would never consider playing this for cash, you can play in a social context, but then the simple mechanism and the brevity of each hand mean that it's not exciting.

I'm an avid poker player.  I play at least a couple of low-stakes tournaments every month, and usually find time to play in cash games.  I used to do it because I loved the game.  Now I'm probably more motivated by it as a supplement to my income, even though I still play relatively low stakes... but an extra few $100 per month (~ $2000/year on average) never hurt anybody.  It's nice to have a hobby that pays for itself.

As for Poker the game, I'm one of those people who just doesn't "get it."  I just find it pretty boring.  Most of the time, if you don't already have a good hand, you have a binary decision of either bluff a bad hand or fold.  Short bursts are really the only way I can ever find Poker bearable.  If anything, I prefer Texas Hold 'Em a bit more as there is at least some open information for calculating more indepth odds and what not.  If I had to take it or leave it, I'd definitely leave it...

It's been a while since I played for money.  When I did, I would win more often than lose but I was not a great player, just better than average.  I prefer basic stud poker but I'd quite willingly play other versions.

All-time classic bluffing and betting game with lots of great variants. Best played with money and a group of people of 6 or so, add beer for even more fun.

I like playing texas hold'em, giving it a 6 when playing with a random bunch of people.  Getting the right group together, especially over several sessions, the score goes up to a 9.  Haven't been able to have this happen in awhile though...

much deeper than most people give it credit. 

must be played for money or at least taken seriously... having people go "all in" when they have no actual risk can be frustrating.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (Pre 2010)

There was a time when I really liked Poker. I played it often but I never learned enough to become a great player. We played Texas Holdem. Some of my MtG friends now play Poker professionally. My desire to play Poker is low, I think it is a good game, but I haven’t played it since 2010. Knowing a lot more board and card games, I see no need to play Poker ever again, however, I would play if requested.

I have at least 100 plays before 2010, thus I’m not logging them.

Fantastic game with money on the table, not so fantastic without.  Rules are very accessible and thanks to the mid-2000s poker craze most people I meet between the ages of 18 and 40 know how to play already.  Ultimately I'm never willing to gamble more than $20 at a time, which limits my enjoyment.  To get really good at Poker (mostly Texas Hold 'Em) I'd have to play a lot more often, which would crowd out the rest of my gaming schedule.  Since I don't Poker's mostly for family engagements.

This game is only as interesting as the people you play with.  Meaning you have to play with people "on your level" or it's not much fun, and if you play for chips and there are people that "don't give value" to gaining or losing those chips or if you play for money, but the stakes are meaningless to some but not others this game isn't very fun.

I think that with all of the available choices, there are just very few games involving a standard deck of cards that I ever find myself wanting to play.  I can appreciate why people enjoy this, but it's not very exciting for me.  If I wanted a psychological or probability based game, I would choose something else.  I assume that for most, the excitement comes from having money on the line, but even if I wanted to play for money, I would just be worrying the whole time about losing it.

Not a bad game after all, very psychological, however usually it is seriously too long and after some time gets boring. Moreover, it has another really big drawback: players are eliminated from it and has nothing to do while waiting for another game. And this can take time.

Šiaip gal ir neblogas psichologinis žaidimas, tačiau dažniausiai jis yra smarkiai per ilgas ir ilgainiui atsibosta. Be to, turi vieną didelį trūkumą: žaidėjai iš jo iškrenta ir pradeda nuobodžiauti laukdami naujos partijos. O tai, kaip minėjau, gali užtrukti.

This review is particularly about Texas Hold 'Em.  While other poker variants are fine, their variance makes them less appealing to the purity of Hold 'Em.

A very tight balance of cards/bluffing/betting makes this relatively simple game deep and interesting if you can find an appropriate group willing to bet similar stakes they care about.

The multiple iterations of poker marked the transition from my early card games to the more interesting and exciting ones. I admit there is a certain nostalgia that sets in whenever I see anyone playing a poker game with nickels and dimes. Texas Hold'em. 5 card draw. 7 card stud. Omaha. All of the possible permutations that exist when sitting around to play make this one of the most easily replayed games out there. Psychologically satisfying and rewarding when played with friends. Many a good evening have started with a game of poker. Cheers!

- I would rather play this game on the computer against a number of AIs. The board game version of the game is flawed because there is no incentive without some sort of currency to accumulate over the course of the game.

Every thursday a friendly game with seasoned players. 
 (we play limit, just to remain friends)

Texas hold'em No limit I rate a 9. Limit however I rate a 5.5. sadly we play limit.

I probably would rate this a ten if I play this at a full table or tournament style.

Only log sessions of over 4 hours. (every hour is one play using 60 minutes playtime as on gamepage)



***EDIT 2008-06-28***
Stopped logging all plays of this game.

***EDIT 2008-10-15***
this is by far the most played game i own. I play 10+ hours a week. some weeks are close to 30 hours.
shouldn't I rate it a ten than? If I could chose to play a boardgame or poker I probably would choose the boardgame.
No limit hold'em however is IMO the best cardgame there is.

***EDIT 2009-11-10 ***
stopped playing facebookpoker with 400 million in account and started playing on pokerstars six weeks ago.started with fourteen dollars
Poker payed the crokinoleboard without the shipping and customs.
 
Now I'm thinking to let my entire Essen budget for 2010 to be dependant on my winnings.  I'm just over 150 now...
so a long way to go.
I am bad at cash games. I'm pretty good at tournaments.
1 in 4 tournaments I am in the money.

This for me is the most awful game in existence. It has most things I hate in a game. Both outrageous luck (cards that you are dealt), and gambling (I am staunchly against such a destructive element in life). I understand others get enjoyment from this chore (I cannot call it a game), but I do not.

While I haven't played much recently, I have good memories of playing easy-going nickel games with a good group of friends.  There were so many variants that it never got boring, and we had plenty of unrelated table talk in the meantime.  Poker really does give you a good excuse just to hang out with your friends.  I get a little unnerved when playing by those who take it more seriously though.

No Limit Hold Em is my favorite poker variant although more experience with other types would likely improve my opinions of those as well.  Poker makes me tense in the same way as a very tense boardgame.  Dan Harrington's three book series really helped my appreciation of tournament hold'em (although I'm still not particularly good).  Although I love trick-taking card games and rank Bridge, Spades and Euchre among my favorite past-times, Poker is probably my favorite traditional card game and the only game other than chess that I currently rank a 10.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
No other game gives me this kind of rush.  Taps into three incredibly deep components of psychology:  the inherent value of actual money, the tension of lying, and people's natural fascination with luck.  A beautiful game (in all its variants) that I will be playing for the rest of my life.

UPDATE:  10 ---> 7.  Woah, I wrote the above in the midst of the poker boom, which I too was swept up in.  I cooled off and since then, I hardly ever play it now, but still rate the experience of tournament-structured No Limit Hold 'Em as one of the most exciting experiences one can have.

For playing casually at home, the experience depends largely on the quality of the company I'm keeping that night.

This will always be classic and fun to do around the campfire.  I feel like there's probably better betting games out there though so I'm looking for them.  Poker does start to feel pretty samey after a while.  

Luckily there are several different versions, and that helps.  When I played with my dad and brother, the dealer would pick which kind we would play out of several: five card draw, seven card stud, five card stud, blackjack, and Texas Hold Em.

World Championship Heavyweight Boxing takes focus, concentration, decisiveness, knowledge of what is possible and an understanding of your opponent.  Poker is the same.

Another similarity between the two is that I would rather watch than take part in a match.

My game analysis: Has early elimination, may cost you even more than Magic the Gathering and you just sit there watching the other players most of the time but I think even with these negatives this game might just catch on ...

Aside from chess, no limit hold 'em may be the most difficult game I've played.  It has a lot going for it - it's mathematically complex, has a high level of interaction and information-sharing, and uses a perfectly-scaled 'scoring' system.

The dark heart of American card games distills the essence of card playing to its basics: outwit your opponents, knowing only what's in front of you, and make the game mean something to all involved.

I never thought I'd enjoy poker until I tried it, at the insistence of a co-worker and friend of mind.  I found that Texas Hold'Em has a lot of strategy to it that I never would have thought of before playing it.  Now, I'm not hooked, but I do enjoy the occasional game for small stakes.  It's important to play for actual money, that makes the game more fun, but it's also important not to play for lots of money, because that might start to grate on the losers' sense of friendship.  Even just nickel/dime blinds really changes the dynamic of the game from "play money" to "real money".

This is arguably a game, but really more of a vehicle for gambling.  I can enjoy it on rare occasion (at BGG.Con tournaments), even if I'm not very good at.  It is too much about calculating minute differences in odds over a very long time period to exact a slight advantage in comparison to the potential near coin flip that can be had at any given time.  If playing for money, it's more of a job than a game.  If not, it's still not much of a game.

Texas Hold 'Em can be great, but, like most Poker variants:
1. It takes too long to play out, and dropping out or buying in isn't always accepted.
2. A lot of hands feel the same.
3. Putting up money brings out the worst in some people.

I dig the mix of statistical analysis and psychology.

What to say about Poker. It is a blast if you can get engaged in the betting aspects of the game - bluffing, one on one, etc. On the other hand if, like me, you don't particularly want to loose your own money playing a "game" or to take your friend's money in the process, it is a bit of a bore. I play poker semi-regularly with friends and have managed to figure out how to play in a basically "revenue neutral" way while having a good time socially, so I guess it should get a 5. On the other hand, I'd much rather play any number of other board games, so I can't rate it any higher.

Poker was my gaming groups game of choice for 3-4 Friday/Saturday nights a month for nearly 5 years. We started with the standard games - the "pure" games until we got bored with them and started adding some of the more wild and crazy variations. Ever play "Red Cards Wild"?? It got to the point to where I HAD to think of something new to do as I was sick of Poker every weekend. We tried to do AD&D but my friends just couldnt get into it. THEN I went to a local gaming convention and played Settlers of Cataan for the 1st time. The following week I introduced it to the group and we never looked back. Poker fell by the wayside and after the many many playings of Settler's we moved onto more German games and my group became converts. We dived into El Grande, Tikal, Bohnanza, Carcassonne and many others. We still occasionally play Poker, but only once or twice a year now.

Pour gagner au Poker, il faut avoir une combinaison meilleure que ses adversaires. Adversaires encore en jeu ! C’est important de le souligner. 

La combinaison équivaut aux 5 meilleurs cartes qui peuvent être alignées par chaque joueur. Chaque joueur peut utiliser 0, 1 ou les 2 cartes de sa main et les cartes sur la table. Naturellement, en utilisant les 5 cartes sur table, il y aura au mieux match nul, puisque ces cartes appartiennent aussi aux autres.

I've tried a few Poker variants, but only Texas Hold 'Em has ever really grabbed me -- and only for money. (There's something about playing for fake money that really detracts from the game -- the gambling aspect is absolutely integral to Poker's enjoyment for me.)

It's also firmly in the category of games I'm no good at whatsoever, but enjoy playing anyway. And over the years, I have slowly gotten marginally better, so I can at least see how there might be some light at the end of the tunnel.

Bluffing and trying to read people are both enjoyable activities, and getting a killer hand -- and playing it right -- is a great feeling. The only thing I really dislike is getting shit hand after shit hand, and not being able to do much about it.

(Rather than list every Hoyle game as "owned," I just list Poker -- it's the one we actually play, and we do own decks of cards.)

Texas hold'em is great fun to round out a party and a good excuse to buy poker chips, perhaps the most satisfying gaming paraphernalia I own. Set the buy in at whatever the crowd is comfortable with, give everyone a huge pile of chips, plenty of drinks and pretend you're on TV. We play no limit and up the blinds to speed up the end game and increase the luck quotient. You see all kinds of crazy hands and wicked bad beats in no fold'em hold'em, which all adds to the chaos and ensures the sharks won't have things all their own way...

Hold'Em, primarily. 10-20 times a year for the last several years.  Only one year where I was in the red (slightly).  Poker is fascinating to me.  Is there a game with a larger luck factor which is simultaneously so deep and difficult to master, always with room for improvement?

There are good variants and piss poor variants.  I'm not very lucky at poker, so my personal losses are subtracting a point here just to keep things even.  I like cutthroat games best because it is easier to count cards.

I've played poker a few times... I even won the jackpot on a poker night once.  I bought myself a poker set made by Bicycle at the local dollar store (cost me $8, though, wait a minute...). I'm up for a poker night every once in a while, just make sure there's a card which shows the ranking of the hands! And an enforced blind schedule!

RATING: 5
Played regular and Texas Hold'hem version.
I don't really like this game.
Here is a breakdown of the things I don't like about this game:
-Player elimination
This is always bad. When you play with six players and you are the first out of the game that's very 
-No long term strategy
Apart from gainning money and not being transparent so you can bluff in the future, there is absolutely no long term strategy 
-Not many ways to victory
Bluff, be lucky and count probability.
-Need to play for money for it to be exciting
That's a REALLY bad point, ALL my games are exciting without having to play for money.
-Very long for what it is.




It's on my own list because of the poker chips I own.

Quite possibly the most "perfect" game for a standard deck of 52 cards there is. I pretty much consider "Texas Hold 'em" a different game than raw poker - even though they use the same principle and odds of hand rankings, the strategy for playing and betting is truly, and almost completely different (an argument that can also be made for many Poker variations). Both of the most popular forms are "genius" games in their own right, and both have their place in my heart.

People that criticize the game due to the luck/betting/bluffing factor, or criticize the game when true money is not involved (why would one play a game with any less skill when there is no actual money – do you play the rest of your non monetary games that way too?), are truly missing out on the obvious - THAT IS point of the game - otherwise you might as well just lay 5-7 cards face up on the table for each person, name a winner, and call that a “game”.

I added it has owned since I now have a nice wooden chest with poker chips, with my name engrave on it. I love that game. I love many types of poker, but I'm now truly attracted to texas Hold-Em.

I can't really rate "all" the Poker games with one index, but they seem to average to 5. Some variants of this game are good-- my favorite is 7-card stud-- while others are insipid. They run the gamut. I happen to think NL Texas Hold 'em, while not terrible, is massively overrated.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Game in a Nutshell: Betting game of trying to get the best five-card combination or at least fool everyone else into thinking you have it.

Played as: from 2 player to 20 person tournament.

Pros: You can't get a red-neck to play Puerto Rico. I loved this back in college when we'd play for pennies-- a whole night of entertainment and I might drop $1.50.

Cons: I don't like losing money, and this, like all gambling games, needs to be played with money to be interesting. Another game where the culture associated with it brings it down.

Other: I can't figure out why people who wouldn't play this unless money is involved. Is it because the game lacks interest? Why not take a game that's actually interesting on its own and add on a bet if that's what gets people off?

Best Use: Played once a year with a small group of friends when there's more money spent on food then being bet on the table.

RATING: 1
Slightly more interesting than rock-paper-scissors, the main difference being that no one claims R-P-S is a game of skill. The claim that poker is a "sport" and requires "skill" remains one of the enduring mysteries of the human experience. You must know the ranks of different hands and the odds of drawing them based on what you're holding. And...that's it. The rest is luck, guesswork and B.S. Bottom line: if there are no stakes, poker is a bore; with stakes, it's a game of chance. The "thrill' is the gambling, not the game play. Some goober basically walked in off the street and won a world championship recently. Huh? 
I suppose some would make the argument that, if it is not a game of skill, why do the same people win the national tournaments year after year? I think it's because the [i]real[/i] skill in Poker is the ability to stay awake and focused enough to survive endless, excruciating hours of fucking boredom. Which narrows it down to about five people in the entire world.

It is about analytic thinking, emotional control and emotions reading. I love the personal conflict every players feels: "On what information can i rely on: probabilities or others shown emotions?

Erről mit lehet még írni, amit eddig még senki soha?

Férfias, igazi tökös játék, ármánnyal és intrikával, megérzéssel és folyamatos esély kalkulálással.

Sokan nincsenek vele tisztában, hogy a póker nem szerencsejáték (hosszú távon persze, adott leosztásban nyilván nagy a szerencse szerepe). Közben bizony folyamatosan oddsokat kell számolni, kemény matek az egész. Sőt, inkább matek, mint blöff (ez biztosan sok laikust meglep, de ez van).

Kedvencem a no limites Texas Hold'em. Anno, még az ősidőkben nyertem is két nemzetközi online tornát...

És a legfontosabb: pénz nélkül nincs értelme. Az adja meg a nehézségét, a sava-borsát (játékpénzt ki a fene nem tud ész nélkül kockáztatni?).

While it does make you look extremely cool, there are better bluffing games out there. Also, some people don't know which sets are allowed (surprising I know) and it's kinda hard to explain if you have no reference with you. We do live in the age of smartphones these days though.

Not to mention the fact that this can be an extremely long game that has player elimination! Unless you play bad though, which I usually do just to get the game over more quickly.

Let's face it, poker these days means Texas Holdem, which can be a really boring game at times. But it is still an interesting and fun mental challenge, sometimes even a challenge of physical endurance. There's still tons for me to learn in the game as well, which keeps it fun and interesting. But I can only take it in small doses, perhaps once a month or so. Any more than that and I get really bored with it.

This game has been around for a long time, using five cards to form the best hand from high card to pairs to three of a kind to straight to flush to full house, straight flush, royal flush and four of a kind. It's okay, but invariably, money is involved, and that usually detracts the game for me a bit. Some people go home winners, and some people go away down a few dollars. With Texas Hold 'Em, there can only be one winner, and you are forced to bet (with the position of the small blind and big blind). I prefer the normal poker where someone decides the game to be played (5 card, no draw, one draw, etc). But the money aspect does turn me away a bit, but having said that it is okay to play for small stakes once in a while.

* Why I like it: This is my favorite game for a couple of reasons.  The biggest reason is that I have yet to find a game that really depends on reading and knowing or (in some cases when playing with strangers) learning your opponents as much as poker.  It is a game of people, played with cards!  The other reason is that I feel that it is one of the most competitive games that I have ever played.

My rating is kind of an average. If you want me to play Texas Hold 'Em, I'll give it a 4 or 5. The game is just way too boring after about 20 minutes as you sit there waiting for a good hand, folding like a cheap suit deal after deal. Now, set up a friendly quarter, 50-cent dealer's choice game and I'll give it a 7 or 8 depending on the company. Either way, poker is a game of whoever has the largest stake controls things.

Fun, has many many many variants, so you don't just play the same game over and over again - you play the same SYSTEM over and over and over again! However, when playing with casual players, it can succumb to luck too easily - tells may just be a sign of inexperience and not actually tell anything. You have to rely on the moderate bluffing element.

I don't know why people are so enamored with Poker other than the appeal of being able to fleece your opponents by lying to them.

Much like Chess, I understand the mechanics of this game, but I am not very good at it and have little-to-no interest in playing.

RATING: 6
We all know poker.  Read your opponents, get dealt good cards, and bet wisely.  I will play this occasionally, but it is hard for me to enjoy a 'game' where you lose or win money.  

I find that sometimes you can play very well and still lose, and sometimes you can play very poorly and still win.  Not my favorite game to test my wits.

As the stereotype says, Poker includes a lot of luck (in the cards) and a lot of skill (in the bets). It takes considerable practice or a very sharp mind (or both) to recognize which situation is the most adequate one to tease the opponents or to bluff, but otherwise the decisions are simply fold, check, call and raise... you can certainly influence the bets choosing one quantity and not another, but the overall feel is a bit passive for my taste - you wait for good cards, try to make the other players bite when you have them and fire the odd blank here and there to confuse things a bit.

So when do you add poker to you boardgame collection, and is it even a "boardgame" per definition? I added Poker to my collection becouse i own a good quality set of poker chips, and good high-class playing cards. Still think it's abit of a stretch calling it a boardgame, but do agree that it needs to be in the BGG database. Mostly play Texas Hold'em, and do enjoy small tournaments.

RATING: 5
I refused playing this game for many years, because I was so annoyed of all the masses running after any damn American trend like Poker, be it basket ball or school shootings or Hollywood movies or hip hop music... 

And I couldn't stand the game because all the people who suddenly played it quickly thought of themelves as the true cool card gamers, although they even hadn't known how to shuffle cards before and felt that games like Skat or Doppelkopf should be played by pensioneers only!!!

Apart from that, I thought I knew exactlty that our trick taking card games were much better anyway.

And then, some buddies threatened to beat me up unless I agreed on playing Poker with them; so, I finally realized that the game had quite some qualities and sometimes tension... Maybe, under other circumstances I would want to rate it higher - if not for all those idiots playing the role of pokerface-gangstas for the time of the play in media and my social environment, who really spoil me the appetite for this one.

However: As a game, Poker is pretty poor. Other traditional card games are still much more demanding, interesting  and better. Really.

How can you rate an entire family of games in one rating. Other games you even rate expansions separate from the base game.

As I like many variants of poker my average would probably be closer to 10 than 9.

I read some of the 1-2 ratings of poker, and I see why they don't like it, as they haven't understood the most important and also unique thing with poker: you do not play FOR money, you play WITH money.

This is the lowest ranked game I have that I have played more than a handful of times. I really don't like it, and I don't believe it's close to being a good game. When I meet someone who really likes poker, I generally see a person who has a lot of time on their hands, and they don't value it much. I play this only because I have a large number of marginal-gamer friends who like it. It's not a good design, it takes way to long for what it is. With money at stake, perhaps it would be marginally interesting, but I do not gamble, nor do my friends. This further mystifies me (WHY DO THEY LIKE THIS!). Ugh. I've tried time variations, which help get the thing over with. That helps.

2014: I keep running into new people who think Poker is the bomb. It ISN'T. Your friends might be a hoot, but they'd be a hoot without playing THIS. Get them to play something else!

Oh wait. What?

They won't play anything else? They'll sacrifice time with their kids and wives on a Sunday night, even when they would never do so to come over for anything else you wanted to do?

What? Really?

ARRRRG.

Okay, fine. But insist that it be TIMED, with increasing blinds every 10-12 minutes (at most - INSIST on this).

Then, go ALL IN the first couple of hands, get yourself OUT of the game. Focus on bringing chips and salsa and drinks, and get a piece of paper and track who wins what hands for them, to keep your mind busy.

Then, when someone else makes a stupid all-in bid (don't worry, with no money involved, it won't take long), put your arm around them, and take them over to your second table, where you have Crokinole (or Lost Cities, Click Clack Lumberjack, Jenga, Innovation, Impulse, Chess 960, anything from the Gipf series, or even Euchre) set up, and have some fun while they "work it out" over at the poker table.

Console the ones steadily are knocked out, come on over to where you are actually HAVING FUN, and remind them that "they'll get their chance to try Crokinole, next game", and recommend that help you set up a mini-tournament for Crokinole! Hand them their second adult beverage while they mull this great idea.

Sit back, and relax, as you have just saved a good night.

As a kid, I learned with the standard 5-card & 7-card studs, plus 5-card draw.  Since then, I've played goofy poker loaded with wild cards & dealer's choices & made-up rules.  But I'm also now in a monthly Texas hold'em crew.

I would probably rate this game higher if I was actually good at it.  I like how the bluffing and probability play such a huge element in this game, but unless you're playing for money, it really just comes down to the luck of the cards at the end of the night.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
My rating is for all of the varients, however mostly on the main types--straight, draw, stud, and Texas-Hold-Em.  I really like the social aspect, playing the probabilities, and betting/bluffing your opponents.  It's a great party game as well.  The hands also go fast, so there isn't too much down time between hands.

My main issue is that I'm conservative with my money and I don't like to lose it.  When I play with friends/family and lose up to $10, I can live with, however I don't like to lose more.  Depending on the group, I may or may not play due to pot sizes.  I play games to have fun and complete, not try to supplement my income.

Don't like the game much though. But a definitely great aspect is that this luck-driven game is basically strategy with minimal luck included.

I like to pay because my games only once: when I buy them.

Now it is a thing well-known to any citizen who ever sits down to an evening of action that a deck of cards represents a vocabulary as supple as may be found in any dictionary; and accordingly, that the playing of a little poker is as absorbing a dialog as any heated dispute over the burning issues of the day; and that, during such a dialog, the citizen comes to discover a fair amount with regard to the innermost nature of his companions and himself also, including handy information as to which of them is the most foolhardy and which the most cautious, and who is a person of true sophistication and who, even though he is dressed to beat the band, is at bottom a common rube.  And as languages go a game of cards is superior in one respect to all other languages presently in employment, viz. that the person who speaks it the best, demonstrating the greatest fluency and the fanciest subordinate clauses, most likely ends up going home holding a sizable sack of potatoes, unless it happens that his less articulate colleagues pursue him to some shady corner and beat him stupid and rob him blind.

I don't play often and I'm reluctant to get into a money game because of it. Still, it's a classic. I prefer basic draw (especially lowball), but Hold 'em is great with numbers. Downside: lots of gimmicky variants and people who think more wild cards = more fun.

Poker has undergone a MAJOR resurgence in the last 20-30 years! Pot-limit and No-Limit Texas Holdem are the best poker variants that exist. The proliferation of online poker rooms where novices can play for free or for low dollars is really helping the game along too.

What can I say?  All you need is a deck of cards and something of value to play for, and you're set.

This classic game should rate a 10+ for game play, with the multilayered bluff / tell / fake-out on top of shifting probability tracking tasks making for the best game to be invented between Chess of the Mad Queen and Scrabble.

But it's being used by criminal interests as an active menace to democracy and my own legitimately elected government, which means that I have to rate it how I would rate similar menaces, such as weapons of mass destruction and totalitarian dictators. This makes me feel very truly sad.

RATING: 5
Horrendously overplayed non-game, for the most part. If you had money riding on a game of Liar's Dice or some kind of blind tiddly-wink game, it would provide excitement and lots of dramatic/"strategic" bluffing, too.
It's amazing to me that so many millions of people will waste their time on this and think they are playing a game. They are simply stimulating their financial risk/reward (betting) center. Don't call it a great game, and don't think it has strategic depth. That's an insult to better games everywhere, and reveals your ignorance of game design.
EVERY time I have caught a Texas Hold 'Em tournament final on TV, the winner ended up playing BADLY into the opponent's strength, and got lucky when the 5th or 6th card was revealed, switching everything around "dramatically" and they end up winning.  By LUCK, mind you - the %'s were against them pulling an advantageous card compared to the opponent -  so the announcers think they were "Brilliant", "genius", etc  :eyeroll:

No better gambling game than Texas Hold 'Em. Love the bluffing, the tension and the odds. Great way to end an overly cerebal or heavy gaming night than half an hour of turbo poker. My only problem is I get too bitter about the "hand I should have won", so I refuse to play anything over a $20 buy in.

I believe Poker is overlooked as a game.  When you get caught up in the money only, there isn&#039;t a whole lot to recommend it.  Usuaully the sums of money that people are willing to play for aren&#039;t really interesting.  When they get interesting, you start attracting people who are looking for money, not a good time.  

My compromise is to play &quot;winner take all&quot;.  Everyone puts in a certain amount at the beginning of the night.  Everyone plays until only one person has all the money.  Making you stack a limited resource adds quite a new element to the game.  You can also &quot;clean someone out&quot; without too much guilt.  You&#039;re just knocking them out of the game.

A good application of game theory and probability.  Playing hand percentages, reading other players, and projecting an image that other players read.  No Limit Texas Holdem is the most popular variant, but only one of many.  My favorite is either Omaha Hi/Lo or 7 Card Stud Hi/Lo.  Lots of action, lots of ways to play hands, but still pure poker.  It's not all about bluffing and luck.

RATING: 9
I rate this a 9 rather than a 10 simply because the game drops in quality so much when you are not playing for money and I can understand people not wanting to gamble.  This game has so many good aspects: bluffing, keen observation, careful calculation, adjusting strategies based on your opponent's play, complex play from simple rules, plays well with various numbers of people.  It is a slow paced game as you must pick your hand before wading into the fray.  I am perfectly willing to play for matchsticks IF everyone plays hard to win and cares enough about their matchsticks to fold to a bluff sometimes.  (That requires the right group.)  
A suggestion for playing with non-gambling friends: try a freeze out tournament with the winner getting the glory. (Every player gets a set number of chips and plays until they are all gone.)  Then you can enjoy the fun  of poker with out obsessing over the money. 
I picked up a $65.00 set of 750 poker chips for my group - a silly / fun purchase.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I think my problem with poker is that I've never been at a table where one chip has the same value for all the players.  It's hard to bluff someone when your bet is mere pocket change to them.  I think in a tournament setting, this could be a lot more fun.

O que falar sobre este clássico jogo e suas variaçoes? 
A idéia básica é fazer combinaçoes de cartas e apostar no seu jogo, intimidando o adversário e utilizando do artíficio do blefe.
Há inumeras variaçoes, desde o básico five card stud ao Texas Hold'em (o mais jogado atualmente).
O único porém é que é necessário apostar dinheiro, caso contrário, perde-se muito no quesito blefe e intimidaçao.

Texas Hold'em is popular right now, but I really prefer to play straight 7-card stud with dime/quarter betting, with family and friends.  My current rating of 9 might be a little on the high side -- I'm probably biased by the fact that this is a game I actually GET TO PLAY once in a while.  UPDATE:  getting a lot more interested in Texas Hold'em lately.  
UPDATE:  changed rating to 8, because I don't really "Always want to play it".  Played over Thanksgiving 2007, and found myself getting bored on a few hands. 
Favorite Games: 7-card stud is preferable to Limit Hold 'em, but No Limit Hold'em is great.

Update 11/4/14: rating dropped to 7.  Getting tired of it, I guess. 

3/30/16: dropped rating to 6.  Finding 7-card stud dull, over-played, almost unbearable.  Wish I could play more Hold'em.

I like this game, not sure if it should be listed here, but I have it, I have the Cards, I have the Chips, I have everything.

I usually played Poker almost every week (once a week) it seems very easy to have people to play with, I'm not in this game for the money I just like some aspects of the game, it plays very different compared with other games.

I also like other styles of Poker like 7 Card Stud or Mixed Styles, but I usually play the game almost everybody plays, Texas Hold'em.

A good thing to do with Poker Chips is to use them instead of paper money when you are playing economic games, I do it.

PS- Recently I started to find Poker real boring and I don't see my self playing it again Live, but I'll play Online that I'm sure. Rating going down.

I don't like to be around poker because poker players all feel their own personal stories are not only entertaining but necessarily educational.  Nobody else does this.  Chess players don't.  San Juan players don't.   Yet whenever I'm near someone who's sat at a large green table covered with felt suddenly I'm forced to listen to a story that starts "I was sitting small blind, I'm in with a Q-10 offsuit and the flop comes up 2-5-7 rainbow...."

Poker does not need to be a money game to be fun. It can be played as an abstract game of risk, resource, and people management. And, in each of these aspects, it excels. 

Think of your poker chips as victory points (if you must). The object of the game is to reduce your opponents chips while increasing your own. For each hand, you need to balance its potential value against your current resource level (your number of chips, as well as those held by your opponents) versus your betting position and also factor in whatever tendencies you've gathered about your opponents. You need to recognize good betting situations, which are not necessarily related to good betting hands. You need to tailor your betting to control the betting actions of your opponents; lull them or scare them or do both in turns or do neither - whatever the situation requires. And you need to recognize and counter-act this behaviour in your opponents. 

The faults of poker (player elimination, direct conflict, and potentially unending play) are outweighed by variable player number support (2-10), simple rules, delicious double-think, heavy player interaction, luck mitigation through skillful play, and situational diversity. Sure, adding money into the mix will heighten the experience (for good and for bad!) and it will do so in direct proportion to the amount wagered - so decide beforehand how much agony or ecstasy you can bear and bet, or don't bet, accordingly.

My girlfriend gave me a poker set a long time ago for my birthday. It had 300 chips in it. People tell me they're of great quality, but I wouldn't know. They feel nice though. I've raided the set for cards and poker chips (for board games), and I only have an empty briefcase now!

As for Hold'em, I'll play it when nothing else is on. That happens a lot, since Hold'em is actually an accepted social activity now. But I don't enjoy picking on little things and trying to read people's tendencies. And player elimination precludes this from being a social game.

We used to remove player elimination in the dorms by allowing eliminated players to buy in again through 40+ push-ups. Buy in at your own risk!

While I certainly understand the appeal of the many forms of this game, it just isn't the game for me.  For starters, in order to be the least bit interesting, the game has to be played for money.  Playing for points, M&M's, or whatnot, just doesn't seem to work.  Since I don't gamble, that immediately drops the game several steps in interest.  It doesn't help that I can't bluff my way out of a paper sack -- I'm completely transparent.  While I probably could learn to bluff better, it seems like a skill of limited use when you attempt to live as honestly as possbible.  (Note that I am in no way disparaging those that are excellent bluffers.)  Still, I would be willing to play at poker from time to time if someone wanted to, but, really, without playing for money, what's the point? [08/14/2007]

These days it seems to be all hold em, which is a fine poker variant, but I was raised on 5 card draw. 
There are a lot of people willing to give away their money it seems... 
However, don't play this with people who haven't the money in front of them...
Online poker has raised the game's popularity immeasurably, and I played for a while too , however I found it to be a dull almost mundane game without the pleasure of sitting around a table cracking jokes and having a laugh with your mates. And the card draw would produce some alarming hands which I didn't enjoy...

This is probably the most social game I have ever played .

RATING: 8
Played 100's of games in my 20's. Only occasionally since then. My rating for Poker could go up or down depending tremendously on my fellow players, the poker games played, and the stakes involved. Nevertheless, Poker deserves a 9. If any poker version you play involves more than 2 wildcards, then let me provocatively say that you do not play true Poker, you are playing something that more closely resembles Yahtzee with cards.

Most recent plays:

Texas Hold'em (too trendy and not my favorite version by a long shot) on 7-28-05 with Ben, Pat, Mike, and Garrett.

Fire Department poker night at Pellizers 3-20-10 with Chief Gerrits, AJ, Mike Pellizer, Josh, and Steve Yingst.

RATING: 6.5
Recently played my first proper round of Poker and found it more interesting than I had anticipated. As long as you don't play for money.

Also, playing with noobs who think that Poker is all about bluffing and just throwing in enough money to make everyone believe they have good cards can be quite annoying -- you don't want to throw in the same amount of money because there is a too high risk that they *really* have good cards, but you don't want to fold early every single round either. Your only hope in that case is that all such players will eliminate themselves quickly, and fortunately there is a high chance for that.

My rating for Texas Holdem; all other poker variants rate at least 4 points lower. It's gotta be real money, too, not playing for fun - that changes the betting/gameplay completely, and for the worse.

Plays listed on BGG are games played for fun; does not include money play.

Update: I've since started playing some Stud Hi, Stud Hi/Lo, Omaha, and Omaha Hi/Lo online. I think Holdem is still my highest rating, but Stud H/L and the Omaha games probably only rate about 2 points lower, rather than 4 points lower.

RATING: 4
I like to play Poker once in awhile, but the playing for money aspect has always been a turnoff for me. It's like this: if I turned my greatest passions into my financial livelihood, those passions would be bled dry. This is because the motivation for engaging in them would shift from enthusiasm to fiscal stability - blah. So I only play Poker when there is no money involved. But then I have a catch-22: Poker was practically designed to play for money, so removing the stakes makes the game less than it is. So I'm screwed either way with this game. I only play it if others really want to play.

I see the merit in Poker, as there is a real excitement that can come out of it.  But I'm not sure how much game is actually there.  This is all about the bluff, and I just think that there are much better bluffing games out there. 

If you don't play this for money you really get to see how the game is insubstantial.  The excitement really only comes from the fact that you have something to win or something to lose.

Poker is [i]the[/i] bluffing game. Depending on the variant, there can be a lot of probability management in it, and that's how I like it: with lots of information to go on, but some space for bluffing. It's the only gambling game I enjoy, and that's how I like to play, but only low stakes and in person.

Poker only having one entry makes it impossible to give a rating to.  I'll usually play any type of poker but I absolutely love Texas Hold'Em.

There is so much nuance to the game that brings quite a bit of skill to it despite it being seemingly overabundant with luck.  There are volumes upon volumes of books about Poker not to mention blockbuster movies and an entire worldwide tournament circuit.  It can be a pretty lucrative career if you're good enough.  I play for like 20 bucks once a month with my buddies...

I learnt to play Poker in Paris which makes me want to like it more than I do. Yeah, I never really got the hang of this. On TV people always have great cards, in my real life experience you mostly come out with a pair. And making everybody believe you have greater cards than you actually do is something I don't enjoy much and would rather pass the time with a different card game of choice.

Poker is such a versatile game due to the fact that all you need to play is a deck of cards and a bunch of chips (or, preferably, cash!), and due to the many variations that are available.  Of course, the variation that is all the rage these days is "Texas Hold 'Em".  And yes, I too have been bitten quite badly by the bug (discovering to my surprise that I'm actually very good and winning several hundred dollars over the past few months at various tournaments has helped!), I have my Hold 'Em kit with carrying case, and I do admit to watching it much too frequently on TV these days.  I just cannot believe the enormous popularity this game has enjoyed over the past couple of years, as much of a contributor as I have become.  Sure it's a very simple and fun variation that can be played with a large group, but come on, it's just EVERYWHERE these days!  What's everyone going to do with themselves when that fad fades away?  And where will I turn for my extra source of income?  Well, I suppose there are plenty of other variations to try once that one is played out.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4.5/5  Total: 9/10

Until board games start coming with negotiable currency, no game in the world will ever match the intensity of sitting down at a table with a rack of red intending to play a tight, buttoned-up session of Hold 'Em only to find some gambling fool from Casper, Wyoming routinely drawing to gutshot straights and backdoor flushes without anywhere close to the implied odds to justify the chase.

The depth is mind-boggling given the different types of players you run into, and often you are your own worst enemy while playing. It's a cross-section of the real world; judging people's motivations and dealing with that is part of the game.

My true gaming love, and a former profession of mine.

Poker is a descent enough game, but a very large part of the fun is the wagering.  If you take out the money or prizes (or play for pretzels or something with no real monetary value) then the rating would suffer greatly.  Probably down to about a 4.  As poker really becomes kind of boring.

Seven Card Stud is my favorite variation, with Texas Hold'em second. Recently, I have rediscovered the joys of plain old Five Card Draw, and I like it quite a bit. Variety is wonderful, isn't it? In general, Poker, for me, is all in the psychological manipulation of the other players. Obviously, the luck of the draw can save you, but the skill and tension involved in good play is so different from other games that I can't help but enjoy this American classic.

Poker is a tough game for me to rate.  I really enjoy playing, and it's the one card game that I can play a hundred hands in a row without getting tired of it.  However, I like to play games to relax and have fun, and it's impossible to relax while playing Poker.  I added Poker to my collection here on the Geek not because I happen to have a deck of cards, but for my case of fairly nice chips.

The game has a bit of randomness, but the interpersonal aspect turns that randomness from a weakness to a strength. The game suffers if there's nothing to win, because in that situation, it's more fun to win an individual hand than to have the most chips at the end of the night.

RATING: 7
How to assign a rating to a game that exists in so many forms?  The problem is, in any form, the game is largely pointless without actual stakes, but inclusion of significant stakes just gives me worry.  An interesting game that's just not for me.  I won't turn down a low-stakes tournament-format game though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
(This rating is for Tournament No-Limit Texas Hold 'Em.)

There are so many elements that challenge the player within the game (like effective chip management, determining odds, capitalizing on positional strength, etc.) but it's the metagaming that makes this extremely simple rule set shine and which separates the wheat from the chaff.  The joy of poker comes from reading your opponents and making them pay through effective bluffs and traps.  Add in the intensity that's inherent to any competitive game of skill that's played for cash, and few games can challenge poker in terms of emotional investment.

I'm the type of player who follows his gut instincts rather than careful calculation, which is why I'll never win much money.  But that's just the way I like to play.

One thing I definitely don't like about this style of poker is that the longer the game goes, the more that luck replaces skill.  But I guess the game has to end somehow.  But the last few hands always feel cheap.

I have been hosting poker tournaments for over ten years, so I am a bit dismayed by all these Johnny-Chan-Latelies that keep beating me out of pots! No other game so makes my gut twist or my heart soar. But maybe Carcassone would if I had 50 bucks riding on the draw of a cloister.

There are so many better things to do than play boring old poker. However, I guess it's good for people who can't count to more than five. Like at 5am Saturday morning when the last of the spilt alcohol has been ingested nasally.

What is there to say?  Psychology, probability, and luck mixed into a bundle of goodness.  Just as many books on the subject as chess, but for any one session a player who is totally knowledgable can lose to someone who gets lucky.  Risk assessment at its finest.  Anyone claiming the main mechanic in this game is bluffing can have a seat at my table any day :)  Actually, I've determined Reiner Knizia developped poker.  Small rulebook, not much depth at first glance.  After playing a few times the enormity of its depth reveals itself.  Can be dry and mathmatical, no theme.  Yup, I'm convinced.

Poker for money instantaneously turns away half my crowd. While I enjoy it occasionally, I find it extremely boring.

As you as you are card counting, there is still luck.

I respect that Poker is a game that requires a certain set of real skills, and there is real strategy and depth beyond all of the recent marketing hype and Wild West mythology.  But I do not have these skills, and don't wish to get preyed upon by those who do.  So I never play this for money, and would rather play something else even when it's not for money.

It is obvious that Poker is severely misunderstood from all the comments about how it is only good with money, or there's no skill involved, just luck and bluffing. That's like saying Puerto Rico is good only if you're playing for victory points. Try playing Modern Art without counting who has the most money at the end. Obviously it can't be a very good game if you need money to make it interesting, right?

The thrill of a huge pot is overwhelming, but man does it suck to lose at this game. It also sucks to fold for 20 minutes before you get a playable hand, then raise and have everyone fold.

I love love love the mindgames in Poker though, and also appreciate the amount of money this game has won me over the years. The game's tedium also is dramatically reduced when you play the game face to face, since you can joke and heckle when you're not in the hand. Unfortunately, my friends almost never want to play me at this game anymore, so I usually have to play online. There, the incessant folding can get quite boring, and I usually find myself straying to a different game nowadays.

The more I play, the less I like. Take away meaningful stakes, and it's a really, really boring game, where the level of interest and engagement is directly proportional to either your understanding of arcane mathematics or the quality of your hand. I won't dispute that it's definitely a game of skill, but there are also a number of annoying characteristics: player elimination, lengthy playing times (to reduce luck/variance), frequent periods of uninvolvement, blind bidding, a ludicrous effort/reward ratio which ties into a nasty sort of incrementalism (20 steps forward, 19 back) that plagues a lot of traditional games. If this game was released today, it would be panned.

I still prefer the style of poker I learned growing up, where the dealer sets the rules (e.g. "High Chicago, five card, double draw, deuces and one-eyed jacks wild!") and a raise of a nickel brings scorn from the old folks.

I do enjoy playing Hold 'Em with my buddies as well, but I don't know, it always just seems to devolve as the night wears on, and just doesn't have that same magic.  

It might be fun to really dig in to poker for real, but I don't really have the time or money for that.

An interesting bidding/bluffing game,  although a bit mechanical. Card draw is pure luck,  so the skill aspect is purely in the bidding - which means to make it a skill game, you need to play a lot of hands.  The "story arc" isn't completely flat,  since the game plays differently when you are running out of chips.  Not much of a "help out the loser",  other than the "all-in" rules.
Needs a new theme,  although I'd imagine if someone "invented" poker nowadays it would be torn apart by gamers.
Actually,  the more I think about it,  it's really high card,  with bidding.  If you do the math,  you can calculate the "true" percentage chance of winning (which is random,  since you can't control what cards flip up).  The rest is the "reading your opponents" "metagame", except since that's the only non-random part of the game, the metagame is the game.  Feels like there's an optimal "rate of bluffing" to "value of cards" curve that can be optimized...

It feels a bit silly to record a game like Poker here, but I've always been a big fan and play at least once a month in a friendly home game.

I have enjoyed many a game, but still don't think it is a specatular game.  At least Texas hold'em makes the game more social.

Gambling for enough money to hurt the loser makes buffing part of the game and is essential. Without the gambling the game is worthless.

My favorite card game. What do I like? Lots of player interaction. Can enter and leave games as you like (depends on the type of game though). Lots of skill involved. And gambling.

This entry is for a very nice set of "Poker-to-Go" mini-chips that I can use as tokens, markers, money replacements, etc. for countless other games.

----------------------

The rating is for Poker itself, which is okay from time to time but isn't something that I'd want to play on any sort of regular basis.    Given a choice I'd much rather play Tichu, which borrows a few bits (mostly the card sets) but is a far more enjoyable game.

I love strategy games and this game takes most of the luck out of the game as it comes down to strategy and bluffing. Hold'em is a great example of the 10,000 hour rule.

Own a deck of cards, so technically 'own' this game.

Most fiction that involves this game in passing tends to concentrate on 'player tells' for some reason - which is such a trivial part of the game to be almost meaningless.  More useful is knowing the odds of various hands coming up - critically so in the various 'stud' forms of poker - and betting based on a combination of your best estimate of what you can manage vs what you can see others can manage.  Game is moderately interesting, about the textbook DEFINITION of 'beer and pretzels' for complexity (and only tolerable way to play), and blazingly fast to resolve.

My favorite "card" game.  I thought it was all about luck until I learned 7CS and hold'em (and I'm only a low-limit player).  And anyone who still denies the amount of skill involved should read "The Theory of Poker".

I understand there is skill involved in bluffing, as well as observing others; but that still does not negate the dislike I have towards the randomness of the card draws.  I also do not enjoy the gamblin aspect that goes hand in hand with this "sport".  Trick-taking card games will always be my first choice to play, especially in a social setting.  Poker does absolutely nothing for me.

(Commenting on mainly Texas Holdem and Omaha) Poker has a fascinating amount of depth, but the high amount of luck makes the game exciting and players of all skill levels can enjoy playing together competitively.

After 50+ Plays: Alright with friends, but I'd always rather play something else.  The biggest problem is that I don't really like bluffing games.  I want to talk and joke around with the other players without having to censor my words and actions to disguise my hand.

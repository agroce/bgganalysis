My first playing was very enjoyable. There's a lot of strategy here, and I know that most of it escapes me. The market conditions are great and add a neat dimension to the game. I like it, but I need to play more before I give it a final rating and decide if I want to purchase it.

It has some interesting aspects, including the whole balancing act between needing money to buy more vineyards and being forced to lose more vineyards if you take more money. Plus, early on, majority in a region is of dubious value and, often, can be bad. However, towards the end, having a majority in an already-scored region is definitely a good thing.

Bad points? It feels abstract. The theme and mechanics are pasted on.  A game of nearly-perfect information, the only unknowns being the selection of regions at the start of each round. There's definitely some strategy for this game, I just have little idea of what that might be.  I imagine scoring will often be fairly close. Up until the end, it looked like most players were very close in score. Honestly, the game wasn't very fun. The mechanics work, it's just that they don't combine for a very deep or thought-provoking game. Also, the grape bits & board-with-holes-for-grapes thing is pretty annoying.

An interesting game. I would play it again, though it probably wouldn't be my first, second or third choice.

Very dissapointed by this one.  Came highly recommended but failed to impress me on the day (night). The rules seemed overly complicated in some places, and rather sparse in others. Maybe we were all just a little tired that evening. I'll try it again,.......sometime.

A wonderful business/market game set in Italy's wine regions.  Well balanced, but can appear to be a kilter depending on group composition.  Game length is long, so be prepared.  Crack open a bottle of Barolo and enjoy the game.  Just don't spill the wine or let the grapes roll off the table (which is easy to do).  [GTI Code: TPSD]

A detailed structured mechanic that really should have appealed to me more but the game really suffered from non-sensical fiddliness and what I consider to be a flawed player order rule that means a player who controls a region can sell and recoup the same vineyards without threat of losing them.

Somehow the design misses the mark badly for me, alot of solid good points but design faults that mean I would never want to play this one again.

I realy enjoyed this one.  It was different as you had to have your crops ebb and flow to get the money you need to buy more crops to be able to, at the end, have the most crops (or should I say vineyards).  One I'll play again, sooner than later.

Update: Boosted up to an 8.  Played with three and it was a very intense game.  So much to consider and think about.  You can plan for the future and set yourself up, tactical opportunities, all encompassed in a buy two vineyards, sell grapes turn.  Really need to get this one out again within the next month.  Lots to explore, I think.  

I have also bought little rubber feet for the player's charts and I added a little number on the grape type tiles which vastly improve the play (making it easier to tell colors apart and the grapes from bolting from the table).

I think it will settle in at a 7.  Good game.

Seems like an okay economic game.  I couldn't grasp the strategies on the first play so I'll need to read more about it here on BGG.  The winning conditions feel similar to Power Grid; the person with the most vineyards on the board (not the most money) wins.

I don't think it's a terrible game, but it's not one of my favorites either.  It's kind of a strange mix between a weird area control system, money management, and market manipulation, where the market manipulation portion seemed like an afterthought that was thrown in once the game was already designed.  While the game itself wasn't that bad, the design of the board made it a chore to play, thus my lower than average rating.

Like many other perfect information games the end-game is calculable, readily leading to AP, but the rest of the game is most excellent.

There is a lot I liked about the game, but the somewhat frustrating and chaotic "guessing game" that goes on is enough to keep it from rating higher. Based on only 1 play though so with more insight this could be mitigated and the game could go up a point or even 2 for me.

Vino is a pure economic game set in winemaking Italy, but it's not really a snowball as the amount of cash you get to spend doesn't increase all that much over the course of the game. The fun comes in from changing the relative values of the various wines which forces players to pay attention to others as well as to diversify to other regions—but also in knowing when to slow down the production of wine so you don't lose too many vineyards in the process. Then of course there is a bit of blind bidding hiding in the mechanics in order to create a bit of surprise player contention in purchasing new vineyards. Vino isn't a great game by any standard, and without custom markers it is nearly unplayable too. But it is not totally silly either, even though many moves you make are fairly straightforward. There is some clever manipulation of market and player sequence at work here, in addition to working out how best to prevent someone profiting from the free government-subsidised vineyards too much. For such an old game it certainly is quite enjoyable.

[b]Update[/b] I sold off the game after some hesitation, but I think I made the right decision doing so. The game is ... too linear in its execution, and the end can drag for too long. It's clever, but not quite there yet.

Odd, that this game merits a low 6 overall in BGG, as to my mind it stands well the test of the flood of newer games to come out, since.  A clever system for acquiring vineyards suitable for growing grapes specific to certain types of wine, which the players then sell on a difficult market.  The land acquisition decisions are further exacerbated by the lease of certain such vineyards by the government, for "free", at known points in time during the process of acquisition.

Fun game of vine growing in Italy. I have only played it once so I expect my rating to go up when we get the hang of it. As it was now it was very hard to catch up on the leader as they always bought first, but with a better strategy this might become less of an issue?

Update: After another play it was more even, still good to be start player at game start it seems.

A psuedo remake of Zoff im Buffalo, taking the theme from penning cattle to controlling wine growing districts in Italy.  Alas this game plods along with nothing really exciting happening, hence it feels 30 minutes too long and leaves you wondering why you traded it's parent game away!

RATING: 7
Probably the best supply/demand games out there. However, it is not intuitive or evocative. The gorgeous Goldsieber production helps, though, but it still feels like an area-control meets market profiteering. But what a great market mechanism! Buy up regions, stockpile wine, and sell in bulk to torpedo the prices before your opponents sell.

A game with great theme, wine growing and selling.  This is a fun, short game.  It is always over before it seems like it should be.  It is a tad fiddly, because score is kept with small purple grapes, and it is not good for even the remotely color blind, as there are several wine colors used on the board and in tokens and it is very easy to get them confused, even if you can see them well.

RATING: 6
Vino is an economic game that revolves around jockeying for turn order. As turn order varies from region to region it can become a complex affair. There is a bit of a snowball element as well, but that is balanced by considerations about government grants and, well, turn order.
The game is rather dry, somewhat fiddly, and probably runs just a little too long but considering its age it has held itself quite well.

RATING: 8
Two plays and counting.  I really like it, and want to play more, but it seems like one that really requires a few games for players to get into.  There is a significant learning curve, as players sort out the trends in how regions fill up and how to find a balance of grape types.

Overall, the mechanics are quite interesting.  It's an odd hybrid of area-majority and stocks-majority.  It's good to control the regions, but each player gets a different grape variety (the "stock") from each region.  There's also the potential for some clever jockeying for turn order, where it may be worth sacrificing a bit of income to get a better position in the next turn.  The game moves along at a decent pace.  The end can come quickly, depending on which regions players choose to buy from near the end.

One important suggestion:  Be sure to follow the steps in the Sell Wine phase in the order shown in the column.  Otherwise, it is too easy to forget to lose vineyards or adjust the market.

RATING: 7
Tight econcomic game, with 'difficult to grok' levers to move the wine market, in order to acquire Italian vineyards.

Throw in positioning for the government hand-out vineyards, and you have a fairly dry but very interesting economic game, where ones immediate needs require sacrifice of vineyards (VP's) for cash to acquire.

The game lies in the timing of the repetitive acquisition/selling phases; when to acquire vineyards, and how much cash do I need for the next round's actions, anticipating my neighbors' plans as well?

Oh yeah, the more cash you take, the farther back it puts you in turn order and the less likely you are to be able to implement what you most want to do.

Therein lies a tight economic game, with a lot of decisions regarding resources, order and timing.

The artwork is beautiful and the bits are awesome, but the pastel shades chosen, while lovely, can be a bit hard to sort out at first- don't play this one in a dark room!

I'm starting this at a 7 after a solo 4-player game. It's not quite as immediately grabbing as Power Grid, and it's turns seem a bit repetitive, but the decisions are just as painful- perhaps more so.

Overall it seems a nice design that deserves better ratings than some it was given, but it's not a great game for the impatient or reckless player.

RATING: 7
A near perfect information game of buying vinyards and selling the wine (and losing a vinyard or two in the process). The victory condition of most vinyards rather than most money seems a little odd, and you're left trying to manoeuvre yourself into third place in the larger regions (to maximise the government handout) which calls for some serious mental gymnastics. Vulnerable to over-thinking which means it can drag to 2.5 hours which is far too long. More of a dry white than a sparkling.

The mechanic is well balanced, and decisions are almost always meaningful.

RATING: 5
In principle, Vino is a simple game. Choose two locations to buy vineyards this round, then sell vines of one sort. This is given depth by majority rules in each area that determine the order in which players can do purchases or later on receive free public vineyards and by a basic but working market mechanism. 

Vino has a surprisingly high screwage factor for a German game. In early and mid-game, this screwage is more incidental and difficult to direct due to the simultaneous location selection which might or might not allow a player to screw somebody else. In the late game, it's calculable and annoying. Do some kingmaking by letting other players get public vineyards or lengthen the game by jockeying for position - sounds like fun? With experience, players can be able to put themselves into the screwing position more often than in the receiving one by manipulating turn order and majorities in the areas.  Some players will suffer nonetheless.

Another point that bugs me, is the initial vineyard draw and turn order that both will disadvantage some players without compensation. One more cheap vineyard early in the game due to this can make the difference in the course of the game and at game end.

The best thing about Vino are the fancy components. I'm rather looking for games nowadays that can give all players a positive experience of playing.

I love wine so of course I dig the theme. Sure the components are fiddly, and the wine selling is a bit counterintuitive, but there's a pretty decent game here. The blind-bidding for vineyard sales creates a bit of tension. The positioning for government vineyard giveaways is the meat of the game. It's also important to time your purchases from turn to turn and manipulate the wine markets to your advantage if you can. We thought that 5 players may have been too chaotic and that 3 could be a rich game with opportunities for intense strategic play.

Interesting game were players fight for a majority of vineyards seperated in 9 areas and five different wines.

Thanks to the goal (most vineyards) games will be close unless players make a mess of it.

Trentino and Veneto ar possibly too important considering the government subsidized companies but everyone is aware of their relative importance to  the outcome of the game.

Not bad. The start is somehow critical, but you're still in the game if you didn't do well. A quite nice game: I really like the mechanism, where players has to make there vineyard building plans simultaneously and without knowing what other players are planning. This outquessing system works very nicely. The last couple of rounds goes with autopilot which is a bit annoying. Another (a bit bigger) problem is that Vino is a bit too long compared what you get + it's too calculable especially when the game goes to last "quarter".

When you sell wine you have produced, you also must give up control of a certain number of vineyards depending on how much wine you sell.  You earn the most money by selling just one, profits decline rapidly selling more but the ratio of losing vineyards declines.  However, in selling only one wine case, you also lose one vineyard!  If everyone is fairly close in score, the game may really slow down in the end game due to the government grants of free vineyards that may be given in 6 different regions.  People in the region who are in last place in a region can potentially gain quite a few free vineyards.  

Note - while its fun to have purple grape like marbles, they can be a pain in the neck in being fairly easy to knock off kilter on your wine cellar!

A very different game with attractive components (although the board does have some color similarity problems).  There is an area control element and an economic element but it is unusual in that you often have reason not to want to be the #1 player in a region -- preferring the #2 or #3 spot at the time of the government funding distribution.

A good yarn. I like the mechanisms of the game, both the buying of vinyards and selling of vine. The economic model seems a bit artificial though, with vineyards simply disintegrating from the sale of grapes, but it makes for one of the tradeoffs in the games decision cycle.
It is good fun; but it will never be my #1 favourite

9/2006 An interesting game of two parts.  First there's "auctions" for land areas of encreaseing cost.  Here's an nice balancing element where some areas are given away once the other are sold - the player with the fewest areas gets the most free ones.  Buying land areas gives one units of wine of the type one has in that area.  The second part involves selling wine at a varying price.

RATING: 7
Odd economic game in which success depends on creating regional cash cows by selling off and then re-purchasing cheap vineyards. The ability to repeatedly sell these cheap vienyards at a profit is based not on any kind of development that might remind you of being a winemaker, but by maintaining a majority of the vineyards in the region. Rating may go down.

Our first game with 5 was severely hurt by the fact that we had let one player get a monopoly in one of the grapes, and one of the provinces. He managed to get ahead early that way, without a way for us to catch up. Despite this the game seemed to take ages to finish. Several players really disliked this first game so I guess I'll have a hard time getting this one back on the table again to find out wether the game is truly broken or that the rest of us made a big mistake.

Our guess is that 5 players is too much, probably a lot better with 4. Prices for all the grapes were continously negative influenced.

the game still felt like it could be fun, but having to play this 90 minute game for 3 hours took away the fun.

UPDATE: unlikely that I'll be able to put this on the table since my gaming buddies are negative about this game, so I mathtraded it away.

Commodities game that's quite deep.  It's a bit of a brain-burner at first as you try to figure out the value of controlling the market: what type of vineyards to buy, where to buy, how much to spend, when to sell, how much to sell, etc.  Some of the economic decisions influence selling prices & turn-order.  There's also a bit of a strange area control mechanism wherein many regions have government controlled vineyards and once all of the privately owned vineyards have been bought in that region the rest are given away properties: 1 to the player in first place in that region, 2 to the player in second place & the rest to the player in 3rd place (anybody else is shut out).  I should mention that although it's an extremely economic game the winner is the player who owns the most vineyards rather than the player with the most money.  Fun theme with excellent bits (wine bottles, grapes, a barrel, colourful pieces).

Vino is a neat little economic / majority game from the same designer as Medieval Merchant, and it has a lot of the same traits. Your final goal is to have the most vineyards, but to get more vineyards you need money and the only way to get money is to... give up vineyards [a side-effect in-game of selling wine produced by your vineyards]. Additionally, you want to have majority-control of regions you're operating in since it gives you preference in buying new vineyards there [which get increasingly expensive, always a good mechanism], but if you remain only in second place you get a chance to get a bigger windfall [i.e. free vineyards] when the "government" takes over a region.

Wine yard domination in Italy. Players secretly decide which vine yards to expand, then sell wine, then increase or decrease the price of another wine. Okay, but what I didn&#039;t like was the secret vine yard expansion and the market manipulation after a sell. Those seem to introduce a chaotic element to the game. Big game with many components.

A trumped up simultaneous revelation game where you're trying to build as many vineyards as possible. Safe choices in the revelation are those regions (you pick 2 of the 9 available) where you're already dominant - you get first choice at building more vineyards. Risky choices are about going where you're not dominant and these can win or lose you the game depending on whether you call correctly that the dominant players in the region where you'd like to go are going elsewhere. Of course to build, you need to sell some vineyards along the way, and there are some subtle things you can do with the price manipulation to tempt other players into offloading in regions where you'd like to go next. In summary, tricky, clever, but there's a fair bunch of player-luck.

Holy Crap, this game is intense!  I'm not sure why Goldsieber put this one out, it is waaaay to deep for their line of games.  It seems much more of a HiG game.  This game is about the level of Die Macher as far as play weight is concerned.  It doesn't seem like the economic system should work yet somehow it does.  Beautiful bits (although everything is designed to roll off the table and be lost).  

There are only a couple actions that you can take a turn but the number of ways that you can manipulate your position is absurd.  This can be slow with A/Pers, but well worth the time.  One of the greatest heavy weight games.

While not totally innovate, Vino offers a couple of twists on area-control and market manipulation that work quite well.

Very tight game at the end when we played with 5.

Vino struck me as having a lot of similarities to Power Grid. There is a similar expanding of your network although interestingly in Vino there are no power plants or even resources: you get money depending on the size of your network and when you "fire up" to get income you just lose some of your actual network (grape vineyards). 

Also like PG the players who have higher income get punished via the turn order mechanism, and in the end it isn't money that wins but who has the most vineyards (largest network). Vino does have some additional layers though- you actually have several networks in different areas, and there are different types of vineyards. Those different types battle it out in a stock market (so there is a supply/demand market similar to Power Grid). 

Although Power Grid is clearly more easy to intuit, which explains its much greater success,to Vino's credit it is more multifaceted (rather than the single-minded pursuit of the highest power plant capacity in PG) and there's no frustrating randomness (in fact there's no randomness after the initial setup).

 I think anyone who likes Power Grid should check this out.

Vino is a game where you are a wine producer, you buy vineyards with some kinds of grapes and makes wine to sell. There's a market change every time someone makes a sell. Nice game, but a little boring, no emotion in it.

Not terrible. But there aren't many truly interesting decisions to make once the game really gets going. And the theme doesn't really tie in to the game play at all.

If you have been playing Puerto Rico a lot lately go back to this game and play a 5 player version of Vino.  Some of the same advanced strategies of PR also work for this game.  In particular I'm talking about controlling what your opponent can do on his turn (for instance by controlling what grapes are profitable for them and turns earlier going into those regions to take advantage of their upcoming winery loss after the fact).

The game got me interested because of it's components (beautiful wood pieces, not so good board and horrible tiles - which I ended up making some awesome paste-ups).

However, being for min 3 players and being a heavy commodity/economic game, it would get so few plays that it became more interesting to make the profict while there was interest.

Sold.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A commodity manipulation with area control, Vino seemed to have great potential at first, but unfortunately fell a bit flat for me in the end.  The greatest blunder I think is attributed to the problem that the game requires a good group of people to really make it interesting, especially since many of the major mechanics are player driven.  I am referring specifically to the game ending trigger as well as the market fluctuation.  If you have just even one person who sets off the government give away or raises the price of a given wine without regards to who it may benefit, the game becomes lobsided with the rich getting richer.  As a result, I cannot award high marks for a system so fragile and so dependent on the level of the participants to be of equal competence.

Strategy-wise it may seem logical to concentrate in only two types of wine so you can simply ping-pong their value as you sell off one while stockpiling the other in preparation for the next sale.  However, it is highly unlikely you will have sole control of either market and thus may be more susceptible to the scenario where both will be in the negatives.  Therefore, it's probably better to invest in three so you have an additional outlet to fall back on in order to not have to sell at a loss.

Although play order may seem important, I think what's more crucial is the majority control in the regions you're invested in, since that is the main determinant as to who can purchase vineyards first, as well as who is eligible for the government give away.

Vino does have several attractive elements that work fairly well with each other, but like I stated before its enjoyment is far too reliant on the people rather than the game itself to be recommended.

Wow, this game is tricky, vicious, and cool, and it is really standing the test of time - or so I say November 2006.  Advice:  Use the little punch-out circles from the grape-holding wine cellar cards as six feet for those cards.  With the added height, the grapes are held off the table, and much more stably.  I've even considered permanently affixing them to the cards, if I could just bring myself to defile the sanctity of a game well made.

A complex economic game that actually works quite well. It has a stock market mechanism and a lot of player interaction. Sadly the overall appearance is very out-dated: the chits and vine-markers are fiddly, the colors are very hard to keep apart, you have to do a ton of bookkeeping and updating each round... Let's put it that way: the game doesn't make it easy for you to enjoy it.Overall an interesting "base-game" but those flaws make it look really bad in comparison to other similar (concerning single mechanisms) games like Acquire, Funkenschlag or Caylus...

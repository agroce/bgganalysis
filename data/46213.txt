This game is a gas.  Every time I play this game, I have fun playing it.  When most people play it for the first time, they immediately want to play again.  (Also, in my opinion, scoring detracts from the fun.  Just play it.)

Great fun playing this with a group of non-gamers.  I usually struggle to play games with my family but this went down a storm including my fifty year old brother in law and 8 year old nephew.

Lots of awesome games of this. Last weekend we used two sets and had a 12 player game which was great!

It's more a fun-loving distraction than a game, but I enjoy it. It's easy to appreciate and passes the time. The scoring isn't needed - and isn't used when I play. So you never win - you simply enjoy the time with friends laughing at the results.

Yes, it's a reimplementation of basically broken telephone, but there are a few things that make this great.

1) The booklets with erasable markers. No need to use lots of fiddly paper!

3) This is one of those games where you don't care about the points.

So yeah, lots of fun.

I played this game only three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I'm not a big party game person. I usually find them decent but I very rarely go further than that. Therefore should come as no surprise that I find Telestration to be merely an OK game. 

I think the idea of turning Pictionary on its head and make it a silly game is a brilliant one. It actually makes it become a good game for a party situation, because it makes it quick, it's still able to accommodate a bunch of people but especially it becomes fun and silly. That being said, I don't particularly enjoy it, because the fun of the game is to go together through the flip-book and see how things degenerate in weird ways. I enjoy that part a lot... problem is that that part comes after 15-20 minutes of people drawing. Sure there's the occasional laughter during this phase, but I still don't enjoy drawing enough to have fun doing it for 20 minutes.

I can surely see how Telestration is a good party game and a clever idea but, since this is my rating and it's based on my taste, I can't give it more than a 5,5. I think it's alright, but I would rather play something else most of the times.

The ideal usage of party games, in my mind, is something of an oxymoron. They offer highly social, interactive gameplay to help everyone loosen up, and provide an opportunity to showcase player creativity. I appreciate how well they accommodate large player numbers, but in general, if it's an unfamiliar crowd the banter/social aspect falls flat for me, and if it's an in-crowd with no social bridge needed, then I'd rather play something else.

The "pay to play" version of Telephone Pictionary, but actually not just a cash grab.  In that while yes you don't need this game, the components packed in the box are really great/ really worth it!  Comes equipped with enough dry-erase materials (board, wipes, pens) to play up to 8 and is neatly packed with other helpful items (topic cards, die and timer).  The boards are exceptional in that they are both neatly organized and are decorated with reminders, giving them some life and helping streamline play.  Overall a fun game complete with really great components.  Get it (and save some paper)!

After only a demo, I think this is one that would be an excellent group activity rather than a game.

After playing it for real, it's not something I like.  It's fine as an activity, but the problem is that you run into people who love the game and try to force the wackiness.  Then you have people like me, who are trying to solve a puzzle and thus aren't producing "hilarious" results.  This is something I don't think I'll suggest.

Chinese Whispers crossed with Pictionary. Unpredictable and very funny; this is a game for those who don't mind their humour getting a bit surreal.

A commercial version of Eat Poop you Cat or 'Telephone' or 'a Message to Garcia'  A good way to start the game night while you're waiting for the rest to arrive.  Nice party game that can be explained quickly.  I view this as more of an activity than a game, and really don't care what the final score was.

Down side is that it requires an even number of players and is probably best with 6 or 8 players.  I suspect that it would also play well with a second copy and more than 8 players.

If you consider this an party activity instead of a winnable game, then this is going to provide a group of people with a lot of laughter.  Drawing one thing off of the cards is normally too easy, so find a way to come up with wacky, off-the-wall items to draw.

The go-to party game for us.  All groups seem to enjoy it and it's pretty much guaranteed laughs for the group.  We ignore all scoring, so there's no strategy or tactical element to the game for us at all.  It's easier to get people that otherwise wouldn't play games like pictionary or charades to play Telestrations.

The markers in the Finnish edition were far too thick. Even writing with them was difficult.

I'm still trying to figure out if this is a game. In many ways it feels more like an activity. Perhaps next time I'll try some scoring to make it feel more game-like. Either way it certainly offers laughs. However, I was a little disappointed at the quantity and intensity of laughs it delivers. Perhaps it is just the bland starting words that feel less likely to lead to a humorous place, I think phrases might work better. However they are still moderately successful at prompting funny situations, and often a single drawing can send a word into a completely different direction, which can get quite silly. The dry-erase pads are the ideal way of playing this game I think, and they were designed well to make the rules/flow of the game really obvious. You almost don't need to teach the game if the players can simply take a moment and read the flip-books as they go. Overall I'm glad I received this game as a gift, but I don't know if it will surpass most of my favorite party games.

When we first played telestrations, we played it for two hours straight and laughed and laughed. It's a drawing game where drawing well can be less exciting than drawing poorly, so it's perfect for me.

Was pretty disappointed with this game.  The dry erase markers are nice...but drawing with them sucks.  I'd much rather draw with pens or pencils.  Also there is no need to buy this game.  You can buy some cheap pads of paper, pass em around and play the exact same game.

Good for a laugh, and good for parties (especially with non-gamers).  It's a social game that you play because it's humorous.  The scoring is very subjective like Apples-to-Apples so you're not playing to win, you're playing for the experience.

Ridiculous fun in a short time.  I never thought I would buy it because EPYC is free - but this feels professional and like a real game as you play.  I am not ashamed to bring it up amongst friends.

To get the most out of this game you need to ignore the cards that come with it.  Think of your own phrases or sayings.

As my friend says, this isn't a game, it's an experience. It's a fun experience though. Eat Poop You Cat: The board game. Picture Telephone: The official boxed version. I got this for Christmas from my friend and I am happy with it. I like the structure, I like the speed, and I like ignoring the silly scoring and just enjoying the fun. Sometimes people can be very literal in their drawings, but these same people are hilarious when they come to literally describing the pictures! It's about how tangential the pictures become

It is a somewhat fun activity for a time - it is not a game really but that's not what party games are for so its not that big of a deal to me. 

The problem for me is that the clues provided are kind of lame - some impossible like Rock of Gibraltar or IT guy, some boring and easy like Atlantic Ocean. Obviously, making up your own is an easy solution, but then I would really be rating Eat Poop You Cat but with really nice components. 'Telestrations against humanity' seems like it would be a fun combo, so I would definitely like to try it that way next time.

Even then, there are many other drawing games I would rather play, like Identik or the Pictionary anniversary edition.

Amazing party game! This game is just pure fun - probably the game in which I've laughed the most out of any of the 250+ games I've played! Of course, the more you suck at drawing, the more fun it is in my opinion (I'm extremely awful myself as is most people I play with). 

You also need at least 5 players for the game to shine, and I would say the more the merrier. It's an awesome party game which especially non-gamers love (as is the case with most party games).

I've only played a paper and pencil version with everyone making up their own phrase and it went down well with both gamers and non-gamers. 7 or 9 players seem to be about right as you can start and end with the writing and there's enough scope for change in between. I would like to own Telestrations but only for the wipe-clean flip pads that come with the game. I would much rather play for laughs than points.

Silly fun. Write down a word, then draw a picture to capture it. Pass to the left. That person guesses what it is and writes a word. Pass to the left. That person then draws the word... and then watch the chain of ideas fall apart.

It's hard for me to find someone who does not own this game or recommends it. Like any game that picks subjects from cards it can get very stale once you go through all of them. On the other hand, misinterpretations and bad drawing skills can make repeats work anyway. The issue then is getting people to laugh.

Fun to play once or twice, but definitely needs to be done in moderation.

Very good party game - basically Eat Poop You Cat with a little more structure.  The blue side of the cards seemed much too easy with the 90 second time constraint - if we were to play blue again, I'd decrease the time allowed for drawing.  The yellow side worked much better.  The scoring doesn't really seem worth using - we just played to have fun looking at the results.

This gets high marks from non-gamers. Perhaps enough so that my rating should be higher. But it's hard to give a higher rating to a "game" when there's so little actually there. It's just a bunch of whiteboards and pens, with cards that have lists of things to draw. That's it.

Technically I've played this already, as EPYC is a staple in our friends' group. But this game made an appearance at an event recently so I had to give it a try.

The thing I don't like is it gives you words/phrases and what you draw first has to be based on those. Granted you could just skip the cards if you wanted.

The thing I do like is the erasable boards, which is certainly more environmentally friendly, although TBH we always play on scrap paper that gets recycled.

Great party game, I have the 12 player party pack but haven't played it with 12...yet. great variation on Pictionary where you guess and draw what you think it is then the next person guesses. It says it is like the telephone game and I agree. I can't wait to play it with a larger group because the larger the group the more iterations the drawing travels through meaning the crazier the outcomes.

Telestrations is a little hard for me to rate.  I think it's a great way to spend 30 or 45 minutes, but I don't think it's much of a *game*.  So if you want to spend 30 or 45 minutes laughing and having fun, "play" Telestrations; I don't remember laughing that hard in a long time.  On the other hand, if you want to play a *game*, whether competitively or cooperatively, I suggest trying something else.

Components: Clever drawing/guessing notebooks. Simple stack of cards.

Experience: The drawings are always fun to see, and it's interesting to see the telephonic progression of the idea, sometimes coming full circle from an incorrect guess back to a correct guess.

Bordering on being an activity rather than a game. Assuming players are faithfully trying to guess a picture, their written guesses will seldom earn them points. In a 6-player game, that means there will be just 2 artists (other than the player generating the clue), and so these two almost always receive the two points for 'creative' and 'hilarious'. The only inconstant scoring is whether the final guess is correct or not. Would probably be more interesting if player's had to guess which final answer corresponds to their own clue.

Telestrations is a fun party game!  It is pretty much a game of Telephone with drawings.  I love to see how my drawing transforms into something totally different once it makes its way around the table.  Everyone at the table gets a kick out of that! I love a game that will provide hysterical laughter - Telestrations does that.  I also like that you don't need to be good at drawing; in fact, the worst the drawing, the better!  Occasionally a round of this game will fall flat when people draw too well and guess well - that is where this game loses a little for me but it doesn't happen often enough for me to not want to play.  Otherwise, this is a very fun game and it is a great filler game.  We usually play a few rounds and then move onto something else.  I will always welcome a game of this from time to time.

Each time we have played this game, it has become a non-competitive affair, and the result is that everyone just plays for the fun.

This is a game that combines the fun of both the old "Telephone" game as well as as "Pictionary".  It's a hoot!  You really don't need to score, just go around and show the end pictures\word trails.  We laughed so hard at some of the pictures and guesses.  This is a great game for any group and for all ages.  Keep on laughing!

This used to be called "that game we played in English class" when i was in 7th grade.  It's still just as much fun.  I probably preferred the way we used to make up our own starting sentences, but I MUCH prefer the way the dry erase booklets work to folding paper.

If you haven't yet played Telestrations, you should.  It is a fun activity that mixes the classic game of telephone with drawing.  Don't expect a game of strategy.  You play this one for the laughs.

Amusing party game of passing a clue around the table, watching it mutate.  Players are each given an erasable sketchpad, and write a randomly generated word on the first page.  Each pad is passed to the left, and the next player has to sketch the word, then pass the pad on.  Next round, players have to guess the sketch, and write the word, and pass it on.  This goes on, alternating between word and sketch until the pad arrives back at the beginning, where the path of the word is revealed page by page.  More a social activity than a game, but very funny.

RATING: 8
Fun times. It's cool to see people's creative sides and to make fun of them (and yourself!). I'd played this game with just paper and pencil before, but the great quality of the dry-erase books and all is spectacular.

The only problem with this is when people want to play with points. The idea of assigning points to people in this game takes away a bunch of the fun. It's a jarring categorical change that makes this game not about fun, but about winning. Since you tend to get points if your guess makes it all the way back to you, it encourages people to be boring (we had a member of our group choose the word "triangle" just so it could make it around so he'd get a point). Plus, anyone who is a bad artist is just SOL with points, but can still have fun when their terrible drawings make for some crazy guesses.

Great party game!

Interesting party game where you must draw a clue for the item of the card which then gets passed through several people. Skill at drawing is a factor but many of the items to draw are simple items/concepts that should be fairly easy to convey

In a chinese whispers sort of fashion the image/guess you finally end up with may or may not have anything to do with the original. 

I am not a fan of party games but this one is ok.

단, 모든 카드를 한글화 하는 것은 힘드니, 다른 적절한 방법으로 단어들을 선택할 수 있게 하면 좋은 것 같습니다.

UPDATE: I hope to give this one more go, but its not as good as a game I was expecting from the reviews - - not really a game but rather a system of laughing at peoples mistakes, which is a strange design basis despite the laughs generated (Rating: 4.785; Feb 2015) UPDATE: No desire to play this at all, gone (Rating 3.283, Jan 2017)

Okay, let's all agree that Telestrations is NOT a game and people who play this game to win should not play Telestrations. This is just for pure laughs and the fun experience that comes from it. Also, don't take it too seriously, if you draw an eye, just guessing eye is not fun or funny and everyone can draw an eye and then you will have all correct pictures and answers, be creative and draw and answer things that spice it up a bit. The only result is, more laughs. I love Telestrations!

In terms of party games, this one is hard to beat.  It is hilarious and everyone loves it.  We don't play with the points that the rules explain because it seems very contrived.  Does this game need to have a winner?  If anything, it would probably make the game worse.

Six is the magic number for this game.  Any less than that and you only get to draw 2 pictures, which is hardly enough for shenaniganns to occur.  Eight people and it is a blast.

I am rating this compared to other party/social games.  The 9 that I am giving it should not be compared to what I give strategy games.

This is probably my favorite party game. It plays best with the maximum number of players. A good idea is to switch seats after each round so that you are not giving and receiving drawing from to and from the same players.

My sisters would rate this an 8 or 9. I do like this game alot! Don't get me wrong, but going by the rting suggestions, I wouldn't normally suggest this game, because I like games where someone wins! The vitory point system for this game is dumb and i wouldnt use. The fun part is seeing everyones bad drawings and wondering if your word will make it back in one piece. Instant family hit.

Below average game.  Kids think it's funny but seems inanane to me.  Especially the attempt to tie a score/objective to the game.  Every time I played, we did it just to see how the pictures turned out and didn't even attempt to keep track of scores.

More of a social activity than a game, but fun nonetheless. Perfect for sitting around with friends, talking, drinking, laughing. 

Players play a version of Telephone with words and drawings on individual dry-erase pads. The fun comes at the end when you see how convoluted the original word becomes after being redrawn and reinterpreted by the other players.

LOVE this game, so much fun!  My only issue with it is that sometimes the clue cards are too easy, and it leads to things like: first person draws a butterfly, person guesses butterfly, then someone draws butterfly, next person guesses butterfly, next person draws a butterfly...

Quite simply the best party game to be released in a decade or more. I played four times and laughed myself silly each time. I can't remember when I had so much fun with a party game. This is the old "telephone" game, but using drawings instead. While scoring is involved, that really isn't the point. The fun comes in seeing how a phrase morphs into something completely different by the time it completes the circuit. We had such outlandish transformations as "skinny-dip" turning into "Aborigine" and "Jumping Jacks" morphing into "Krakatoa East of Java".

The telephone equivalent of Pictionary. While there is a game with a scoring buried deep within, I believe the game's true worth resides in its telephone antics and misinterpretations.

My family picked up the gist of the game quite easily and found it to be very enjoyable without keeping score. If you find amusement in suggestive and ridiculous drawings, you're definitely in for a treat with game. Unfortunately, the game requires at least 4 players and, while enjoyable with the minimum amount, it benefits greatly from having 6-8 players.

Amusing party game. Lots of laughter when looking through all of the answers at the end. We play without scoring, just for the amusement factor. This game is definitely better with more people playing, it really needs a minimum of 5 and more is better. We made our own version with sheets of cardstock in sheet protecters as the pages (dry erase markers work on them) because we wanted more room to draw.

I was wondering how a publisher could take the ubiquitous "Eat Poop You Cat" and present it in an accessible, marketable manner.

The gameplay is essentially "Eat Poop You Cat", meaning it can be wild and crazy, hysterically funny and memorable. But, why would you pay money for a game you could play with paper and pencils?

By introducing high-quality, dry erase sketch books, Telestrations has taken the messiness of creative folding of the drawing papers, and turned it into a clean, functional sprial-bound, flip-book format.

Also, the game has done away with hard-to-draw phrases that "Eat Poop You Cat" allows, and forces players to work with simple, everyday words and concepts. For example, "Tongue Tied", "Man Overboard", "Best Man", "Exploding Volcano", "Evolution", "Teacher's Pet", and others are on a number of cards that are drawn at random. This also makes the game more family-friendly, since the words/concepts are not R-rated, like they could be in "Eat Poop You Cat". Of course, it does depend on groupthink, and the game could devolve into raunchy, silly innuendos, but only if the group wants to "go there". 

Telestrations does everything right on a functional level, with clear instructions on every page. It simply works, and the game never gets in the way of itself. It is a solid "8".

[b]DON'T BUY THIS GAME.[/b] Save your money and reduce your impact on the environment. Go buy a ream of 8.5"x11" printer paper, and a box of pencils and call it what it is, EAT POOP YOU CAT!

Game that works well with group of 4 -6 artistically impaired partygoers. Isn't really a game ... more an activity for adults. Can be very fun at the right time and place. Each person gets a difficult word to draw, then tries to draw it and passes the erasable book to their neighbour to write down what they think it is. Rinse and repeat around the table. Laugh at the results by presenting outcomes to everyone.

RATING: 9
What a great Party game, can’t believe someone never thought of it sooner.  Take the old "telephone" game or something similar like "eat poop you cat" and combine with "Pictionary" and you have this game.  Recommended for late night gaming 5 players and up with higher numbers being better, and alcohol will most likely add to the fun but is not required.  

I couldn’t give this any less than an 8 though its not much of a 'game' (most party games aren't), I had a sore throat after playing from laughing so hard and I’m not exaggerating and so did the others, my gut really hurt too no shit.  Group dependant of course, all these types of games are though.  No rules to explain and I mean NONE and plays in 20 to 30 minutes. 

Basically everyone starts with a word or two and passes their drawing easel to the next player.  Next player has to draw the word, then pass that to the next player.  That player has to guess what the picture is.  Then the next player has to draw a picture from THAT guess and it keeps going until you get your board back.  So like the telephone game, things are not what they seem at times and by the time the drawings come back to you man have they changed usually!  Some very funny stuff looking at all the boards after, a glass eye that turns to 'dog shit'?  lol  bust a gut on that one.  

If it's this funny with at least one other group my rating will go up to at least 9 and I'll be buying the game for sure. The hardest I laughed for a long time.

[u]UPDATE[/u] 8 => 9 Played again with a completely different group of only 6 people including my Mom and we had lots of laughs and everyone loved it. First games were with 8 people and like I said the more the merrier but 6 was great too.  Outstanding Party game, probably my favourite to date. EDIT - Played yet again with 7 totally different family members, everyone loved it yet again. One suggestion to avoid confusion, no need to get people to always turn the page ahead, then have people always turn back when they start, totally unnecessary and creates confusion, would only be needed if people are sitting to close together and this game plays best sitting around the living room on couches. 

Tidbit - Modified my copy so we can play up to TEN people now, required FIVE more books unfortunately but I will gladly pull this out with 6 to 10 people. You could buy two full sets and have it play up to 11 by restringing the books OR just have it play up to 16 but books dont pass all the way around, 16 might be too many people not sure, would probably work but I wanted books to pass all the way around and more often than not I wont have more than 10 people. The spiral binder is removable and this is how I added 2 pages to 10 books to have 10 books with 10 pages each instead of 8.

Great game to play in large groups, especially if people are drinking and/or if people can't draw. The retail game adds a few nice things over playing with just stacks of paper. For one you don't have to scrounge up paper, rip it up, and organize it; the dry erase is very convenient. And I personally appreciate that there are cards to choose what to draw. This doesn't stop you from doing a round of make up your own but it gives you the option to just let the game pick for you, which might be best in certain contexts.

Initial Rating 3.5 (February 2011)

This game can be very fun with the right crowd, however for me the arbitration is a big deal. I can´t pass the fact that the judge can vote in any way he sees fit, if I clearly did the best image I should win a point and this is not the case with Telestrations. In the game we played the judges refused to vote for the clearly best player (not me, I can´t draw) as he was in the lead, at the end of the game he lost. 

It has nice mechanics but I don’t think I will play this again. I want to try instead Pictomania from genius designer Vlaada Chvátil.

On the bright side this can be a nice game to attract people to the hobby.

Current Rating: 3.5

It’s been brought to my attention that we played with the friendly rules. The competitive rules are more like I want so PERHAPS there is still hope I like this game. I will play ONCE more to see this.

Finally I played this again yesterday. The game is fun to play and I’m upgrading its rating based only on the competitive rules. This way the arbitration is clear and objective. Still I hate to draw so this is not a game for me, but perhaps I will buy it to play it with my family and non-gamer friends.

Broken telephone done with white erase pads -- and drawing. Draw the word, pass it to the next person, and let them deduce the word based on what you've drawn. The quality of artist can play a role, but so can misinterpretation. Fun, especially as a group party game.

PLUS: art and vocabulary come together in a fun way
MINUS: some words are too easy to misinterpret while others go wildly off

Hit of the 2010 Gathering.  Need I say more than that?  If I must I'd add that I haven't laughed so hard playing a game in a [i]long[/i] time, and I'm one to judge how well a game is going based on how much laughter is happening, so "gaming == laughing" is not a new concept here.

As far as party games go this is one of the best that I have ever played. Keeping score is nice but not really necessary as the game is more about watching how your initial clue transforms into something completely different.

Lots of laughter with this one.   

My rating considers it against all other games I have rated. As a party game I would rate it an 8.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Not so much a game, but more an activity that involves the telephone paradigm passing sketches and words around that will most likely shift from one thing into others. When something derails completely, it can turn into hilarious results. And that is what this game is all about: laughs and giggles. This is fun for everybody: young and old, gamer and non-gamer. Just try to play with 6+ persons.

This is a nice implementation of Telephone (also Eat Poop You Cat). You take a word and draw a picture, pass it to the next player who writes the word and so on. The fun is more in the transformation than trying to get the correct answer around the table. We didn't use the die to select or the timer. The game is a lot of fun at the end of the night. This is definitely a great implementation with the dry erase boards.

RATING: 7
This game really only plays well in the 6-10 or so range. Much more than that and it feels too long (or incomplete). Fewer than 6 seems to lead to less interesting results. Add in the fact that it plays best with an even number of players - and you are somewhat limited. I personally like drawing, but others don't as much so you are also risking someone being pretty unhappy in a large group playing this. I would rate an 8 if those two limitations weren't an issue.

A great party game. I've only seen one person not laugh.

You spend almost as much time looking at everyone's drawings and guesses as you do actually playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
If you only play games to win, this is definitely not worth playing, as the scoring system is pretty stupid, but if you enjoy playing for the experience this can be a riot.  I would recommend not doing the die roll and allowing everyone to choose their own word or phrase, not even limiting them with the cards.  The only drawback I see with the game is that you kind of need a lot of players to make it worthwhile.  And though the flipbooks are nice, you may as well just play Eat Poop You Cat for free.

'Telestrations' somehow managed to suck the fun out of the excellent 'Eat Poop You Cat'.  I guess I blame their short stock clues (vs. EPYC's creative complete sentences), little dry-erase boards (vs. EPYC's good old paper, which becomes a funny keepsake to reread later), and scoring (vs. EPYC's focus on the experience of creating and presenting the story each booklet tells).

I recommend you just fold some short stacks of printer paper to make booklets, and play Eat Poop You Cat!

I will fully admit that this is not really a game in the traditional sense.  It is a VERY fun activity to play with a bunch of friends, though.  (There are scoring rules, but nobody uses them.)  Famously also known as Eat Poop, You Cat, this is game of Telephone played with drawings.  Everyone playing has a little booklet with dry erase pages.  You start off with a phrase and write it down.  Everyone else does the same and passes their book to the next person.  The next person then tries to draw this concept.  They then pass and the next person writes down what they think the phrase is.  They then pass it and the next person tries to draw that.  It keeps going and in the end, you will laugh because of the crazy changes that happened through each booklet.  You can't play this without laughing a lot!  :-D  A real winner.  A new favorite party game of mine.  This version plays to 8 players, by the way.  There is also a 6 player version and a 12 player version.  I also have the 12 player version.

[size=12][b]Why I like Telestrations:[/b][/size]
+ I enjoy seeing how bad people are at drawing and how bad they are at recognizing drawings. 
+ I like the name of this game over the game that this game re-implements.
+ I like the mechanics
+ The game is easy to teach
+ The game is short

[size=12][b]Fixable dislikes in regards to Telestrations:[/b][/size]
/ The markers seem to die out. You will probably need to buy more markers. 
/ I do not enjoy this game when people intentionally try to change the drawing. I suggest not playing with these people. 

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Telestrations:[/b][/size]
- The game lacks meaningful decisions. There is no clear winner or loser. 
- I think that the game might be better with a pen and pencil but I have yet to try this out.

08-27-2014 - I can't see myself really giving this more than an 8.  Well, maybe an 8.5.  There's not much to it.  You get a word, you draw some stuff, you pass your thingy around, repeat.  But all this said, it's just plain "fun in a box."  It's always a hit.  Every time.  Laughs all around.  One of the funnest and most versatile games we own.  Yeah, at least an 8.5 for sure.

Each player begins by sketching a TELESTRATIONS word dictated by the roll of a die. The old fashioned sand timer may limit the amount of time they get to execute their sketch, but it certainly doesn't limit creativity! Time's up! All players, all at the same time, pass their sketch to the next player, who must guess what's been drawn. Players then simultaneously pass their guess -- which hopefully matches the original word (or does it??) -- to the next player who must try to draw the word they see -- and so on

RATING: 8
This "telephone" drawing party is ideal for 8 players but since I own the Part Pack edition, my copy can play up to 12 drawing-challenged party animals.  I don't usually prefer playing drawing games but this is an exception for me.  It can create some very memorable moments of outrageous hilarity that will keep you laughing and blaming others for their inaccurate drawings.  

I tend to play with a slightly different scoring: 
1 point awarded for each correct guess of picture drawn that matches previous phrase written down (guessed).
1 point awarded for each picture drawn that is guessed correctly.
1 point (bonus) awarded to the owner of the book if the last phrase matches the starting phrase.

But, this is one of those party games where keeping score is not essential.... the laughter and misinterpreted drawings are.

Less a game than a social activity -- at least it is a genuinely amusing activity with the right crowd.  I have never kept score and the rules seem to imply that you don't need to.

The rating is specifically for the game 'Telestrations', which destroys the fun of "Eat Poop You Cat" in two ways. (1) since the scoring rewards correct guesses, and incorrect guesses are where the fun is, the game is designed to be as not-fun as possible. (2) the words are short and simple, and usually not too tough to guess (they're also boring). It's not hard to even do a stick person "surfer" over and over. EPYC is a hilarious activity that this company tried to adopt using a definition of "fun" that was worked out in some other "telephone"-like game.

Normally party games aren't my cup of tea, but I've never laughed so hard in a game of any sort before. Incredibly simple: basically telephone with alternating of drawing and guessing the drawing; but people's horrible drawings or horrible guesses adds for great hilarity. I'm not so sure about the scoring mechanism though, while it makes sense this game might be best played without someone trying to win, as my enjoyment stems more from the "story" of how everyone's book changes. I haven't played with much variation in player count but more seems to be better since then the books change up more.

Also known as Eat Poop You Cat, Telestrations is a solid party game that always inspires a good story, whether it be cheese grater hands or soda tits. I like the fact that I can draw terribly and not only not be judged for it but actually get a lot of laughs. After all, drawing something perfectly each round is way less entertaining than a fairy godmother becoming a pumpkin patch.

This is a really funny party game for a large group that naturally adjusts the level of inappropriateness based on the players -- that is, I can switch this at will from an adult group to a bunch of church kids and the game is fantastic either way.

Go ahead and find the 12-player version; 12 is better than 8 (both to include more people and to have more rounds to draw / guess badly).

(Obviously, rated as a party game)

A fun game which really is often an activity and not a game.  It is basically telephone with pictures.  You can have a lot of fun with passing these around and getting some strange outcomes.  Better with 8 or 6.  You can play with 4 but it is less likely you get funny outcomes.

It's okay.  I thought the "_____" and "favorite _____" were the best ones as they were more creative.  Other then that it almost felt like someone had to try to manufacture the laughs by guessing something funny just to make the next person have to draw it.

A blatant rip-off of "Eat Poop You Cat." 

Scoring can be a bit odd, but the game is probably worth having for the bits. Then again, it might make sense just to use old fashioned pencil and paper.

The fact that someone turned it into a game that's garnering rave reviews on Amazon and BGG is brilliant.

I am SOOOO jealous!!! :(

One of the best party games I've ever played -- and a funny experience in part because, by default, there's no scoring. It distills the party game experience down to its essence, and you don't need points for that. Tons of fun!

Telestrations is an absolute blast to play, and our first night involved four games in a row. The best transformation was probably "guacamole" to "alien invasion," but we also had a couple where the final guess was correct.

On top of being pure fun, Telestrations has the best components I've ever seen in a party game. Little touches like the inclusion of the cleaning cloths, full-size markers, and uniquely colored coils on the sketch books really make this a great little package.

A good party activity.  It is not a game in the traditional sense.  There can be winners and losers, but it isn't based on much and no one cares.  That is part of the charm.  This should be in everyone's collection. It can be played by people of all ages.

My pet peeve with playing this game is that people are too worried about their drawing.  Good drawing doesn't make the activity better!  People say "I can't draw so I don't want to play."  And my least favorite is people who start their drawing before the timer is started.

07/11/17 Played twice. This game (and I use that word loosely, as to me its more of an "activity") is about as far from my cup of tea as I can think of. I've played games that I hated more. But this one is still near the bottom. At least the two "games" of it we played only lasted 11 and 8 minutes. One player afterwards said Telestrations is better if the players are slightly inebriated. Maybe so, though I have no plans to ever find out. As I hope to never see Telestrations again.

This is a great party game.  My friends and I always just make up random words or phrases instead of following the rules of the game.  Also, we never keep score, because it's not that type of game.

Ordered this based on how many great reviews it's getting. Since I've gotten rid of cranium as it is showing it's age (mechanically), I wanted to get more party games that are truly considered great. I got more werewolf style games along with this and dixit. Once I try telestrations out, I'm hoping it will really fill in the void left by cranium (as far as fun and accessibility even though they play very differently)

UPDATE
Amazingly fun party game but you really need the full 8 people or at least 6. I really recommend this for a large group of non gamers to relax and open up with.

RATING: 7
Picture telephone game which is great concept and a lot of fun. The cards can get a little boring after a while though if no one draws anything clever - I think coming up with your own words or using something like a generated list of phrases or expressions could add some nice, more flair to the game.

Overall production value is great, whiteboards work awesomely. Solid party game (note, I generally find party games fun but rate them lowly due to their party nature - this is just a personal thing)

Plays: 2 or so?

My  understanding is that this game is just like Eat Poop You Cat, which doesn't have a winning condition and therefore is a social activity, NOT a game - hence the 1 rating.

RATING: 7
This is my 'go-to' party game. We NEVER use the cards or timer included in the game and just have everyone make up random words/phrases and take their time with drawings. It is also less of a game and more of an activity as nobody wins or loses. We just enjoy sharing the stories as everyone laughs as we take turns describing the train of thought. Where else can you see "Jedi Knight" turn into "Batman is not allowed on TV"!

Entirely group dependent... probably best with a small child or someone with absolutely no artistic ability in the mix. Laughs ensue, but they tend to be the same sort of laughs each time, so the novelty wears off.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Yes, it's the old game "Telephone" from our youth, except instead of whispering something in someone's ear and finding out how bad people are at repeating information correctly, you are drawing a word or phrase, passing it to another player who has to guess what you drew, then hands the drawing pad to the next player who has to draw what the previous player thought you drew, and so on. It's great fun, has fantastic components, and belongs in every gamer's collection. Yes, you can play it without the cards or pads, but for $25, it's so worth picking up a copy.

Good filler/party game. We played without cards or an actual board in the past, so not sure how necessary this is!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Telestrations is not so much a game as it is a fun activity; one that is full of laughs. Scoring sucks the life out of the end-of-round discovery, so I wouldn't recommend attempting it. Poor drawing skills are a key element in the game's humor as, if everyone were to draw well enough the Telestrations wouldn't work at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Telestrations is a 'whisper down the lane' game except with drawing.  I draw the card 'frog legs' and have to draw that, than pass my drawing to the left where this player guesses at what I drew.  After they guess they again pass it to the left and than that player draws the guess the previous player guessed.

The game is fun in an, let's all laugh at how silly this became, but ultimately Pictionary is funner and has a 'winner' in the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not a good game. All the fun is in looking at the drawings. That is only about 30 seconds of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's only somewhat a game. It's really just an excuse to be silly, which is fine. Any game where you can start with 'rag doll' and end up with 'amputation' is okay in my book.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The game components are quite poor. It's still better than having to improvise your own, but the cards use a paper thin cardstock, some pens were almost dry out of the box, etc. It would have been quite an issue for me had I paid the full price.

The scoring system is a joke, that's why nobody cares to keep track of the points. But the game is hilarious. It works even better than expected and I think it's a game for everybody, 99% of the players will enjoy it (even my mother [anti-fun made woman] enjoyed it!).

It wears out a bit. It's not a game for an evening. We usually get tired after playing a few rounds.

One of the best party games on the market. For some reason its difficult to explain this game to people. Probably because I bring it out to non-gamers often.

BRAVO !! Hilarious and Fun Drawing Party Game !! Part Pictionary, part Grapevine/Telephone game. I've never seen so much laughing for a game, not even with Cards Against Humanity. Works with friends as well as strangers.

** You don't have to be a great artist to have a blast with this game. You can just play for laughs instead of points if you wish.

The friendly points system seems to be the best way to go, though the competitive scoring is great, too.

The game CAN be hilarious raucous fun.  But, and this is a big but, WAY too many of the words on the included cards are too easy and boring.  It is no fun if someone gets "lipstick" and everyone draws/guesses it correctly all the way around the table.  I have seen entire games where all the drawings and guesses were almost spot on.  That's boring.  Period.  If the game had tougher cards, it would be a much better game.  There are a few tough ones scattered about in the box, but it really needs a whole extra deck.

One of the few party games that is all about the experience rather than the competition. What makes this work is that the worse you are at drawing, the more fun it is as the game progresses.

Wow, this is a fun party game! The number of players on BGG profile is wrong. I believe our game had 12. The game is a mix of pictionary and telephone. Each player gets a reusable book and a word. Then each player write the word and hand the book to the next player while receiving the previous player's book. They draw the word. Then pass the books again. This time they have to interpret the drawing back into a word and pass the book again. After the book is handed all the way around the table you will have your original book back filled with words and pictures.

Its a blast to just go through the progression of each book but there are rules on scoring if desired.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game, a combination of whisper-down-the-line/telephone and Pictionary, is just crazy fun.  I enjoy drawing games to begin with, and the hilarity that results from revealing how images progressed is not to be missed.  However, this game is not worth playing with fewer than six players.  Also, things can be more fun if you vary the seating order between rounds/games.  I also highly reccomend the "competitive" rules over the other rules--they encourage people to actually try instead of just writing or drawing something random.

RATING: 5
This game would be a situational play. It is more of a social game for the laughs and not the gameplay. If you have a not-serious group who will laugh, it could be a winner. If you have gamers or party gamers who like competition, it's a poor choice.

My main concerns are that your success is highly dependent on seating order. You only get one guess unlike Pictionary, which is superior, as some would be "close". If you don't know, can sabotage other players following by writing a ridiculous answer, which others will try to draw and guess, which you'd get nothing.

Will play for the laughs only.

Pick a word, tell your nieghbor the word, they will draw a picture of it to their nieghbor, whose neighbor will then try to guess the word that was drawn, whose neighbor willl draw a picture of the word that was guessed, and so on down the line until it gets back to you and you can see how far things went wrong in this pictionary-esque partygame.

As always with these kind of games: with the right kind of crowd it is very funny. But of course only if the drawings deviate far enough from the original. Sometimes the explanation of the creator is even more fun than the drawing itself.

So far have only played with four people.  It was tremendously fun.  I can not wait to play with a full group of eight!  Great fun, and we don't even bother keeping score.

RATING: 8
Party game that can be summed up as Pictionary meets the telephone game. Can play up to eight but six players is the best count as you get some fun results but does not take too long, either. A nice plus is that with the short timer, needing to be skilled at drawing is not needed. I would say it's even a plus as it adds more fun to the mix as the book makes its way around the group. I have never kept score and have played this 100+ times. The joy is in the journey, not the destination.

The markers do not last long, however, so you will be needing to supply your own if you play the game more than 20 times. Another annoyance can be if someone is intentionally getting it wrong to be "funny" or something. But overall, one of the best party games and a favorite of many groups I play with.

a very good improvement on 'telephone'.  Also, the dry erase boards are nice, so it actually has some marginal benefit over doing it yourself.

My biggest complains is that too many of the words are too easy, making for boring rounds.  So, it's probably best to let people make up their own starting words, and completely ignore the deck of cards.

Much better with more players.  4, the stated lower limit, is really pushing it.

Party game based around drawing someone's interpretation of yet someone else's original drawing. Not bad, and can be funny when you see what the original source was at the end of the game, but it suffers a bit when players have different levels of artistic skill. You need everyone to be equally good (or bad) otherwise the whole thing becomes a bit skewed.

Like a lot of party games, Telestrations could be easily accomplished with a pile of paper and pens. There's not a lot of reason to buy a commercial version. That said, I do enjoy this, largely because the little pads are nice, and because the dry-erase marker give the drawings a nice cave-drawing feel.

Great game, some hilarious moments and we were still talking about the drawings the next day.

An excellent party game. There is no downtime as everyone is doing something at the same time. It is always better with more people - 6 or more. And it's always better with even numbers of players so that the rounds end so that the last person has written a word. I haven't actually played once to score points. This game is worth playing just to see the results. Not for the competitive. A must-buy for the casual gamer. For increased hilarity, good drawers need to not apply!

Telestrations is a great game for a group of creative people. When I bought this game I thought it was going to be fun... I was wrong, it's better than fun. Drawing stupid pictures with your friends and then seeing how contorted it gets 7 friends later is crazy. Hands down one of the most enjoyable party games I've played to date. The only major problem I have with it is that a lot of people won't want to play it claiming that they have no imagination or aren't creative enough. This can kill some nights of this game.

Fun party game, very similar to Eat Poop You Cat but with structure.  Every player gets a card and a word or phrase from it is randomly selected, they draw that word or phrase and pass their book, the next person then  guesses what the word or phrase is from the picture, alternating for a set number of rounds based on the number of players.  It is telephone with illustrations, hence the name "Telestrations" and just like in telephone the result is not often what you started out with.

You need not be a good artist to play this game, in fact it is often more fun when nobody is that great of an artist because then the answers get more mixed up.  Also, the game is a little lame without at least 6-8 players.

We always like to get the "player's choice" option to draw whatever we want and I often consider just playing the whole game this way but then I think the answers would be too far out there to ever actually get it right at the end.

A fun little variant is to play with the Cards Against Humanity white cards.

RATING: 7
This game pretty much cashes in on the simple "broken-telephone game". In this case, the game gives you all the materials you need to play the game in case you are lazy.

The stuff you are given in the box are somewhat mediocore at best - the markers dry out quickly and the dry-erase boards are excellent at being re-used, provided you aren't playing with little kids who will easily destroy them within a manner of a few gameplays.

The game overall is great - you can easily get great laughs from simply seeing how pictures deviate from the beginning to the end. It's always great to have a good mix of people in the game - some horrible artists with some excellent ones.

Caution though while I had some amazing laughs in this game - overplaying it (playing it too much times over several weeks) seems to ruin its fun - even though every game is different.

One of the best casual party games I've ever played (Say Anything might be the only other contender).  I've created a photo album of the bizarre evolutions that come out of this simple design.  The flipbooks and dry erase markers are a masterstroke to keep things moving quickly and avoid being bogged down in doodle paper scraps.  Try to get the 12 person version because though it scales, I felt 6 people is not quite enough to have your word-sketch-word transmogrification go completely off the rails (which is definitely my goal!).

Like "Balderdash" and other party games before it, this officially published game came from a popular "unofficial" game.  And they've done a real good job with it!  Everything from the booklets to the "dry erase" markers is very well produced and makes the game easy to play.  My only real complaint is that I wish they had thrown small phrases into the mix, instead of just one- and two-word items.  Otherwise, it's a fun and funny party game that can be enjoyed by any age from older children and up.  There's nothing really original about the officially published version (except perhaps the scoring systems), but that's fine because the original game didn't need to be improved upon.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7.5/10

RATING: 6
Gamified version of that glorious public domain game variously known as "Eat Poop You Cat", "Broken Picture Telephone" etc. -- players play a game of Chinese Whispers but alternating between drawing and writing, corrupting the message further each time.

Telestrations adds, in descending order of value, some nice custom pads and dry-erase markers, a timer, cards telling people which words to use, and a scoring system. While the last of these should be automatically discarded by right-thinking people unless they want to suck all joy out of the experience, the other accoutrements are more subtly poisonous.

The charm of this family of games has always been the transition from something sensible to "purple monkey dishwasher", and to a large extent that relies on players not being able to draw very well. But many of the cards in Telestrations are boring, easy to draw, and not funny. Part of the problem is the change from EPYC's "write a sentence" to "write a word", which precludes compound constructs like "X riding a Y" that are almost guaranteed to be corrupted.

It's a solid but unnecessary package, and you're better off using the components to play the original, superior game.

Telephone + Pictionary = favorite party game! It's always fun, really hilariously funny, and it gets a good reception from all sorts of people, from hardcore gamers to total newbies. You usually have to wheedle the new players a little, though. ("We don't CARE that you can't draw. Neither can we. That's the fun of it! Lots of detail just makes it harder to guess!")

A game you can play to liven up family gatherings. EXCELLENT.

All of the brilliance of Eat Poop You Cat with wipe clean boards and words for those that lack imagination.

I didn't use the card (I thought of a more fun thing to draw than 'udder') and we didn't score, so I can't really comment on how that works...

Update: I've now used the cards and they're a bit rubbish. I suppose if the point is that everyone can easily draw and interpret what they see, but where's the fun in that? 

Rating down from 7.5 to 6. Just play Eat Poop You Cat instead.

Great Party Game, essentially the same game as Eat Poop You Cat, but I think EPYC is actually a little bit better in that it uses Sentences and the ideas get more weird with more words involved.  It's possible in Telestrations for something to make it all the way around, which if you're playing with points, is kind of the goal of the game, which makes them less fun.

This is a combination of Pictionary and the Telephone Game, but it somehow manages to consistently be hilariously funny.  I'm not really sure how it pulls that off, and yet there it is.  This game is particularly good with non-hardcore gamers, such as at family reunions or dinner parties.

Not so much a game as a source of comedy.  Telestrations is somewhat solitary until each round is over, and then everybody hopes to laugh at something that someone else drew.  Compare this to Pictionary, where everybody laughs at something being drawn RIGHT NOW, which influences the artist directly.  This immediacy makes a big difference, making Telestrations the less interactive drawing party game.

It's not really a game so I'm rating it as an activity. It can be fun, but in a strange twist, someone who knows how to draw can actually ruin the game. Part of the fun is seeing what kind of crazy things get drawn based on a starting word, but someone who knows how to draw can make it so that the starting word is guessed correctly. Can be fun at times, but I wouldn't suggest playing it.

Sold.

I don't know how to rate this game. It's totally awesome, and the dry erase makes it so much better with the fumbly markers and easy clean up then playing with pen and paper. One of my favorites!

BUT, it's a public domain game. And the deck of cards it comes with are terrible, uninspired and probably never play-tested. 

So, technically, I'm just rating what the game adds to the original public domain game, and the answer is not much or nothing. But, the dry erase boards make this a must buy. Just house-rule the terrible cards to your group's liking or play with Cards Against Humanity cards.

Culled - First wave; Gifted to Macinda

Why we culled it: We love Telestrations! And it can lead to some absolutely hilarious sessions. However, the flavor can be chewed out pretty quickly in frequent groups, and the game can easily be played with some blank paper and topic cards taken from any source, so the whole production copy is a bit unnecessary (and the cheap markers can be a bit annoying). That said, the game is wonderful. I sent my full copy to my sister, so that my nephews can enjoy it with their ever-evolving groups. We continue to play it with them on occasion.

Now, let me start by saying that I love the mechanic behind  the game, however, I think it's dumb to use the actual game to play Telestrations. Just make up your own words or phrases, the people you are playing with are funnier than the cards, and the game is going to be more enjoyable and you can create inside jokes. If you want the paper from this game, not a bad price to get the nice papers, but I'd definitely go with making up your own terms to turn this into a fun game.

Fun party game, especially when not worrying about keeping score. Just draw, guess, and laugh at the progression. 

Telestrations takes the old "telephone" game where one person starts with an idea, and it gets passed down the line. At the end of the game everyone looks back, and sees where there topic went. On a recent play Rock Musicians turned into an Indian raid. You have to play the game to understand it.

The final game of Thursday night was Telestrations, the published version of Telephone Pictionary produced by USAopoly. Telestrations is fine and all, but infinitely inferior to just playing Telephone Pictionary with pen and paper. I explain Telephone Pictionary in my In With the New column  from BGG.CON, but basically players alternate writing a word or phrase, passing clockwise, drawing the text, passing clockwise, writing text that interprets the drawing, etc. Instead of using pen & paper and coming up with your own initial words or phrases, Telestrations provides Wits & Wagers-style white boards and markers, and cards with specified words to draw. Not only is it easier to draw with pen & paper, but it’s also much more interesting to come up with your own initial words or phrases than to use the ones provided by the publisher. The game is much more interesting if the starting clue is a full sentence rather than a single word. Telestrations was still fun, but I do wish we were closing out the night with Telephone Pictionary instead, just as the public domain game Celebrities is preferable to Time’s Up and Dictionary is preferable to Balderdash, it seems like the mass produced versions of these games miss out on the chance to explore the group’s idiosyncratic creativity.

It's basically the game: Telephone but with a pen. EPIC! This can create some very unusual drawing and conclusions of what you were trying to convey to your colleagues.  

The more raunchy the drawings (either purposefully or accidentally) make this game happen.

This is a family favorite. The laughs start early and last well past the last round. Keeping people on track - drawing and writing on the correct pages - can be tricky at first.

If you're looking for a game that will make you laugh hysterically, this game is second to none.  It always goes over really well with any group, and it doesn't matter if people are bad at drawing because it is much funnier that way.  In fact, I imagine this game would be rather boring if all of the players were excellent artists.  I recommend making up starting words instead of using the words on the cards.  Also, it isn't necessary to keep score.

As a party game, Telestration shines. However, there is a limit to the number of times you can play with the same group. The game starts off exciting and rather unique but after several games in, the game sort of loses its appeal. The humor often always comes when someone makes a haphazard guess or a silly guess. The subsequent chain reaction often turns out increasingly funnier answers. Thus, once everyone tries to outdo each other for silly answers, the game ceases to be fun anymore. It just drags on and on. Still, it is a good way to wrap up a night or a dinner party.s

While Telestrations doesn't lend itself to the same zaniness as Eat Poop You Cat does because it has cards that determine the starting word, while in Eat Poop You Cat, you start off with any sentence you want. However, Telestrations is better for the non-creative crowd, because it has more structure than Eat Poop You Cat, the drawings are usually not nearly as intricate, and the send result is usually a single thing. Telestrations is probably better as a game for holidays, family reunions, etc., but with the right crowd, no other party game is better than Eat Poop You Cat.

I'm a huge fan of these kinds of games.  Used to play "Eat Poop You Cat" pretty often in large parties.  Was hooked on a website variation for a while.  Telestrations gives you everything you need to get going.  At first, the artist in me was frustrated with the whiteboard and marker you're provided, but then I realized it really helps the game in a lot of ways.  It levels the playing field as pretty much everyone is limited to stick figures, and no one can spend too long with details.  I've played this game at a few family gatherings and I don't think I've ever heard my whole family laugh so hard together.

RATING: 9
This party game is great, I have started bringing it almost every week to my parents house, and they absolutely love it. Most of us are not terribly great at drawing (besides my husband, show off :-D), but that is the best part of the game. A keeper for sure, will probably need to replace the pens fairly soon already tho. Pens ran out after about 20 plays, can't play till I buy more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Normally you would expect buying a mass-market version of a parlor game would make the components better and generally improve the game.

In this case the component quality improves but the game suffers for it. The whiteboard booklets are a fun idea, and work well, but they reduce the number of players it can support. Since the game is drastically better with more people this is a big drawback.

The biggest nail in the coffin is the provided cards that decide what your starting word is. If the prompts were clever it might be beneficial but the prompts are bland and lead to the majority of peoples telestration booklets being filled with the same word every turn. (Saxophone, Basketball, Castle)

This game was sullied for me almost straight out of the box. I bought the game as a night time treat for my group of friends out for a weekend of camping under the stars with a few cheeky glasses of wine. I'd read the reviews and it sounded like the right game for the right crowd on the right night... But... 

Under no circumstance play this game (or any game for that matter) with a kids entertainer / magician! 

Almost immediately the restrictions of organised fun was imposed on the group. The next two hours were hell, a group too nice to tell a socially inept idiot to leave the group and a socially inept idiot too self involved to see the car crash situation he had orchestrated. 

So I can't play this game now, nothing to do with the game but the scars always seem to be too fresh - it's already been a year (2015)!

Party games are party games, and when you get right down to it, the scores don't matter.  Games like Catchphrase and Scattergories work better with scoring mechanisms, but others, like Balderdash, are more about the experience.  Telestrations is like that, as well.  In fact, the only times I've played the game have been without any scoring at all, since the experience, the socializing, and the laughing is all that it's about.  My only gripe is that short phrases would be better than words, and that this game could easily be played as a public domain game.  Still, for flat-out fun, not a whole lot beats this experience.

RATING: 7
Most people should have a blast with it. Folks who can't draw may have concerns but they (ahem... we...) often bring about much of the hilarity. To be honest, the most boring thing to happen is for the word to be super easy and score right around the circle with ordinary/easy images.

A great party game as long as folks are willing to be a bit silly.

Fun party game, though it does run too long relative to other games of this ilk.  Flipping through afterward is hilarious.

But it's a falling star for me. I don't like the scoring, as the same things happen every game: original word/art is completely missed, and the guess/new art devolves to something easy (which is why it was guessed). So the downstream people all get points for something dumb and unearned.

Hilarious and a lot of fun. One of those games where if you keep score, you're playing it wrong. People ask why buy this when you can just get pen and paper and play on your own. Well I am not creative enough to think of as many things to draw that are included in this game. A lot of their suggestions are well balanced words that are fun to draw and yet not always blatantly obvious to the next person. The dry erase boards are great too, I just wish there was a way to add to them to allow more players. I am really kicking myself for not getting the 12 player party pack. The only real down sides are the markers and the erasers. Markers ran out of ink very fast and are a bit too thick to draw on these boards. And the erasers shed more than a dog, and get flimsy fast. A new pack of fine tip markers and a paper towel allow the fun to continue, but that keeps it from being a 9 or 10.

This party game is just great fun! Everyone has their own draw pad and picks a word for the person on their left to draw. That person draws, then hands his drawing to the person on his left, who has to guess what it is. Players alternate drawing and guessing like this until the draw pad comes back to its original owner, at which point you may end up with something completely different. Guaranteed laughs for the entire group! I would only recommend it with 8 people though, which is the maximum player count. 6 players would also work, I guess, but you're essentially removing an entire round of guessing.

I should have trusted the geeks recommendation on this one. Quite often we have large groups together for boardgames so we are always looking for the next party game. We dismissed this game as a knockoff variant of pictionary. WRONG! A friend brought a sealed copy over and it was an instant hit. Our group has NEVER been so loud with guffawing laughter so that is why I give it a 10. We were playing the 12 person game and later put two 12-person games together and ran 20 people and it worked great (We just don't make a complete cycle and stop at the last page of the booklets). Very engaging, no early play elimination, simultaneous play, experienced and non gamers just dive in and tear it up. My only slight concern would be replay value after people get used to how the game works, the drawing styles of each other, and using shortcut tricks to easily convey meaning. But that won't stop me from adding this to the party game go bag.

A great take on the classic telephone game where you have to draw instead of just whisper into someone's ear. It's a blast to play with your family during a holiday, but prolonged games of it can start to wear on your nerves as the same patterns start to repeat themselves.

Had the funniest (which of course was NOT politically correct at ALL) tonight: "drop" turned into "mother egg" (?) and then into "miscarriage" (at which point I drew a stick figure woman who was sad that her stick figure baby was dead) and somehow turned into "abortion" (which I KNOW isn't funny).  Quite the progression/regression.

RATING: 7
Amusing when the game takes a twisted turn (like when "diploma" becomes something heinously unexpected like "murderer"), but fairly innocuous otherwise.

As an aside, I don't see the point in keeping score in games like this.  I guess it wouldn't technically be a game without the hint of competition, but really - why?

Original rating with an all-adult group of six players: 6.

Update:

With eight players, a healthy mixture of kids and adults, and no scorekeeping, the game rates an easy 8. In this setting, you can expect the entire group to laugh until teary-eyed - and possibly multiple times.

Kids are a necessity because they make guesses that adults would never make.  Hence my having to draw "rock contest" and "sports explosion" in my last game.

As far as my favorite Telestrations memories go, I'll never forget when my "halftime show" became someone else's "eulogy".  And then there are the flaming eyes.  Ah, the flaming eyes.

When it hits on all cylinders, Telestrations is my favorite party game.

I love this game but I don't love having to clean all the pages of 8 sketch books after gaming. Cos people tend to didn't clean well and leave smudges here and there which will be difficult to remove after a long time so I gotta clean them to preserve my Telestrations.

Having said that, Telestrations is one of the best party game if u are looking for tonnes of laughter. All of us always laugh ourselves silly until our eyes were tearing and our tummy hurt! Rocky Mountains -> Forest -> Lost little lamb -> Baa Baa Black Sheep. Seriously, u should grab a copy and start playing if u haven't! No regrets!

Oh man, was this game fun. Way funnier than I'd expected it to be. The six of us were laughing our asses of, bursting in uncontrolled laughter at some of the drawings and guesses of each other.
Update: Played a couple of times past weeks during the holiday with my family and they enjoyed it more than I could ever hope they would. The sign of a great game. Points of annoyance: the timer gets stuck, so I have to purchase a new one; many words that are too easy (lollipop) or too difficult (San Diego); the box could've been smaller.
Update 2: The markers are already dry; I have to buy new ones. The game should actually have come with an electronic timer that goes off when it reaches 0:00, because everyone is busy drawing, so no-one watches the sand timer. It also surprises me how often words come up repeatedly. I thought there'd be more than enough cards to seldomly see the same word twice, but that's not the case. I've seen dozens of words twice or even thrice already... Expansion, please!

Hate pictionary but I like telephone.  The combination turned out to be quite a riot.  I understand most of the fun is in people's inability to draw, so competent artist seem to ruin the game (not to mention embarrassing others at the same time), as well as those that purposely sabotage their guesses with something outrageous.  I'm just not sure funny answers for the sake of being funny is actually hilarious.  The markers that came with the game is pretty bad.

A "pack of gum" game. Fun tile placement. Has cute strategy and is quick and I'd actually carry around and play. And the game fits the format. Very nice! Not sure about long term replayability, but would be good for a few plays

Out of the Pack o’ Game series, this is the one where the size of the cards bothers me the least. It has nice tactics and it is really well designed. Not even my favorite of the series and that says a lot for a system I thought I would hate and I was wrong. Pack o’ Game is way more than just a gimmick.

2p this just doesn't seem to work. In my plays, the two players converged on the same (or nearly the same) colors and because it's very difficult for your move to expand two colors at once, there's very little mystery or tactical appeal. I could easily believe it's better with 4 or 5. But I could also believe it's not.

HUE is a pretty fun little game.  I like how players are able to cover up a square on each turn in order to help themselves or hinder their opponents.  The poison each player can play also adds an interesting element and can be used to spoil an entire run of colors if used at the right moment.  For what it is, HUE comes in handy for a quick and fun game that plays with up to five.

I was surprised to find that this is my favorite of the 5 Pack-O-Games titles that I've tried so far. I usually don't care for tile-laying games, but I was pleased by how quickly this plays, and how wrenching the decisions can be. I always enjoy games in which you have to juggle hurting your opponents and helping yourself. My favorite part of the game is deciding which card to hold back for scoring, which is a great idea.

I like HUE. It's easy to grok, but the landscape changes rapidly. You can pursue a strategy, but it's such a brief game that you might have to change it -- and you can, by picking a new scoring card. I love that mechanic.

Neat mind-bender of a game. I actually wasn't expecting much from this, but I think that this is my favorite game from the first wave of Pack-o-Game. This is a tile-laying game where you are trying to make large areas of colors, and the last card left in your hand determines how you score. It's quite a bit deeper than that, and I would encourage anyone who likes interesting abstracts should check this one out.

A game I have wanted to play since I saw it. I love colors and I love tiny games! Its hand in hand. It is a nice filler of a game and Is strictly abstract. Very enjoyable and I will have to pick up a copy. I just worry it will get lost it is so small!

OK card placement game about forming colored regions and choosing which 3 of the 5 colors will score points for you. We played with 5 and 4 players, which felt a bit too chaotic for my taste; I can imagine it being better with fewer, but don't know.

Wow, this one was really good. Again, awesome form factor. And the game makes great use of the shape of the cards!

The cards are divided into 3 squares (top, middle, bottom of card). Each is either a solid color, or 3 bands of colors (still 3 colors, spread across all 3 squares each). Players each get a hand of 5 cards which includes:
- 4 random cards
- 1 card with 3 squares, the middle one "poison"
Three (of 5) starting cards are set up on the table.

On your turn, play one card such that at lease one square is orthogonally adjacent to one already on the table. You MAY cover a single square of a tile already on the table. After 4 rounds, calculate the value of each color = sum or rectangles (3/square) of that color in the largest contiguous area on the table. However, ignore any areas where the color has been poisoned. Players score VP based on their last (5th) card, still in hand: the center color scores double value. Most VP wins (tiebreaker = turn order).

This is a very clever game! Such simple rules, yet you still have a lot to think about. Which colors to build up? Which will end up being poisoned? Which will the various players be doubling? You can make tentative plans about which card to hold when you start, but change your plans as you see the board develop. Very cool!

Players have a hand of cards each with 3 differently colored lines on them. They take turns playing these cards in such a way as to connect same colored lines. The more area of a color the more points they are worth. Players will score colors based on the last card in their hand. A fast puzzle-style filler.

Quick tile placement pattern builder. Comes in a bic lighter sized box full of crazy color strips like you would find at the hardware store. Pick the largest created contiguous color areas for the win. Use your starting strip to poison an area.

Much more strategic and solid than you would think.
My only problem with this is that you have to be very careful with laying down the cards, it is so easy to mess up other cards. Oh, and the awkward shuffling.

The choices are more interesting than I expected, but the side-effect is that you will face AP. 10 minutes? Only if players are willing to slap down the cards without worrying about scoring. Still, it's solid!

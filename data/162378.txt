Ok for a family holiday get together with non-gaming relatives, but the theme means it probably won't come out much more than that. On top of which, it's one of those Fluxx versions with no creepers, which just takes a lot of the zing out of the game to me.

11/17/15: Played this around this time last year with Katie and Lisa when the Furbys were in town for the light parade. Really pretty bad. The game works, but since it's the "family" version (no creepers) it's quite boring. Only reason to play this is for the theme, and I'm not even sure that's worth it.

Very nice version of Fluxx full of holiday cheer. The inclusion of surprise cards and some very interesting new rules make it solid fun even if you already have other versions.

worth it and adding the fruitcake Creeper was a fun thing since it's the only creeper but can count as a keeper for two of the goals

Fluxx is ok and this is pulled out around important holidays. It's my daughter's favorite Fluxx.

It's Fluxx with a holiday theme.  There should have been more coverage between halloween and christmas, but still, it's something to break out at the holidays that may appeal to people as a light card game.

This variant on the standard Fluxx model (without Creepers) is pretty enjoyable and the perfect game to play with the family on those lazy post-lunch holiday afternoons when you don't have the energy for anything.  Like most Fluxx variants, it's easy to learn and fun to play without any big barrier to entry.  

The main drawback, if you can call it that, is that you probably aren't going to want to play this outside of November and December, but that's okay.  The design is good, the theme is on point, and it's a fast game with Fluxx's usual high replay value.

It was fine. It isn't in the same ballpark as most of the recent fluxx variants/versions.

Theme is the worst, but it has a couple of fun and powerful cards that are missing from other versions.

Holiday fluxx is a good filler game that is constantly changing throughout the game.  The only downside is the compiling rules that can really confuse those AP prone people that don't like a little chaos. Great theme!

The sheer amount of rules that can pile up can get irritating after a while. Kids don't like this one too much, as I have heard this game described as "boring" by them. Adults may appreciate this more.

Bought this for $2 on clearance and didn't think much of it. We've played it a few times and my daughter enjoyed it. Enough randomness that she has a chance to beat her dad. Fun and cheap, already got our money's worth and it can linger in the closet for a bit.

Why do people hate Fluxx? Chill, everybody; go where the cards say ya gotta go. Chaos is good sometimes.

I pleasantly enjoyed this card game.  Fluxx receives a bunch of bad feedback, but I thought it was a fun experience.  My boys enjoyed the ever changing rules and quick pace.  I loved the holiday theme.  I'm fine with this being my only Fluxx game, though if I found the Monty Python version on clearance, I would pick it up.

RATING: 6
This is an amusing enough party game, with simple rules and a good premise. The key problem with the game is that it highlights individual players' lack of general knowledge in quite a humiliating way. Much of the laughter comes from watching your opponent or team-mate describing something terribly inaccurately, or misunderstanding the word they are forced to describe. i.e. it is a game about laughing at people's ignorance. This is fine in a close-knit group comfortable enough with each other to enjoy a bit of gentle banter, but could be awkward in a more sensitive setting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Fun at a light-hearted gathering of friends.  Not at all deep, but very replayable.  Worth owning the extra cards, but I've since moved on to Cranium as a better game.

RATING: 1
Like a lot of party games, it can be as fun as the people you play it with. Like all trivia games, its too culturally specific and exclusionary. All that aside, it can be fun, but is fundamentally broken by the all-play round, which is the cruellest thing ever. If you happen to land on this space, anyone can guess your team's clue, and you have unlimited time so it can drag out, and then if any other team gets it right, it zips to their turn, skipping anyone in between. Its just insulting. Play Say Anything, Telestrations or above all Dixit instead.

Does largely rely on people knowing the definitions of words or the names of people and places, but if that doesn't alienate you or other players at the table then its a great party game. Creates a fun, vibrant atmosphere and healthy competition as people are blurting out information in a time-pressured environment. I just wish there were more cards - even including the expansion pack!

RATING: 9
Easily my most-played party game. 

Needs some house rules to really shine: 
- Forget the spinner.
- Allow people to look at two cards at a time and pick the one they want to describe.  (Three cards at a time for ESL.)  When they've described one successfully, they take another into their hand.
- Double-point catch-up after one team's made it across the finish to keep it interesting.

Even then, Articulate does suffer from some problems.  The version published here in Australia has a number of obscure UK clues, especially strange little towns and counties, and the People category is often ridiculous.  But it's still a big winner in my book.

Eventually, you'll need more cards.  The Extra Pack No. 1 and self-contained Articulate Your Life are both good options.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Try to get your partner to say as many words from a particular category written on the cards within the thirty second time limit, you may only pass once. Move your team pawn forward a number of spaces on the board equal to the number of words you got correct. If you land on an Orange or Red space, spin the spinner for a chance to move yourself 2 or 3 spaces forward, or move an opponent piece 2 or 3 spaces back. If you land on a spade space, try to get you team mate to say the word on the card before any other team can say it. Whoever answers correctly gets a turn immediately.
Categories include Person, World, Object, Action, Nature and Random. First team to make it around the board and successfully answer a spade category (chosen from any of the above) wins the game.

RATING: 9
Perfect post dinner-party with non-gamers.  Just pass out some sheets of paper, have people rip them into tickets and write a word on each, fold into a hat.  Done.  It's enjoyable that after the shared dinner party conversation, some odd words will be duplicated.

I've recently played it with the published components and cards.  They're much less fun, and they look crappy.  Just let your guests write the words.  If you're still having a blast after you've all hat a turn, turn it into a game of The Hat Game / Celebrities / Monikers.

RATING: 5
The only-one-pass-allowed rule can cause problems if you and/or your partner simply do not know a word (e.g. if you or they have not heard of "Bhopal" then getting them to say it is essentially impossible).

The fact that the category for your next turn's questions depends on where you land also makes it quite gamey. If you don't have long left, and you are currently due to end on an easy category, you may choose not to answer more questions to avoid ending up on the next, easier category.

All things considered, I'd much rather play Taboo.

RATING: 7
Always alot of fun whenever we get this one out, with gamers/non-gamers alike. The "spade" rounds where everyone can guess are probably the most interesting idea in the game.

That said, objectively it is not a well designed game:
- Imbalanced with the "Person" and "World" category always having some very confusing and obscure references, mixed with really easy ones
- Pointless spinner whose only consequence is to reduce players time on "Action" and "Random" categories, or screw other players onto a harder category.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Basically a much more difficult version of the $25,000 Pyramid main game. Every time I've played it, it's been surprisingly fun. A lot depends on the categories—"Object" is always a cinch, "World" is almost always impossible. A great, intense, fast-paced party game.

[size=12][b]Top 300 or higher board games list[/b][/size]

[size=12][b]Why I like Articulate:[/b][/size]
+ I like trying to guess words / give clues for words in a short amount of time, especially if you have team versus team style battles. 
+ There is decent player involvement.
+ There is decent replayability.
+ The game is easy to teach
+ The game is short enough
+ There are decisions required to win the game

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Articulate:[/b][/size]
- Some of the things that you are supposed to guess are so obscure that a team might have no chance of a correct guess. You can, fortunately, skip one card so this issue is at least partially mitigated.
- There are better games that I'd rather play with a group of people.

Bah humbug.  The game is definitely fun, my non-gamers friends enjoy it (they do not know better) and movement around the board (until the end) is better than some games in its genre.  But the end conditions stick in the throat.  Basically the team that were scoring high in each round and a distance ahead could not get the winning answer.  Therefore my team who included a couple caught up eventually and got an 'in-joke' clue.  Basically, if I win a game i think it is broken.  Bah humbug.  It was fun though if I am forced to admit it.

Smashing party game if you enjoy trivia/talky games. Best played in as few teams as you can to keep the speed up and keep folk involved and engaged. Our copy is probably our most battered boardgame due to many a raucous party.

Pro tip: if you're all grown ups leave off the spinner and ignore that 'your team/the other team steps forward/back' mechanic: all it does is introduce randomness and you really don't need it. Also ignore the 'maximum five cards' rule. On that rare occasion when you get through more you will feel like gods and you will want the reward of those extra spaces.

Played this after a day of gaming where some non gamers joined in (and we had already played 3 games of Dixit).  I found the different categories are quite unbalanced, with a huge possibility of runaway leaders (as happened in our game).

While it was possible to become proficient with the mechanism for explaining the text of cards quickly, I didn't enjoy the gameplay.  I think I'd actively try an avoid playing this game in future.

Take Pictionary, remove the drawing element, replace with verbal description. Then add a much faster pace and more exciting rounds, along with much more clever gameplay overall.

The artists in the group no longer have an advantage, everyone is now on the same level. Downtime while waiting for a turn is substantially decreased, all-plays are more common, and turns come much faster. The game length is substantially decreased and thus several games are usually played, whereas we have historically ever played one long-winded game of Pictionary: often moving so slow we wished it would end sooner.

If you like Pictionary, get this. It is, without a doubt, better than Pictionary in every way.

+1 light fun party game - easy to learn, easy to set up, short playtime. 
+1 varying group sizes are enjoyable, as watching the other teams can be as fun as playing. 
+1 skill elements and social interaction add to enjoyment
+1 lots of cards, lots of replay-ability 


-1 depends on trivia/pop culture knowledge - very group dependent and can put off a lot of people. 
-1 included electronic timer is not the best quality (leading to us having to wait for the timer to run down before we can re-start a round...an egg timer or sand timer would work better) 
-1 fast, high-pressure pacing of the game is very polarizing, and some players hate it. 
-1 a timed description game - not really anything novel about it.

A good combination of trivia and description-without-naming. The difficulty of the different words varies wildly, possibly just due to the age or assumed location (UK) of the game.

As with many such games, enjoyment depends on the group - need to be on the same wavelength, approximately equal at trivia, approximately equal at quick thinking, and enjoy being social.

We don't think the spinner adds anything, and ignore it.

RATING: 5
Above average word / trivia / party game, which eschews a die in favour of moving a number of spaces equal to the questions answered in a turn. Turns are limited by a timer. The downsides are low production values, an ambiguous manual, and a minimum of six players for best results (it's a team-based game).

Great party game, everything can be described in a totally different way depending on both the person doing the description and the person they're describing to.

Really good fun partygame. Hugely entertaining to get big chains and laugh when the other teams minds go blank. Dispose of the stupid spinner rule though.

Good party game for couples and families where you know your teammates well. However, even more fun after a lot of wine and switching the partners around.

(Several pre-Geek plays with family)

"Describe without using the word game", in a Taboo style, to guess as many as you can each turn against the clock.  The categories are a little bit different, but can bring your turn to a halt if you're stuck with a 'World' or 'Person' one that you just have no idea where or who it is.  (Or perhaps me and my family's grasp of geography and celebrity is lacking *grin*).

Needs some careful balancing of teams - couples on the same wavelength especially can turn it into a walk-over.

Has caused a number of memorable and amusing descriptions, even without an excess of alcohol.

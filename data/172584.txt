RATING: 8.8
After our third complete play, I can say that it is very good boardgame and that I am looking forward to play more. 

The theme is nice and during the different eras you achieve to be involved in the development of your family. 

The mechanic is elegant and everything works great, in addition the interaction is great through the wars in the map, the competition for the children and the marriages tactic.

It is a clear Essen 2015 "must have", and I am very happy of having it.

I find Among Nobles quite an engaging game.  That is partly due to its big deck of real European nobility, with the characters of those nobles nicely differentiated in terms of the actions they can take and special abilities.  It is also quite pleasing to build up a dynasty, marry off daughters and conquer European territories.  I like the way that actions work, with most characters offering the choice of four different rows of them and married couples acting in unison, potentially to achieve more.  The limitation on the children of a couple sharing a trait with a parent (so a couple who were both pious would only produce pious offspring) is the only element that strikes me as unrealistic, but I can see its value in game terms.

So, lots of good things, but also some doubts.  Among Nobles bucks the trend of great piles of mechanisms topped with point salads.  It is lean and straightforward, perhaps a little too straightforward.  Added to that, there will be times when your decision space can seem cramped.  Need a son in one of two colours, who brings an army cube?  Pick him.  Need some money?  Do this action.  Enough money, want prestige points?  Do that.

Production quality is fine, the useless insert that the rules can't sit flat on aside.  It's a handsome game, with the noble cards particularly appealing.  The rules are a little repetitive in parts, while in other parts some further explanation or an example would have been helpful.

Rating set to 8. My initial enthousiasm gave it a 9, but that was mainly for loving the theme. The game is a bit long for what it is. It can also be quite unforgiving when you make a mistake along the way.

After rating some other games set the score 1 lower again. Only play this game with 4 players. With 3 players the game is much more boring due to the green cards missing. With 5 players the options for the 5th player in turn order feel often restricted. This happens sometimes with 4 players, but is even more prevalent with 5. And no extra cards are used in a 5 player game which limit options even more.

RATING: N/A
Just read the rules... basically, it's a card game with an area control element where control gives you cash.  Cash is used to get more control and get married/have sons.  The neat aspect is the genealogical aspect of it.  

I'm not blown away by it, but I'm interested enough to be curious what the price is.

RATING: 7
A very interesting game that takes action-based cardplay and layers on a theme of actual historical nobles.  Some of the cards seem much more powerful than others, but most players all have the opportunity to get some of the powerful cards, if they play carefully and leave options open for later opportunities.

Keeping options open means making sure that you maintain a group of nobles that produce cash, children, and weddings.  Later in the game, nobles that produce piety (victory points) became more valuable.  There is an abstract military aspect that is simple, yet effective, in portraying the power struggles in the different countries and provinces and these struggles focus in the most lucrative provinces.

Strategic card game in which players try to build a performant family tree on the basis of a set of characters, each with their own abilities. There is a worker placement element in the game, as each turn three characters or couples can be activated. There are a lot of different actions and combinations of actions among which to choose from once the family grows successfully. There are also some battlegrounds on which the players can compete for points and money.
Although all characters are historical men and women, there is no element of historical simulation, as each character can become the son or daughter of any couple of characters.
A funny element in the game is that women can prolong their lifetime by marrying a man which could be their son or even grandson. This also rejuvenates them, as they have no difficulties producing offspring. The opposite is also true. A young woman who marries an old man dies together with her husband, as if he were an Egyptian pharao.

I've played only 5-player game and it was mostly a random and chaotic experience.  To whom (and if at all) you can give birth (or marry) was uncontrollable.  The family tree was developing itself with limited impact of the 'owning' player.  Icons (abilities) on family members interlocked too little, too late and generally in an unsatisfying way.

Besides, no narrative formed, generations of family were arriving, being activated and departing purely mechanically.

Maybe there is some potential in the mechanics and the game itself.  If so, it should expose itself in 3- or 4-player mode but for now I'm not tempted to find out.

Not a bad game but I feel it's underdeveloped.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Among Nobles is a very good design. It's a euro with engine building, area control and clever card play.

Somehow it reminds me of Deus, but it is better. In this game you always have something meaningful to do (unless you really play badly and build a family tree that runs out of sons...).

The balance between individual play and social interaction is also very fine. You can lead the game, but not excessively as the group will most likely ensure some balancing and thus catch up. Bash-the-leader is however not a big problem either, as this might be very costly for those that do so.

I really hope that this game comes in broader distribution as it is among the best modern euro-games out there.

2015-10-13 - 8 - Seriously looking, but often quite funny card game, which has quite a lot of depth at the same time. There is very unique mechanism of having three generations of nobles, who get married, have children and eventually die. A lot of mechanisms really have sense in terms of theme and that is something always important to me in games. And there is always a funny part when someone is getting married and others are presenting him their daughters.

2015-11-22 - It's holding strong even after 3players game! But I can see it will be better with more. I really like this game. It's also really original to me.

2016-11-28 - 8->7 - It didn't have luck to hit the table.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I like the concept but the execution and the ruleset failed a bit. I'm not sure how balanced the game is - it does require player interaction to create some balance and if you are low on money with no way to get more, you are hosed. To be fair, the rules warn you of this but you can run into bad luck in the drawing of the lineage cards and such where you have no noble capable of earning you money and if you are not doing well on the province board, you are toast. That was me. :-) 

Also, be aware that while likely historically accurate in the depiction of men and women, the rule set pulls no punches in explaining how the game works and is very much male oriented with women primarily useful for childbearing with a few exceptions. That turned off a couple gamers from the start who thought afterwards that the game was interesting but they wished for a different theme.

I thought I would like this game, but yesterday I had possibly the worst gaming experience of my life. 

Basically, what happened to me in a 5p game was that I got in a situation where in the beginning, 3 turns in a row I was not able to get a son or daugther. This spiraled my game out of control and meant that during most of the game, I had only 1 noble pair to take my actions from. One third of the game, I just took 1-2 coins (my guy had an extra coin if he was reactivated), and the last 3rd I just took 1-2 military actions with Napoleon. During the last 3rd of the game I literally only played with one character (no spouse), because I was unlucky enough that getting married only became possible so late that it would no longer help me. Most of my turns took less than 5 seconds to make, and while other people enjoyed the game, I became more and more disinterested, simply because I knew I would not be able to get any of the new nobles being laid out in the tableau. It was a very long 2½ hour session to just sit there and not be able to do anything. In the end, I did something I have never done in a board game before: I told the other players what I would do with the rest of my turns, and quit.

While I expect that my situation is very unlikely to happen again, I would argue that a game where this can happen is broken mechanically. 

I giving it a 2 solely because the other players were, apart from the occational sad look towards my seat, enjoying the game.

Among Nobles sieht, mit seinen historischen Persönlichkeiten, in der Optik der jeweiligen Epoche, unglaublich dröge aus. Zumindest mich persönlich hat die gesamte Aufmachung nicht wirklich angesprochen. Nach dem ersten Spiel zeigte sich dann aber, was für ein überaus interessantes und komplexes Spiel sich dahinter versteckt. Im Prinzip beginnt jeder Spiel mit einem historischen Ehepaar. Nun kann man unterschiedliche Aktionen dieser beiden Personen nutzen. Ziel ist es immer, Karten aus der zentralen Auslage zu erhalten bzw. zu gebären. Genau, denn aus dem "Start"-Ehepaar entstehen Töchter und Söhne. Söhne sichern den Fortbestand der Dynastie und Töchter werden an Anwerber der anderen Spieler verkauft. Zusätzlich versucht man noch seinen territorialen Einfluss zu sichern. Amon Nobles ist ein komplexes Spiel, die Regeln in der Anleitung sind nicht immer ganz eindeutig und trotzdem macht es riesigen Spaß, besonders wegen dem unverbrauchten Setting und der ungewöhnlichen Mechanik.

Interesting theme and unique mechanics. Although the theme is not unique anymore (since Legacy: Duke the..) this game applies it even better, since there are no nameless characters in the game and your family´s sons marry daughters from other families. Which means when a man in your family marries, other players have to offer unmarried female caracters from their tableau and you choose one of them to join your family (physically move the card into your tableau). The action selection offers quite interesting choices throughout the game and most characters have special abilities. Only wish I have at the moment is that there were a bit more cards to prepare the deck from (so that the deck is same size, but characters are variable from game to game).

RATING: N/A
I'm surprised this doesn't score a lot higher in BGG (reminder to self - must get around to rating games on BGG). Noble patriarchs (taken from late Medieval European history) take brides and have offspring (more historical figures) in order to increase the family's wealth and prestige. There is a very workable mechanism to represent genetics. The cards are attractive and the game has much charm - tho' the game's military element seems to be quite marginal, to the point where I wonder if a player could win despite completely ignoring that option.

I like games in which you create a family tree, like in Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy, so I had some high hopes for this one. While it is fun to play, it takes a bit too long for what it is. If you can create a couple that gives you 3 or even 4 points, you just activate it as much as possible, so the game is playing a bit itself at that point. It just takes a bit too long for what it is. Otherwise a fine game.

Solid game with a neat thematic rule system of nobility marriages, offspring and deaths. There's also a quasi-secondary area control mechanic where the noble houses will war for extra gold or victory points. The game works well, even though it almost drags on a little, but not quite. Even though it is not multiplayer solitaire, it appears to be devoid of both the "gang up on the leader" and the "running away leader" problems.

There is an interesting mechanic here where you pair characters to create spaces for an action selection that is really interesting. The way in which it is implemented is ... unfortunate. The decision to simulate in detail an idealised, and that is an awkward word here, the gender politics of the late medieval/early modern Europe was questionable at best. I'm thinking of writing a longer post as the why of why this bothers me is interesting.

2015: 8. Based on a few solo plays of 3 and 4 players.  Lots of interesting decisions going on here!  I can see the game getting better with repeated plays, so that everybody starts to understand how the cards interact and will beginning to plan on having specific sons and daughters that further their strategies.  4p appeared to be better than 3p, but need to play with real people to know for sure.

2016: 8. Played at least one 3p game so far and really enjoyed it!  The timing of the cards as they come out of the deck and disruption from other player actions makes it more tactical than strategic I think, but I need more plays.  Really like the mechanics!

This is a good game, nicely produced at a decent price, and the length is just right too. With just three generations of European nobility to breed, marry and die off you have to keep your wits about you; with dynastic plans constantly foiled by other players getting the princes or princesses you had your eye on you have to allow re-thinking time, but everyone is constantly involved and there are sometimes humorous sub-games to be played matching or mis-matching the historical characters. I can see this getting regular play in our evening sessions despite the vast amount of stiff competition.

tl;dr: good but slightly repetitive

A couple of years ago games about generations where very novel. These days we see more of them and so far most of them have been quite solid. And so is this one.
The system where certain traits are inherited from parents is quite nifty and leads to interesting choices.
The fact that you can choose the gender and traits (from the available cards) does make the game slightly unthematic, but if it was random, the game would probably be too random as well. It didn't bother me.
My biggest gripe with the game was that towards the end we all had a feeling of 'ok, lets do yet another round'. I guess making the game shorter might make certain strategies harder to pull off, but it did feel like it repeated just too long.

Initial rating: 6.7/10
BGG scale: 6/10

RATING: 3
Among Nobles felt like a long series of particularly uninteresting actions where it was entirely possible to get into a long death spiral if a) you ran out of money or b) you had married into the wrong colour(s). We got to a point towards the end where one player was chaining actions to activate multiple cards and another player was taking 1 piety point as each of his three actions. It all felt incredibly dry and uninvolving, though oddly the other three players (including the one who'd been in a long death spiral) proclaimed they'd enjoyed it.

Not something I want to play again.

RATING: 7
Trying to keep track of what others may do on their turn to maximize your own actions can be a bit exhausting. It somehow bothered me that between player order and in what order cards come to display you can luck out and have poor choices or even no kids at all. Also with no options you are playing on autopilot and that's boring.

Provisional rating, one incomplete play at Spiel. Fun and thematic game of building a tableau of cards representing nobles having a variety of optional powers - though we saw only a few of the cards, it was clear there could be some powerful combos.  The marriage and breeding mechanisms seemed innovative (ok, Familienbande, Legacy) and were interesting, though the military conflict subsystem (majority control of money/VP/etc production) much less so.  I couldn't help noticing how these highlighted some unpleasant attitudes of the time and milieu - boy children receive education but girls do not, males represent the dynastic future but females are traded away, a man and woman marry for the good of the family.

I did criticise the set-up of this game, and stand by that, although I still enjoy the theme, and you know me, I like a good theme! I understand that Kath Collman, Endof Supercycle and Mark Evans played it with a straight first, second and third choice in a dice determined order. I'd endorse this option as it does not allow the fate of having two paired nobles with no progeny to select due to the cards drawn for selection which can be a pain if you choose last! This happened too often on my first play and was very frustrating. Like with all games, downtime can turn people off, and any delay (and I've been guilty of a few myself), does detract from enjoyment. I think the key to making the game work is ensuring there is enough progeny options in the first round, even if done artificially, and acquiring gold and piety in the territories the armies attempt to occupy. This was the strategy Mark Evans went with when I played, and as he had not played before, he managed to win doing this. I am sure there are other strategies once the range of cards is more widely known.

Interesting and well executed concept, but the 5-player game we played was well, too short.

Stil it was a decent experience, although I suspect it is much better with four players

Mechanically this is totally sound. Some clever elements and plenty going on to keep players involved. As somebody who can't get enough 'trading in the Mediterranean' or subsistence farming I was surprised that I did find the game very dry. Good design, very solid game but didn't particularly excite me. Would give it another try to see if I'm missing something.

Build your family of nobles through three generations. Some abstracted military operations are the main player interaction.

Barely anything interesting happens, plays way too long for such lack of variety, bordering on completely automated.

I like this new version, the kids in the family dig the hats and hairdues. I have lots of good memories playing this with my whole family when we have reunions.  Its a good simple game with enough elements to keep everyone interested and we can play with the grandparents all the way to the young kids.

RATING: 8
The best edition from the million version of Cranium and always a joy to play.

However, the cards are starting to reflect the era from which it was produced and so sometimes players won't have any idea what they're trying to draw/impersonate/sculpt. While it's clearly a problem endemic to most trivia games, asking a teenager/20-something to hum or whistle "She Drives Me Crazy" by the Fine Young Cannibals might give a blank stare in response.

I really can't stand this game.  I'll laugh and enjoy myself to some extent while it's going on, but deep down inside, I'm full of pure loathing.  I think that this game, like most games of its ilk, would be much better if it were much shorter.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Besides a different board and cooler pieces to move around the board, only real difference in this version is the addition of a puppet game (for green cards) where you can only move your team mate and your team has to guess the answer from the puppet's actions.

Couldn't use the clay as it dried out.  Same problem as original game.  We just skipped any sculpting cards that came up.

An ok party game if everyone needs to be playing at once.

The customizable movers, attractive board, and fun new activities would make this the best version of Cranium yet.

But...

The Star Performer cards can be a serious drag, which is really too bad, because they made for some of the most memorable moments in previous Cranium sets.  Unlike past editions of Cranium, the SP cards have a tendency to focus heavily on recent figures in pop culture, severely hampering the enjoyment of players over 25 years of age.  If you're not well-versed in 2000's-era pop culture, you're better off with the original Cranium.

Party game bought because I thought it would be a good game to bring out during our holiday gatherings with family.  The great thing is that it can be played in teams so every one can be involved.

This adds more questions and different characters to the original Cranium which you can customize with accessories that are included in the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun and stylish amalgamation of just about every party game you've ever heard of: Pictionary, Charades, Name That Tune, etc.  Sucks when the clay goes dry, though, as the clay modeling is one of the better parts.

RATING: 6
Cranium WOW is probably the best version of Cranium. Nine years after the original version, they seem to have taken the lessons about what made things fun about the original and refined them. Even the playing pieces are a lot of fun. (They are little heads that you can add different hats and hair to, giving each piece its own personality. And there are lots of options.)

In this version, you select a player from your team to perform each activity. A player who is self-conscious about acting, for example, will never have to; they can draw or sculpt instead the next time one of those activities is selected. Getting the right answer allows you to roll and move, so you could be moving anywhere from 1 to 8 spaces. This randomness doesn't really reward the better team, but it does keep everyone involved to the very end. As such, it is much more a "fun and wacky" kind of party game rather than the more intellectual experience offered by something like, say, Trivial Pursuit. You will have to decide for yourself whether that's a positive or a negative, but it certainly succeeds at what it sets out to do.

This game is all about the group.  Large group of married extroverts = good game.  Smaller group of self-conscious singles = terrible game.

UPDATE:  Get [gameid=4424] instead.

UP-UPDATE:  After wearing out the base game and two booster boxes, we're back in the saddle with [gameid=33150].  We love it!

UP-UP-UPDATE:  We just looped all the cards in the WOW edition and the people I game with are sharp enough that they not only remember getting a certain card [i]years ago[/i] but they can also remember what someone did (or didn't do) [i]specifically[/i] to attempt to win that card for their team.  Sometimes I wish I gamed with dumb people... I know I'd win more.

Booster boxes, anyone?

Along with Trivial Pursuit, a game that shaped my childhood as it was regularly played with my parents. Where Trivial Pursuit has disappeared, this has remained, and is still to this day a party favourite. With so many possibilities for hilarity, this game has become every bit a staple of Christmas day as turkey! The WOW version offers excellent customizable characters and a fresh new design.

Trivia games are not games, they are [url=http://www.human-memory.net/types_declarative.html]non-interactive skill[/url]  contests, played on an uneven field, which are fun for equally matched players/teams, but usually devolve into which team gets lobbed more softball questions in their weakest category, √† la Trival Pursuit.

Cranium had its time in the sun as the it-game for family parties. Today it feels a bit dated and unfocused because it's such a hodgepodge of genres in one box. If I am at a party and Cranium is there I will gladly take part but I will almost never suggest it.

I'm not a big fan of Cranium as my pop culture knowledge isn't usually good enough to pass the Star Performer Humdingers and Cameos (and some of the other categories).  Looking at the card and going, "Yeah, I have no idea what these songs are.  Sorry team!" just isn't any fun.

A good party game. Mostly gets rolled out around Christmas or Boxing Day. Friends and family are always happy to play the game. I have used it as a gateway game to get them enthused enough to play some of the other board games in my collection.

RATING: 6
Rather refreshing to play this game again. The variety of activities in Cranium makes for a fun experience whenever I play it. The Copycat and Star Performer decks remain my faves. But I'd still rather play Quelf than this. The new visual aspects thrown into the packages does very little for me.

This game is all about your gaming partners. They will make or break this game. You have to be willing to be silly and down right ridiculous in front of your gaming group. No shy players here. It is a light and fun game that always keeps our gaming group laughing.

This sort of game would be much better without the board, with each team playing a certain number of challenges.  As it is, the board only amplifies the significant level of luck already in the game thanks to the huge difficulty imbalance in the cards.

The party game with something for everyone: Featuring everything from charades, celebrity impersonations, and pictionary to trivia, puzzle-solving, and name-that-tune style mechanics, this game is sure to please even the grumpiest of gamers.

Basically just Cranium with a classier look and sillier figures.  Making your characters is very clever though, fun little side game in it's own for a chuckle.

There's nothing inherently wrong with party games, but I really, [i]really[/i] hate "guess what this thing is that I'm drawing / saying / doing" games. They're just frustrating no matter what side I'm on, and more than likely I don't get the reference even if I'm the presenter and have a card telling me what the answer is. Cranium is a mashup of several other games that I just flat out don't want to play.

Mediocre roll and move family game, with the addition of annoying tasks such as humming a tune or acting out expressions and phrases. Always seems to go on too long, so not really a fan. Player pieces and board look good though.

Decent party game - if only I didn't have ten thousand other party games that trump this one through the floor. Still a decent game to pull out if it is a couples thing.

Was fun when it came out and the successive bajillion (actual number) times I played it. Now its a big, black paperweight.

After 1 Play: This is really just Cranium with some funky new playing pieces--it adds nothing of consequence to the game.  With that in mind, here's my comment for Cranium:

It's a combination of party game mechanics you've most likely already played.  If you like those mechanics you'll probably find some enjoyment here.  I'd guess it's popular because there's a little something for everyone, but of course it will be few people's number one pick, because they'd rather play the game that features only their favorite mechanics.  My favorite is the senso-sketch, which is pictionary played blindfolded.

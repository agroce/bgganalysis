Inspired by Game of Thrones. Its a perfectly neat & functional game which probably works better with more players. Any game-buying addict will look in vain for anything new. Others and beginners may well think the same features are wonderful, so higher ratings = reasonable.
It may be best to assume there is little or no connection between a card's colour, its trigger, and its Action or non-action card text, which is esp. true of building cards, though of course a card's *title* may not quite follow this pattern, and thus confuse. Triggering, and actually using triggered card text, are two different things.

Council of Blackthorn has a lot of depth to it yet is easy to play.  The aspect that I enjoy the most is balancing the cost of playing one faction card to get the eventual benefit of another faction and the "building up" framework of the game.  The artwork and components are superb.

Very fun game.  Encourages boisterous tabletalk.  Easy to learn.  Do well, but not so well as to garner the attention of your fellow council members (other players) or they do their best to make you look treasonous in the eyes of the King.  The most treasonous player cannot win, as they get beheaded at the end of the game.

RATING: 5
Council of Blackthorn strikes me as a deeply ordinary game.  It works, but there is nothing original or intriguing about it.  Players are competing to move their markers up four influence tracks by playing matching-coloured cards.  Hit the front on a track and you gain income (vps), but are also vulnerable to receiving treason cards. Vps are also scored by building building cards.  Player character abilities spice things up a little.  Collect the most treason at game end and you have lost.  At least it plays reasonably fast.

Production quality is decent, the artwork is forgettable.

Gives a great feeling of being a fantasy kingdoms small council while the king is indisposed. You plot against each other gaining influence in the 4 factions (Noble, Merchant, Peasant and Military) while also being simple to play and easy to teach. 

My favourite mechanic is the treason cards, it makes you unsure of who is actually in the lead, as whoever ends up with the most treason at the end of the game is beheaded. When stealing influence from another player I have had to think carefully about who I stole it from as a player may have the most influence, but may also have the most treason disqualifying them from the win anyway.

This is a fantastic game! Each player can pick a unique character that allows them to choose their playing style, but they all balance out very well. It is also fun to see how everyone uses different strategies to earn points without drawing too much attention (and too many treason cards). Each time I play is different, which keeps the game fresh and entertaining! Highly recommend!

After one play, I really like this game. The game play is really simple, but it's very amusing seeing someone doing very well and just watching as treason is piled on. I'm a big fan of this game because it rewards you for being patient and punishes you for being greedy.

RATING: 9
Had the opportunity to play this twice so far.

It's very easy to learn and turns can go pretty quick.  Basic concept is you are part of the council and you are maneuvering into position to be the most powerful member. Avatars have various actions (the version I played had 6) and cards have actions that could can choose from too.  Some are one time shots and some are buildings.  You earn points through your position on the 4 tracks, collected points/money, and building cards.

The neat part, much to my chagrin, is the treason cards.  These have a value of 0-3 points for the different types of treason.  The highest total loses their head no matter how many game points they have!  In my second play 2 of the players, myself included despite my excellent victory point total, lost our heads. It was a good laugh.

As noted by another, the game definitely brings about some very fun table banter and negotiation.  I highly recommend!  I have never been a kickstarter backer, but this brought me to my first time.  Great game!

Picked up at GenCon. Played with my gaming group and we had a blast. The treason aspect is soo intense as you are unsure who will be beheaded. Might come up with a house rule to add a possibility to escape the beheading, but make the chance be small. Overall it was a great experience!

Great initial impression despite only 2player. Can't wait to try this with 3 & 4. I agree with another reviewer about needing a house rule for the treason cards. Maybe an initial shuffle with equal 0's and 1's only.

One of my first Kickstarters that I backed... and it didn't disappoint.  Might take a bit to get the flow of it down but once things start rolling it's a blast.  Always fun to figure out how to utilize each of the different character's abilities given the other players and what's being played.

Kickstarted, picked up at Gencon and played. We liked it even better than Mansions of Madness 2nd ed.  Great fun and strategies. Some of the rules are slightly intricate but overall lots of fun and suspense. Player powers have good variety. Art is terrific and the theme is ever-present.  Beheading aspect is cool - our group may take that up a notch so that player with highest treason is not automatically beheaded; they would roll a die and if it came up zero/blank they would not be (16.6% chance).

Backed this on KS and so happy I did!

This game is a notch more complicated than Jay's previous work Noble Treachery. But in gaining the complications, it gains a fair amount more devious control over your destiny in the game. There is still a healthy bit of luck involved, but it isn't as swingy as Noble Treachery. This will likely appeal to a lot of gamers, as the game is heavier and so to have your fate changed on the turn of luck won't upset you.

The swinginess of Noble Treachery, however, is a thing of beauty unlike any other game I know or in my collection. Difficult to explain, but it just adds to the fun where usually any swinginess is hard to bear. Somehow Jay turned that on its ear!

Back to Council of Blackthorn: The largest contributing factor of luck, imo,  can be the treason cards, which you need to manage well or you will fail in this game. However, they ARE manageable.

If you fear the role of the dice in this game, fear not- they aren't strictly determining an individual player's outcome, but more the setting for that round of the game in which each player will participate.

The powers you can gain (buildings) and trigger (personages) in the game are a lot of fun and exciting when each player takes a turn, so downtime is minimal.

The game's graphic design isn't as coherent and beautiful as I think Jay's design deserves. Color scheme is a little jarring. The graphic design, however, is completely functional without any confusion due to it.

The game's mechanics are truly elegant and so well integrated they are nearly seamless, though it is obvious how completely he had to playtest this design to get it right. He's a seriously good designer we should all be proud of (my mom was born in MN!).

Interestingly, the rulebook is a little difficult to decipher. This suprised me because the rulebook to Noble Treachery is almost to a flaw so utterly precise in comparison. It's hard to put a finger to it, but the rules for Blackthorn are confusing on a few points that are critical, but can be sorted if you read them with precision and infer nothing that isn't explicit. No stars removed for this.

Bring us another game Jay as soon as you can!

This game is a lot of fun. Great artwork and components. Maybe could have used a quick start to get the first game going, but quickly picked up on the flow of the game. Played a 3 player game and look forward to playing with more players to see how that changes the game. Trying to collect influence points and avoiding treason make for interesting gameplay. And just being ahead on the faction tracks doesn't guarantee a win!

Nice game. The biggest problem I have with it, which I think is addressable, is the randomness of the Treason cards. For example, in my last game, I started with 8 Treason from my starting Treason card draw, while others started with 0. That is a massive range. That, coupled with the fact that throughout the rest of the game I consistently drew non-zero cards, I was beheaded.

I understand that the nuance of the game is intended to be adapting one's strategy to the level of Treason and taking opportunities to remove Treason versus score points when necessary--I think it's a great tradeoff. But I'm not completely sure it works perfectly as is, mainly because the inflow of Treason is so much higher than the possible outflows. In addition, the random range of Treason card values from 0-3 is huge.

For example, there is an unevenness between how players need to operate in order to have a chance of getting to the top of influence track and earning those massive point bonuses, and removing Treason. Namely, through randomness, some players have stronger abilities to move up the faction influence track than others. This means that the ones who are slower have to try to stay in the lead on the tracks ahead of the players who can leapfrog them with little effort. The problem here is that the slower players become the target of Whispers, which increase the difficulty for them rather than acting as a catchup mechanism as I believe was intended.

I think the design intent was to differentiate players by strategy with the initial Treason card draw, i.e. "I have high Treason to start so I need to focus on Treason reduction versus influence generation." However, there isn't sufficient control over Treason reduction, or really the ability for a player with a high amount of Treason to specialize and remove Treason efficiently; as is, the opportunity cost for a player to remove Treason is much too high and it feels like focusing on removing Treason cripples a player's ability to generate influence. 

Remember that only the player with the highest Treason loses, so one player trying to remove Treason e.g. by giving it to others by playing a Whispers card or using a faction with a zero die, not only sacrifices gaining influence, but only really hurts one of the other players. In a 4 or 5 player game, the remaining players are essentially unaffected. This might be fine if the player had reasonable assurance that taking this action would shift the burden of Treason to another player, but the fact is that the range of Treason cards from 0-3 is just too big, and so such an action may do nothing at all.

I don't know the distribution of the Treason cards, but I think the range should overwhelmingly be only 1-2. As the player causing others to take Treason, I need strong assurance that they actually are receiving Treason relative to me in order to balance the opportunity cost of not gaining influence. And when taking Treason, a bad draw of 3 Treason (or worse, more than 1 draw) can cripple a player.

The alternative would be to have a much more predictable way for players to remove (or increase others') Treason. I'm not aware of any mechanism that predictably allows me to remove Treason if I want to, even at a cost. Instead, all removal mechanics are opportunistic and very costly--a zero die or a random card draw, plus a lost turn.

At least for now, I'm considering a house rule that would reduce the randomness of the initial Treason draw. There is already plenty of randomness in drawing and in getting rid of Treason cards, so even if we all started with the same amount, those amounts would quickly diverge.

Bought the game at Gencon 2016. 

Have only gotten to play a couple of games but it is fun. The treason aspect is good however based on which leaders are chosen it can become unbalanced. 

I played a two player game against the master of thieves leader and the speed at which they were able to unload the treason cards made it clear who the winner would be early. 

But overall I enjoyed myself and want to play again just not the 2 player variant (2 players with a ghost).

Played this at gen con with Rick and had a GREAT time. I was beaheaded sadly. In short there are a number of tracks and ways to reach victory which allows players behind early to catch up or set others behind. Reccomended for crunchy players. Using a 3 point scale for crunchiness 1 is low 3 is the most.. I'd rate this a 2.

So far we've played it three times, with four players.  Enjoyable, and both of the first two games led to a surprise as to which player had the most treason points in the end.

This game is a mess.  The production quality is okay, but should be better to allow pieces to sit on their spots without easy getting bumped off.  The game play is VERY unintuitive and more confusing than it needs to be.  The rules are horribly written.  We read and re-read the rules on buildings several times and came to a different conclusion each time.  Ugh.  By the end of the game, 1/2 the table was telling the other players where to play just so the game would end.

Just not my kinda game. Toward the end drew a 3 treason poison which I had to focus on dumping and came last in points technically because of partially that. I think I dislike the card draw/take that, it feels a little heavy on bash the leader and just swingy effects ish.

Mechanics are fine though I don't much see the thematic tie of if the die value matches you get the effect based on influence. Lots of tactical play and card reading and not as much strategy imo and not that much fun though an okay game for others and at least semi unique in mechanics.

I really like the game. There's a good bit of strategy to the game and just about the right amount of take that. Lots of hidden information means that while there is almost always a perceived leader and some attempted king making, it's almost never the person you think is winning who is actually winning. Overall, it's really quite enjoyable.

The downside is that it tends to run long, particularly with 5+ players. Being first player always sucks, because you basically feel like you're sitting out the next round, making the game feel even longer than it actually is. If you play more than 4 players, I highly recommend starting everyone off at 3 on each track instead of at 0. It shortens the game enough to keep it enjoyable.

If there was a bit more direct player interaction, it could also be a much better game. While there is a bit of interaction, it often feels like you're supposed to be trying to hurt each other but don't really have the options to actually do it. The interaction that is there is great, but a bit more would be better.

I think this game would benefit immensely from an expansion that added additional cards that can reduce players' influence. Combined with starting at a higher base influence, it would make for a much more involved game. You'd just have to figure out a balance point where the play time isn't increased by too much.

Vin d'jeu: french review of Council of Blackthorn: http://www.vindjeu.eu/2017/04/24/council-of-blackthorn/
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
There are four suits. Each suit has a color, a symbol, and a name. Each card is a member of two suits. The suit that activates the dice action is indicated by the color of the card and a medium sized color coded icon in the top left of the card. The suit that activates the text action is indicated by a tiny black and white symbol on the middle left of the card. Finally, the symbols on the board are covered up by the markers of the players who have zero points in that suit. 

This is a huge usability fail. The two suits should be more clearly identified on the cards. An easy fix would be for the top half of the card be the dice color and the bottom half be the text color. 

In addition, the text actions refer to the suits with the small black and white symbols or the name, depending on the circumstance. The color would be more useful.

Played this game several times. Great for larger gaming groups. Does not scale well for 2-3 players. I think 4 or more though makes for a fun time time where the traitor faction and score is usually a bit murkier. Reminds me of Kingsburg, but there is more going on. If you often find yourself in a larger game group it's an interesting game for your game mix. Takes about 1 playthrough to grasp.

Really did enjoy the game, found it at GenCon and played the demo. Got a basic understanding of the effect of the cards and each character. The fact that you have to bluff a bit with the poison cards reminds me of Mario Kart for keeping the game a little balanced to allow anybody to still win regardless of your end score.

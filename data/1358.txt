RATING: 7
More of an abstract strategy game than a wargame. A couple steps up the complexity scale from Battle Cry or Memoir '44 and I would say that's a good thing but it's still very easy to learn. You can teach someone how to play in about 2 minutes. No cards and no dice so there is very little if any luck in this game. It requires some thought to play well since every unit has a strength and a weakness depending on where they are (fields or woods) and who they are fighting. Combat is for the most part a simple rock-paper-scissors format. Plays longer than either of the above two games mainly due to the written movement rules. Still, it's a very nice tactical game with surprising depth. Not easy to come by but well worth it. The only drawback is the length of time a turn takes but with the amount of thought required to play well I couldn't see getting a satisfying game if you rushed through the turns. Take your time and enjoy.

Good game lots of thinking, strategically set up your army in anticipation of what you think your opponent maybe planning. Then you set about trying to outguess your opponent’s moves. I enjoy this game, but after a few plays, if it is running long, reading out and moving 24 orders per turn can border on dragging a little. This wouldn’t stop me playing the game or buying it again as it is fantastic.   

Dropped from an 8 to a 7.

Simple war game that uses rock/paper/scissors mechanics in combat depending on terrain, game is perfectly symmetrical.  But it takes up to 3 hours to play, and is too bland for something that long.

RATING: 8
This game deserves to be better known. The simultaneous movement may not appeal to everyone, but this is a solid, different kind of game with nice pieces and board.  Lends itself very well to postal or e-mail play.

The concept was so cool I had to get it, but I've never found anyone interested in playing :(. But simultaneous movement and diceless combat in a wargame? Still too good to pass up.

RATING: 9
Outstanding light wargame, with very simple rules,  full information after the start and remarkable depth. You never have quite enough to do everything you want or need, resulting in games that are full of tension and angst. Truly excellent. Cameron, my 8 year old, loves it.

Great fun with deeper strategy than first meets the eye.  The map is nice, the bits are great, and the reversals of fortune are nerve racking.  I love it!

Very chess like. If you can visualize pieces and how they move, and plan where they land for effective attacks you will love this game. Unfortunately I could not get my mind to work like that. Beautiful minis

RATING: 9
Likes: It really is the fairest game of all; equal starting units, point symmetric board, simultaneous movement, and no 'devices of chance.' This game has the psychology of a rock-papers-scissors duel with your opponent on the grand scale of a board game. Plus, I will always have a bias for the first board game I ever bought.

Dislikes: Games length can vary from very short to very long, and usually games are longer.

Majority tan board (75/46).

Love the simultaneous movement, and the "pure abstract" nature of the game. This is the sort of design I have a great deal of respect for.  Needs two similarly-minded players, however.

Ok, maybe I'm not smart enough to play this game.  For me this game is like papers/rock/scissors.  I suppose if you are a human computer, it is possible to *never* get beaten in this game.  I tried to play it skillfully once.  My opponent had to tap me on the shoulder.  Apparently an hour had passed by, and I still hadn't decided what to do.  Great pieces though!

RATING: 8
Good little game - sort of a cross between battle cry and stratego (though it predates battle cry). Like the fact that luck plays no role, and that moves are simultaneous.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Best when played with a timer, otherwise players will be tempted to analyze their move possbilities forever.  Amazing components, especially for an independently published game.  Most mass-produced games wish they could look this nice.

RATING: 8
One of my favorites from when I was young.  This was a game I could usually get my dad to play.  The idea of the three dimensional board and the chess like movement of the pieces was simple and brilliant.  This game could really create a lot of end game tension as players moved to either protect or capture that remaining general.

RATING: 6
Another game that collapses under its own weight in that that which makes it fun also turns against the experience by the end. At first, it's an incredibly deep, tense, and dynamic strategic exercise, but it wears me out. Your poor brain has to consider all unit types as well as the different classes of units (e.g., circle, square, and triangle infantries) while also taking into consideration the terrain types and that you can only move 12 of your 40 units a turn and, oh by the way, there's a 3 minute time limit (at least the way we played).

RATING: 8.4
Lighter 'wargame'. Stratego on Steriods is about on the mark, although it's a lot of steriods. SiMove of 10 (?) units / turn can make for quite a bit of thought. You need to keep a combined arms mentality not only between different types of units (infantry and calvary and the guerrillas and keeping the artillary to wipe out unlucky or improperly placed opponents), but also between the triangle, oval and rectangular rock / paper / scissors attributes withing the infantry and calvary. If you don't, you can get chewed up without a proper counter attack.

Threaten artillary with calvary esp. if the artillary is 'bunched together' so that the calvary threatens 2 or 3 pieces at once. Guerrillas can't be destroyed by artillary and also have a high movement factor of 3. Sneek a calvary or 2 near your opponent's general and watch him/her sweat - a lucky guess and it's all over.

Interesting idea, good execution, but in the end it is just slightly more interesting to play than Stratego.  (Okay, I know Stratego is a classic, but it doesn't match up to the general quality of games available today.)

RATING: 9
Real nice strategic game with a classic feel to it. The game packs in a lot of strategic considerations during play. The round-robin elimination seems simplistic at first, but once you start considering the forest/field variations, the special rules around guerillas, together with the artillary and the three level field, the cycles of elimination are anything but simple. And, the game is just a heck of a lot of fun. Trying to outguess your opponent can lead to some great situations. As with all great games, a story unfolds as the game progresses and this story is entirely driven by player choice, which always creates memorable moments. There is not an ounce of chance in this game. Great, great stuff.

RATING: 8
An excellent strategy & tactics war game where there is no randomness (except for trying to outmaneuver or outwit or outguess your opponent).  All orders are made and then both sides reveal/execute orders (simultaneously).  Rules are simple to learn in a mere 5 mins.  It has a lot of combinations of choices & many maneuvers to perform.  Only wished that this had a modular board (along with setup rules for balanced board configuration).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Excellent tactics game! No dice, no luck at all! Takes some time to become accustomed with the variety of dominances on the two different fields. In the beginning, the way the movement commands are given, is a bit tricky (you write them down for 12 of your units at the beginning of each turn). You can easily loose the overview of which units have been moved already which sometimes cummulates to lots of illegal movement commands which can ruine your complete move.

Field Command is defenitely a little gem in the abstract tactics genre of boardgaming!

I'm re-theming this game with Zveda Samurai miniatures as I don't like the sculpt of the gamepieces. However, the simultaneous gameplay is brilliant. Simul-play is probably my favorite game mechanic that is often hard to come by.

[2010/01/01]

my friend from high school told me about this game and i am sooo excited to play it... unfortunately it's not produced anymore, so i think i'm going to have to construct my own board

if anyone in philadelphia has this and wants to play this game let me know!!!

[2010/01/05]
Just Ordered from BGG :)

[2010/01/09]
Recieved: love the board,box,and army peices... the board is the only thing that could use some improvement off the bat, and thats to make it a little more sturdy/heavy

Played a game with my wife (but i accidently knocked the board over on the 5th turn... so it turned into a practice game... we played with an 8 minute timer for moves... and i think it really helped to keep a nice flow to the game.

Overall this game is super sweet... how did it never become massivly popular? playing againt my wife turned out to be a really fun challenge (she hasn't played similar games [chess, stratego,diplomacy] but she picked this one up in a snap)... this game will not be static... it will always evole as you understand the game and your enemy better... What's interesting is that a powerful piece anywhere on the board, can always be defeated by another piece,,, I think that this game is so well done, i just can't get over all of the possiblites.... you can bull rush the other teams general, you can lay back and wait to strike, or anything inbetween... 

time will fly by as your hurry to write out your orders (within 8 mins)...it's a two person game that instantly get the blood rushing, But that means to play it, you'll need to be gaming with just 1 other for a while...
it's an intense game so you'll both have to be in the mood for it (and have the time... and that could include waiting time for bystanders)...   but if you meet that critera, i think this game reigns supreme.

I cant wait to play it again... and i'm hoping to develop a 3 person variant...

Recommended highly to everyone [everyone shold play this]

[7/16/2013]

Played it probably 6 more times since... it's a great game.. i recommend 3 minute timer ("space clock" from the apple app store)

Slick little game.  Simple, but elegant.  Nice pieces, too.

And I must add: This is an inheritance from my little brother.  I'm looking forward to playing this with my sons when they are old enough to figure it out.

UPDATE: I got a chance to play with my 7 year old, [thread=1313907]and we had as much fun as I remember.[/thread]  Great game.  Terrific starter for a young wargamer.

This is a gorgeous tactical euro-styled skirmish game that makes itself entirely accessable for anyone to play.  Too many intriguing decisions make this game a bit nailbiting.  Sadly, the very thing that makes this so good is also the thing that slows the game down so dramatically.  Each turn takes forever.  I'd want to encourage people to make their decisions quicker, but really at the end of the day you are going to have better play if you spend more time thinking things through.  Regardless, I'm going to have to put a timer on this one in hopes that it will be completed in a reasonable fashion.

RATING: 6
An intriguing and well-presented game with a Napoleonic theme (although it was apparently originally designed as a Civil War game), but some abstract aspects.  There are nice little plastic miniatures (40 each side), and a very interesting game board with forest and fields areas and different levels of elevation (although this essentially only affects artillery ranges).  Strangely, different printings of the game have relatively more/less of the forest and fields areas - for no apparent reason.  There is also a glaring error in the rules regarding what units win over others in the different terrains.  

With hidden setup, terrain factors, and ranged artillery fire, there is much to recommend this game, but some of the more abstracted notions make it pall (for me).  The artillery is too powerful because it can hit every area within range (rather than there  being any arc of fire, and - more importantly - combat between different cavalry units and between different infantry units is done by a counter-intuitive rock-paper-scissors mechanic.  While I dislike this as totally unrealistic and nonsensical, some players really like this aspect, and there's no doubting that it does lend itself to strategy of a different type.  To me, it becomes too much like a wargame crossed with a puzzle and Chess.  One day I'm going to play 'Field Command' with a few rule revisions, like more limited and directional artillery fire, slightly modified movement allowances, and more logical combat results between units of the same general type (based on their hierarchy, and maybe die rolls where they are identical).  I expect that will be pretty fun.

(May 2009) I've owned this for nearly fifteen years and played it only three times - not for lack of desire, but for lack of interested opponents!

My wife indulged me once in 2004, and my son is only 5 (he'll be 6 in September).  If you're coming to NJ and want a game, look me up!

I haven't had many chances to play this yet, but the few times I have it's been very enjoyable.  The board terrain seems to favor a rather obvious artillery placement, but that's not necessarily a handicap.  The pieces are gorgeous and the board is impressive too.  I'd love to play this more often than I do, but the people I generally game with prefer games that we all can play together, so my two player games don't generally get much of a workout.

Stratego on Steroids.  I highly recommend it.  Easy to learn, great strategy.  Fun to play with a time limit (2 min) to write orders.  Makes the game even more of a pressurer cooker.

Playful system, that does not really bear any resemblance to a wargame.  It is fun, and more psuedo-chesslike/ Stratego in essence, yet enjoyable.  Can be played in 30-45 minutes, if neither player is taking it too seriously, nor over-analyzing the situation, and what to do next.

RATING: 8.4
A very good and now OOP and hard to find plot and move game.  The units have different abilities with a somewhat rock-paper-scissors approach to battle.  The fog of war really shines not in knowing where your opponents are (you know) but in not knowing where the'll move to next.  The terrain aspects were very interesting as well making the board an engaging battlefield.

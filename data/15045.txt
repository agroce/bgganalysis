Risk with some nice ideas.  Coordination of players within a faction is of primary importance.  The Republic must win quickly or work toward a Palpatine victory.  The multi-use cards require some delicate decision making.  This is a solid, well-designed game.  (It would have been nice to have plastic starships, but I just substituted some from Twilight Imperium.)

Beneath the Ep 1-3 theme is a very poorly-balanced game of Risk.  This just seems totally biased towards the "Dark Side", which admittedly matches the plot of the movies, but it makes for a hollow victory and unappealing game.

RATING: 5.4
Played this one once or twice...

By far the coolest (and most controversial) new mechanic was "Order 66" which could make territories turn to favor the Separatists (Emperor) and away from the Loyalists (Jedi)...the way the mechanic worked was basically like this: The more turns the Separatists can delay calling Order 66 the more likely territories would flip their way (it's based on an 8 sided dice roll, flips on only 8s to start and greater then 7 and 8s after a few turns and so on...), and the sooner the Republic gets the Emperor to declare "Order 66" the less chance those territories would flip allegiance (and troops) to the Separatists. So basically the Republic need to be aggressive and push for the Order to be called as soon as possible and the Separatists want to hold out and wait as long as possible to call it.

It's a fascinating dynamic that I never really got to play enough to determine how powerful it truly was, but it seemed balanced and definitely intrigued me. It basically WAS the game.

Haters will say the game is broken, because not only do territories flip but the troops on them flip as well which could mean huge army swings...but I tend to disagree, first: if you have a lot of armies flipping you simply were not aggressive enough. The Loyalists need to press, press, press and force the Separatists to call Order 66 very early. Second: you need to focus on one color, because if you can take out a color before "Order 66" is called that army no longer gets a "turn" and the Loyalists will now get 2 turns to the Separatists 1 even if there is a lot of territories flipping.

I have played as the Republic and won, you just need to be aggressive and (as ALWAYS is the case with Risk - to it's detriment) you have to have the dice rolling your way.

...still...I ultimately didn't like it more than 2210.

Disclaimer- I am one of the few people on here who really like risk.  This is a very fun change up with the order 66 mechanic.  It really makes for a wild change up, which for some might ruin in due to an element of chance (can plan the whole game or dominate yet lose due to the random nature of order 66) but creates some good tension.

I haven't really played this game a lot. I fell in love with Risk many years ago, playing with some really edition  and with I'm sure were not the correct rules.
So, when I opened this box, it was very different to what I knew, and I was unfamiliar with most of the mechanics. Since then I found other games I think I like more and this game has been gathering dust on the shelf. I'd like to play it sometime soon.

"Impressive!" This game practically re-invents RISK. The introduction of ships and formal alliance play into the game would be a welcome addition to any of the other sets. In this game, you can't afford to sit back and build because play is just too fluid to allow indulgence in static-defense tactics. The integration of card play into the game is light years ahead of the original and head and shoulders above LOTR Risk and Godstorm.

Much better than standard Risk. It's more fun. The cards are awesome. 3 ways to use them. Some nice new rules: Order 66, 8-sided dice, Ships. And for once you don't have to hate the other gamers when they try to kill you. Now they have to...

I only wish it could be played with more players than 4.

And, YES, it is well balanced. The people saying otherwise hasn't played it more than once or twice.

THE butt-fugliest game board I have ever seen. Oh, my eyes!

As for the gameplay, the initial stress of Order 66 is quite unique to Risk. Playing the Republic, one must hit the Separatists hard to force a very early Order 66.

This is another ingenious edition to the Risk family by Rob Daviau. It's not quite as good as the Original Trilogy edition, nor as good as 2210 or Godstorm, but still a worthy addition.

RATING: 9
This would  get a total thumbs-up from me but for one thing. I think it's really cool how many interesting choices the game throws at you: the Republic is very strong early, and the Separatists must balance holding out for the 5-6 turns required for a devastating Order 66 with defending bases with the fact that Risk is fundamentally a very offense-friendly game, so they need to attack from time to time. The Republic is on all-out offense early on, and they have to balance the need to take bases (to get cards, which matter a lot) with consolidating regions. Plus, it's a team game, and if either team suffers a player elimination, they will lose, so you have to support your teammate (and this puts more interesting pressure on the Separatists and their need to call Order 66; they may be forced to call early if one player nears elimination, which they need to aviod). This is all extremely clever and gives the players all sorts of interesting choices.

The albatross around the game's neck, though, and the only reason it doesn't get a 10 rating, is its Risk heritage. Two things, particularly: firstly, Risk's time-consuming combat resolution. When stacks of 12 units or so go at it (and thankfully in the two SW Risk games, you won't see this very often), it takes quite some time to roll all those dice and take the casualties. A faster system wuold have been far preferable. Secondly, the designers have come up with this really cool deck of cards, but you never seem to quite draw enough to get the full flavor of the deck (especially the Separatists).

Both Star Wars Risks are very sensitive to sensible setups. If one player can consolidate a mid-sized region early, that team will have a huge advantage - both games are a bit of a knife fight in a closet. Early game is a balancing act, and both sides need to be sure to keep the pressure on all the time. If the setup allows one player to lock in early, the game won't be as interesting as it could be.

I really enjoy Risk variant games, and while this one has some great aspects, it is clearly a one sides game in many ways. Not to mention the very first time I played, I won as the emperor with no chance of recourse.How?So as the game goes on, the Emperor moves along a track called the order 66 track. It is numbers 1-11 and at any time, once per game, the Player for the empire can call out order 66 in which case re rolls for every enemy occupied territory and if he rolls below the number the emperor is on, that territory becomes his showing the sudden revelation the emperor controlled the whole warProblem was this, I got to 11 and had a card that dropped my roll by one for order 66. So on 2 6 sides Dice (12) I need to roll a 12 or lower. Anyway, since I could not lose, every territory became mine and I won, just like that.Keep in mind I had about 2 territories left as I was getting my butt kicked across the galaxy (the game seems to side with the Trade Fed side first since eventually it is a give order 66 should level it back out. but in my case I held on just long enough to play the order 66 event and card for automatic victory.  After 3 hours of playing, even though I won, it seemed a cheap victory.

Well, it's still Risk, so it's still a major dice-fest and the real strategy is only at the beginning of the game, when players are selecting their areas of control. But I must commend this game for making a strong effort to cut down on the 2 big bugbears of Risk - overly long playing time and dice-fest-iness. Having the ships modify dice rolls adds just a slight bit of strategy and control to the dice combat. And the Order 66 rule keeps the game short and very exciting.

The theme definitely lifts this game up from the run-of-the-mill Risk, but more than that, it's clear that the game designers did really think about how to incorporate the theme into rules that deal with Risk's problems.

Although I had trepidations whether Risk could be turned into a cool Clone Wars game, I'm satisfied with the results here.

My brother in law has this game.  We got excited at first.  Played a few games and had some fun, but I find it horribly unbalanced and frustrating.  This is actually the game that led me to finding the geek, because my wife did a google search with some rules questions and to find out what people thought about how balanced it is.  Most geek members seem to think it's very balanced, or if anything the Republic has the advantage but I think the Separatists definetely have the advantage.  I have no desire to play this ever again.  Actually, I prefer standard Risk.

"Your Plays" count only for times my son has played with all the bits. One day we'll try to actually play it, but it seems more fiddly than it's worth to try.
Update: We finally slogged through the slow-going if competent rulebook and gave this a proper play. The Order 66 mechanism is what gives this game its flavor, I think, if only because it gives the game some narrative shape, but a shape over which the Separatists have control and that has potentially significant impact on the outcome of the game. Still, it's hopelessly fiddly like the original. I may very well just give all the bits to the kids to play with and throw the rest out.

Can be played as normal risk (in which case the Star Wars stuff is just flavor) or can be played with the Clone War rules.  If played with the Clone War rules, the Darkside wins.  It is insane how huge of an advantage the Dark Side has.  All they have to do is play very defensively until late in the game when they take over about 80% of the Light sides units.

A great game, I like the Order 66 rule because it accellerates the first turns (the republic has to move quickly to drive the seperatists into issuing Order 66). Don't let the rumours on the net disturb you - it's NOT a game where only the seperatists win. In fact, they loose quite often if facing an experienced republic player.

Eh...forget the snobbery.  I like this game.  Doesn't hurt I'm a total Star Wars nut.  Great bits, run to play, the Order 66 mechanic definitely turns the game on its ear.

UPDATE:  This one is still a keeper.  Plays in an hour and a half (for RISK?!?!) and has enough strategy to help mitigate bad runs of the dice.  Not as "heavy" as 2210 but certainly one of the finer Risk variants ever produced.  Upgraded from a 6.5 to an 8, really a nice surprise here.

RATING: 8
I've played this but once with my daughters the day I bought it on sale at Wally Martinville. I think it is superior to the LoTR version, but not as good as the 2210 version (I own but have yet to play Godstorm).  Order 66 is a great rule! The feeling of sick dread that grew in me as I watched the Republic turn to the dark side was intense -- but I played some kind of sneak attack card that allowed the republic to assassinate Palpatine in the end . . . hope to get to play this game again some time.

Risk is a bit boring these days compared to other titles. The Order 66 mechanic is a little overpowering in this version as well. Still willing to play though.

RATING: 8
This may be the best Risk game out there, the locked alliances mean that the game will not last 5 hours like 2210 or the original and that creates a little more strategy rather than just mayhem.  Palpatine and order 66 gives an important time dimension and the seperatist leaders balance that weakness.  The cards are great, they can be used for turn-in's like the original (which I never liked) for more troops or they can do interesting things like add 1 to dice or let you roll 8 sided dice, or you can use them to build starships, fighters, corvettes and capital ships.  You use these ships like units and they help significantly and are lots of fun.

This game has made a very positive impression with most (but not all) of my gaming group.  Rules seem "smoother" and theme seems slightly better integrated with game mechanics than with LOTR Risk.  Overall, I believe this one approaches 2210 (my favorite of the Risk games) in design, playing fun, etc.

This is a good alernative to the Risk series.  The parts are not as good as 2210 or Godstorm, but still a good game.  It's fun to play as a team against another team so 4 players work the best.  I do not like the board though, it could have been so much better!

An interesting take on Risk, I especially like the "Order 66" rule. Pretty cool to see the sh*t hit the fan when that is achieved.

The cards mixes it up a bit, not my favorite risk variant to play, but one I should play more often.

The major con for me on this variant is that you have to play "Good vs bad" and therefore it really is limited to a 2 or a 4 player game. No option for 5 or 6 players, and who wants to play 3 players when you have a 2 vs 1 scenario.

I like the order 66 rule.  It makes this a unique version of risk.  The sepratists are fighting a losing battle and trying to hold out until they can effectively execute Order 66.  The Republic has to work fast and try to crush the rebellion before the sepratists can pull the trigger.  It makes for some nice tension.

This went just as expected: The republic expanded in the early game, forcing the separatists to call Order 66 rather early (6-8). After that, the separatists made a crucial error leaving Darth Sidious with too little protection, which we managed to capitalize on.

RATING: 8
This is the first time I've found myself enjoying a Risk game. First of all, the theme fits the Risk mechanics perfectly for a change. You're not trying take over the world, you're not trying to have the most territories controlled by the time the One Ring reaches Mt. Doom. You're trying to get rid of the Separatist scourge, or as the Separatists, trying to take take over the Republic. And Chancellor Palpatine betrays and takes over the Republic halfway through the game. I swear, I'm a Risk hater, and I love it. I'm also a little biased because to date there have been NO grand strategic Star Wars war games, and we need them. I'm stoked about the Original Trilogy edition next year!

RATING: 6.5
I'm pretty much a softcore Risk and Star Wars fan, so I figured this would be an interesting blend.

It allowed for many fun gaming moments with my friends in my secondary school in Singapore, but I haven't been able to try it out with any of my friends in Junior College. So far this is the game I am most capable of beating newbies at (if you don't count chess).

What I like:
The "Order 66" counter. It basically pushes the Republic to be extremely aggressive during the game, which makes for fast-paced gameplay compared to the original Risk. It's also convenient to let newbies play as the Separatists.

It's [i]Risk[/i], and if you're a hater, then get ready to turn your nose up and move along—there's nothing for you here.

If you don't mind the [i]Risk[/i] base engine, then this one has a couple of neat little quirks for you.  First and foremost, the triple use of cards leads to some acutely agonizing decisions.  They can be turned in as sets to gain reinforcements, OR used to build a ship, OR played for their special effect text.  Secondly, the non-compatability of the two armies within each faction makes for more interesting play.  The Republic and the Separatists each have two armies, and no matter how many players there are, all four armies will be in play.  The two armies within each faction cooperate for the end-goal, but they cannot share territory or cards—and each army gets its own turn.  

The Order 66 shenannigans add a nerve-wracking thematic clock to the game; watching systems flip to the dark side is a nail-biter for the Republic player... culminating in a desperate, last-gasp mad-dash assault on Palpatine.  The all-or-nothing feel of the endgame is simply delicious.  

There's not as much going on here as there is in [i]2210[/i] or [i]LotR[/i], but my 11-year-old son and I had a great time.  Overall a good rootbeer & pretzels game, provided you like the modern Star Wars and don't mind [i]Risk[/i].  Lucky for me, I find I'm hovering at a sweet-spot of equanimity in respect to both.

Two-player Risk variant that plays pretty well and very quickly.  The Separatists are outgunned but once per game can cause some of the Republican forces to switch sides.  Nice for what it is but the connection to Star Wars is pretty weak.  This isn't helped by Kamino being in the wrong place on the map.  You'd have to be a hardcore Star Wars geek to know where most of these planets are located, but the location of Kamino was a major plot point in the film Attack of the Clones, so it's inexcusable that it was misplaced on the game map.

A big hit with my boys, 9 and 11, who loved strongly themed games.   The ships, multi-use cards, tokens, and order 66 give the game a lot of options.   The strict team rules codify allowable screwage, and it doesn't become personal.  We all had a good time and can't wait to play again.

Ack!  I'm enjoying a Risk game!  Serriously havn't touched Risk since 1985 or so, I was just too luck driven for grognard like myself.

Tends to fall into 'Republic always wins/Seperatists always wins' strategy familiarization that annoys potential players.  Seperatists need to play their cards as missions and strive for compact regions to protect their leaders (the hexagons).  Republic needs to hoard non-Annakin cards and hope to retain a variety of locations so that they can strike at Darth Sideious (sp) after Order 66.  Pressing to force an early call for Order 66 is a good strategy.

Many people here miss the statistics with Order 66. You don't wait, you call it when it's at 2 (or even 1). That gives you a 2/8 chance to overturn a planet. The other side starts with 22 planets, you with 20. You should, on average, turn 5 planets. Giving you 25 and them 17. Note too you also get their armies. From there you simply win. This hardly makes for strategy or fun.

This was a revelation for me.  Basic Risk, at least with the rules I learned in the 70's, was broken, and had one winning strategy, based on deferring turning in card sets as long as possible.  

The ship rules, which give more dice options, and the card powers make for a much more interesting game.  (They also got rid of the geometric growth in card set value, I think even for basic Risk.)  The Order 66 mechanic is annoying, and probably means the game is not balanced; but it doesn't feel broken.

If you really love star wars you should probably check it out but the thing that killed it for me was how its set during the prequels ...as far as gameplay for risk though its not half bad 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I don't like the prequels.  The map is ugly.  That makes the theme fairly weak for me.  It's basically a 2 player game (I don't like playing teams for the same reason I don't like co-ops), so I'd rather play a better 2 player game.

Me and two of my friends were playing this game. I was playing the good side. My friend that was playing the bad side invoked order 66 on the first turn that he could, and basically wiped us out two turns after that. I think that it is an incredibly unbalanced game.

However, I would like to try a couple of different strategies to change that, if I find that with Order 66 you can't win, that is a problem.

The best Risk game, I have tried. Order 66 and the leader tokens add a lot to the game. The Republic cannot risk holding their position - they need to capture some of the seperatist leaders in order to gain troops before the seperatists start "Order 66" and take over the entire galaxy.

I wasn't sure how I'd feel about this one, and avoided getting it for awhile.  I mean, it is RISK, after all.  Also, I wasn't too pleased with the "look" of the game: the board lacked visual appeal, there are only two unit types per side (and one of them, the Repulic tank, is really hokey...I mean, did these things actually exist in the movie?), the cardboard cut-outs of ships. And while I'm still feel a bit "eh" about the components, I was very pleased with the gameplay.  The introduction of "Order 66" and the way it changes the game dynamics was really quite clever. Also, they got the team-play rules down pat in this Risk version (unlike in LoTR Risk, where team play was awkward at best).  It's a bit difficult with less than 4 players, as one person essentially will need to play two teams, but still it works. I'm still not sure about game balance, but at least I'm eager to play more to learn about it.

This is actually pretty good.  It has 3 innovations over normal Risk.
1.  Team play - 2, 3 or 4 can play, but always form two teams. This solves the leader bashing problem.
2.  An asymmetric set-up with a clock mechanism.  This makes the game take 90 minutes, and provides an enjoyable variety of experience as the game progresses through distinct phases and there are two sides to play, each needing a different style.
3.  The cards now have 3 uses: for reinforcement troops (as usual), for ships (which improve battle odds), or for special powers (various funky ways to break the rules).
It fixes up many of the things I don't like about Risk, without adding too much overhead (Risk 2210 may be a step too far for me) while reducing play time.
Seems balanced to me so far.  Recommended.

Can only compare it to classic Risk which I liked as a kid and this is much better.    Strategy is much more important and the team concept as well as different team strategies makes two player games great.  I find this game very balanced and not just a dice throwing contest like the original risk was.  The Order 66 timeline is a unique and fun twist and keeps the game going.  Average game time has been right around 2 hours.

--Feb2006-- It's Risk.  I'm not sure it's an improvement on the original, either.  The asymmetry is slightly interesting, but it looks (admittedly, after exactly one play) like the Seperatists have a huge advantage.

This got a lot of play in 2005 when I was living in LA with my friend Chris, a fellow Star Wars nerd. Feels a little swingy now... there are basically two routes games can go. Either the Clone Army routs early and put the game away, or the Separatists hang on until Order 66 can be declared and then walk away with the win. Feels a little imbalanced because of that.

2.5 plays so far and I really like it. I'm not a big fan of any of the prior Risks, but this one is fun and the quickest of them all.  The anticipation of which Republic armies might turn and the desperate fight to stave off the survivors provides for some great tension.

An excellent use of the Risk formula, and a great team game.  The biggest down side is the only way to truly play this game requires exactly four players. If playing classic Risk, this board is a lot better than the original because there is no Australia.

This one can be frustrating: it has all the hallmarks that irk me about Risk (the same way to get troops, battle system, turn structure) and adds elements that imbalance the game greatly. Some of the cards are overly powerful and a good run will leave you with a nice set of cards in which to do some serious reinforments and damage.

I do like the pacing of the game where the Republic is strong at the start and the Seperatists are basically holding out for a good Order 66. The game does seem to balance itself out well but the original risk elements still leave me more frustrated than satisfied.

[gameid=181] blended with a card-driven wargame.  One of my favorite Risk variants, if not THE favorite, probably not unrelated to the fact that it's the shortest one I've tried.  It's a race to see if the Republic is going to be able to use its extra cards and slight early start to get enough of the universe that they'll still be able to hang on after Order 66 is triggered.  Make the Separatists do it too early, and it won't have enough of an effect to save them, but if they wait too long, it may be too late for them.  Really an ingenious twist on Risk for two or four.

This variant isn't too bad, but it's a lot more swingy than the other Risk re-themes. It plays similarly to the trilogy edition game, but with only two sides to the conflict and no asymmetric win conditions. The big wrinkle here is that Palpatine can declare Order 66 and have a random set of pieces switch sides from the Republic to the Separatists. As you can imagine, this can have a pretty huge effect on the game. If the Separatist player rolls well, the game is pretty much over. If he doesn't, then the game returns to classic Risk mode. It's a little too random for my taste and the net result is that when Order 66 does swing the game, it feels like the early turns were very much just a waste of time.

I'm one of those gamers who (gasp) enjoys Risk.  Furthermore, I'm one of those who likes this edition.  There's a lot of interesting twists to this version of Risk, and they did a very good job of incorporating the theme into the gameplay.

The map is a bit unorthodox and not very elegant, making it different from probably every other version of Risk.  However, it's functional and actually makes a lot of sense for the gameplay.

It's also very interesting how the game FEELS unbalanced, but I don't think that it is.  (For everyone who says that a particular side will ALWAYS win, there's someone else who says that the other side will always win.)  I think that apparent unbalanced-ness is carefully designed into the game making it look as if one side has the upper hand and the game is sewn up ... until Order 66 is called, and then the game frequently swings in the other direction.  But it's easy to call Order 66 too early or too late.

There's a lot going on in this game.  In fact, I just persuaded myself to bump it up one point in my rating.

For those who love Risk and Star Wars, it's a godsend. "Order 66" rule can keep it from bogging down. Triple duty powers of cards make them ultra important; Addition of ships adds more traditional wargame strategy to the usually static Risk concept. The fortification rules (slightly modified from RISK) alone make the game worth it.

This is a good twist on a classic, and who can really knock any game with a Star Wars theme.  Much more strategy involved then regular risk, but at its heart I will admit its pretty much still risk with some Star Wars themed twists/goals.  Not bad, but not great either.

RATING: 7
An interesting 2-sided dynamic with the Order 66 timing and result being crucial, and immediately changing the tone of the game. How effective the Order 66 is is a bit random though. A few too many cards that simply discard a player's hand or drastically reduce card draw right when they'd increased it, which can feel a little anti-fun. Continents seem incredibly hard to hold, without even a Death Star around to blow up all those connections...

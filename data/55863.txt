Nicely produced game, well-mounted board.  Figures are about 30-32 mm in wargamer scale parlance; character figures are slightly larger than the red guards.

The photos don't do justice to the figures--they are beautifully detailed down to tiny embroidery represented on the ladies' dresses and they are made of a relatively hard plastic.  The swords bend just enough to make them durable and nothing was broken or even bent.

Well-illustrated and clear rules.  Breaking it in tonight!

Great fun to play, especially if you're a fan of the books and films. I might suggest a 3-minute timer for the Musketeer players, since we had a devil of a time our first two games but won the third with a lot of communicating during our own turns.

The production for the game is top-notch throughout. You might expect minis for the heroes and maybe for Queen Anne, but no. They go the distance and give you great minis for everyone in the game!

I guess if you want a quick 30 minute game where you hack through some baddies, this is a good diversion.  I'm just not into this sort of thing.

The "good" players are trying to deliver some jewels to the princess, and a slew of bad guys is in the way.  The good guys try to maneuver their way through, using special abilities chits they find along the way, and hacking any baddie to pieces that gets in the way.

I can see why others enjoy this sort of thing, but it's just not for me.

RATING: 7
Based on 1 play with 5 players:

VERY tentative rating. The problem here is that Richelieu won at the beginning of the THIRD ROUND, so we didn't get a very good feel for the game.

The biggest problem we noticed so far is the luck... luck in combat is one thing, but Richelieu won because he lucked out early on. It's kind of difficult for me to tell whether or not there was anything we COULD have done to prevent it if we'd had more experience with the game. However, we did somehow miss the rule that we didn't have to take separate entrances into the palace and split up early on, so that could have swung things already.

So yeah, definitely minus points for the fact that someone can, apparently, just luck into a win early on. But it's hard to tell how common that is, so, we'll see.

But I'm giving this a 7 for potential, because the two turns we DID have were actually pretty fun and interesting. I like the potential for bluff and of course, the theme is fun! The special powers and variable turn order are cool, but the variable turn order was one of the big factor's in Richelieu's early victory.

This is a richly themed, over-produced (in a good way) light family game. Its one team against one bad-guy. The game is pretty to look at, and not terribly complicated. It can be played in a short amount of time. 

I'd be happy to play again, but I don't need a copy of this one. This is a genre of game I already have well covered (light family-fare) but I enjoy it otherwise. Yes, there's heavy luck, but its short enough that this doesn't make much difference to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun game that feels very thematic - I haven't read the book, but I'm interested in doing so now.  My kids enjoyed it because they can "team up" with someone and either win or lose together.  I really liked the variable turn order and the Musketeers fending off wave after wave of guards until finally succombing JUST at the last moment.  Not too sure about the luck factor where Milady can end the game immediately upon the seduction of a Musketeer, but that didn't happen in our first game.
Good game with a compelling theme.

Players are either the musketeers, trying to get the pendant to the Queen before time runs out, or the bad guy trying to prevent that happening.  Simple game where the four musketeers and the bad guys are activated by a random sequence of play each turn.  The musketeers are trying to infiltrate through the palace, but only one of them is secretly carrying the pendant.  The other musketeers are carrying dummies, and it's up to the bad guy to work out where the pendant is and knock out the carrier.  Alternatively they can fight a delaying action and just run the game out of time.  Nicely designed game, lots of light hearted fun and bluff, with (all for) one against many.  Looks nice, seems to be tightly designed and comes down to close finishes.  Good game, but probably best with five.  Felt a bit like Dorn in a way.

Amazingly good if simple one-vs-all game. How this has slipped past people, I don't know. Extremely simple actions make this easy enough for non-gamer family play, but equally makes the game very open and very psychological for hardened gamers. Perhaps the dice-rolling for combat makes it too lucky, but as a tricky puzzler, this is a surprise package and well worth checking out. I bough a cheap German copy, and there's little enough text that gamers will be fine, but families will want the edition in their language. Nice production, if with some defects in the plastic figures.

A surprisingly interesting twist on the traditional dungeoncrawl (or is that Louvre-crawl?).  This one came out of nowhere as I had never heard of the publisher before.

I like this game quite a lot.

Need to play this more.  Can't make up my mind how much I like it.  Either it's too simple, or it's brilliant.  I can't decide.

Sort of feels like "Musketeers play football" in that they're running from one side to another, dodging tacklers (guards), faking who might have the ball, until the reach the endzone (the king.)

This is obviously an inferior game to Mousquetaires du Roy, but light and fun in its own right.  I love the figures, they're larger than you expect and really nicely done.  I may substitute them into my games of du Roy as they have a bitching Rochefort here.  Only problem?  No Treville.

Components: good quality and not bad figures
Complex: really easy to teach and learn

Length: 15 minutes, not a problem if it lasts longer
Opinion: the typical them on the musketeers, but done on a really easy and fun game.
Rules can be explained in 5 minutes, and the game is understood in 7. Reveal a card, move the musketeers or the guards according to the order on the card and advance the queen to the ball.
On your turn, not much to decide, just move the musketeers trying to get to the Queen, or move the guards to avoid that.
At first glance could be seen as a child game, but with this length, this simplicity and this them I will try to play it more times than any other game with these characteristics.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (November 2010)

I have only played it once, and to be perfectly honest, I don’t remember much about the game. It was played on 2010, the year I really got onto the hobby. This was my first game of “all against one” and I really like that. I remember the game had lots of dice and in my only game, the “overlord” threw very bad dice. I want to try it again.

As soon as I play it again, I will come back and re comment. 

Current Rating : 6.0

I finally got to play the game again.

I’m angry that the game board is very loose on the big game box (the insert is useless), due to this the board suffered in transit and arrived with battered corners. The game box should be smaller or have a better insert to avoid this.  I bought 3 copies and all arrived the same way :angry:.

The Three Musketeers: The Queen's Pendants is a (relative) light and simple game with lots of luck, however I enjoyed it because it plays so fast (and we were 5 players!). I feel the Musketeers have the upper hand but in my games both teams have won so I’m not 100% sure about this, but I think there are some balance issues. I really like how the players hide the  jewels , that is the best part of the game for me (bluffing). The combat is pretty straightforward bun fun nonetheless.

The way turn cards appear is very random but it doesn’t bother me, it is a novel system in which each player is not sure how the turn order will develop in the next turn.

The game components are good, the game miniatures are very detailed. The theme does nothing (bad or good) for me.

Bottom line, The Three Musketeers: The Queen's Pendants is a borderline 6.0 to me. An ok tactical game I would play from time to time. For now I’m keeping it on my game collection as it serves as a good introduction to the boardgame world and to one vs. many (I love these kind of games). Its main appeal is the fast playtime.

One-against-all tactical battle game, with the musketeers trying to get the jewels from one end of the board to the other before the clock runs out while Richelieu tries to capture the jewels or run the clock down.

Feels a little like trying to score a try in rugby (or touchdown in US football) but without the broken bones and dislocated joints.

Occasional fun rather than hugely compelling, but worth a spin.

Good game if you're in the mood for a highly themed tactical asymmetric partially co-op game. Beautifully produced and the theme is refreshingly unique. Shouldn't be too hard to add scenarios, even freely downloadable ones, and conducive to expansions as well.

I'm not into minis, and generally not all that into tactical games (Space Hulk just didn't do it for me). But, although I would jump at the opportunity to play this again. Dripping with theme and implements this into the mechanics in a very creative way that resonated with me.

Hasn't seemed to get much buzz, which is a shame b/c I really enjoyed it. I've since read the rules and see that they have a few variants already described (and I assume play-tested), which allays my initial replayability concerns.

Amusing.  Team-based match of the Musketeers vs. Cardinal Richlieu's forces.  The great theme and light touches carry this forward nicely.  There is a ton of luck, so don't come into this expecting a serious match.  I'd say ONLY play this with 5 fun-loving players.

After five plays, I am coming to the conclusion that an experienced Cardinal will generally defeat the musketeers.  I plan to impose a new rule, which others aparently use, where Milady can only roll for seduction if she is *alone* in a room with a single musketeer.

This may pull the game balance back to where a fresh set of musketeers has a chance against an experienced Cardinal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent game. Very, very well balanced, very fun to play, very faithful to the novel (and movies)... It's as good for 2 players as for 5 players. For 2 players, it's a game of opposition, each player has to think of all the options, take calculated risks, and make sure they don't forget anything or make a mistake because they will generally pay for them. For 5 players, the cooperation aspect is very important: the Musketeers players need to coordinate if they want to win, and mustn't give hints to the Cardinal player when they speak...
There's a lot of action, and the game doesn't last too long (one hour at the most). The game appeals to a very large audience. Core gamers will learn the rules very fast, but still have fun playing it. Families and casual players will find the rules a little complex to start with, but will understand everything at the first game. And then, they'll play new games easily (actually, they'll ask to play again!). A must have, and definitely one of the games that really stood out at Essen 09.

A very thematic and amusing race-against-time game involving bluffing and tactics.  This re-inacts the final scene of the book:  The Musketeers must get the Queen's Pendant into the Ballroom and into her hands before it's too late.  But, if you are playing the Evil antagonist, which Musketeer is holding the real pendant? and running for the ballroom?  Game is probably best with three or five players and plays in under an hour.

This game is filled with so much goodness I don't know even where to begin. The varied turn order is implemented perfectly and adds a dose of more tension during the beginning of every turn. Much like Assault in Hoth turn order is dictated by a card play. Simply brilliant, and I wish more games used similar mechanics. The production value is top notch, although I wished that the box was a little bit smaller, because there is a shit load of air in there.  The dueling mechanic also works out quite well, with the heroes of the story rightfully taking out henchmen after henchman on their way to the Ball. Kind of has a Space Hulk feel in that way. The  bluffing mechanic also adds something really nice to this game with guessing and double guessing throughout the game. 
This game might even make it to 10 once I get a few more plays in.

I really like the production of the game and I think they did a fine job on the theme considering it's not too deep or complicated.  The mechanic where one musketeer holds the jewels and can "secretly" trade them to other musketeers works fairly well too.  This may be an ideal family game.

Warning: the game can end really quickly.  This might not be bad considering you can just play again right away.  

I'm not a big fan of semi-cooperative games where it's one against everybody.  Not because it doesn't work -- more so because I want the challenge of playing against everybody but rarely get the chance.

Very nice game with good tension.  You alternate quickly from feeling like 'I got this made' to 'oh no I'm a goner' as the musketeers lay waste to onslaught after onslaught of Roquefort and his men - only to quickly be surrounded once more.  It feels like a lighter, more kid-friendly version of Space Hulk or Mutant Chronicles.

Hidden pendant mechanic is a fun addition, as is Milady's ability to 'seduce' a musketeer and reveal if he's carrying the pendant or not.

A straight-forward semi-coop, the musketeers moving steadily from one end of the board to the other, fighting their way through the guards who are spawned and moved by the Cardinal player. Combat is roll X dice, hit on a Y, keep going until only one side remains. Which makes it good to stay together, but then that makes it easier for the Cardinal to mass troops. The Cardinal has to kill off the musketeer with the pendants, which is unknown to him, and the musketeers can secretly move them between themselves when they share a space, so that's another benefit of hanging together over spreading out. Stopping on spawning points and denying them to the Cardinal seems obvious. Picking up the helpful bonus tokens along the way seems good as well. I liked how the round cards dictated a new turn order each turn, with the Cardinal often having multiple turns within a round to do stuff, and finally moving the clock which the musketeers have to beat to win the game. My only game was an easy win to the musketeers, which threw doubt on replayability, otherwise I may have rated it higher as it came in at an appropriate length and was a pleasant dice-rolling romp with some discussion required along the way as to plans.

I picked this up because of my childhood fondness of the physical comedy featured in Oliver Reeds movies from the 70s and the music of The Flashing Blade. Sadly seems to be suitable for 5 players only as all 4 musketeers and the baddies are in play, so less than 5 means multiple personality overheads for the good guy player. Plus reports of downtime with more than 3 means this had to go....and yet Mousquetaires de Roy, with its external narrative and solo play mode is starting to appeal :-)

The game depicts the final passage of Dumas' book, where the musketeers must race to return a relevant necklace to the Queen before she meets the King of France, while Richelieu tries to stop them with the aid of his henchmen. Rules-wise, the game fits inside the genre of semi-cooperative tactical combat and can be seen as a kind of a faster, lighter version of such games as Doom: The Boardgame. Scaling well from 2 to 5 players, with great production value and with new and interesting ideas to the genre, like bluffing (which musketeer has the necklace?) and the card drawing system to determine turn order.

not to be confused by the Ystari game of a similar name and plot and gameplay (somewhat co-op), even both use dice and have the saying all against one, one against all. weird.

Wow.  I enjoyed this quite a bit, and would never have picked it out of a line up if it hadn't of been for Morgan (sisteray).  Essentially the 4 musketeer players must run a gauntlet comprised of a labyrinth of rooms and the cardinals henchmen.  This feels vaguely like  your trying to lateral your way to a touchdown, only the theme is really well presented and I love the fact that you never know what the actual turn order will be from round to round.  
For a game that clocks in at less than an hour, the concept and mechanics come together for a compelling non-Euro experience.
I'll be adding this to my watch list.

This game was a 'must by' just because of the subject.

Most enjoyable components, allthough I'm still looking for a good storage option. Just got the broken swords replaced and don't fancy a repeat.

The game is okay, maybe it just has to grow on us.
The duels, main part of the game, lacked exitement as the henchmen are to easily killed.
The milady character seems to powerfull, finding the pendant ends the game and that is just what happened.

Неплохая игра, но без оригинальности. Подобных игр с хождением и ловлей соперника в лабиринте не мало. Боевка также простенькая и без фантазий. Локализация же неплохая, хотя качество фигурок могло бы быть и менее хрупким.

Интересная ролевая игра. Подходит для любого кол-ва игроков от 2 до 5. Достаточно быстрые партии. Красочное оформление. Антураж. Все что нужно подобной игре.

Wow!  Lots of color and theme.  I love the Musketeers charging the palace, duping out the Cardinal.  It's remarkably similar to football strangely as you are trying to deliver the pendant to the queen pushing your way through the defensive positions duping out the Cardinal's forces.  The mixed turn order is really fun, and the special powers are great.  It's wonderful.  I could see my rating go up on this.

Terrific little cooperative game,albeit from my perspective, in need of a few more sessions before one can adequately develop effective strategies related to either side of the cooperation equation

Don't let the bad 80s cover art fool you. This is an enjoyable movement and dice rolling game where one player (the Cardinal Richelieu) tries to discover which other player (one of 4 musketeers) is holding the Queen's jewels. Each player has their own special abilities, the Cardinal gets a deck of special action cards and the Musketeers can loot rooms for various advantageous (or booby trapped) items.

I truly [i]want[/i] to like this game, because it captures the theme so beautifully. It is extremely light - anyone who is used to me giving low ratings to games that lack depth should be warned, because my affection for it exceeds its play value. I think it will be fine for play with a youngster who loves swashbuckling literature, and perhaps enjoyable for adults in the mood for a quickie cut-and-thrust run through the palace. But if you want tactical depth, I confess there isn't all that much.

In essence it is a shell game - one of the four Musketeers carries the real pendant, and tries to get it to the opposite side of the board before the timer expires (the Queen moves on a track each round; they must succeed before she reaches the end). The guards aren't strong enough to stop all four. They have Milady, who can use seduction to determine whether a given Musketeer's pendant is real, and Rochefort, who is tougher than the standard Guards, but still no match for a Musketeer. I think if you played more than a time or two, you would need to use the balancing options to help the Guards.

Just the right length for a game of this type!  The Three Musketeers and D'Artagnan team up against a single player directing Cardinal Richelieu and his fanatically devoted guards, running the gauntlet to return the pendant to Queen Anne before it is too late!  It was fun and tense and very close at the end!

Senkit ne tévesszen meg a játék lemaradása a toplistán. Ez egy remek egy mindenki ellen játék. A hangulata is kiváló és a könnyen megérthető, de mégis izgalmas játékmenet sokat tesz a játék élményfaktorához. Szerencse persze van benne, de pont úgy és annyi, amennyi kell.

Juego cooperativo, fácil, vistoso, corto y entretenido. Los Mosqueteros deben entregar los Herretes del Collar a la Reina, antes de que esta llegue al Salón de Baile. Los esbirros del Cardenal intentarán impedirlo.

cooperativo, uno hace de richelieu, con rochefort y milady como esbirros y los guardias, y el resto los mosqueteros. Tienen que llevarle el pendiente a la reina, antes que los descubra el rey, solo uno lleva los pendientes verdaderos. Tematica buena pero demasiado simplon y muy desequilibrado en favor de los mosqueteros

Played a couple games at Oasis of Fun in Atlanta June 2011. Was fun, would like to introduce local players. Was able to fix D'artagnan's blue figurine with a soldering iron!

Plays fast, yet there's a lot of tension in each decision-- there are a fair amount of rules that need to be checked, but it's a surprisingly deep game. The dice-rolls can be a bit random, but because each individual game is quick, it's not quite as bad as expected.

Downside is that the rules are a bit vague/unclear, so it takes a while to learn (it may have been nice to have a quick icon on the equipment, for example).

Edit: Rating down because I have another game with similar theme done more in depth with better gameplay.

A quality family game guaranteed to generate nostalgia twenty years from now.

For an adult crowd, [i]Musketeers[/i] isn't too shabby if you have a light heart and 45 minutes to kill.  I'd certainly rather play this than Scotland Yard.

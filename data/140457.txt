RATING: 5
Of all the versions of Werewolf I have played, this is the only one that does not have player elimination. This actually changes the whole game completely. Instead of talking and coming to and agreement together (=regular Werewolf), everyone acts more according to their own personal agenda when selecting actions. The whole action selection part was something I was not sure I liked so much. It made the game much more like a gamers game whereas Werewolf can be played with almost anyone. 

The best part however, was that the game actually works with low player numbers. In Werewolf, 10 players is the absolute minimum while the Ultimate Werewolf: Inquisition worked well with 5 players only.

RATING: 5
This was a good attempt to try to bring Werewolf to lower player counts. It doesn't really work. 

The game is clunky, there's not much reason to stay hidden, and in many cases you can't. Resistance is so much better, even at 5 players.

Interesting take on the Werewolf genre. Compared to more vanilla, or just less mechanical, hidden-roles and/or deduction games, this game definitely suits the players that aren't all in for JUST the role play aspect. It also fills a certain desire for tactical maneuvering, or at least a more physical type of maneuvering compared to the mental maneuvering required in more socially-deducing-games.

An improvement on standard Werewolf (removes player elimination), but replaced by One Night Werewolf (due to One Night being easier and faster to play).

RATING: 6
Solid game.  This is a social deduction game with no player elimination.  It is kind of like Resiatance if Resistance had more of a boardgame feel.  There are a bit more mechanics here than your typical social game.

Ultimately I got rid of this one due to its fiddly nature and being overshadowed by a much better One Night Ultimate Werewolf.

RATING: 5
Based on 1 play with 9 players:

After one game of this, I literally have no idea what to think about it. It's going to take me a couple plays to wrap my head around the strategy, I guess.

So it SEEMS like there might be no real advantage for the Werewolves to stay hidden. In which case my rating for this game will lower.

The endgame also felt super anticlimactic. It just came down to us calculating the odds of which card was likely to be the remaining werewolf, and voting for it. Meh.

With the Mason, you can actually know for sure who someone is. Which is possibly fine, but I prefer the uncertainty of The Resistance. If you have an alpha gamer in your group and you know that they're a villager, they have much more power than in Resistance where you're never SURE of who is who.

Also the whole mechanic of passing cards around the table with your eyes shut is just awkward.

And the implementation of the theme is confusing and strange. So WE'RE inquisitors, and we're... what? Interviewing suspects? How are the houses involved? Also, we're only trying to lynch the town werewolves and not the ones within our own ranks? I think my favorite moment of the game was the last round of the game, staring at the cards, knowing there was ONE werewolf left and no villagers, and someone pointed to the werewolf/villager house and shouted "What's the problem, even? WE KNOW WHERE HE LIVES!"

Ultimately everything done here is done by The Resistance in a tighter and more elegant package.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2.5
Ooooh! This game is horrifyingly bad! Wow I was underwhelmed! Where is the deduction?! Yes, you can deduct something, but there is a huge amount of luck and guessing involved, and the actual deduction is extremely limited! Okay, truth to be told we did lose the apprentice seer and the other characters whose abilities are that you can peek at certain cards early on… But still, I don’t think it would have made a big difference in my opinion of the game; a second play will tell. It also didn't seem to matter if you knew who the werewolves were among the players, and that felt a little wrong.

Oh, in the end there was 50 % chance that the good guys would win, but when a simple card draw is the cause of this I think it’s too random... This game is just awful! The way you’re choosing the cards and later vote seems very weird and the mechanism when you pass the cards around is unbelievable clunky; you need to try it yourself to see just how bad it is.

RATING: 7
Players represent members of the Inquisition, tasked with investigating a village, and attempting to umask werewolves living there.

Interesting blend of Werewolf and The Resistance, where players are either good or bad (pro-werewolf).  The village is made up of twelve huts - each granting a special action, and twelve face down villagers - a mix of innocent villagers and werewolves.

During day turns, the players take turns to use a villager hut's action, or to take 2 voting cubes (which are power in this game).  Then each player with at least a cube has to place one on a face down villager.  Villager with the most cubes is eliminated and revealed - werewolf or a villager?

During night turns, the players pass a set of villager cards around the table (eyes shut), from player to player.  The werewolves may open their eyes and reorder the cards.  At the end of card passing, the card on the bottom of the set is eaten by wolves and eliminated.

The game ends when all the werewolf villagers are eliminated, or when the werewolf villagers outnumber the remaining innocent villagers.

This was a fun game.  It was an interesting blend of two very well known games, but with some light deduction and game play elements added in.  Certainly looking forwards to exploring this one more.

RATING: 8
PERSONAL COPY. Really nothing like Werewolf, but still very enjoyable. It's actually pretty deep but you don't realize it until you've played a few games. Less guesswork than Ultimate Werewolf; plays like a co-op puzzle. Still not sure if I like it more than The Resistance, maybe time will tell.

Jól sikerült kitalálni, hogy hogyan lehet olyan játékot kreálni az eredetiből, amiben nincs kiesés, illetve kisebb társaság számára is élvezetes. Azért egyértelműen nem 4 fővel csillog a legszebben, de teljesen játszható volt, és végig kiélezett, izgalmas. Több vérfarkassal még izgalmasabb lehet, mert sokkal nehezebben derül ki, hogy ki kivel van. Az igazi pontszámát majd egy legalább hat fő party után adám csak meg.

Vártam, hogy többen sokkal jobb lesz, de hatalmas csalódás lett, egyáltalán nem állt össze. Ugyanannyi az infó a játékban, csak 8 felé oszlik, így az egész egy nagy vaktában szavazgatássá fajul.

Take the core idea of Werewolf and mix in a card game mechanic that recreates the individual roles and the townfolk. Add to it a cleverly designed voting element from columns of hidden townsfolk/werewolves and you have a really interesting take take on this tried and true Social Deduction game.  Don't worry if you get revealed as a wolf...the game still plays fine in spite of it.

Just horrible. Nothing of the original werewolf feeling (imagine: the werewolf players don't give a fuck if they are discovered). Once they kill the Fortune Teller it becomes a pointless, dull, blind guessing game. Plus horrible, inelegant mechanics. One of the worst games I've ever played. Lured in by the original werewolf and the claims from the designer, only to find a poorly designed, unrelated game. A shame.

First impression: Good, well-crafted, fun, and exciting hidden traitor style game. An interesting disconnect between the villagers actually being lynched/eaten and the players, which on the one hand does away with player elimination, but on the other makes exposure less critical.

Still, first impression is definitely good.

This is a really creative, no player elimination take on Werewolf. The players are sort of meta-playing a regular werewolf game. It's much shorter than Werewolf, and you will get to play the whole time. There is some annoying downtime, though. It's not better than a really good game of werewolf, but I think it will be at least more consistent.

Update: Lowering my rating from a 7.5 to a 7. It's a good game, but One Night and classic Werewolf are better, which leaves little room for Inquisition to get played.

I'm not a huge fan of Werewolf, but One Night Ultimate Werewolf was enjoyable.  When I heard of Inquisition, I figured I'd give it a try and it's also really enjoyable and certainly better than vanilla Werewolf.  I think it also scales rather well.  Even at three, it gives a decent feel of the real Werewolf, but keeps everyone in until the end.  Lots of fun and something I'll have to bring out again with more.

Unfortunately this game was completely eclipsed by One Night Ultimate Werewolf, which offers a similar type of experience that is more communicative and interactive, less analytical, accommodating of lower player counts, and quicker.

This is werewolf to a new level.  Werewolf 2.0 if you will.
There seems to be a lot more double and triple think than in the original.  There is no elimination and you almost always get to have a roll other than "vanilla villager".  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Even despite already owning One Night Ultimate Werwolf I traded for this and I'm happy I did.

While both solve the typical Werewolf problem of player elimination they do it in very different ways.

Inquisition does it by making the villagers NPCs which can be used by the players which also leads to its next advantage over both classic Werewolf and ONUW: You don't get stuck with being a lame vanilla villager for the entire game. Each turn you select a character from the village to use and so you will get to use some of the more interesting characters in each game.

On it's own it is not so bad. However problem is that there is One Night Werewolf which is much more fun and also more social game than Inquisition. And for me One Night Werewolf tops this in every area.

Nem tudom, hogy mindent jól játszottunk-e, de ha igen, akkor sajnos nagyon gyenge játék. Az alapötlet jó, mert egy olyan vérfarkasos játék, amiben nincs kiesés, és van benne némi társasjátékos elem. De rettenetesen kevés információja van az embernek, és az alapján kellene leadnia a szavazatait. Persze ez így van az eredeti vérfarkasosban is, csakhogy amíg abban pont a játkosok közötti interakció a lenyeg, ebben nem sok van. Pl. azt nehezen dolgozom fel, hogyha azt az akciót választom, hogy megnézek egy asztalon lévő karaktert, akkor miért kell arra mindenféleképpen szavaznom? Hiszen pont attól lenne benne döntési lehetőség, ha azt mindhatnám, látom a lapot, és nem biztos, hogy szavaznék rá. Érzek a társasban némi potenciált, de nem hiszem, hogy valaha kérném, játsszunk ezzel.

RATING: N/A
Ultimate Werewolf: Inquisition is a standalone game of deduction, secrets and betrayal with no elimination or moderator. Part of the fun is figuring out who the werewolves are on your team, but even then, you've still got to outsmart them!

More specifically, the humans need to rid the town of werewolves in order to win, while the werewolf players need to eliminate human villagers so that the werewolves can overrun the town. To do this, each round players either use the power of a villager's hut or take two votes from the supply. Each player then places one vote on a resident, and the resident with the most votes against him is lynched, with him and his hut being taken out of play. The werewolf players then secretly choose to kill a resident – but only one of those chosen by the Grand Inquisitor, a role that passes hands each round.

Hidden role game were depending on how many players (3 - 11) one or more players are secretly werewolves the rest are villagers - Villagers win if all werewolves are killed and werewolves win if there are more werewolves left alive than there are villagers.

Only played once so far, but had a lot of fun. Of course, I am biased towards anything under the Werewolf label because of my affinity for deduction games. Either way, if you want to play Werewolf with fewer players, this is the only, and a rather good option. 

Update 7/19/14: Played this with 5 tonight. The Mason action really broke the game for us. It seemed to make it MUCH easier for the villagers to win. I think the werewolves are already at a disadvantage in this game, at any player count. With the Mason removed, I think it would play a lot better. As it is though, we've played this game twice, and both times it fell a little flat. I still like it, but question how many more times I'll pull it out.

My plays have usually has involved a lot of yelling and chaos, which can be fun if you're in the right mood. It seems like the Werewolves have a more enjoyable experience, although I haven't found the game to be too unbalanced (with the suggested cards from the rulebook) and there is an ability to modify the roles that are available if you want to make it easier for one of the teams.

I do think this is a great game to play in the right settings, although it can be quite stressful so it's only something I will play sporadically (hence the seemingly low rating).

Because of the cards and the different actions available to all players & the denying others of those actions, there is maybe more strategic decisions than in your average Werewolf spin-off.

My favourite werewolf-style game, but it took a while to grow on me. Repeated plays help stir up strategies. We houserule the following: even player numbers get 1:1-ratio of werewolfs to villagers, but with one fewer werewolf card at the start (exchange a werewolf for a generic villager, and the witch to a sorcerer). This improves the game a LOT.

Can't wait to play!

UPDATE:

I like the components, some of the ideas behind it, I like how you can play it with less and it's a more micro game. But it isn't this awesome crossover between resistance and werewolf I was hoping for. It doesn't even really stand up to either one individually. It wants you to rely less on social cues and more on card logic and gameplay but not enough information is truly available to make it strategic and not just often a guessing game. In proper werewolf it may be a guessing game in theory, but you get to rely more on social/body language cues. In this one, since you're not needing to figure out who the peoople are but who the cards are. And the actions of the people don't always translate to figure out who the cards are. I don't know. It's just not as solid despite still being pretty good.. Have not kept.

Pending more plays.

Played 2 games so far with a 4 manned group [played this since we didn't have the 5+ for Avalon.  I ended up Werewolf both times and let me tell you.  Being the only werewolf is HARD!  I got most everyone to believe i was not the werewolf and convinced the players to kill off entire rows of humans, it was fun - but during it was just pure stress, looking back makes me laugh a lot.  In the end I lost both times, the last game I was 1 kill away from winning, but they basically had me cornered and I had to reveal my werewolf-intentions at the end to even get that close.

I really enjoyed the game, but I feel like playing with less than 5 people really makes the lone werewolf feel really pressured.  Highly recommend you have 5+ people to play this game!

Plays in about 15-20 minutes depending on your group.  We were able to play both games in about 35 minutes.

RATING: 6
A decent take on removing elimination from Werewolf, which is a good thing. But it has a couple of issues. Firstly, the role-playing (one of the reasons for playing Werewolf in the first place) is diminished by the gamey-ness of role selection, making it more a Resistance type game in trying to work out whether people are lying or not when they reveal what they've found after taking a role selection. So it feels not so much like Werewolf, more like a poor man's Resistance. And I say the latter because it has an awkward night phase, where everyone's eyes are closed and a set of cards are passed around the table - werewolves can look, villagers can't - but each person gets to open their eyes and pretend they've had enough time to peruse the cards and change their order (which is the werewolves' right only). So you have no idea if any of the villager's have accidently seen anything or not, and the integrity of the game rests on no accidents happening. It's a time consuming and awkward process, which is unfortunately needed for the game to progress, and there's no way around it, it just is. But it doesn't mean I like it. I'll be sticking with Avalon.

One play with me being in the villager team. I had no oppotunities to aquire any information on the central cards and did just blind guessing (I was last in play order and seer was killed early). Also there was no tension or motivation of quessing who could be the werewolf since villagers could not lynch them or affect their actions anyway. It could be that this game works better for smaller amount of players or for just those who sit left from inquisitor. But for me, playing with 8 players and sitting right from the inquisitor, this game was a total dud.

If you are a player that likes games with hidden roles, there is a lot to like about Ultimate Werewolf Inquisition. In this game, the players are inquisitors sent to a village to suss out the werewolves that have been killing their neighbors. However, some members of this Inquisitorial Squad are themselves werewolves and are working to help their kin in the village. That sounds fairly similar to the classic Werewolf/Mafia game, but Inquisition adds some twists that alleviate problems with the former. Most noticeable is the lack of player elimination. Because players are not [i]themselves[/i] members of the village, a player cannot be killed. Thus, no one is forced to sit around and watch after dying on the first turn. Second, games rapidly drive to a conclusion regardless of the number of players (the game handles 3-12 in 30-45 minutes). There are many familiar aspects to Werewolf veterans: using the Seer to check on the identity of a villager, having the hunter deal a killing blow, etc. The game is different enough that players can own both without having them occupy the same niche. I enjoy Inquisition quite a bit, and it will stick in my collection for the foreseeable future.

I am a HUGE fan of Ultimate Werewolf, and has always been my game groups favorite go to game for big parties or get togethers. Hidden role games give life to parties, especially after everyones roles are revealed, seeing who deceived you, or maybe that you were right to be suspicious. The only quarrel with Ultimate Werewolf I had, was that a large number of people is needed to get a good game going. Other games like the resistance are great for smaller groups, but even with Avalon, gets a bit repetitive and predictable after many playthroughs.
When reading the rules of this game, I almost had my doubts. It has completely new mechanics to any hidden role game that I had ever played. The game is branded with something I am so familiar with, but with very different gameplay from werewolves. I was pleasantly surprised. 

After the game arrived yesterday, I gathered a group of friends to play a small game (5 players). After the first few rounds, everyone understood the rules well enough to make the game alive. The role (hut) choosing has a very similar feel to Citadels, except you are working as a group. You will leave some huts so that the person after you can take it, to prove that you are not bad. On the other hand, you might want to take that hut and pass, just so that no one can use that ability for bad (or good!). 
Some of the cards (such as the boring vallager/warewolf huts) we thought would be useless, but through the game these become vital, as the voting becomes more intense.
(one game, a player used the seer hut to investigate a card, and found the seer. This had been a card with 'meaningless' votes already stuck on it. A werewolf reveled himself and kept putting his votes on this seer card. Because we didn't have any huts to move or destroy votes, we had to save the seer each round by outvoting the lynch votes on the seer card, and lynching another card. It turned out that the person who investigated the card was lying, and we were outvoting/saving a werewolf card all along).  

One of my few criticisms to the game is when everyone closes their eyes to pass the cards around. This relies very much on honesty, since everyone has their eyes closed, a villager holding the card could easily look at the cards and no one would know the wiser. Luckily, no one (that I know of) did this, but I am worried that new players that don't really like losing would sneak a peak. Apart from someone monitoring the game, I'm not sure how this could be fixed. 

Apart from this, everything I have to say about this game is praise. There is no moderator, you can play with as little as 3 players (though I haven't tried this). Some of the tactics and strategies are complex, while some can be obvious double bluffs. The huts are all fun and if used right can change the game drastically. I can't wait for expansions to add some more familiar characters to the game. I cannot see myself getting tired of this game very soon. 

Move over the resistance, a new party game is coming.

Grows on me the more I play it. I think there is a heavier strategy in Inquisition than other Werewolf titles, but it is often more serious and less fitting for the usual party game crowd.

Interesting take on the 'werewolf' genre, though it plays nothing like its ancestor, and IMO this is a good thing. That said it is not without its flaws... pro: no player elimination. con: figuring out who the bad guy(s) is can occur fairly early in the game and if that guy is not particular skilled then the game will lack tension.

It's a Werewolf game I actually enjoy! Probably because it is more a game about figuring out a puzzle instead of figuring out the other players. Plays great at low player counts, not so great at the higher ones if played as rules written.

If you like werewolf but hate player elimination, this one is for you. The main game Werewolf is basically duplicated on the table so that werewolves and villagers are represented as cards in a grid. During the day special roles are chosen by each player, their actions occur, and voting results in one card/role being lynched. The Grand Inquisitor for the turn then picks a column of cards which are passed around the table during the night phase. Villagers keep their eyes closed and cannot look at or change the order of the three cards. Werewolves can look at the cards and re-order them. When the cards make it around the table everyone opens their eyes, the column of cards is put back into the grid and the bottom card of that column is flipped over and has been killed by the werewolves overnight. The game ends when either all werewolf cards have been found and eliminated or when the werewolf cards outnumber the remaining villagers. Great game of deception and trust.

RATING: 5.8
The only thing that this game has in common with classical [thing=38159]Werewolf[/thing] is the card design. Other than that, it is mostly a deduction game, with a lot more knowledge, and less hidden roles, than Werewolf. Even a bit on the abstract side, which is in stark contrast to Werewolf, which very much relies on social interaction.

In one of our two games we had the problem that both seers were eliminated early, so without any information source the game degraded to blind guessing.

I have a feeling that anyone who bought this hoping that it would just be a slightly modified version of Werewolf to spice things up a little, will be very disappointed. To those of us however who are occasionally pressured into playing Werewolf and are annoyed by its lack of information, this is a quite enjoyable change of pace.

A clever twist on the werewolf theme. This time round it's not as important to keep your own identity secret. Victory or defeat is all about the cards on the table.

not bad version of werewolf - no player elim throughout. 

Like most games like this, I would think it's more "fun" being the werewolf than the villager but the challenge is the same.  I can see the seer and apprentice seer being very important to the villager cause - without them it becomes a crapshoot for the villagers and a slow methodical crushing for the werewolves.

1 play, and I'm NOT a Werewolf fan. If you are a fan, you'll probably like this a lot more than I do (and even I wouldn't mind trying this again on occasion).

Inquisition is like Werewolf but not quite. The main job is still figuring out who is lying, but everyone remains in the (shorter) game until the end. Instead of being assigned a role, players pick a role/power each turn. Instead of killing players, you're killing cards from the table. These could be villagers, or werewolves; when one group outnumbers the other by a certain margin, they win. The killing is either by vote -- each round, players use voting chips (which they earn either by passing or choosing certain characters) to publicly vote on the village cards on display -- or by selection from the wolves (although there is a pretty unique selection process for them, involving the player currently in the Inquisitor role). If a villager is killed, their role card is also removed from the game.

So the game is a nice twist, different from Werewolf, but it's still too much of a psychological game for my tastes: I'd prefer to play the game rather than the people. However, it's enough of a twist that I'm more likely to play this again than Werewolf.

This is just Werewolf and Werewolf is not for me.

The additions to this game don't really make it more interesting.  There is no actual elimination of a player but instead cards representing villagers and werewolves are eliminated according to a structure.  The game is also played using certain action huts instead of merely insisting a certain player is a werewolf or not.

There is so little ability to gain actual usable information in this game and the Werewolves get to outright choose a card to be eliminated every turn.  So who wins really just boils down to luck with the werewolves having a huge advantage.

This just isn't very fun for me.

I have never played the original werewolf but heard so much about it that I was excited to try the new "Ultimate Werewolf: Inquisition". From what I understand, two major changes to the old Ww are to get rid of the game moderator and no longer eliminate players after their identity is revealed. Both sounds like improvement to me, since the moderator part seems too role-playish for me and I dislike it when in a coop game you die and just sit and watch for the remaining game, as dramatic as character death is, it is a downer to do so.
Now to my experience with this updated version: I loved it. "The Resistance" clearly echoes in it. But where TR has more conversational parts, this one includes more actual board game elements. The point is as a villager to find and kill werewolves, as a werewolf to protect your own kind and outnumber the villagers. Helping with that are "hut"-cards with different actions to reveal the identity of the upside down villager cards. So, you talk and yell "you are a werewolf" but you use these cards, place tokens, have a vote and execute an inquisition each round. 
The game does rely on honesty though when cards get passed around with eyes closed and only werewolves are allowed to look at them. Easy to sabotage but who could do that when you enjoy gaming?
I loved this game experience, it is different enough from TR to be an alternative but close enough to make it hard for me to tell which I enjoy more. Played with 6, and I actually got to be a werewolf!

Interesting that they combined Werewolf/Mafia with some kind of worker placement mechanic. Felt that the night phase was a bit too clunky and awkward since the noise that the cards make when they're being reordered give away the Werewolves' identities and having a quiet and/or shy Grand Inquisitor can make for painfully long night phases. Would like to play it a bit more but my gaming group didn't want to play more than one game.

Also, although I disagree with the notion of buying a dedicated set of cards for playing Mafia/Werewolf (a la Ultimate Werewolf) since roles can be mapped out onto a French deck or just scraps of paper, this set can be used to distribute roles for Werewolf.

I just hate the fiddlying card shuffling and the voting cubes nearly kill the voting theme. You look at a tableau of cards and try to pick which column the werewolfe might be in and thus which one to vote on, but then they are reshuffle so where might they be? Ugh. This layout of the villagers/wolves seems to kill the spirit of the original because it adds some sort of geometry to it, and none of the psychological. The voting cubes are bizarre because they used not only to vote but also to purchase certain roles (one time use) which kills the idea of them as votes.

The Resistance/Avalon took Ultimate Werewolf and stripped out most of the roles and player elimination and changed the theme. Ultimate Werewolf: Inquisition takes The Resistance and adds variable role selection and (incredibly!) light resource management for selecting those roles and voting and changes the theme back. While they are similar in concept, they do actually play quite differently -- with Inquisition being the more "game-y" of the two. With that said, there's enough that makes Inquisition stand out that it's worth adding to your collection even if you're an avid Resistance player.

I'm generally a fan of hidden traitor games.  This one's maybe too fiddly and fragile for its own good, though.  There are too many opportunities for a "fatal error" with all the handling and passing of cards.  A fun enough game but there are other options that scratch the exact same itch while being easier and quicker to play.

The best game in the Ultimate Werewolf series so far IMHO.
Interesting game mechanics preventing player elimination, allowing all players to play all roles in the same game, and remowing the need for a moderator. Thus, the game plays well with even three players. Especially as it is more important to make your team win than keeping your identity secret.
I think of this as the gamers version of Ultimate Werewolf: It has the distinct feel of Ultimate Werewolf while being substantially deeper. 

I would not call this a party game. However, even young players used to (One Night or standard) Ultimate Werewolf and its characters easily convert to this deeper gamers game.

A fine alternative to the usual Werewolf antics (though somewhat supplanted by the excellent One Night). Some neat card play slightly marred by awkward passing mechanics, there's more of a central "puzzle" here to chew on amidst finger pointing and light deduction. It's been a hit with my regular group.

Update: This remains oddly difficult to balance in terms of picking a mix of characters/huts that works. Too much information and the village team walks away with the victory, too little and it becomes a crap shoot. While I doubt that this a game that benefits from a knife's edge balance, since there's no player elimination I would ideally want everyone playing to feel engaged for the full game.

It just feels weird in a lot of ways to me. It does do something new with the Werewolf concept which is interesting, but it also loses a lot in the process.

Specifically, the fact that the wolves should not stay hidden the whole game is a negative to me. It's new and potentially interesting, but I feel the hidden role and deduction aspects, which are probably what I love most about Werewolf/The Resistance, lose almost all of their impact. (It is nice that an outed wolf can still do something compared to a nigh worthless outed spy in The Resistance, but that situation is extremely rare.)

It also seems like the game actively tries to force a longer game that comes down to the wire. This seems good in theory, but in practice makes the game feel more random and arbitrary to me. (Yes, just as much or more than vanilla Werewolf.)

I guess I had fun with this. I was the werewolf in a four player game and basically gave myself away on the first turn, though, so I don't know how well I can judge the game with that basis. Hopefully next time I won't make such a dumb mistake, and I'll get an idea of how the game is really supposed to be played.

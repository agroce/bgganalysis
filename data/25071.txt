Cthulhu version of Munchkin. Suffers from the same problems as standard Munchkin.

In addition, the cultist cards drag this version even farther than regular Munchkin.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
It's munchkin, a crappy game with almost no strategy and a lot of the "I kill you because I don't like you" mechanics. The only thing that saves this edition is that the game itself can win and has a fun theme

RATING: 4.5
I can take a little randomness if that reinforces the theme/experience, but in Munchkin it's entirely possible to sit through an entire game (may take more than an hour) not being able to accomplish anything. There's no balance or whatsoever too, so strong players only get stronger; of course the idea was that players themselves will balance the game by annoying each other and not picking on the weaker players. This however rarely pans out as intended.

Munchkin is a fun game to play if you don't take it all too seriously. If you can relax and enjoy the funny cards and teasing each other with ridiculous monsters, than you will very much like the game.

Munchkin meets Lovecraft.  What can I say?  I love both and it works nicely.  Cultists add enough of a change to the rules to actually make it feel like more than a re-themed Munchkin.  Several expansions help add to its value.

Too massive text.
The game is confusing with their own text to the non-English primary language players.

RATING: 3
I finally got over how needlessly detailed the instructions were. After that, the game was a great deal easier (It was my first munchkin game, sue me). The ease of death kept with the the Lovecraft concept, but the entire structure was nice and light.

Definitely has some of the funnier cards I've seen in the game, but at its roots it is much the same as the other earlier wave Munchkin titles. Always play with the faster rules when possible, and you can have a good time here. Don't dwell on it.

I like each version of munchkin that I have played so far. I particularly like the cultist class in this version as it adds the extra mechanic of if everyone becomes a cultist its game over. Plus the guys I game with like to chant "One of us" each time someone becomes a cultist so that adds an extra element of fun too.

It's munchkin, and cthulhu, what more could you want? Specifically, I love how clever a lot of the cards are in munchkin cthulhu, and it's my favorite of the variants.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun enough, though there are some ambiguities in both the rules and the cards that have led the group to confusion on a few occasions. Typically these are of the "How does THIS weird card interact with THAT weird card?" variety. Requires a group with good chemistry and table-talk abilities.

Ugh really?  I am waiting for Munchkin Flux so I can Die the most painful death imaginable!!!

Otherwise known as Munchkin:  Make a bunch of crappy expansions, good for exactly one laugh in a game that should be ten minutes expanded into untold hours of torture wishing that you had the +2 rapier of suicide so you could kill yourself an get it over with all ready!

Said Game will make Steve Jackson Games a bazillion Munchkin Gold pieces off of a really boring, looong, and repetitive game, sold to gamers too brain dead from playing this stupid game to know better than to buy more crappy expansions with the same jokes rehashed over and over and over.

As a good friend once said "Once you've played onE munchkin, you've played them all." That pretty much rings true with this one too. There are a couple of new things (I like how cultists are handled) but for the most part it's just a rethemed more-of-the-same.

I hate the gameplay of Munchkin, but with 3 or 4 players it doesn't drag out too long and the humor is good for a few times through the deck.  I like the Cthulhu edition better than the standard fantasy one.  The cultist class adds a few twists to the gameplay, including a way to end the game early which can sometimes catch people off-guard.

Based on 1 play with 5 players:

My first Munchkin game. Wow, I was really expecting that I would have more to say about this than just agreeing with the general BGG consensus... but my honest impression was just an echo of everything that's been said on here a thousand times before. The SOLE "enjoyment" I got from this game was seeing the next funny card. There's just absolutely no other draw to this game. The mechanics are bland, the game runs too long for what it is, and the humor is pretty much gone after you've seen each card once. There's nothing really wrong or broken with the game (at least, nothing apparent after one play) but the mechanics are just so dull that it's not worth it unless the humor really works for you. I could see how this appeals to people who play a lot of RPGs and not a lot of board games, I guess. But for me, there's just no reason to ever play this again.

The theme appeals. The presence of cultists is about the best thing that has been added to the munchkin line. My non-gamer friends liked playing. Never played it with my game friends oddly, only munchkin.

BTW Cthulhu is two syllables, not three. Yes, Lovecraft did descibe its pronunciation variously but too many people are saying it the silly "official" Chaosium way.

RATING: 4
Rated 5 after one play. I've got a lukewarm reaction. On the one hand, I see some things to like. The fight monsters, level up, play cards on opponents... all that is actually pretty neat, and having some negotiation and "take that" built into the game means there's some fun to be had with this at the table.

At the same time, I got stuck with no hand, and needing to defeat a monster alone, pretty much locking me out of the action for a while. I'd give this a shot again if others want to play it, but I won't be seeking it out on my own. If I do, hopefully it will be with less than 7 players.

I'm not much of a Munchkin fan to be honest but I do love Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos, and that for me makes this game fun. The game plays better than regualr Munchkin though if you don'r know your Lovecraft then you won't get the enjoyment from the in-jokes.

The first game I was really disappointed with. I thought I knew what I was getting into but still, Munchkin Cthulhu disappointed me. Basically all you do is draw cards and then maybe draw some more cards and play some cards. The cards you draw deteminate what happens, you can't really make decisions about it. Good theme though, if you like other Munchkings you'll probably like this. As for me, I don't want to play this again.

My gripe with this game is how long it takes, if you are playing with 4+ players expect to play for 2.5 hours. 

I've created my own variant rules: 

-limit 7 rounds, whoever has the highest level at the end of round 7 wins. You no longer win when you reach level 10, does not matter how high you go. 

-You cannot sell items on the last round, if you wish to sell all your items for levels it must be done on turn 6 or before. 

-players start with 5 cards from each stack. 

This variant makes the aggression of game play much more even throughout the entire game, as opposed to the game really picking up from level 8 to 10 with the standard rules.

Munchkin Cthulhu is a card game where you try to get equipment, level up and whack monsters in the process.  I probably give the game less credit than it deserves.  For me it's just something I compromise to play with my friends so they play the things I like.  I will say at least it has a better theme than the other games in the Munchkin series.

Munchkin is very much an acquired taste, and one that most gamers move past quickly. This one is less friendly to new players, as most people who are familiar with Lovecraft are gamers to begin with. I am pretty sure the Venn diagram for Cthulu fans and role players looks a whole lot like a single circle... People who have already been there and one that with Munchkin.

There's better, faster-playing "take that" games these days, but I wouldn't mind playing again with the right crowd. This was one of the better versions as the insanity of it fits the theme, and the alternate game end condition with the cultists was neat.

This game is dark! you have to be so bad, so evil!
In this game you must trick and lie to your friends in the worst ways possible!
My group and I would get as far as making people cry in order to win!

This game is the perfection in the backstabbing genre!

Plays best with 4-6 players with all expansions and Munchkinomicon

See "Munchkin" but with the works of HP Lovecraft being torn to shreds.
The benefit this expansion/variant has is an extra rule. If all players become 'Cultists' then the game ends prematurely and Cthulhu wins. This game has tons of ways of making players into cultists and actually adds a fun way for people to wrap up the game when it *needs* to end.
The theme also works better, than others, and lends itself to some immaturity, while embracing the paranoia and insanity that both Munchkin and HP Lovecraft hold close.
It is by no means great, but it was the most fun I had with any of the Munchkin series.

Still Munchkin, though I think the theme doesn't work quite as well here. The classes are complicated and yet rather similar to each other and the concept of cultists adds confusion without adding fun. If you must play Munchkin, stick to the original. However, it will suffer from many of the same problems as this one: lack of options, overriding chance, runaway leader, and simply too long for what it is.

As with all Munchkin Games, most if not all of the fun comes from the theme, the funny references and the (limited) player interaction. The game mechanic itself is simplistic and not very engaging. This game is practically void of tactical decisions other than bargaining for help - which most of the time, especially in smaller groups, is not even necessary. A game for in-between and theme diggers (like myself).

Definitely not as gripping or fun as regular Munchkin. It's based on a very niche "monster hunting" genre, so if you know nothing about the cthulhu genre (see: Arkham Horror), you won't get most of the references. There is only class and no race in this version, although the addition of the cultist class makes things interesting.

The art, theme, and text combine for a cute take on Lovecraft.

Using that house rule makes it a fairly entertaining game, though, and I pick it back up every now and then when we have an hour to kill.

28.10.2009: Better than Munchkin. If theme doesn't matter, get this instead of regular Munchkin. It plays faster because there's more low level monsters and it has some additional win conditions that also speed up the game. But it's still very similar to Munchkin, so if you don't like that you'll probably don't like this one either.

All the fun of a Cthulhu mythos RPG without the role-playing.  Of course, role-playing is the primary point of RPGs.  On the other hand, I do think this game is a fun diversion to quickly kill monsters, gather loot, and build a character all with fun pokes at RPG and Cthulhu culture.

I am a huge Lovecraft fan, and I enjoy munchkin alot. Having said that I'm not a huge fan of this expansion if only because of the Cultist class. One of their powers is having a  1 for every other cultist in the game. This in my opinion, is a huge imbalance, or at least can be once people start being converted. I like the theme and the new monsters, just didn't like the (even to overpowered for munchkin) cultist class.

I was told the rules were improved over basic Munchkin -- I didn't see it. I was hoping the humor would refresh the game for me -- didn't happen. The humor was so bad it made the game worse. The clever bits that made Munchkin funny and fun for a few times didn't work here. Giving something a silly name doesn't cut it. Another sad attempt to cash in on the Cthulhu Mythos license.

Not one of Munchkin's best efforts; still hilarious if you are an HP Lovecraft fan and worth it for that alone.  But it's almost too straightforward - a lot of monster boosters, but not a lot of cards you don't see coming. Definitely worth grabbing to add some cards into a mixer deck though

Maybe I'm just a sucker for the Lovecraft theme, but this one seems to play better than the standard Munchkin. It can still be a slog towards the end, but once you go mad as a Cultist you can just act crazy and try to screw everyone over even more. 

It plays best when you don't care about winning but rather just try to go mad.

Munchkin Cthulhu is a stand-alone game in the Munchkin line, this time lampooning Lovecraft's Mythos and the horror gaming that surrounds it. Brought to you by Steve Jackson (I) and John Kovalic, this set features four new Classes -- including the Cultist -- and a lot of classic monsters from outside reality. And they all have Stuff you can take from their twitching bodies.

I like this Munchkin version over the classic one, specially because of the status of "Cultishness" and Madness. 
If you and your friends are into the Cult and like Goomi`s Unspeakable Vault this is the perfekt Munchkin game for you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
As per munchkin: if you like the topic the jokes are silly but quite funny however they do not carry a game of this length, especially with more than 3 players.  While the planes/portals are interesting they can hugely increase the length if a "bad" one comes up before a long gap between portals.

Munchkin is fun but is really milking things with all the different themes.  Biggest problem is that all games end up the same way (one person almost wins, everyone teams up on him/her, this continues until everyone runs out of cards they can use to screw the person.  Can also take a while between turns.

Its a fun game of Munchkin.  However, if you're not that familiar with the Cthulhu Mythos then much of the humor will be lost on you.  The new Cultist class is a very nice twist on Munchkin.

My first Munchkin game - bought in Arizona - and much tougher monsters than Munchkin vanilla. The slowness of advancing up levels and the low number of players (the cultist thing doesn't work well with only three) made this merely an OK experience.

Cthulhu, what's not to love? Well, the Munchkin game system is somewhat - well, not broken as such, but wobbly in the way a game can last 5-120 minutes, seemingly at random. I really like the humour in all the Munchkin games and my kids like playing - but the Munchkin Impossible is probably favourite (the theme is more their style)

Discarded unplayed.

I bought it for the theme.  I need to stop buying Lovecraft games just because of the theme.

The cards weren't even as amusing as I'd hoped.

I had only played Munchkin once before this, but even amongst non-gamers we had fun with this. The rulebook is quite poorly written, and the rule that states that the game owner should decide upon clarification of other rules, while cute, seems to indicate awareness of the confusing nature of the rulebook.

Initially the 'Cultist' class appeared quite broken, as there neither the rules or the card itself seems to indicate any incentive for the first player to become a cultist. It was only after deciphering the game example in the rulebook that we were able to work out that Cultists have their *own* +2 bonus, in addition to the +2 bonus for any additional Cultist in play. This, in addition to Cultist-only equipment, were the discoveries that turned the Cultist into a desirable class for the first player to play the card.

All up, both the board game enthusiasts and non-gamers enjoyed it, so it will certainly return to the table. One of the participants is now set on buying it, so I suggested he consider getting one of the other themes to prevent doubling up and expanding our collective, uh, collection.

Got this some time ago but never got around to playing it.  Played it with the first expansion, Call of Cowthulhu and it seemed to take quite a long time before something happened.

Either this was because we had never played it before or there were too many cards coming up with not that many monsters which dragged the game out.  I reckon it will get better the more we get to play it and possibly a selective wittling down of cards before each game.

The Munchkin games are a little paradoxical - they can be wacky and silly and fun, and they can also drag on and just be the same few actions each turn.  Good for introducing non-gamers to something new and simple enough for younger players, but not something I will pull out on a super frequent basis because nothing much changes from play to play.  The same holds for all the expansions.

I prefer the Munchkin Cthulhu alternate victory conditions. If all players are Cultists, the game ends and the highest-level player wins. But if only one player is left as a non-Cultist, he gains a level (even at 9th level) and can win. But, as more players become Cultists, each Cultist becomes more powerful. Heck of a balancing mechanism.

I can see why certain groups enjoy this kind of thing, but it's certainly not for me. I truly do not enjoy games where a significant dimension of the strategy (if such it can be called in a game of this nature) involves such pointed nastiness. 

Gameplay is too loose/chaotic/clunky; there's far too much text on the cards, and accordingly, too much time parsing; the (attempted?) humour doesn't do much for me, either. Yeah: hard pass.

Played the original munchkin the first time. Thought it was fun. Went to get the Cthulhu version. It was OK...

It's not for care bears and non-aggresive players for sure. You'll always come to a stalemate and only start acting when one player is a level away from winning, which I think takes the fun out of most of the game. 

The munchkin formula gets old really fast.

Not much more to say regarding Munchkin I haven't already said. I think the Cultist thing is pretty confusing, but after we figured it out the rest of the game was fun. Game still takes hours and hours even with 5.

This is probably as close to heaven as card games can take me (I wait to be proven wrong). Not only is it my beloved Munchkin but it has combined with elements of H.P. Lovecraft's writing to make a truly unforgettable gaming experience. If anything, Munchkin: Cthulhu punishes you more than any other Munchkin game out there and it has no qualms about throwing off the balance of play in the name of a good joke.

If I want to play a funny take that card game, I'll play Gloom. It does it a lot better and with cool transparent cards. :) Munchkin just feels... stupid. I'm sure many others can find this fun, but it's not for me. It certainly didn't help that I'm not familiar with Cthulhu mythos.

Not like the Munchkin games are known for their sophisticated humor, but some of the puns in this one make me cringe.  And I like puns!

Otherwise pretty cool.  The cult mechanic is a neat idea, though it doesn't influence the game as much as the designers seem to want it to.  I do love the monster enhancers that can played on cultists for a permanent bonus, though.

Cthulhu is always welcome in my games.  The alternate win scenario of everyone becoming a cultist is rather humorous.  Always have one d-bag in the group trying to convert everyone else.
I probably would have given this a 9 like the Zombie version, but it gets a bonus mark for the Lovecraftian stuff.

It's Munchkin.  If you like original Munchkin and the Lovecraft mythos it's probably going to be enjoyable.  The rules are a little more complicated than the original but if you've played Munchkin before it shouldn't be hard to adjust.  I would recommend the original over Cthulu.

Ah, my first Munchkin - sure it had to be Cthulhu to lead me to it. Though I haven't played other Munchkins I read about and saw the TableTop episode. Anyway, the gameplay is simple and I had some fun with the game. However, Munchkin - Cthulhu or not - is sure not meant to last for more than 45 minutes. The game can drag (and usually this is the deal breaker for the Munchkin kind), but this version of Munchkin has another trigger for the end game: if everyone became a cultist, the person with the higher level wins.

I also liked the "scenarios" cards, that makes the game different inside the same match.

So, though I'm not keen the play it again, I wouldn't mind much to do it.

This game can either be extremely fun or extremely frustrating. If you don't take this game too seriously then you will have a lot of fun, win or lose. The cards are very humorous at times and you never know what to expect from the opposing players. Based on the luck involved and the combination of helping players and screwing players over, I would only recommend this to casual players as there is very little strategic/competitive value. Otherwise, if you're looking for some good laughs with friends then consider picking this game up.

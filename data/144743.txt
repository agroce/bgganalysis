RATING: 7
Sucker Punch meets Cthulhu, in a dungeon!  This game looks great and has a lot of cool thematic content including novel items, chapter card-driven campaigns and rich characters.

It had some production problems, most notably game tiles that warp and player marker stands that don't quite fit.  It's a modest annoyance, but shouldn't be a deal breaker.

I'd give it a higher rating save for two limitations.  First, we found it repetitive - draw, spawn, run or fight.  This, at times, bogs down the progress of the stories.  Second, it's a punisher.  If you don't mind dying a lot, you can discard this criticism.

RATING: 10
One of the best dungeoncrawlers for me at the moment!
The combination of the Cthulhu mythos and Steampunk is just great! Great game mechanics and very good story (read them in parts at the Spiel and also played a test game)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pros:
+ Great Cthulu-steampunk theme
+ Not the usual boring and repetitive dungeon crawl for retards (although Machina can sometimes drag a lot)
+ Nice artwork
+ Great story telling (not the so-so Cthulhu "narrative" of Arkham Horror)
+ Good exploration 
+ Satisfactory replayability
+ Satisfactory equipment system
+ Simple and effective AI
+ After you learn, it becomes easy to follow rules (although not easy to master and even less to succeed)
+ It can involve some brain-burn puzzle trying to predict monsters movement and maximize attack, traps, doors and barriers activation
+ Good quality components, specially cards; see note below for tile warping problem
+ The designer - Juraj - is an active BGG member, receptive and always ready to help

Cons:
- Rules book is really really bad, very disappointing; takes a lot of time/effort to learn the game (BGG forum, summaries, Encyclopedia Arcana)
- Excessive rules, excessive things to control during gameplay; maybe just an effect of rules book but anyway I think there's plenty of space for improvements and simplification
- It is somewhat common for being caught in a cat-mouse situation, where you keep running from creatures because you can't kill them (e.g. running from an ethereal creature because you don't have a kill ethereal ability so you last resort is to activate a trap)
- Stands are poor designed and need to be replaced
- Hard to read small text on chapter cards; these cards must be bigger (take Legends of Andor as a good implementation)
- Explorer and monsters tokens are all the same size and shape, there's no difference in cut/shape/size to help identify them

Neutral:
+- The game is challenger; it makes you feel really insignificant
+-  Although there's plenty of space for tactical decisions, dice rolls can destroy everything (and usually that is exactly what happens); it's not that bad but could be less dice dependent and a little more predictable; this can be partially remedied with some simple house rules
+- It is not unusual to spend the whole day trying to finish a scenario
+- Have no problem with tiles warping, but some people complaint about it (that is a common problem for board games; even famous games like Zombicide suffer from tile warping)
+- Small size cards are hard to shuffle (specially item cards); being non-standard size means it is hard to find a high quality sleeve that fit; luckily cards are on the high quality side

Verdict:
* Not perfect but far from being bad. Probably one of the best dungeon crawl and Cthulhu inspired game out there
* I really hope the designer comes with a new, improved edition or even a new game; the man is talented (and that is only his first game)

Art is cool. The theme looks good. But once you open the rule book it all seems a bit too fiddly. Backed this game on Kickstarter some time back because I didn't see too many other Cthulhu based games besides Fantasy Flight's that we liked. Unfortunately for this game Eldritch Horror came out first and that game does everything I thought Machina Arcana would do and does it better. So this one gets a pass mostly on bad timing.

Great fun, amazing art, and some really dark atmosphere. Bought the kickstarter and got the bonus scenarios (though we havn't played them yet). I feel like there is tons of potential for this game, but I have a hard time getting people to sit down for an hour to play.

RATING: 9
Great artwork, neat game system. But at first we started to play many aspects wrong due to the rulebook.

The rulebook is not that good and should be improved. I wrote a summary sheet for it (alpha) but hopefully it will help to get into the game.

The equipment system is great and really captures the feeling of a dungeoncrawl game.

Update: 9 (gamplay-wise it is a stellar 10, but the rulebook causes the 9)

+ great campaign system
+ great story telling
+ smooth and tactical gameplay
+ great sense of exploration
+ replay value according to variety of monsters, map tiles, items
+ breathtaking artwork

- rulebook is not well organized and some important rules are missing or not that clear
- no stats improvement on the heros (only development over items)
- replay value according to the story telling is not that great because you know the flavour texts of the different scenarios after one playthrough
- very very long


But all in all it is the best coop-dungencrawl yet. Better than Mice & Mystics and the D&D games easily because the gameplay is more involving and the character development is better integrated into the whole campaign.

I really fell in love with this game.

Monster Threat is 1 to 10
Monster Level is 1-4 (each time the Monster Level increase to another level; take out the Monster of that level and shuffle them into the draw deck.  Whenever the Monster Level increase to 5.  Each player must discard an equipment card or have his or her Explorer destroyed)
Horror Rating is to facilitate the playing of Event (something like playing the Mythos card) Question: Does each player roll make a dice roll for the Horror event or only 1?  Remember 0 is considered to be a 10 unless you play the easy mode.

What are the phases in the game?
The game has 4 phases
Explorer Phase - each explorer must finish activating their abilities before the next one (unless we play the variant mode like what available in Eldritch Horror and Mistfall).  This game allows the players to decide who should start first, then second and so forth.

When do we increase the Monster Threat?
Monster Threat will increase if there is already of 4 monster on the board and anew one needs to be spawn.  Do not place the 5th monster but move the Monster Threat to the next number/level.

How does the Monster activate?
The Monster activate by queue.  That's the reason why there are monster cards to be queue up on the card panel and the standees on the modular board.

When it activates, it will often attempt to play its ability and then move or move to the a range where it can play its ability.

How does the Monster choose to move?
The monster will not move if it is already in the nearest space to an Explorer
It will always choose to move towards an Explorer with the lowest health as it can smell the Explorer weakness and want to go in for the kill (unless the Monster card stated otherwise).

What will increase the Horror Rating?
Whenever the Monster Threat reach 10

When can we get 'better' treasure?
When the chapter effect adds a specified treasure level.


Why do we need to activate the Chapter Space?
This allows your Explorer to progress through the story.

How do I activate the Chapter Space?
You are require to spend 3 stamina and 3 essence if the Chapter Space is unlit or only 3 Stamina if the Chapter is lit.
However, Explorers adjacent to the Chapter space or those adjacent to the Explorer that is made to activate the Chapter Space can contribute essence (including those Explorer which is adjacent to the Explorer which is adjacent to the active Explorer).

How can the Chapter Space be lit?
When you seal a Monster Spawn.

When do we place the entry token?
When you enter into another tile, you need to put the Entry Token on the tile on the space in which you enter or explore.

When do we place the exit token?
Whenever you are instructed to do so with the new Chapter card that is revealed.

What happen if a monster is destroyed?
An explorer can gain 1 Essence from destroying Monster (This was something we forgot, dang) Should highlight this in a box.

What happen if an explorer is dead?
Destroy half the explorer's item - and then leave the rest to be picked up by another explorer later.
The player choose another Explorer.  (Where does this explorer start)  Place the new explorer on a passable and unoccupied space adjacent tom or on top of an existing entry token.

TREASURE (explain this later in the game)
This is a unique part of the game
Combining items you have acquired
Apparel, Weapon, Artifact, Consumable, Augment

How do we gain Treasure?
Activating Treasure space.  By interacting with the treasure space, you restore 1 essence.  (Need to highlight this)
Draw 2 treasure card.  Keep it or pass it to adjacent explorer. 
You may destroy the other card OR place it on top of the treasure deck.  (Can you communicate what treasure you have revealed???)


How do we equip?
There are like slot limit.  Explorer can only equip one item per treasure type with the exception of weapon if it has one hand symbol.

What is the different between upgrade and augment?
You augment by looking at the symbols to determine whether they match.

How do we augment?

So I talked about the objective of the game (going through the story, exploring the cavern and achieve the victory condition at the end), anatomy of explorer player sheet - stamina, and essence (require Stamina to move and perform certain actions), and essence (require to pay for certain card effects/abilities or trigger certain things on the board)
Explorer has Armor, Will and Health
Movement of Explorers and Monsters can be both orthogonal or diagonal.  Explorers and monsters cannot pass each other.
Attack can also me made at a target is on adjacent orthogonal or diagonal space.
The Explorer and Monster attack by rolling dice.  Black dice deal more damage.
White 0.1.1.1.2.2
Black 0.1.1.2.2.3

Movement - additional rule
Link space must be present and unobstructed in order to move diagonally

Icons
Each item will have a Stamina cost to be paid in order to activate/use.
A circle with an X inside means destroy the item when used.
An arrow pointing to an X means drop the item on the target space when used.
Melee: No small x in the the cross hair. Can only attack adjacent units.
Cross-hair with small x. Ranged Attack.  Must follow line of sight.  Draw a straight line from the center of the space and the center of the space of the target unit/explorer 
Cross-hair with spiked borders. Ignore obstacles. Like psychic attack.

Other special abilities (explained only when these abilities emerge in the game play)
Ethereal - can be attacked indirectly using traps, exploding barrels, or other abilities.  Cannot be targeted by other units unless they have abilities or items that can target such units.
Switch Position
Control Monster
Teleport
Push

You push can trigger the exploding barrel.
You want to push units into the pits.

Explain about the Explorer Anatomy
Talk about the basic rules first
Talk about movement and then attack
Only then go through the phase of the game.

There are two Events
Explorer Events and Horror Events
Default explorer event, scenario explorer event, ongoing explorer event, quest explorer event

Horror Rating is the horror event value.  ONLY one player roll for Horror Event.

Tile is always 2x2 due to the scrolling effect

Lay out the tile and explain what are there?

Great Writing! Like the Characters as well... nice artwork! (The Black and White Creatures are hard to tell apart sometimes... ) Cardboard stands are bad... Dice are Great! Punchboard for Game Room Tiles are very thin and are partially warped.. after playing with them for a while and trying to stack them under another game for a day, they still are warped...Rulebook certainly does not go in depth about the rules. There were alot of times when I had to go digging for a rule and it took a while to find it... Table of Contents in the Back of the Book (LOL) Played the 30min (Extra Fast Game) in about 3hrs because of Rules Questions and learning time... note: I had read the rules about 3 times in a row to learn the game :) But overall... when it was all said and done... in our Four Player, very challenging Game... we had Fun! So.. in closing... now that I've struggled and learned the game... I'm looking forward to playing it again, in a longer game fashion.... but not longer because I'm digging for Rules... Longer because I use more than 3 Scenario Cards LOL!  I hope they make some better player reference cards and perhaps a revised rulebook that is cohesive ... Otherwise... worth playing if you like Theme and Horror Steampunk!

I feel bad for giving this a poor review because it's clearly a work of passion. Backed the kickstarter for Exclusive content. Kickstarter was handled brilliantly. Game is confused, clunky, lacking in atmosphere (surprisingly) and the narrative text is excruciatingly bad. The rulebook is a god-awful mess. The game doesn't seem to end. You just keep playing with replacement characters until you as a player lose the will to live.

Now so far I have only played a handful of times on solo mode but that's because I don't want to drag friends into playing it. Maybe with a couple of more players it will improve. 

I can excuse the narrative text because English is not the designer's native language. However the characters are the kind of bad, cliches that you expect from an adolescent writing their first sci-fi story.

Finally the artwork is murky and hard to decipher.

So far very disappointing. May try it again but more likely to offer it for sale. Hate to be so negative about what is clearly a work of real love for the designer.

Another dungeon crawler, with the steampunk theme attached. I liked it a lot despite some shortcomings in the art department (in general, everything is too dark even to notice different types of spaces at times; and the enemies look too similar and you can spend more time than desirable looking for the right tokens). Good game.

The artwork is beautiful, the gameplay solid, and it's very difficult but the atmosphere is incomparable. The only thing is the board warpage.

Awful rules: it took us an hour just to figure out which card goes with which scenario. Poor card stock quality: the boards warp. The token holders doesn't fit figures, and the names of the monsters cannot be read once placed in the holders. Heroes and monsters and all done it "atmosphaeric" b/w, so they are difficult to discern from each other.

RATING: 7
Preliminary rating after a few solo plays. The score on this one could go up, but probably not down. This is an action-point driven dungeon-crawl game which focuses more on interactions with the board elements than it does with combat. That's not to say there isn't a lot of combat. There is, as monsters are spawning all the time! However, the monsters in this one are obsticals to manage or control rather than an end in themselves (except in the finale). It is easy, however, for the monsters to get out of hand, which makes this game very difficult to beat.

The objective is really to progress through the chapters of a scenario to the end. Four scenarios come with the KS and they range from 4 to about 10 chapters in size. To progress a chapter, you need to activate a certain space on each map tile. So, for a ten chapter scenario, you will need to explore at least 10 map tiles to get to the end (maybe more if you were unable to activate the space on some tiles before being forced to leave). Other spaces to activate can net you some equipment, have a positive event occur, give you a quest - nothing too grand, activate a trap, blow stuff up, or heal you. You are ALWAYS trying to activate these spaces and the monsters are ALWAYS distracting you...

The rule book is poorly laid out and the reference page on the back of the book is pitifully insufficient. The rules are all there I think, they are just hard to find and your first game will have you flipping through the rule book constantly for basic stuff. After a few map tiles, though, it gets easier.

My biggest disappointment with the game are the scenarios. I have yet to get a strong sense of story that I care about, as most of the scenario text is atmospheric. There isn't a strong plot, or any plot really, which is a shame. On the plus side of this, the game seems to value replayability moreso than telling a story. The scenario chapter cards provide text, but in game terms they usually unlock something (like more powerful treasures) or alter some game state slightly. There are scenario specific horror and explorer events, but they are randomly shuffled with the core decks and so can't possibly contribute to the plot in a meaningful way. Except for the finale tile, and possibly the start tile, board tiles are random, so you won't find any story there until the finish. Whatever fun is found here is more in the atmosphere and mechanics than in the printed story.

Most game elements are common to dungeon games. The one thing I found different, and interesting, is the concept of "essence". You start with no essence, but accumulate it in the game by finding stuff, using stuff, and killing stuff. You need essence, in most cases, to unlock new chapters so it is a cool twist on the idea of experience points that allows you to advance. You can also use essence in other useful ways, so balancing the need to progress with the need to stay alive is where the heart and soul of the game resides.

My big question is whether the mechanics and atmosphere are enough to keep me coming back with no story to speak of. We'll see....

RATING: 8.5
Arrived 9 months after seeing it at Essen via KS.

My rating is boosted by +1.0 based on the extremely good artwork and a very sincere try by the designer to produce a game with horror, Cthulhu, coop, and above all a story orientated narrative.

However, there are far too many ambiguities in the rules which are written in a mixed up, illogical order. Some of the BGG summary sheets help, but overall it is hard work to get through a long game without making a few house rules up about what some of the cards mean and what the monsters are supposed to do (especially when they start queuing up outside closed doors).

I like this game but I would really like to enjoy it even more. I certainly don't regret buying it. A diamond in the rough perhaps?

Atmospheric tension builds up throughout the game to a brilliant Cthonic climax that will leave players breathless- an utterly fantastic Lovecraftian cooperative experience. Kickstarter version is well worth seeking out for the exclusives- extra tiles/scenarios add much needed longevity and the ultra high quality etched KS dice are simply chrometastic. Unfortunately Two points are deducted due to the badly translated rulebook (better versions are now available online) and one simply Must Buy a pack of FFG plastic token holders - don't use the ones included with the game or you will damage the monster & hero tokens!

We had a lot of fun playing Machina Arcana. What's not to like about having access to a whole bunch of arcane weapons that you can upgrade and augment to make them even better? Who can honestly resist the temptation to wield a Chainsword?!

There are boots that let you move in a direction until you reach an obstacle, awesome.
Items that let you teleport 1 space, no longer do you have to abide by the laws of walls like a puny little human.

Then there are those moments you think you have a great idea for the next turn... only to be stuck behind a door with 3 monsters on the other side *gulp*.

Or having all explorers gain 1 health, only to realize that the current horror card says explorers can't gain health, sigh.

The manual could use some more work to clarify game mechanics though. Reading the 'rules forum' over here at BGG and going through the "Encyclopedia arcana" on the official website is recommended.
There are also some summary PDF's in the 'Files' section that were a big help to us for a quick reference while playing.

It is not a game you just casually start, it takes a looong time to progress through the chapters and collect gear. I'm talking hours. Inventory management for 4 players can also gobble up time. Start early in the day.

I saw this at Essen and was impressed by the artwork and theme but ultimately did not KS it. I've now played another's copy and keen to play again. The Equipment cards and combat seem to work well but I'm finding it difficult to nail down why I don't mind not having my own copy. It may be that the board focusses on using lots of board features, potentially most turns, rather than in a game like Descent, for example, where it might take several turns to reach "one particular chest" or to gain a specific boost. 
It just gives a different emphasis and it may grow on me, but my interest may also fade.

A great example of a survival horror board game. You can really feel the panic as the odds stack against you. Very challenging. My only complaints would be that the random story cards don't align very smoothly and can create some unintentionally silly moments. Also, unless you are running from every enemy and skipping looting for treasure, the game can take a long time. Overall, this is a good game to consider if you don't like having a GM/Overlord player, like Descent. Th A.I. enemies are simple, but challenging. Glad to have it in the collection.

The game is great. Not perfect. Nothing is perfect. But Juraj really is doing a great job, so i don't mind stuff lika a confusing manual. Gameplay is lot of fun, atmosphere is awesome. Im absolutely satisfied.

It's a very long game, but it has interesting mechanics, so we didn't find that we were bored or frustrated by the length. I enjoyed the game, and would certainly play again. That being said however, the game is very punishing, and with that and the length of the play time, I don't feel that people who are not huge fans of co-op games would like this game at all.

Okay game, nice artwork. Some rules have 0 sense, like, okay I get you can't shoot at a guy standing close to the door, but then there is a guy you could shoot at, standing next to him, but you actually can't because guy who you can't see is standing in a way...

With some rules tweak etc. it could be really something ;)

This is a steampunk horror adventure game without the need for any kind of GM or overlord player.  Each player takes the role of an adventurer trying to accomplish goals and gear up to fend off increasingly difficult Lovecraft-ian monsters while progressing through a story.

The most interesting part of this game is the equipment system.  You can equip different kinds of equipment to different slots and these equipment can be augmented, sometimes in multiple ways.  It feels neat to find new, interesting items, and then be able to tack on accessories to increase their effectiveness.

Past that though this was a mostly uninteresting experience.  There's nothing wrong with it and it is neat that the monsters are controlled via AI so everyone can play together but you can tell they put a lot of effort into, and the biggest draw are the stories.  But the stories attempt to be too generic to fit each experience so they really end up just not being engaging and I can't remember a single detail of the story from the last time I played.

The rest of the game (except the equipment system of course) is very been there, done that and the production values aren't the best.  I like the insert and the atmosphere is pretty well done.  But the colorless art is also ugly and reminds me of the horrible art from the first edition of Catacombs.  And standees in a world of miniatures in this day and age don't impress.

Overall a fine game with some okay ideas but in the end it is mostly just an also-ran with nothing to really grab me.

Gritty and merciless dungeon explorer, dripping with lovecraftian theme.

Love the theme! The game play is a little meh. Not everything they are trying to do works and some actions are a bit clunky. 
The story is ok, but a bit confusing. 
Its a very hard game to play/win though so you have to be dedicated and focused.

Have to play it, so no rating yet.

But the components are not the best, all, even the rule board are bending by themselves.
The 2 smaller cards does fit any sleeves I have like Fantasy Flight sleeves or Ultra Protection.
The box is too small to fit everything in a nice way.
Have to throw the monsters and explorers with stands (cannot remove or you damage them) in the space between the gaming boards and the box...
If you put the monsters into stands, you cannot read the names anymore by a few monsters.
The inlay doesn't fit sleeved cards.

Solitaire works. Not an easy game, but lots of depth and solid environment.

This is a great game. I got it through Kickstarter. Nice blend of steampunk and horror. Kickstarter site has a very good play though. Nice feel to the game. It does take a while to learn the game but after a few turns not a problem. 
A couple of hints: Choose the explorers carefully and get a good mix. Pick one explorer who can provide a health boost as those monsters hit hard and you will lose health quickly. Work in pairs and hit the treasure and work benches, then come together and trade gear.

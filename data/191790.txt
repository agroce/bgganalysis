GAME: Empires in America (second edition)
RANK: 4641

RATING: 8
There are some reasons why this game wouldn't be for everybody. First, you can get hosed by the card distribution. the arrival of Montcalm, Wolfe can decide the game as well as the timing of the War in Europe. I played back-to-back games and lost on the 2nd turn and then turned around and got a perfect distribution and never got threatened. These things happen in card games and for a State of Siege game, this one seems to be a bit more dependent than the others.

With that said, I think it's one of the most innovative designs in this family. All State of Siege games have armies on tracks and you roll to push them back. However, instead of a number on a counter for you to roll against, you actually battle the marker. You select an army and a leader and go up against that army and (probably) the leader. Your leader's rating and other factors will determine who rolls first. The number of regiments, support, militia, proventials, and Native Americans will determine how many dice you throw in combat. You manage leaders, replacements, support... much deeper and much less abstract than the other games in the series. Would you expect any less from Joe Miranda? But unlike many of his designs, this one was developed really well. So yeah, you can get hosed by a draw, but overall, you are going to a see a tightly contested game. It is on the long side, though. I think 2 hours is a minimum, but the satisfaction is much higher.

And if you have the first edition, I will say that the 2nd edition upgrade is worth it.

Empires in America plays unlike the other States of Siege (SoS) games I've experienced. It provides a hybrid SoS/traditional war game experience at a playtime more in line with the typical SoS title (e.g., in about an hour for a win condition).  And while I feel like I enjoyed the experience after the game is done, it doesn't feel as enjoyable as other SoS games while its being played. In the end, Empires in America seems to straddle the line between the SoS experience and the war game experience a bit too much, as I need to be in the mood for that shorter hybrid experience. 

As compared to other SoS titles, the hand management aspect of Empires in America adds an interesting wrinkle, but the battles and round progression slow down SoS's typical fast game play.  The game does provide interesting decisions on each turn that (a) require evaluation on the risks and rewards involved, and (b) feel different than those involved in similar SoS titles. 

There's one thing to note about the rule book and card text. Overall, the clarity of the rules, the way in which card text resolves onto the rules, and the ease of reference in the rule book itself are all decidedly the worst out of all the VPG titles I've played.

Update, Nov. 2017: Yeah, this is my least favorite of the SoS games that I've played. If I want SoS combined with hand management, I'll play Zulus on the Ramparts. If I want a pure SoS experience, I'll play Cruel Necessity. If I want a neat twist on SoS, I'll play Mound Builders. Then there's Dawn of the Zeds, 3rd, which is just great on its own. Too bad, as I'm partial to this game's historical setting.

This game has some quirks that I am still trying to unquirk.  Time and more play experience is needed.  My initial impression it that this is a very good solo game.

Good design with a nice tension mechanism and I like the theme.  I just was not as interested in the choices during the game play. 

1 play w/ all optional rules.

Fantastic solitaire based on French and Indian War.  Decent depth and very rich if you read flavor text.  One of my fav solitaires along with Cruel Necessity.

I had one aborted play with the 1st edition, but I was keen to get the updated 2nd edition Gold Banner version. The components in it are first class, although the map is not mounted. It needs some plexiglass or thin glass over the map to keep the two sheets together and flat. I find that the gameplay is more fiddly than other SoS games, and there is a lot of dice rolling - some battles you end up rolling multiple 6-sided dice to score hits. It is quite a long game for a SoS game, so it may not get as much table time as some of the other titles in my collection. I won my first game. I need to play it more to give it a final score, but after 1 play this is a 6 rating for me.

After several plays, I have upgraded my rating from 8.5 to 9.5 because I've really enjoyed the solo gameplay. I love the interaction between the various decks & the way that combat is conducted between the French & British leaders. I like to keep stats and have a top ten ranking for the various leaders --- I think there are 19 in the game. The theme is perfect for me because I lived in Montreal for over 30 years, & this game oozes with theme and historical flavor text. Yes, the luck of the cards is a major element in the game but that doesn't bother me because there are still important decisions to be made & I care less about winning/losing than simply watching the exciting events unfold. Both sides are well balanced & have equal chances of winning (if the luck element doesn't bother you) because you never know which cards come up next to either help you or hurt you. This is my first Victory Point Games product but it certainly won't be my last --- I already have my sights on Nemo's War (Second Edition) & Dawn of the Zeds (Third Edition). These days I am almost exclusively a solo gamer except for Duel of Ages II.

One of the best States of Siege games. I really like the way Joseph Miranda utilizes the card play in his States of Siege games. Another shining example of what the States of Siege system can be.

One of my favourite VPG SoS games - the use of the deck of cards in providing historical figures on which you place chits for reputation and battalion strength; plus in the case of the Brits placing them on the board; is particularly clever. And the fact the French (your troops) aren't on the board at all because they are everywhere so can attack the Brits anywhere is so simple it's genius. I love the colour and design of the board and the cards. Some people may quibble about cost for the components provided but I've always liked VPG's homemade look which, sadly, has been superseded with the retirement of their laser cutter.

Also have A Few Acres Of Snow and 1812: Invasion of Canada. Different dates, similar wars.

Fantastic components. What an upgrade compared to the first edition! And soon, a mounted map. I'm really happy that VPG begins to equal other companies for the quality of their components. Counters and cards are splendid.
A 9 (among solitaire games) based on components and game play experience from the previous edition (without the upgrade, this one should be better). I'll probably edit my cotation after some plays of this edition.

Edit: Finaly, I give it a 10. I played it yesterday 4 times. I lost them all. It's a very immersing game (thanks to the new components) and a real challenge.

A good States of Siege game which has some more "wargame-ish" elements (leaders with attributes and special abilities and a number of battalions which get eliminated gradually during battles). I binge-played it after learning it. Addictive! It also got me more interested in the French & Indian War and the Seven Years War. The rules are generally very well written and clear (like VPG games usually are), although there are a few ambiguities about how certain special card effects interact.

I liked it enough to create [[Empires in America (second edition) FAQ]] in the BGG wiki.

I'm not sure I really like a straight up solitaire experience. I feel like I would really enjoy this game as a two-player game, a-la Twilight Struggle.

States of Siege game of the French and Indian War. Did George Washington really start it??? Lots of historical detail on the cards, but the mechanics are not nearly as thematic as other Victory Point Games such as Hero of Weehawken. Then again, this is SoS game so the point is to re-use the mechanics across many themes. The rules are a little too long for the game's complexity, but once you know the game it goes pretty smoothly and can be played in an hour.

First 2 plays and 2 big defeats! More experienced is needed. A good solo choice for me, with nice theme, nice flavor text and beautiful artwork.

I don't think I'm a fan a straight-up solitaire games. For war games, I prefer just to play both sides of a two-player game. That said, I wanted to try the States of Siege system, and Empires covers a conflict about which I've been wanting to learn more. While I appreciate the production quality of Victory Point Games' new line, and the basic premise of the game, it nonetheless left me wanting more.

There are no designer notes, and I'm left wondering if the siege system truly represents history in a meaningful way. The history is on the cards, but it's presented as optional flavor text. Due to the nature of the game, the cards come out randomly, and so there is no sense of chronology.

On the other hand, taken purely as a game, there are certainly interesting decisions to be made, but none of that makes up for the fact that luck of the draw drives the system. Poor luck will leave you out in the cold with little recourse. That's one thing if you're playing a quick game, but frustrating if you're setting up and playing through something as involved and lengthy as Empires. I enjoy it overall, but I'm not sure how much I will return to the title now that I've given it about half a dozen tries.

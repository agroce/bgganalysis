This is an excellent new set of ancients rules. I would recommend any players of WAB or DBM, DBMM to give them a try. I really think they will be the ancient equiv of flames of war.

RATING: 1
A retrograde step in terms of ancient wargames design. Lovely artwork and production values seem to be aimed at producing a "Flames of War" product for the ancient scene. However, having played, there are much cheaper ways to get as good, or better, wargame.

Too slow & static. This and DBMM killed my enthusiasm for ancients for a while, but luckily I found Impetus.

RATING: 2
FoG is strongly based on another 20 years old ruleset, patched with some mechanism taken from other systems. The rules have been streamlined, better organized and better presented. I don't like it much for it is just old stuff that come back over and over, but can see how it will be well received by WAB players and 6th WRG grognards.Army lists are DBM ones adapted and are sold in dedicated booklets. It seems there will be a huge number of these (more than 10) and this will be costly. Osprey is looking for bucks, for many army lists will be uncessesarily splitted in more books to have more stuff to publish. I've read of early and later Teutonics to add list numbers in two different booklets.The game is not tough to learn, and once mastered the rules I find it quite easy to play. There are not difficult decisions to make. I think the initial deployment is too much opportunistic, and can easily create odd (or unhistorical) situations.  The overlap / flank attack advantages outweight the benefit of having a reserve, that usually moves too slow to arrive in time. Linear deployment is then much better than a deep one. Most of the battle you can see will present the miniature deployed in a long string with some skirmishers ahead.The combat more often than not is a protracted struggle lasting more turns. If most of your army is engaged, you spend some turns with few activity apart the dicefest. Boring, unexciting.

Have played a couple games. While the production and thoroughness of the rules are excellent, this is not an easy game to play or teach. A critical part of the game are the rules for movement: many units must pass a kind of "drill test" to perform complex moves or they may only perform simple ones. More to the point, the rules admonish you NOT to be sloppy with your moves. (You MUST select and PIN the front corner of a unit as the pivot point for a Wheel maneuver, for example.) If you allow your opponent to be sloppy with their movement and "tidy up" afterwards, you'll find him completing all sorts of evolutions of illegal maneuvering that will probably cost you the game. This is because a lot of winning strategy is catching opposing battle groups angled badly to the friendly units behind them. Forcing such groups to retreat is bad for friendly groups behind them. After that, combat is a bit fussy and detailed, but better overall than the DBx rat's nest of minutea I was used to before. There are a lot of subtle conditions and exceptions, so know your opponent's Army List as well as your own!

Not for me. Prefer DBx. Seems incredible that they made it so that even more figures are required than a standard DBM/MM game.

RATING: 5
I was into FOG when it first came out.  Now my opinion is, its ok but a tiring effort to endure combat.  Its more of a chess game than a historical simulation.  It uses the standard points system to make battles fair so to me it has a more chess like feel, which is ok in itself.  

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.6
Coming from being a hard core DBM player I found this one to be harder to keep straight and didn't care for all the markers you have to lay all over the table (thus killing the look of a "real" battle field).  Lots of complexity added for no real gain over DBM in my opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Looking forward to this. Hopefully it will provide me with an excuse to break out all of my DBM armies. Currently working my way through the rules. What a pleasant change from DBM - rules that I can actually understand them without an advance English degree...

Played once. 
I have to say, no ancient game felt so like a dancer as this one. I don't think ancient armies were this manoeuvrable. Combat and unit customization didn't appeal to me. 
Beautiful book, but not recommended.

RATING: 5
This is NOT a board game this is a miniatures rules system.  Ownership of scale figures is required to play (not a problem for me mind you I have tons!)

If you are considering a set of rules for quick play or for kids you would be better suited to DBA.  If you look for more detail or a tournament game system this is it (and by extension this set of rules signals the pending doom of DBM/DBMM IMHO).

The biggest problem with FoG IMO is how long it takes to play.  Games can routinely take over 5 hours even after you have played the game for years and are using smaller forces on reduced table sizes.

v2.0 fixed nothing about the game's length, steep learning curve or complexity either.

Update: Oct 2015 the gaming crowd simply has stopped playing ancients for the most part as this set of rules is not being played.  It is too long to play and hoestly, too complex for the level of "detail" and "accuracy" you get (do note quotes adn this is IMO).  Too bad really as I own a ton of these figures and love the period, but I am not the only one that things so...

Field of Glory scratched the Ancients itch for me for a good few years but eventually I became bored.

It is a great Wargame but does not have as much "game" as DBM does. Because of this I have now moved on again to other game systems.

THE game system for playing ancient and medieval battles at brigade level. very good design and production. Historically affordable. Tends to play a bit longer compared to DBMM.
Far superior to WAB.

RATING: 6
Way too fiddly of a rule system.  I never really did catch the DBA bug to begin with so not too surprising that, as a DBA inheritor, the FOG system hasn't grabbed me.

The rule book and army lists are amazingly produced.

Initial rating.  Rating may change with further play.  Print the player aids and the detailed rules index found at the main website (link is on this page) as it will greatly increase the ease of playing.  The game is much less fiddly than DBM and also DBMM (although my conclusion regarding DBMM is just from watching rather than playing a game).  I've played Warhammer ancients, Warmaster ancients, WRG 6th, DBM (most versions), and a few others.  This rules set looks pretty good compared to those.  Time will tell.

The game is still in draft form and being tested by many players world-wide.  The system shows much promise and I think it is likely to replace many of the current "standard" games (such as DBM) that are used for competitions world wide.  

The rules have now been released and seem to be fulfilling the expectations.  Well written and presented they are becoming very popular.

A solid addition to the historical mini rules arena.  The rulebook is nice, well designed, and points in a direction that will hopefully lead the industry away from "Barkerese".  Even though I still prefer the DBx system I would recommend this over DBx to new players.

The replacement for DBM which I reluctantly bought after seeing a DBM tournament with just 6 players which had been 120 strong just a few years before. The guys down the club didn't play this so I found it hard to train and when I did go to a tournament my Medieval Danish were panned, though there were some good moments I haven't played it since.

EL JUEGO. Muchos lo consideramos el sucesor natural del DBM, ya que aprovecha el basado del mismo y la sensación de movimiento en masa de los ejércitos de la antigüedad y edad media, aunque el sistema de juego ha variado bastante, vamos, no tiene nada que ver. Las reglas están bastante claras y muy adornadas con los dibujos e ilustraciones de la editorial Osprey. En fín, una edición de LUJO para todo un JUEGAZO de batallas antiguas y medievales.

Very accessible and simply playable from the summary sheet, and a godsend for the competition chaps - but ultimately technical and dull, and subject to all manner of army list excel and "the champs do it this way" minor league technical cheeserie. 

Command and Colours and DBA much easier, more exciting and more likely to gain long-term converts to wargaming: "Not as realistic" I hear the cry - why, were you there? 

More gloss than progress here I'm afraid and not the second coming. Not for me obviously, but I think the more sensible folks into this kind of thing stuck with the Barker line and the infinitely more enjoyable WAB dice-o-rama.

The game plays well enough, and with more practice I think it could well rival DBM as my rules of choice for ancients.

I have to say that the layout of the rules is bloody awful. We must have spent half the 5 hours play time trying to find references in the rulebook.

RATING: 6
I like a lot of what the designers were attempting.  Engaged units grind away until one breaks.  Some units have greater shock, and some have greater staying power.

Unfortunately, the whole is less than the sum of its parts.  The rulebook layout is confusing, and the terminology can be difficult to figure out.

I played this a dozen times before giving up on the system.  With some streamlining, these could be great ancients rules.  As it stands, they are too fiddly for me.

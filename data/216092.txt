More Escape the Room in a board/card game. This one was pretty clever, but I think I like ThinkFun's games better... they feel more like an Escape the Room experience. These Unlock! games do seem better than the Exit: The Game games though. I'll be trying a couple more of these and then may stick with the after that... if they're still good.

This is my and my wife's favorite of the Unlock games. Best with 2 or 3 players, maybe 4.

These games are single play escape room style, but the deck can be put back together for other people to use. It requires an app, which works well and is used in unique ways at times.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS FOR THIS SPECIFIC GAME:[/b]

++ There is one think "outside the box" puzzle that is clever as we didn't saw this one coming (but this one could pose problems for some though!).
++ Some good puzzles (3 or 4).
++ Nice funny theme, that was refreshing.


:thumbsup: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS FOR THIS SPECIFIC GAME:[/b]

-- There was a bit too much of hidden numbers in this one, so missing these really make you lose a lot of time and hints on stuff you cannot yet solve because you are missing a card. This is really frustrating.
-- There was also a long series of straightforward and easy puzzles, using the combinaison mechanism.

Super fun. Pretty worth bang for your buck if you're playing with 3-4 players. I can't see this working with more than that as it requires everyone seeing the same cards at the same time, and with a big group that becomes a mess. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Components: Not as big a fan of the cartoony artwork in this game as of the photorealistic artwork of The Island of Doctor Goorse and The Formula. E.g., it's difficult to determine if a collection of colored dots conveys a clue, or if it's just part of the artistic style. Still, the rooms are fun, and as with others in the series, I love how the detailed views of particular items are consistent with their wide-angle representations on the room card.

Experience: The easiest of the three I've played so far, with only a few moments where I felt truly stuck and relied on a hint. Mostly a fun time, though I did not like the final puzzle; too meta. There was a bit about a cassette tape that seems to play to an older audience, even though the theme suggests it's meant for a younger audience.

This was ok. We didn't do so well on this first one - I found I needed a magnifying glass to help in finding the numbers. The hints were not very useful - they basically restated exactly what was in the card text.

I like that this is reusable by other people (worth a +1)  - I'll pass it along to family. Probably not really "my thing".

Initial play of an 'Unlock!' game.  Overall, I enjoyed it solo.  

Other than the end puzzle, this one didn't seem all that difficult.  I saw all but one of the 'hidden' clues, which you absolutely need to find.  It was also fairly straight forward which puzzle pieces combined together.

I'll look forward to playing others, but don't know if I need to go out and buy them.  Try them out if you can find them at a library, or someone else in your group has them.

I liked it better than the Island of Dr. Goorse and Nautilus but that last puzzle was a horrible cheap shot. It took you right out of the game, literally, and it was horribly stupid. It felt like it was just there so the game designers could point a finger at you and laugh. So far I have played three of these. This one was the easiest but we still didn't win it. This leads me to believe that the 10+ rating is very optimistic. Also, these games are way better to play with 2 people max. Otherwise, you have have a bunch of people shuffling through cards and constantly grabbing cards before the other people know what is going on. This leads to confusion and things being missed. Do yourself a favor, play it with 2.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (July 2017)

I really enjoyed Unlock! The Formula, so I was very keen to play Unlock! Squeek & Sausage.

The rules are very easy to teach, you can do in under 1 minute or have players play the tutorial. I´m a bit disappointed this game comes with the same tutorial than The Formula! I was expecting a different tutorial, but this is a minor issue.

Cool theme, better than The Formula.

The art of the cards is cartoony and very good. I feel the difficulty is a bit harder than in The Formula, still it is best played as a 2-3 player game (it isn’t very hard). With more players there are some cards and/or puzzles you won’t see before they are solved and that’s a bummer. We played it with 6 players and I was far away from some of the cards so I didn’t enjoy that part of the game. I will play the rest of the series with my SO as a 2 player game.

I have a bittersweet feeling about the game, like T.I.M.E Stories, once you played through it, you won’t play it again because you already know the answer so it has zero replay value. At least in Space Cowboys´ games you don’t physically destroy the game, thus preserving the resale value. That’s the only reason I bought the whole series of games while I can’t buy The Exit series of games. It isn’t about the money though (the game itself is very cheap), I was raised in a third world country and I was always taught that you do not waste if you can avoid it so I loathe legacy style games that destroy or permanently modify the game. To me, it is immoral and unethical to create games that are disposable (even more when the designer can easily make them resettable), even if they create a great experience. Kudos to Space Cowboys for not doing this. 

After playing the game I already sold it as it has zero replayability, however, before I sold it, I showed it to as many people as I could and they all loved it.

I won´t write about the adventure itself due to spoilers, but it was a very interesting experience. It is entirely possible to finish it under 60 minutes as many groups demonstrated.

I loathe to ask for hints when I’m stuck. To me, it is much better to finish the adventure on my own, even if I take more time than the allotted by the app. We managed to finish The Formula without asking for hints, but we did have to ask for a hint in Unlock! Squeek & Sausage :(.

[o]I always sleeve my games before playing them but when you sleeve any Unlock game, it no longer fits in the box due to the additional bulk of the sleeves. This is common issue with card games so I use other containers as deck boxes and I never carry the original box. I did so this this time as well so we couldn’t finish the last puzzle that required the original box :/. When we encountered it, right away I saw the code bar, but we didn’t think, literally, that the answer was outside the box. Some friends (and me), liked this development very much, however, other friends felt cheated as the game broke the paradigm that all the answers were within the game and they weren’t amused by it. In all the playthroughs by different players, they all needed to ask for a hint to successfully solve this last puzzle. I love the new level this puzzle adds to the mix. From now on, I will bring the game box as well but I doubt they will use the same trick again. [/o]
 
Bottom line, I really like Unlock! Squeek & Sausage. Its puzzles are not very hard so you can play it well with two players. I already sold my copy of the game due to its zero replayability but I will continue to play all the games in the series. Good Stuff.

Enjoyed this up until the last puzzle, which was easily solvable once you got the hint. IMO, they could have put elements of the hint on the card itself and then it wouldn't have been so bad.

RATING: 6
Good concept, but not as well executed as the Exit: the Game series, in my (and my wife's) opinion.

Good art, unique theme.  There IS fun to be had here and there is a sense of discovery, BUT.... 

Greatly disliked:

The hidden number thing (it's just cheap and while I understand it thematically, it doesn't work well in card format - especially for older pairs of eyes) 

That you can mistakenly end up with some answers that will then lead you to a correct answer from another part of the game, corrupting the main mechanic.  While this isn't something that happens often at all, the fact that it can happen period is enough for me to view this as a deeply flawed system (especially compared to Exit: the Game).  

Sometimes the directions are unclear, leading to mere confusion rather than puzzle solving, which dampens the experience for all. 

Will play the other 2 offerings, but, having played other, much better Escape Room series offerings, this one sits at or near the bottom.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Do not pick Squeek & Sausage as your first unlock/escape-type game. While the first few clues were obviously simple, we restarted the game twice because subsequent clues were cryptic and misdirecting. The game did not hold together thematically which led us to receive multiple "wrong answer" penalties. After about 90 minutes (as first time unlock room players) we solved the puzzle. However, we ended feeling confused and unfulfilled as a gaming experience.

Liked this one better than The Formula, might be a lot due to the themeing and look of the cards. Still not a fan of the penalty system, but I feel like the mistakes we made this time were more fair. Think that the system does rely too much on looking for hidden things on the cards, but this one did do a good job of thinking outside the box.

I know many will balk at the modern trend of "disposable" games. I contend that if you hold onto them, it's likely that you could replay them in a matter of years. 

In any case, this game does a really good job of simulating an escape room and has very well done app integration. I look forward to more of the games in this series.

I liked this one about the same as Unlock! The Formula.

This is only leaving our collection because it's a once and done game.

I understand that having more people will make these easier because there are more minds working on things and you can spread around the puzzles. That said, this was the only one of the series that we played with more than two, and we found it hard to see everything. We enjoyed it less because of that.

This is the first "escape room in a box" product that my wife and I have experienced.

We had a good time going through the puzzles - most of which were decently clever - but had to persevere through several frustrating moments at the beginning while we learned how to operate within the Unlock! rules/system.

As an aside, I would recommend that anyone over the age of 40 keep a magnifying glass handy while going through these puzzles.  The "hidden object" text was sometimes so ridiculously small that I had ZERO chance to read it.  Fortunately, my wife has good enough vision that she was able to handle everything...

Foremost, I'm pretty disappointed in the ending of this Unlock, it did not seem fair given the understood tools.  But, it was still a good sequence of puzzles that gave us an hour of entertainment for a fraction of the prize of an actual escape room.

One other minor knock = we managed to jump ahead by revealing a card without revealing the 1/2 the puzzle before it.  This would be a minor design flaw.

RATING: 6
Much better than The Formula, we only had to take one hint - but it was a frustrating point very early in the game which didn't feel fair and started to sour me on the rest of the experience again.  Lots and lots of hidden numbers in this one, fortunately a team mate was good at spotting them (I was not) and felt more linear than The Formula.  Unfortunately this didn't make me feel clever, it mostly made me feel like I was searching for a hidden number and then a blatant solution.  The entire time there was really only three puzzles, two of which were super simple and one of which was a sudden twist I wouldn't have been prepared for if not playing the Exit series.

Love the theme and setting and art...

We were cruising in the game but somehow one of the players discarded one card that should still be in the table and because of that we missed several attempts at one of the codes (4 or 5) after that we asked for a hint and realized that one of the cards was wrongly discarded...

We still had some time left because we started so strong and then it happened one thing that I really didn't like that caused us to spend some more time and that we only solved with a hint from the game... and without that we would never get there and that pisses me off because it had nothing to do with our inability to solve the problem it was something that makes no sense, at least to me, because there's no indication anywhere in the game that we are supposed to do what we had to do... 
That makes me lower the rating...

I really liked the first 2 scenarios but I HATE that we had problems in both of them because of things that had nothing to do with us not being able to be logical and solve puzzles and problems but because the designers decided to be extra "cleaver" or "funny" and those things for me caused a sour taste in my mouth in both experiences

I had pretty high hopes for this game. Unlike the other Escape the Room-style games I've tried, this one didn't have a special wheel to tell you answers. It instead has an app, which I didn't realize until later. It was a minor annoyance, but okay, it's a better option. I also really like the idea of combining items in this game, even if it is a little confusing.

The reason I rate this a 1, however, is because the game is simply broken. I got off to a decent start, but when I became stuck, I tried getting hints for different things to no avail. The hints are far too vague here, and guessing at numbers is a bad idea because it can break the whole the game. I had no idea what to do, so I just started plugging numbers together that might be related, and it screwed the whole thing up. I also feel like there must be something wrong with the app, because I got the same hint from two different items.

Shame on you, Space Cowboys, for publishing such a fragile product that is about the furthest thing from user-friendly.

Feels like a room escape game.  It's also great that the cards aren't damage in the process of solving, so we can easily lend this to friends and eventually trade it away.

RATING: 8
Fun game, the card-based system helped prevent running off the rails. Important to use the app in 'hints' mode. Although the card-based system reduces innovation in the types of puzzles, all players seemed happy the game kept progressing, and there was enough variation and novelty for light fun. The younger players in the group enjoyed this more than the 'Escape the Room' and 'Escape Room the Game' games. I expect experienced Escape the Room veterans would prefer something else.

It was ok.  We did terrible, as I figured we would.  Obviously can't play it again, so it was hard to rate but I did not get as much fun out of that hour+ of play as I would have liked.  We did get it on clearance though so that helps.

RATING: 7
Unlock! Squeek and Sausage is a cooperative escape room-style game that's all contained in a single deck of cards (and a mobile app). Like other games in this genre, this game is meant to be played through only once, though no components are destroyed and the game can be played by another group.  In this scenario, you've been imprisoned by some sort of mad clown, and you're interacting with his bizarre lair trying to stop him from blowing up the world or something.  So, many of the things you do are a little oddball.  Like in The Formula though, the puzzles are interesting and generally well done.  The numbers that you're supposed to find on the cards are more visible too.  Of the three original scenarios, I found this one to be the easiest, but that didn't make it less satisfying.

As this is a puzzle, and not a game, I cannot rank it according to the suggested BGG rating parameters.

However, that being said, it's a lot of fun, and does an escape room justice. Worth the buck provided you recognize it has no replay value and is in fact, not a game from a technical standpoint.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Hard to rate this using BGG's rating scale which doesn't handle single play games like this very well. But alas, I found the experience provided by this game to be excellent and I can't wait to try and play more. We played with four people, and while it was much more expensive on a dollar per hour per person metric than most board games, we all had incredible fun. Compared to paying for an actual escape room, it is far cheaper, and yet provides an equivalent experience. 

I suppose this isn't the place to really launch this debate but suffice to say I personally have no issue with the single use game model and the experience this offered me was worth my dollars. I am also glad that I can now pass this game off to friends who can enjoy it and then pass it along after that. 

Looking forward to more escape room style board games off of this experience. One of the best hours of entertainment I've ever had with a board game.

Oh man, this was really cool!
The art style, app music, and puzzle humor evoked wonderful memories of playing Day of the Tentacle, albeit with much easier and more straightforward puzzles to solve.
In fact, that seemed to be the one major stumbling block here... it was too breezy.  Apart from one brilliant puzzle at the end which had us laughing and tittering, it's possible to blast right through this from room to room without ever really having to stop and consider much.
Most all the puzzles either involve noticing a hidden number somewhere, or just applying one thing to another thing.    Very rarely were we required to actually think... which is a let down for a puzzle game.   Perhaps this is just a limitation of their number based card system.

Anywho, I enjoyed this anyway just for the nostalgia trip and humor.  I'd happily pick up another Unlock!

After having played several escape room style games, I think the Exit series has been better.  There are some puzzles in the Unlock! series that I find to be a bit too obscure.  Squeek & Sausage had a single puzzle that I still don't understand how we were supposed to figure out.

This one isn't bad, but not my favorite.

Of the first three Unlock! adventures, this was my second favorite. The art style and even the fantastical puzzle logic will be a treat for fans of old Lucas Arts adventure games. It's remarkable how a little whimsy in your puzzle can make it so much more enjoyable.

I'd also like to point out that the hint system was our savior a couple times, and left us scratching our heads just once until we finally had our eureka moment. I do appreciate that this game gave us a rush of accomplishment a couple times throughout, something that I CRAVE in puzzle games.

This one gets a higher score even though it's not my favorite.

RATING: 8
The Unlock series is a terrific mystery room-type game using cards as the storyboard through the adventure. It's extremely easy to catch on to, and after you play one, you get the gist of the gameplay. The thing I love about this series is that they keep the puzzles fresh and idiosyncratic. 

In comparison to other table versions of this genre, this game is easy clean-up and handling. From the few others I've played, there's typically some props that go with the game that require wear and tear. Although, the Unlock series does not have any replay value. Once you solve it, you're done. Because of the style though, you can pass it on to a friend, unlike some of the others in its gaming category.

Squeek & Sausage is a great one to start off with. It's not too difficult overall, with a difficulty rating of 2 out of 3. That's not to say that you'll breeze right through this. All of the Unlock games require some intuitive thinking, including this one. If you go into these thinking that you'll master it because you've done mystery room-type games before, think again. Be careful in this one, because there are a couple elements you could miss if you're using your brain more than your vision. That's what held us up. We were cruising along and doing great, until we realized we missed something on the card that was meant to be hidden from plain sight. That's not uncommon in the others from the Unlock series, but for some reason, Squeek and Sausage had the most memorable "how did we miss that" moments. 

I give this addition an 8, because until I find an Unlock game that has some not-so-kosher puzzles to it, it will receive an 8. It would get a 10 if it had replay value, but that's the nature of the genre.

I absolutely LOVED this game. Such a cool premise, the escape rooms in a box. I was blown away by the puzzles in this one and the way it worked. It actually felt like I was doing escape room puzzles, and with just a deck of cards. It's a shame it's a one-trick-pony, but at least it's so cheap it doesn't really matter. Great, great game.

RATING: 7
I've played very similar games to this one.  Namely the Exit series, they're both "escape rooms in a deck of cards."  The Exit series usually has a few more cardboard and paper components whereas this one was exclusively (kinda) a deck of cards.  This one is also managed by a free app which made things work pretty smoothly.

My comments on the Exit games translate pretty evenly to the Unlock! series as well.  This was a lot of fun.  It was tense and well-designed.  I also like the systems at work here a lot more than the Exit series.  Cards are of different types and the game often gives you options when puzzle solving, some of which are wrong and penalize you.  As opposed to the all-or-nothing style of puzzle solving in other similar systems, this gives you a lot more agency and room to work and play around within this "room".

In this case the game was gifted to me by a friend who had already done it and once I finished playing it I passed it off to someone else.  So in this situation I paid $0 for this game as did the person I gave it to and so-on down the line.  I don't even know how much it cost, my guess would be the MSRP comes in somewhere around $15-$20.  Now technically this game will get 3+ plays for that $15-$20.  I have games, after all, I've spent much more for that I have yet to even play once.  But still, the perceived personal value is low.  Paying that much for a game you get about an hour or less of play out of is a steep price.  The fact that this one is not disposable is a nice bonus because you can gift it to others, and I suppose it is at least somewhat selfish to think of the value as only including your personal play and not the others who might get enjoyment out of it as well.  And I also realize that development and manufacturing costs probably keep it from being any cheaper than it is.  But it is still hard for me to recommend nonetheless.

The easiest of the first three full scenarios, but also the funniest -- we read the bomb cards afterwards and some of them are funny enough to reward guessing wrong. Biggest issue for us was that the final puzzle was impossible because a required element was not present. I do appreciate the out-of-the-box thinking but I'm not sure it's a good idea. Other than that, the biggest roadblock came, as in The Formula, from a missed hidden object, my least-favourite Unlock! mechanism but one unfortunately used very heavily in this scenario. I played with a 63-year old who couldn't see one of the numbers, or a certain symbol on a lock, without a magnifying glass.

Enjoyable.

An interesting attempt to fit an escape room in a box; unfortunately, it didn't really capture any excitement or the magic of being in an escape room, rather causing more frustration than anything.

[b]After playing all three of the Escape Adventures series (Squeek & Sausage [2p], The Formula [5p] and The Island of Doctor Goorse [5p])[/b]:

Oh well, I don't think escape room games are for me. While they've proven to be very involved, engaging and thematic, they're not the most satisfying gaming experiences. More than challenging I find them head-banging-on-the-table frustrating, the main culprit being the overly cryptic puzzles. I guess it doesn't help that I'm not a huge fan of IRL escape rooms either, but I'll give Space Cowboys credit for recreating that same experience in tabletop format. Having a group that's familiar with the genre helps out significantly. Wouldn't mind trying out Mystery Adventures in the future. The more players, the merrier and would recommend at least 4p.

Verdict: [b]6[/b]

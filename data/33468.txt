Print & Play that you will actually play.  Brilliant design makes it credit card size - would actually fit nicely in a wallet and you could bring it out anywhere.  Quick and fun.  Only complaint is that it is very random. May have a limited life span, but for what it is - great.

To me, this game should be the start of something bigger and better.  It's very good.  It has a hint of Betrayal at the House on the Hill feel to it.  Still, it is rather simplistic, which is a good and bad thing all at once.  There's certainly something bigger and better that this game could be turned into.  I hope that the game creator will make it into something grander.

Very nice little game that knows exactly what it wants to be and is exactly that.  The print-n-play version looks GREAT, but I don't play it much because the theme totally creeps me out.

Where is that dang Evil Temple?!  My first PnP game and I love it.  It's tiny, fast, and tense.  You can feel the clock ticking down the moments to the Zombie Apocalypse.  It's hilarious when you reach the graveyard with one life point left and a bat poops in your eye as you're burying the totem.

This is a solo print and play game that provides a quick solitaire fix with zombies portable enough for your breast pocket. 

As you explore the house and back yard looking for the items and locations necessary to win, you are playing against the clock. Drawing cards makes time pass, so you must weigh the desire to draw a card, which might have a good weapon or tool, against the pressing need to keep moving.

This is a quick little solo game.  I traded with the designer to get a nicely printed copy, but it doesn't look like too much for anyone to do at home.  The gameplay is fast and furious.  It kind of gives me the same feel as a cooperative game, because there are so many ways to lose but only one way to win.  It's a hard game to win, but fast enough that you can try several times until you attain victory.

A fun and quick solitaire game. Game can basically be summarized as shuffle the cards and see if they come out in a favorable way, but the theme and the clever time mechanic give this game several points. I love the thought of cowering in the corner while my health slowly rebuilds. Definitely worth a print and a few plays.

I'm not a big Zombie fan, so maybe that distilled this game down to the mechanics for me. The design is solid and fulid but just not fun. Perhaps its more fun if you are taken by the theme but it just wasn't great for me. I admire the production, the concept and the realisation but ti just didn't work for me. It does have this very portable aspect to it, I can fit it in a plastic bag in my pocket, I love that, perhaps this can spawn a series. Alas the game is a let down for me. I would prefer other print and play games to fill my solo time.

Got this one from Tom. Interesting solitaire game - I won the first game very quickly (though that appeared to be down to the order the tiles came out - evil temple came out as the first indoor tile). Then it was a breeze. Also won second game, although it was a lot closer, and the 11pm deck was almost empty. 

I don't feel like you have a lot of control over what happens in the game as the choices are relatively limited (fight or run essentially). The only real strategy involved is whether you will burn a card to get an item and hence trade off the item for less time to win the game.

In most zombie movies I've seen, zombies don't eat just the brains, but rip off large slabs of their victims and kind of just eat it all like a human casserole.  In that vein, I do not recommend putting zombies in your pocket.  It just gets them closer to your naughty bits that you *really* don't want them to chew on.

Also, the game is not very good.  The components are disgustingly horrible to look at, like a masticated corpse, the semi co-op nature is pretty easy to exploit to make sure no one has fun, like riding a pair of water skis that are actually masticated corpses, and it has player elimination, like life.

Players are members of a party exploring a house, trying to find the totem.  Once the totem is taken out of the house to the graveyard, it is buried to end the zombie threat (and earn a victory).  Portable tile laying game where players take turns flipping a tile and adding it to a growing map of the house/garden.  Each turn a card is revealed which triggers an event, such as finding an item, gaining health, or an attack of zombies.  Combat is simply differential, with weapon items helping reduce the damage.    Once the totem is located, it's out to the graveyard and victory - hopefully before your health runs out!  Simple and fun solo game - plays in about ten minutes.

Part of the fun I suppose is printing and assembling the game.  It is a quick game that you aren't guaranteed to win.  My son had fun playing it, too.  As a simple game it may not have that much re-playability; however, the five books of scenarios and then all the theme variants solve that.

My 1st PNP, worked with the kids to put it together using 8.5x11 "sticker paper" from Avery and Matting board. 5 y/o and 10 y/o daughters played with me.

RATING: 6
A fast solo mini PnP game. In every new game, you place tiles by moving around, discovering rooms and areas and forming a new map each time. The scope is to retrieve an occult item found inside a house and then bury it in the graveyard to stop the zombie hordes and win the game. It plays fast, it has lots of luck, little bit of decision making, random placing tiles and it is balanced for the purpose it was designed. It is well suited to kill  a spare time of 5-10min. The very many variants found in the Forum section add more flavor.

Free Print and Play solo version. Half the fun is making the game! Excellent artwork, quick and tight game with most decisions being the more stuff/health versus time lost variety. Win percentage is maybe 30-40%. Fantastic theme, makes for a great "session report" as you play it. Needs a bit of space and make sure you print the counters in the file section as it is a pain keeping track on paper. Takes maybe 5-10 minutes for a quick game.

RATING: 7.1
O jogo é bem simples e rápido. Basicamente nós montamos as peças que representam área internas e externas de uma casa repleta de zombies. Quando fazemos isso significa que estamos nos movimentando para um novo e desconhecido ambiente. Sempre que fazemos isso o tempo passa. Isso é marcado de modo sabermos que nosso tempo está acabando. Nsse novo ambiente pode surgir diferentes situações, como, um cheiro de sangue no ar ou vários zombies famintos querendo devorá-lo. Você deve encontrar um Totem Malígno dentro da casa e enterrá-lo no cemitério que fica do lado de fora. Ótimo jogo. Vale a pena imprimir e fazer.

A bit too much luck for me to play this game ALL the time, but my daughter likes it.  We have only played the flash version, although we have the print-and-play.  Hoping to receive a copy of the multiplayer/published version soon, although have yet to hear back from the designer.

I think the physical bits make this a little more enjoyable, honestly, than the flash one.  Especially with more people, as I'm not huge on solo board/card games.

It's a nice, quick, and portable solitaire PnP game. It doesn't use much paper (the designer used a clever method of combining events under different hours on the same card) and was easy to assemble. And I enjoy it too, otherwise the above information wouldn't matter.

print and play.  mounted tiles on heavy cardstock and then laminated over.  truly a pocket game...it keeps you busy for 5 minutes.  worth having as a print/play if you want to take 15 minutes to do everything.  good effort...and is better than most print/play.

Had the original data file of this for a while, but budn3kkid's customized makeover spurred me to commit it to card stock. Light fun, but still maintains some tension. Zombie walls seem to be my bane, as I'm often painted into a corner; in fact, my first game found the bathroom over the foyer. Printed this out at 85% of the original size, so now it's truly wallet sized. This now accompanies Pico2 for carry-along gaming.

Played the Android version a number of times. Success or failure in the game is very nearly completely based on luck. To me, this was literally the equivalent of rolling a die and saying that you win on a 4 to 6. A win is not gratifying in this game. I cannot understand the appeal this has.

This is a great little solo PNP, for free you can't beat it.  I would rate it a solid 6.5 to be honest ( it loses 1/2 a point for only being solo ).  I give it a +1 cause it is Free - which is just amazing me to  ( free I tell you ).  And I gave it a +.5 Cause the designer, Jeremiah Lee, is such a great guy ( I couldn't read the little 1 page rules, and he got a 8 page PDF up for me so I can now read the rules.  Thanks you J.L.


  It is really fun and a game can take 2 minutes to win or lose, and up to 15 - 20 with you losing or maybe winning just as the clock strikes 12.
I play you only 2 health for cower, and max out at 6 health, much harder

Kudos to the designer for putting together a short, easy-to-learn game that delivers exactly what it intends - a quick little zombie game experience.

I'm not convinced that there are a lot of challenging decisions to make - of course, how many should you expect in a solitaire game that completes in ~15 minutes?  Will be interesting to see how it holds up.

Given the size of all the game components (i.e., very small), I intend to give this one some use on airline travel.

Note: I'm ZimP's designer. With over 400 other player ratings, I guess it's safe for me to rate the game now.

I like the game, it's fun for what it's trying to be.

From other users:

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/2180983#2180983 - "The more I play the the more I enjoy it. I may get a few more plays out of my printed copy tonight before I toss it. The cards are a bit worn I am beginning to recognize what is coming."

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/293314 - "With my first game of ZimP finished, I have to say I like the way it works. [...] My first impression of ZimP is it's a simple but fun game with a great theme (everything is better with zombies). It takes up very little space and has a very clear rulebook."

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/315834?size=medium - Homemade ZimP bag. Amazing, and wonderful.

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/303380 - "I have played this three times now and want to give my shout out to this neat little "print'n'play solitair tile placement house crawler zombie filler". The artwork looks kinda maybe-okay-for-playtesting but hey who am I... it's free godammnit. The mechanics are, just like the artwork, very very simple, but suprisingly well working and great fun to play. The playing time of the game is 5-10 minutes and thats really great, I like games that feels just a little bit to short and leaves you wanting to play just one more time."

RATING: 6
Quick and simple game teamwork/treachery game in which the players have to decide simultaneously and secretly whether they will join in each of the fights against the zombies or scarper. The players have to work together to allow a win of any kind, but as ther's only one winner you also have to know when to stab your fellow players in the back.

In my only play I was the lead player on the last turn. I held all the bonus attack cards but had very little life left. I had a choice: join in the fight and guarantee a win for someone else, or duck out the fight and let the zombies win, i.e. everyone loses! I did the decent thing and joined the fight and died, meaning Phil (who chickened out of the final fight) survived and won. We did point out that there's little honour in such a win....

Played it online for the half-dozen times it took me to win. There are basically no choices to be made. The tight schedule means winning depends entirely on drawing the right rooms in the right order (e.g. temple before dining room), and most items are pointless because you can't spare the time to dig them out. I can imagine a nicely printed physical copy does much to enhance the experience.

Just because its free doesn't mean its not fun. This is a great pickup and play game that I store in a clear i iPod case. It fits great and shows off the goods. A little wooden man/meeple from the crafts depth at Wal-Mart spray painted black with a white outline completes the look. With afootprint a little larger than Muses it mostly fits on  a stool-top. A great little gem that doesn't take long to play but can played to the wire before you can definitively sau you've lost. Print it, play it, survive it!

A simple Print-and-Play game, and not a bad one.  The Betrayal-esque exploration is completely random, but there is some choice to be made: what items to keep, when to run in combat, and when to cower in a corner like a crying child.  The zombie theme is a bit weak (I wish that there was some threat of being surrounded and threatened by a evil horde), but for a solo filler, you could do worse.  The new graphics are schnazzy, but the components are still just as quality as you make them.

A lackluster luckfest with a pasted on theme. I played this game three times. The first I won and thought I did something wrong. The second time I lost while I did nothing differently, as I had understood the rules properly. The third time I won and I realized there is no deeper game in there, it had absolutely no replay value even with 100% luck determining the game result.

2 / 5 - Fair.

Fun solo filler to occupy ten minutes of your time. Largely random excitement but with some choices to be made sacrificing time for health - if either run out you loose, so it's a tense balancing act. The theme and narrative come across very nicely and are the real selling points for this title. Ultimately though the lack of variety and much strategy will kill your interest in playing this after a handful of runs.

made myself a rough and ready (but not too shabby) copy of this as my first foray into P'n'P. Me and the boys played it a lot at first and it was nice to take away on business trips (those evenings on your own in a hotel... yawn!). Ultimately though it faded due to lack of interest.  Somewhat limited replayability.

Initial thoughts:

An interesting solitare game.  The theme works well with the mechanic - reminds me quite a bit of Evil Dead.

Can be fun in the right circumstances.  Played 4 games and each played quite differently.  But having played these out and won every one, I've become a bit tired of it.  Would rather read a book at the moment.

Spent a while printing, laminating and cutting the game to get it ready.

On further reflection (9/9/12):

What frustrated me after 4 plays is the sameness of the decisions, and the lack of meaningful choices or different strategies.  Each turn pretty much boiled down to placing tiles in a way they wouldn't block others, killing zombies if able, taking damage if only a point or 2 short, or running away if attacked by a swarm of zombies.  

The best moves in a given situation were quite obvious.  Once I'd figured this out, then the game became far less interesting and not much of a game, just a randomised story.  Unfortunately it was a story that simply wasn't that interesting for me.

It doesn't matter that this game was free - I won't take that into account when rating (in any case it still took time to assemble).

Nice little solitaire puzzle.  Decisions are mostly about timing and how fast you run out the deck.  The rest is random card drawing.

Game in a Nutshell: A quick solitaire game of exploring random rooms, dodging zombies, and having short events randomized through a small deck of cards

Played as: Solo only.

Pros: I thought this did a pretty good job in what I imagined it trying to create. A fast, portable Zombie experience. It also doesn't hurt that it's free and has awesome art-work. Overall, a well put together distraction.

Cons: Completely linear. Almost all luck with little tension. I think I spent more time learning the rules then I did playing the game before the stars aligned, I beat it, and didn't feel the desire to pull it out again. 

Other: I'm glad to hear that this is being developed into a fully published (with multi-player) game at some point. There really is a decent shell of a game here that deserves the attention that it gets.

Best Use: Something to hold in your pocket for a few rounds until you beat it. But don't count on it converting anyone into gamers.

I bought the professionally printed version from Jeremiah--I'm a bit lazy about printing these things, and I don't mind throwing a little money the designer's way.

I've played seven or eight times now (three wins), and I am conflicted: It's a brilliant design but "merely" a good game. Brilliant design because it's compact, it's streamlined, it develops a great narrative, it's funny and it's well balanced. "Merely" good game because you don't really make that many significant choices. Most of your choices are fairly obvious--trading (or not trading) time for stuff or health--and it doesn't seem like something you'd want to replay all that many times. With a couple more plays under my belt now, it definitely loses its luster. There's just not a ton of meaningful choices, and it gets a bit samey and boring.

Having said all that, I do think the designer deserves a lot of credit for self-publishing a tight, interesting little game that you can pull out any time and play. The artwork in the professionally printed copies Jeremiah sells looks great, the rules are easy to learn and whatever flaws it has, it definitely captures the feel and look of the classic "zombie experience."

Using the deck as a timer works very well. Most games are close, and it definitely seems to have been well playtested. The items are well chosen.

It suffers from the typical problems of random tile-laying games: Sometimes the room layouts are utterly ridiculous. My house rule is that if I draw the bathroom or storage room first, I shuffle them back into the deck and draw again. Alternatively, place the family room on top of the deck so it is the first room drawn. This will ensure at least a somewhat more logical layout.

I can't say that I love this game. But I'm glad I got it, and I expect I will continue to play it now and again when I need a quick game before I go to bed. Well, maybe not all that often, but every once in a while.

[u]21-May-2013[/u]:  I want to say upfront that I am impressed with the design of this little PnP game.  Kudos to the designer for making a well put together game with only two pieces of paper.  I am impressed.  Unfortunately, I wasn't as impressed with the gameplay.  I felt there just weren't very many interesting choices, and if you end up with the "right" equipment, it's fairly easy to survive to the end.  I'm glad I played it a few times, but I don't think I'll be going back to it any time soon.

Most in-the-pocket games (solitaire or otherwise) are very abstract. ZiMP is a very concrete game-- if you don't know how a rule should work, use common sense and figure out if an ordinary Joe would be able to fight zombies with both a golf club and a chain saw (for example). The game is fast-- about 5-10 minutes of play  per game. It changes every time you play. It's fairly easy to learn, and there is some strategy in how you play (essentially, it's a choice between health or time-- when either one runs out, you lose). After playing this game for a couple of hours, I had nightmares all night long about zombies chasing me through a house.

wasn't such a fan of this. it seems pretty random what you can find/what encounters you have, so i didn't really feel like i was having much of an influence on what happened. essentially i was just grasping through new rooms hoping to get to the end. for encounters you have, you always just want to lose the minimum amount of life possible so there aren't really any decisions to make.

I'm not sure yet how much strategy is involved but you do have to weigh certain options as every Dev card means you have less time to find and bury the totem. Cowering to recover Health, needed for survival, means drawing an extra card; opting for an item means drawing another card; search the Storage area, yet another card. 

Overall, a simple, fast and fun single-player game. I'll be keeping this one handy.

Cheesy, self-conscious mock of a solitaire that can be downloaded for free here - very nicely done, by the way. The game itself is easy, well balanced but with a bit more than the fair amount of luck present in almost any solitaire, and with too little of a learning curve (after two plays it will be repeating the same moves again and again, since it's so obvious what the no-nos are). Wins or losses are really tight and... up to luck, almost. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An intelligent design and surprising depth for a solitaire game. Needs a play or two to become necessarily familiar with the slightly contrived mechanics, and a little unbalanced in favour of the player, but worthwhile for the occasional outing. Strikes the luck-skill balance at a very happy medium, too: not bad for a print-and-play.

Found this browsing the geek.  Neat little solitaire.  I didn't rate it very high after my first play-through, simply because I don't play solitaires much and the likely hood of my playing this game often was slim.  I played it through a few more times and reprinted it in the smallest format I could (the cards are about 1" x 1.5".)  I found that this was actually a VERY playable game and I could keep it in my wallet... which means I'm much more likely to play it when I'm bored and have some time to kill.

Slightly disappointing because of all the positive reviews. It's a little too random for my tastes. I like the idea of the tiles, but sometimes I feel it is a bit TOO random.

Still, it is FREE, which is a major plus... and I can see myself playing it from time to time as a 10 min. time waster.

Funny little game that has it's roots based on games such as Chill: Black Morn Manor, Betrayal at House on the Hill etc. But it's SOLITAIRE! There are some nice ideas including the multiuse Dev cards (also seen in Pocket Civ, another solitaire print and play) and variable layout of tiles. 

Another nice addition would be a 'stats' card which a player can use to track their life, items etc.

Oh, the rules could use a rewrite. It would be (IMHO) better expressed in terms of turn/phase order.

RATING: 5
A free print-and-play solitaire game.The color artwork is pretty cool (I love the way the rulebook folds up from a single sheet of paper to an 8-page booklet!). Game play is pretty straightforward, with events driven by card draws as you enter each room. The major decision points are whether or not to look for items, when to spend a turn healing up, and possibly (?) a bit of how to lay out the house to maximize chances of finding the right locations quickly ... time management. Still, mostly the decisions seem straightforward and the outcome seems largely to depend on the luck of the shuffle: if the rooms come out in an order that makes it difficult to get to the temple and back out of the house (to look for the graveyard), you have no hope.Also, of course, I'm not usually a fan of solitaire games.

Nice and very fast playing game, easy to make (it took me about 15 minutes) and very portable (surprise). Though it is quit more luck based than other solo games I know this one is nice to play! I consider this one a little gem. :)

For more challenge I recommend Inspector Moss 2 which is also relatively easy to make (20 minutes) and has some quite appealing mechanics.

I actually feel quite bad giving this game such a low rating because the designer is a fellow BGGer who is very active on this site, and he seems like such a cool guy when I read his comments.  I guess the thing to understand when looking at my rating is that I'm simply not at all into solo board gaming (with the notable exception of "Dungeon Twister 2: Prison") and I've never been into the zombie genre, and thus my "fun factor" score pretty much kills it like a ravenous zombie.  ZimP is a great concept that is well-executed (partially thanks to Kwanchai's graphic redesign) and it does have some neat "push your luck" elements, but much of the game seems to come down to the luck of the tile draw.  But hey, it's a free "print 'n' play" game, so I really have nothing to complain about!  I'm very grateful to the designer for making it publicly available, and I'm very happy for him that it ended up being picked up and published by a real live game company!  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 1.5/5  Total: 4.5/10

Fast, fun and challenging. This is a great PnP game (And it has quite a number of rethemes if you don't dig zombies). Haven't had a chance to try out the retail version yet.

Update: Got tired of this one after a while. It is still a solid game but the decisions required aren't captivating enough to keep you coming back in the long-term. Perhaps the published version with multiplayer rules might salvage the system, I haven't tried that yet.

This is the first solitaire game that I tried, and even though it took me 8 tries before I actually won a game, I had a lot of fun, and even got my roommates to try it out when they were curious enough to ask me what I was doing, cursing to myself. lol I plan on getting the variants to change it up a bit. :)

I have version for purchase from Jeremiah with Kwanchi artwork.  I laminated my cards.

Fun, quick and a little addictive.  Very expandable and the varients on BGG help keep it from getting stale.

Extra credit from me because I love games I can take and play anywhere.

Update:  I have downgraded this from 6.5 to 5.5 because I just don't find myself wanting to play it anymore.

Update:  Downgraded to 4.5.  I appreciate it for what it is, but don't enjoy it anymore.  I keep it because it is a print and play so it really isn't worth trying to sell or trade.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 5

a solo print and play adventure where you survive, or not, zombie attacks. Played this twice with my son tonight and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.... granted the tv was on, the baby was dive bombing us off the couch and i had a phone conversation during one of the games. But for what it is, it is it.  nice job and free. will i pull it out while in an elevator or doctors office?

My son and I played this game for the first time during Earth Hour and the dark candle lit mood really set the theme for the game, and we both enjoyed the games that we played. We didn't win any, but we came close (which is fine with me because I usually cheer for undead guys during zombie movies). The game is easy to get, make and play, and is quite fun. Reminded me of another excellent solo game called Chainsaw Warrior that my brother and I absolutely flogged as teenagers, and I am sure my son and I are going to flog ZIMP. The game does fit in your pocket so can be taken anywhere. All in all an excellent well playtested game that is balanced just right (hard for the human to win, just how it should be).

Cute.  It has the same sort of tensions that one would get from a cooperative game, like Pandemic, and even has some of the same replayability, since not all the cards are used in each hour of the game.  That it's free, and can be created with two sheets of cardstock and one sheet of paper, is a definite bonus.  I'd be interested to see if someone (including the designer) may come up with a cooperative variant of the game, or maybe some new development cards.  I can see this being played out after about 10 plays or so.

3 plays: 1 player
7 plays: 1 player (on computer)

This is a fun light filler.  I used to play it nearly every day while at work waiting for some code to build on my computer.  There is a good tension in the game since each action takes away a card from the deck, thus reducing the time until the zombies win.  I like it.

Good little PNP solitaire game that's super portable.

Success is heavily affected by luck of the draw, particularly the order in which the room/yard tiles come out, but you still have meaningful decisions to make throughout.


After several plays the difficulty level does seem to drop quite a bit because you figure out most of the tricks to minimize lost time and damage so there's not a lot of long-term replay value, but overall this is still absolutely worth the effort to print out put together.

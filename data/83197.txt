It's Relationship Tightrope revisited, but less offensive and thematically more interesting. There neat little yin yang pieces representing one's "balance." But it's still just eh. There's no suits or anything. So the depth of trick taking is low--centered on balancing your yin and yang winnings.

Solid card game, play out of the box as a luck-heavy casual game, or with the 10 card per player 1 unused and with cards 1 to number of players x 10. The 2 basic strategies are to always stay in the middle, or to try and balance your Yin and Yangs.

Well, it's the umpteenth reworking and retheming of the game, but this one is the most beautiful and somehow the most fitting to the minimalistic game design. As for the design, well it's a Knizia - minimal set of rules for maximal tension. Great!

Let me say up front:  I HATE TRICK-TAKING GAMES.  I mean, the merest glimpse of Wizards will send me screaming from the room.  So when I find a trick-taking game that I not just tolerate, but actually enjoy, then it must be something special. I don't know whether it's the lack of suits, the absence of bidding, the high-low mechanic, or the unique scoring system that excites me the most.  I found that the game appeals equally to my peer playgroup,  my adult children, and my grandkids.  So my recommendation: if you only have one trick-taking game (which you should) Yin Yang should be the one!

I've enjoyed this with 3 and 5 players. It's much more interesting strategically than it appears.

Suitless cards mean you always feel like you're allowed to make your own gambles. This is in contrast to being forced to follow suit in other trick-taking games.

The variant where getting 0 allows you erase a previous score (instead of giving 2 points to all opponents) is brilliant: if you get a 0 in the first round, opponents don't fall too far behind too early. But if you get a terrible score in a round, you can still feel like it's possible to win by shooting for a 0 in the last round. Always play with that variant.

You don't have to play a number of rounds equal to the number of players. I think 3 or 4 rounds is probably enough.

I like trick-taking games, and the idea of having to think about how to manage points here is good (although there's certainly a random luck factor to the game). Based on engagement ability, this may get played < 1 / yr.  
Even though they're not trick-taking per se, those I game with prefer something like No Thanks! or 6 Nimmit for a card filler. Ok for something different.

RATING: 7
New Yin Yang edition of a Knizia classic, a good filler card game where you win white/black chips for playing the lowest/highest card in a trick, but the chips cancel each other out so the aim is to get a zero sum balance.

Some elements reminiscent of [gameid=175]

Recommended is the variant where players get 10 cards each and only play 9.  Some other good variants suggested by [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/video/8333/yin-yang/dice-tower-reviews-yin-yang]Tom Vasel[/url].

The "Mr. Retread" of designers has struck again.  Reiner Knizia is a master of having his designs republished with different names over and over again.  Often, other than the name, the games remain unchanged with each additional version.  Sometimes, however, very minor changes are made, but the pedigree of the new game remains unmistakable.  

Yin Yang is the latest in this long line of reinvented games.  Its grandfather is Drahtseilakt, which was published by ASS back in 1999.  This was followed by the re-themed Relationship Tightrope from UberPlay.  Now, the game has once again been republished by Gryphon Games as Yin Yang (Fifty Fifty in certain countries), albeit in a more basic and watered-down version.  I'm not sure why the game had to be simplified, as the original version was easy enough to learn and play.

The main change in Yin Yang versus its predecessors is the scoring cards.  The combination is different, and the cards that cancel one side of a scoring card have been eliminated.  I honestly prefer the original, as it requires more planning and seems to have more unexpected occurrences that force players to adapt their plans and scramble to achieve balance.  Nothing present in the original would make it too difficult for casual gamers or family members to learn and play competently.  I'm surprised the game was simplified even further in this new version.

There are two variants included in the rules.  One deals each player ten cards, but nine tricks are still conducted.  This gives players a bit more flexibility in planning their strategy for the hand.  The second variant adds a rule back from the original game.  If a player manages to take zero tokens in a hand, he can cancel a score from a previous round.  This gives players the ability to eliminate a hefty score from a previous round, perhaps bringing them back into contention.  I especially enjoy this last variant and would recommend it be included in future plays.

I have always enjoyed Drahtseilakt, and was happy to see it be published again when the Relationship Tightrope version was released.  While I'm disappointed that the decision was made to simplify the system in this latest version, I am happy that it is once again available.  The game isn't difficult to learn or play, but it does present the players with some interesting hand management decisions.  It works wonderfully as a filler for experienced gamers, and is a great choice to play with families and friends.

This is a clever, simple filler game with nifty mathematical balancing and a neat core mechanic, exactly what I expect from a Knizia design. I like the gambling and tough decisions, as well as the temptation to wait for the "right" score card to come up so that you can zero out exactly the right number of chips. It's easy to learn and teach, and fun to play without being too mentally taxing, but it's also bland and kind of uninteresting. After one play I never had any desire to play it again. Sold.

As light as it gets, a simple Knizia cardgame. Not super elegant but effective. The last few cards are almost random and the game reminds of 6 Nimmt ( Category 5) and how you the best laid plans can end up in total chaos in the last turn which makes the game more luck-based and more of a filler than anything else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Easy-to-teach trick taking game, reminiscent of (and simpler than) Take 6 or Turn the Tide. The big difference with Yin Yang (and its predecessor Relationship Tightrope) is that cards are played consecutively rather than simultaneously, which gives players more control over their strategies.

Although there is a lot of luck and chaos in the game, strategies and tactics are subtle and unexpected.

One minor note about the components of the game: "Positive" and "negative" points are represented by cardboard counters shaped as one half of a Yin Yang symbol. There is a lot of counter shuffling in this game, and these thin, small cardboard tokens are somewhat tough to manipulate. I might consider substituting black and white cubes for these counters.

RATING: 6
A near exact re-implementation of relationship tightrope, without the sexism.  It's neat, but doesn't grip me.  I'd much prefer that players not score until all the rounds are over and instead carry your white/black tokens over between rounds.  That way, there would be interesting asymmetries between players, the rounds would not be completely separable, and there would be more opportunity to come from behind.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Good variants: The rules also include a couple of variants. One that we particularly like is where players get ten cards at the start of each round. The game still ends after nine tricks, leaving one card unplayed. Since much of the game comes to setting up the last part of a hand and in particular the last card played, this offers a little more control. Another good variant lets you erase a score from a previous round if you score zero in a later round. If you want more skill and enjoy card counting, you could also try playing with cards numbered 1-30 for a 3 player game and 1-40 for a 4 player game.

RATING: 7
An elegant, fun and tense card game of trying to either not win or lose any bids or alternatively win or lose in equal amounts. I definitely recommend dealing out 10 cards to players so that you still get a choice when bidding for the last treasure. Also the ability to delete a previous score if you end a round with zero points can be a life-saver. Luckily I own the Polish Szaolin Panda version of the game, which is gorgeous to look at and also makes sense thematically.

I enjoy trick-taking games, and this one is a very streamlined, simple, quick-playing version -- would seem to be a great filler. It's been so long, though, that I don't remember if the rule simplifications vs. Relationship Tightrope are a good thing, or not. Maybe I can get that game back to the table some time....

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
There is a deck of 10 Scoring Cards, each showing a black number and a white one. Each hand, remove 1 randomly (play 9 tricks); also deal every player 9 cards (numbered 1-50). 

Player to left of dealer leads, and every other player plays a card. Highest card wins the trick: collect as many black tokens as on Scoring Card, and will lead the next trick. Lowest card collects as many white tokens as on Scoring Card. Black/white tokens cancel each other out: return pairs to supply, so that each player only has one color of token (or none at all). After 9 tricks, players score 1 Penalty Point for each token remaining. If anyone ended up with no tokens, everyone else takes 2 additional PP.

Reset and play again, passing the deal; 1 hand/player. The player with the lowest sum of PP wins!

Another fun, small game from Knizia - trick taking without suits. Everyone goes around and plays a card numbered 1 to 50. High card gets some black tokens, low card gets some white tokens. Black and white tokens cancel out and get returned. Try to end with as few tokens as possible over several rounds.

Another simple, but fun Knizia game.

Bidding to complete black/white sets.

Update: I finally managed to play this again (after almost 4 years). And it remains a really good hand management game where you want to win some tricks with a high card and come bottom in others to try and achieve 'balance'. Winning is risky because leading means you have little to no control over the outcome. 

Played with the ten card variant.

Rating up from 7 to 7.5.

I'm not a fan of 'deal with what you get dealed'-type of card games. If you get a hand of which your highest cards are an 18 and a 30 (out of 50), you're gonna have an unamousing round, and thus a lot of negative points and thus a growing hatred toward the game.

GAME: Dungeon Twister
RANK: 755
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent dungeon based game. Not your average cannon fodder game though. Strategic and highly tactical with little or no luck & a combat system drawn from LotR Confrontation. Can be prone to overanalysis but definately one to get the grey cells going and very enjoyable. 3/4 player may be a little chaotic and more luck based than 2 player

Very good original game with lots of player interaction and conflict. A little subject to anaylsis paralysis so the idea of a timer is a good one though I'd suggest a chess clock rather than a flat two minutes per go - some decisions need more time than others.

Nothing like it...a really good puzzle/chess like game with a dungeon escape theme. Many expansions and an apparent competitive scene makes it an interesting choice. Too many of my friends are AP'ers so this game drags on too much for me/them.

Like chess - no luck factor is in the game
but you can play "loosely" and still win
with an opponent at the same experience level as you can make mistakes thus you gain a chance to win

very simple mechanisms with a very complex gaming

RATING: 6
Wow, what a unique play this game is.  Endless variety of play, requires some good thought, just a tight game all around that's very fun.  Can be a brainburner AND feel like a fun dungeon crawl all at the same time.  Some tough decisions in the game too.  A bit of a trouncing happens if you don't calculate everything right.  Good game, not sure if it's great.  Needs more plays.

After one play I am intrigued. We didn't really know what we were doing and made some seriously bad choices. I need to give this game enough time to learn the characters and combinations... then'll I'll really know how to rate it.

This game plays pretty quickly, has a lot of options, and never lets down. This base set is so good, I never felt the need to buy expansions.

What a cool idea!  Only played two games so far on beginner level and they still took over an hour.  A timer is a good idea.  Very well balanced - there's usually more than one way to get out of a jam and the game rewards clever play.

It's certainly a real brain burner, as there is virtually no luck in the game other than the initial board set up.

RATING: 8.6
Juego de dungeons para 2 jugadores sin azar, sin dados ni cartas aleatorias. Mecánica por elección de numero de acciones por turno (4 cartas de 2,3,4,5 acciones que se reciclan) y combate por cartas de ataque, sumado al ataque de la criatura. Los puntazos del juego son la variedad de personajes con sus capacidades especiales, los objetos, y sobretodo el girar las habitaciones, cerrando caminos, abriendo otros, encerrando personajes, dejandote via libre para cojer cierto objeto, etc. El objetivo es conseguir 5 puntos, bien sacando personajes de la mazmorra por el lado opuesto al tuyo, o bien machacando a los personajes del contrario. Muy entretenido y con bastantes tema para pensar :)

RATING: 7.6
A clever little game, where two opposing teams are trying to rush past each other in order to meet their objectives.  Extremely tactical with lots of decisions to agonize over, and lots of different ways to play.  Whether to seek out or avoid combat, how to collect your 5 victory points, whether to be more offensive or defensive or some delicate balance of the two.  That's just the base game -- supposedly it gets alot better with the expansions....

A game with so many choices....  Has to be one of the best two player games that last about an hour.  Components are ok, the board is hardly the same for two games and it changes frequently during the game.  Top strategy and good theme.  Even played it wrong for the first time and it still turned out to be a very good game.

1st play: I had heard good things about this but really didn't know anything about it.  Lots of tactical choices, really cool minis, but without dice combat it works really well.  There are a ton of expansions, and they seem like they could easily substitute in and out.  The biggest downside is that it's 2p only, but I hear there are expansions that could make it more.  I like that the units are unique without being overly complex.

No 2nd play: 2 player gaming sessions are just too hard to get in and there's a lot of competition in this space.

Lighthearted race to the opposite endline. Great production and artwork. 

Can't help but feel the dungeon twisting made the game too 'out of theme'. Twisting a dungeon? Somehow it does not sync well with me. 

Overall, if the dungeon was 'fixed in 1 position'. I might've actually enjoyed it more.

RATING: 6
More like a race to the other side than a pure combat dungeon-y type game. Very good, thematic dungeon game, if that is what you are looking for. At first, I thought it was cheesy bad, since I was convinced I was on the verge of any easy, fast win. However, the big focus on this game should be the "twister" part - play that up to your advantage and don't underestimate it! 2015 UPDATE: Simply put, I have limited opportunities to play 2 player games and this is not one I would choose to play. Giving my copy to my sister who wants to try it out.

RATING: 4
Overall, a game with some neat ideas but it really needed some more playtesting and development to make the game more fun and less of an exercise in frustration. The rules seem to be a little more fiddly than they need to be with lots of exceptions and the game dragged on much longer than it needed to. The board and the action number cards are much more restraining than they should be and this was the main cause of frustration for me. For a game that bills itself as a no luck strategy game I certainly was surprised at the lack of control I seemed to have. I really wanted to like the game and was really looking forward to playing it. A no luck game like this with a fantasy theme really sounded like a good idea but after playing it just really didn't do anything for me at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun 2 player game, but the confusion over different versions and some stuff being out of print makes it more of a pain than its worth to add to my collection, but I do wish I had got the base game and a coupel expansions for it for myself while they were still in print.

RATING: 6.3
A decent game with a good idea behind it, but during play it falls short.  You have a virtual dungeon you are trying to escape with your party and players can "twist" pieces of it by rotating them 90 degrees and causing you to have to pick different paths based on how the wall segments are laid out.  The different characters are good, but since you only play with 8 in a game (and really only focus on 3-4 of them) it seems that everyone is just taking turns running or fighting and there isn't much room for strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The rotating dungeon play mechanic is fun, but the game isn't well thought out, and it doesn't help that the rules are poorly written.

We substituted some house rules to make it playable. The three biggest game changers are:

1. Combat cards are shuffled and placed face down. Players each draw and play a card during combat to add an element of chance so the outcome of each battle isn't predictable. 

2. Rival characters are wounded in combat, but never eliminated from the game (even when blasted with the fireball).

3. The winner is the first person to get all his characters (including wounded ones) out of the dungeon along with the treasure.

I like the idea, but haven't played enough to really develop strategies yet. There's a slight clash between theme and mechanics. One expects dungeon-twisting fantasy to have an element of luck, and to be pretty fast-paced and furious, whereas DT plays more like a complex game require careful thought and calculation.

Must try it with a timer, as suggested in the rules. Rating may change as I play more.

Traded away.

I love, love, LOVE this game. It is oozing with theme and a wicked sense of humor. I've only a few plays under my belt (between this and prison) but I've had an absolute blast each time.

I've only had the chance to play this twice, but I think the system is really really cool.

The drawback is that low-luck, many option system really invites deep thinking when planning out your moves.  You want to really count things out and explore the possibilities to find the ultimate move.  But, of course, that can make the game take forever.

It almost feels like it would work best playing by email, taking a turn a day.  Whatever the case I'm eager to play it some more, and I could see this rating going up even higher.

RATING: 4
I'm really not sure about this game, almost too many options. I'm not an AP player and this game does my head in a bit.
I do like the way it works and the many different ways in which you can try to use the charcters to win.
Do I go for treasure,
Do I fight,
Do I just run,
Shall I sneak and wait for the right moment

Does seem to have a lot of 'counting' how many actions, how many moves, what's my attack etc. Hence there is a horrible amount of AP. With more plays I'm sure it'll become faster. I'm just not sure I want to invest the time or effort needed when I could play other games.

Played again. Nope don't like it.

i bought this one sight unseen after hearing about how great it was, a super dungeon romp, etc.  it played like a calculational AP knightmare with a dungeon theme thrown on top of it.  i think games like this are best-suited for play by web, where thought can be legitimately devoted to each move.  with how open the whole board is, the fact that it's 2p, and not exactly light kinda forces the analysis onto you.  i wish it was more like finstere flure where you can ignore it if you want and go with the flow.  here it just feels like you're throwing the game if you do.

I can't believe I didn't rate and comment this after playing. A very thinky, chess-like game, quite different from what you'd expect. (I'd read reviews and knew what to expect, of course.)

This is not the game you might think it is.  It is 100% strategy with a classic dungeon party look and feel.  While themed as a fantasy setting, the game is a real brain-burner.  The game can take a fair amount of time to complete, especially if the players are well matched and experienced.  The numerous expansion add different twists (no pun intended) that keep experienced players on their toes when facing an unown opponent.  Well balance game.  Do not underestimate the brain-burn this game has.  [GTI: APSD]

Algo me llama de este juego y no sé lo que es. La mecanica es muy contraria a mis gustos. Muy cerebral, muy de quemar neuronas, muy de que los fallos te dejan en evidencia... Y sin embargo me gusta bastante. El tema. los componentes e incluso algunas mecanicas me gusta. Me encanta la tensión que me provoca que mi mago lleve el rayo... ya sabes... pero: conoces la sensación cuando te toca tu turno de que te molaria ser el contrario porque lo tiene todo de cara mientra que tú estas fotis? pues a eso me refiero... se ven demasiado los fallos.. tipo ajedrez... yo soy más de pasar desapercibido.

Me gusta y creo que para inciciar a la gente a esto es un buen juego. Pocas reglas, sencillo de explicar y que entra por lo ojos. Por eso lo tengo. No lo jugaré mucho pero las pocas veces que lo haga serán con buena intención.

Nice game. Rules need to be clarified in my opinion. Material is not perfect, and for the price some plastic miniature would have been much better. But of course better to push people buying official ones.

RATING: 7.8
A unique blend of Dungeon Crawl (at least in theme) and Euro-style brain-burner.  Players are in a race to escape a maze of trap-filled, spinning rooms.

With so much to keep track of, and so many variables, it can be difficult to plot out your moves over more thana few turns, and even harder to predict what your opponent might do in between.

I find this an incredibly rewarding little game that rewards flexible planning.  There's also quite a bit of psychological play with ample opportunities for bluffing.

Highly recommended.

(watch out for those speed potions by the way.  anything is possible when they are in play).

I'd love this game way more than I do with pimped components.  Moreover, pushing an item token along with whatever character is carrying it is fiddly and annoying.  Rotating the dungeon tiles gets tedious as well.

I don't really dig the LotR: the Confrontation style combat in this game as much as the latter.

There is clearly a physchological battle with the early counter placement and I guess some ideal tactics here. But the strategies seem wide and the lack of dice and random card draws (except dungeon tiles) really tips the skill level much higher than luck. Looking forward to 3-4 expansion.

I like that there are many aspects to this game to consider when playing...character skills, movement, strengths as well as dungeon twisting, and combat cards.  Played twice, lost both, will play again.  Negative part is the lenght of games...about 2.5 hours.

I think this game could grow on me with more plays, but right now, it's a six.  And stupid completist/hoping it will be a hit, me, I have both expansions so far.  Sometimes perfect information games are just not for me.  This is a 90% perfect info game, and I like a little luck and randomness to keep me on my toes during a game.

You really have to be in the right mood for this game. There's a lot of thinking involved, so when it's not your turn, it's a bit slow. Kind of like chess that way. But if that's the kind of mood you're in, then it's quite fun.

One thing that I don't like about it though is that your guys are cardboard pieces. I'd much rather play with plastic guys. I wasn't sure if this would bother me too much, but it does. I guess if all my other games had cardboard guys, maybe I wouldn't notice. But they don't...so I do.

Just ordered it and Impatiently await its arrival, I am so GEEKED! 

I got in a partial play as I did not finish this one with the wife, it was way too late and she was sleepy, however I LOVE what I have seen and she liked it as well. It comes off as being a lot lighter than it is strategy wise, just to look at it, however this one is DRIPPING with possibilities and is in fact a high strategy game. Looking forward to more plays and she likes what she has seen so far. It was simply too late to get her into something that new and deep, but I am encouraged, she has scheduled a rematch!!

Saddened by two facts here: one that I forgot to update that last play, and two that I do not own the sequel as yet! still the score has creeped into solid 8 territory, I do so enjoy this game, good stuff and i need to be about the purchase of the sequel!!

It's not really a dungeoneering game, but it's an abstract that ties in very well to the theme of dungeoneering.  The variety of characters to play with, and the intricately planned rooms that can twist, are a lot of fun.  The action point cards and the combat cards are nice touches and make this a very thoughtful, maybe brain-burning game.

The game also has both official and unofficial alternate scenarios, which are much more thematic in nature than many chess variants.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Clever game, quite dry. It certainly has depth and interest but it doesn't quite gel for me. Quite fiddly - spinning the rooms, carrying the counters, moving things around is a bit of a palaver and the boards are over designed. The game, however, does stay in the memory. If the wife can stand a few more plays the rating might go up. Might be worth investing in a chess clock.

***Upping it to a seven, still playing it and still engaging. Could rise further if wifey continues to feel challenged by it.

My favorite maze game.  When you need a 2 player game that is full of tricks, strategy and fun then this is it.  It reminds me of playing British Bulldog at primary school.

So many variables to keep track of, and very little randomness, make this one a bit of a brain burner.  Learned to play with 4 players, and the game went a bit long (3 hours), but it was very involving the entire time.  One important key seems to be counting your opponents' high combat cards as they are used.

Good stuff! Thinky without being boring. I am looking forward to improving at this game, still make millions of beginner mistakes. Since there is a lot of room for skill in this game there is also a lot of replayability. Every game and every opponent is different.

Update 080308: Lowered the rating to 7. This game requires the players to be of equal skill, otherwise it is no fun. Some would consider the fact that it rewards skill a plus, but I would actually like to see some randomizing factors to even out any skill/experience differences. And yeah, I know about the handicap system but I just can't see me using it.

After one play. Unusual two-player game which uses Fantasy as the theme for a slightly chess-like game that is part race, part puzzle, and part dungeon crawl. The mechanism which extends replay value is the "Dungeon Twist:" a manuever players perform which allows a change in the arrangement of the dungeon (gameboard). Learning the abilities of your pieces and using them in ways that complement their powers is the chief challenge to mastering the game.

I need to play this more.  I think it's a very well designed game, and I give it credit for being a Euro that has the balls to be about something thats actually interesting (a little ridiculous, but still interesting).  When I bring the game up with someone, they're usually a little put off by it NOT being a dungeon-crawl (which is usually followed by, "Then what is it?").  Still, I like it.

One partial play though this game had us stopping and playing something else.  I'd like to give it a shot again at some point with only two players.

Looks intriguing, but I suspect that mistakes made early in the game could be costly later without realizing it.  It seems combat is to be avoided where possible, as losing the wrong character could be crippling.

Had a few more games, this one certainly is a brain-burner.  The second game unfortunately brought both swords together in a room which ended up being an utter blood bath.  Combat is just vicious in this game.  We liked the game though, and it will be getting more plays soon.

I feel I should like this game, but I don't. Played it twice now and didn't enjoy either game, and didn't bother to finish either game - I just lost interest.

RATING: 8.5
Just one tip for you all: Play this game straight on with a 2 min. timer, as in the rules instructed. It`s just annoying if somebody tries to plan 3 or 4 actions ahead with every figure and permutate every move, as the game looses his fun and pace. Yes you will commit errors under time pressure, but it will be a ton more fun to play this game out of your guts. With more experience you get adapted.
I saw games which turned out to be longer as 2 hours. But this game is just fun as a light fun tactical game with a max. time of 30 to 45 min and minor downtime. W/O timer you will get a headache and be tired and bored just after one game.

t's been previously explained as a cross between a dungeon crawl and chess and I think the description is apt. Much thinkier than either of us expected (and took much longer too). It was a good game and I'd happily play it again; however, I'm not sure how often we'll choose it over other games

Pros:  only one random event (tile reveal), solid mechanics, built-in handicapping system, abstract aspects sneak up on you.

Yo conocí primero el Dungeon Twister 2: prison. Este es básicamente es el mismo juego, pero componentes menos espectaculares.
Se trata de ser el primero en conseguir cinco puntos mediante eliminación de personajes del contricante o saliendo de la mazmorra por el lado del otro jugador. Juego para dos que se desarrolla en una mazmora de ocho habitaciones, que pueden girar, haciendo del tablero una especie de laberinto en los que cada uno de los 8 personajes que lleva el jugador se pueden encontrar numerosos obstáculos (además de los personajes del contricante, que harán lo posible porque no salgas de allí con vida).
Juegazo.

I like the variety offered with the various characters and objects. It seems though that the same ending occurs with the final sprint to the 'finish line,' using the Thief with the 5 Action card, perhaps carrying a treasure for the extra point. Need to explore the setup options to try and avoid this seeming inevitability. Complaints: goes much longer than 45 minutes. I get frustrated when certain configurations of the modular rooms that stop movement cold, trapping key characters. Also, neither player is able to stop the Wizard from using his fireball, which almost always is aimed at the slow troll. Otherwise, the game is a fairly enjoyable dungeon crawl. UPDATE: Obtained first expansion, better game.

I've only had a chance to play this twice now, and both times were with 3 players. This is a keeper. I'm convinced it's a game I will never get rid of and eventually, will own more expansions for. 

It's got a great combination in luck and strategy. Although, once the game gets under way, it's more or less a complete information game, there is a large dose of luck/chaos in the setup. Trying to make the best of the current situation when there is so much going on is extremely fun.

So much to think about, so many options. I like the game, but it can take forever to finish.  Maybe it'll speed up with practice.  You can't beat the game's delivery of tactical choices.  The fact that exiting characters for VP also serves to weaken you as a whole is a great way to balance things.  Killing off your opponent has the opposite effect but I think it's harder, not to mention riskier, to approach winning that way.  I think my favorite thing about the game is it's neverending delivery of surprising moments.  Never underestimate the cleverness of your opponent!

RATING: 2
While I figured this game was probably not my cup of tea, I figured I'd give it a shot.  Turns out my gamer intuition was right and I disliked this one intensely pretty much right from the get go, even more so than I thought I would.

While the basic premise of a puzzly journey through a dungeon isn't completely unappealing to me, the way the fantasy theme is applied through a bunch of characters with special abilities, map effects, and objects lying around to pick up which do various other things (which some characters can use and others can't on top of it all) just completely turns me off.  It's probably more of a shortcoming of mine than it is the game's, but I absolutely abhor having to keep track of all this crap, and the fact that the game doesn't come with a reference sheet for the players boggles my mind.

On top of it all is the card based bluff/double-bluff combat we see in LoTR: The Confrontation which I also strongly dislike.

So, to sum it up...

I like - A puzzly journey to get from one side of the playing area to the other.

I pretty much hate - Absolutely everything else.  So much so that it makes the puzzly journey aspect completely unenjoyable.

I can see how others would really like this game, but for me, it's a game I would actively avoid in the future.  The only way you could get me to play it again is if there was some terrible consequence to not playing it.  And even then, I might cry while setting it up.

I'm absolutely terrible at this game (I'm what you might call "spatially impaired"), but I still find the main conceit pretty neat. Definitely starts to shine after repeated plays with the same person... after you both feel more familiar with the game and know how best to use each character (read: it's a bit fiddly).

Still, the designer gets points from me for deciding to mash up an abstract with a dungeon crawler and make the whole thing work.

Not a bad 2 player game, but not terribly compelling either.  Kind of a puzzle game, but that puzzle is downgraded by the poor combat mechanic.  Components are really weak in the English edition too.  The fantasy theme doesn't really get me going either.

Interesting .. was pleasantly surprised to find more of a strategy game in the box than a dungeon crawl ... rating is after 1 play, may go up or down .. A bit afraid that any longevity in the game may require more and more expansions. However, the price for the base game was very reasonable, only marginally more than "biggish" card game like lost cities or scarab lords, with alot more in the box.

[u]December 2008:[/u] Haven't had time to play again yet (my gf didn't like it as much as I did but she is ready to give it another go!)
I now have expansions 1 (P&D) and 2 (3/4 players)

[u]January 2009:[/u] I've played a few more times and I really LOVE the game. My gf started liking it too, however, I think I bought a bit too many expansions a bit too fast, my gf was then lost with all the rules so she doesn't like it much anymore (damn me!). I think we'll start all over and play with just the base game for a while and add one expansion after another. It is true that with 2 (soon 3) expansions (excluding the3-4 players one), the amount of new stuff is huge.

[u]May 2009:[/u] I now have all expansions (-3/4 second expansion) and tried them all out, except Terres de Glace.
As planned, we started more slowly this time and the game is really a gem. Some people will say it is chess in a dungeon, well yes, but it is NOT an abstract, the characters all have special powers that stick with their names. The game has a great theme, and it shows. However, it is a real brain burner and has almost no luck, which is rare for games that have this kind of theme. The only fault to find is that it is severely prone to AP.

[u]November:[/u] you can read my review [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/4262298]here[/url]

[u]December 2010:[/u] Changed my rating system, the game is now rated 9.5. Also I realize that the game is REALLY great with some expansions thrown in. The game would be rated 8 without any expansion but just one suffice to make it jump to 9.5 because of the amount of variants that exist with just one of these...

Dungeon Twister is a 2-player high level strategy game where 2 teams of adventurers with various powers are trapped in a dungeon. The board is composed of 8 rooms that can be moved and rotated by the players. Each turn, a player is able to spend actions to move around the dungeon, pick up and use items, battle with the opponents team, or turn and move the rooms of the dungeon.
The goal is to reach 5 victory points. Points are collected by moving adventurers out of the dungeon or by killing an opponent's adventurer.

Personalmente uno dei migliori giochi da 2 giocatori sul mercato, con un sacco di espansioni, di cui consiglio la terza e la quarta che aggiungono grande varietà. Dungeon Twister è quel tipo di gioco tattico che cattura l'attenzione di giocatori di scacchi e altri giochi del genere. L'ambientazione non è molto sentita ma la struttura del gioco è qualcosa di originale e veramente apprezzabile, inoltre è uno dei primi giochi con cui ho iniziato questo fantastico Hobby.

Enjoyable game, but it didn't go over very well with the wife.  I think it was too abstract.  It's also in a weird niche that might make it hard to ever play.  That being said, it's a pretty good game.  This is just a first opinion based on one play, and I think it takes a few to get it down.

I enjoy the variant player powers (in the form of the characters, especially when you get to chose which ones to use when including the expansions. I also appreciate the effort Asmodee went to create miniatures for the game. My only problem is that each further expansion for the game seems less and less compelling, and that the need to purchase at least two full sets of miniatures adds another $60 (U.S.) to the cost of the game, which seems ludicrious when you realize the game is just as easily playable with the components inside the box for no additional cost.

Dungeon theme pasted on an abstract strategy game.  Sooooooo many options that it makes my head hurt.  This game more than any other forces me into AP mode, where I end up taking a ton of time trying to think of a great move, get information overload, and end up throwing everything out and making some random move with no plan whatsoever.

I was intrigued by this game but every person I played it with hated it. Hated. They felt hostility toward its dry lack of humanity. It was to them as mechanical as the gears that rotate the rooms. Eventually I gave up trying to draw people in. I also realized that I didn't really like it much myself either. Too chessy. Bye bye, chessy chess.

Smartly designed and with a great graphic design scheme, Dungeon Twister is one of the better releases of the past couple of years.  The dungeon theme is terrific (so what if it's overused) and the rotating room mechanism brings a lot of fun and an intriguing element of problem solving to the affair.  The character combinations provide a lot of possibility and the replayability is very high.  The game plays almost like an abstract movement game but the theme is rich and the atmosphere is engaging.  Best of all, it's challenging and deep without needless complexity.  I think I love it.

My [u]favorite[/u] and most enjoyable boardgame. Similar with "DT2: Prison" (except no minis & no solo) --see my comments on DT2.

I own, also, a lot of different characters.

I love to hate this game.  It's an abstract strategy with a dungeon theme.  The object is to move your people through the dungeon with the help of various objects, fighting the other team along the way.  The dungeon is made of 8 room tiles randomly placed each play.  The tricky part is - the room tiles can be rotated!

Great idea and I'll continue to play it despite resounding defeats - but there's something about this one that I just don't grok.

I think I got my hopes up too high. The oft-used term "chess-like" is a bit of a misnomer, since it uses the combat card mechanic of adding a card to a character's base value (a la LoTR:Confrontation, A Game of Thrones, etc.), which is about as far from chess-like as you can get. It is indeed a fun little puzzle, and luckily easily handicappable. Not impressed with the production quality. Bits are flimsy and tokens easily tear, character figures easily bend, etc. I'm learning that this production quality seems to be par for the course for Asmodee.

Muy buen juego!
Es difícil encontrar juegos cortos (se juega en menos de media hora) así de buenos para dos jugadores. Tiene la dosis de estrategia y comecerebros requerida para pasar un buen rato. Además, tiene azar 0% (bueno, la colocación inicial del mapa, pero realmente no influye para nada) y eso para mí siempre es un plus :D
Temática muy bien conseguida, y el sistema de combate de los mejores que he probado, funciona a la perfección. Además, este mismo sistema evita que las partidas se alarguen innecesariamente.

Dungeon Twister features solid mechanics and is very well balanced brain burner much in the same vein as say chess. 

There are two short comings with the game, one being that the components leave a little to be desired because moving your pieces around is a little awkward especially if you pickup an item. More importantly though is that I just not sure how much 'FUN' the game is. The combat is not very exciting and the game typically ends up being anti climatic. 
Perhaps with more play will provide to be more entertaining.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Components: The dungeon squares look great, and have all sorts of great details on them. Having to stack a pawn/token atop an object makes it difficult to tell what that object is. The cards are functional.

Experience: A bit of a brain burner. There are so many ways to spend my action points that it takes me a while to think through my entire turn. Rotating the rooms is fun, opening up new corridors for my characters, and trapping those of my opponent. I like that we place each other's pieces in newly discovered rooms. I dislike the blind aspect of the combat. Feels a bit like work to get my team all the way through.

I like this best as 2-player to keep the turns moving quick and typically both players are involved with every turn.  This has a lot of what I love;  exploration of hidden tiles, dungeon theme, direct conflict, multiple paths to victory, spatial awareness, no unknown information for combat.  Each character really does feel different and you need to play them different and use teamwork between your characters to be successful.  The rotating rooms add an awesome extra way for your opponent to impact you.  Sooooo many different ways to play this game; different board configurations, symmetric or asymmetric teams, hidden or public team selection....My original copy is wore out from too many plays.  I will buy another copy and use card sleeves on that one!

RATING: 9
After 10 years the game is still a great experience and still so solid as time pass.

It feels a bit dry and AP prone at first, but the more you play it the more smoothly the game flow. Once you are familiar with the basic you can focus on the big picture, and the game is much more enjoyable and you appreciate the real depth of the game. Relatively simple rules, yet still plenty of tactics and strategies to explore after hundreds of play (including expansions).

This is one of the very few games I'd rather play with a timer, even for friendly game, as it keep the game flowing, avoiding AP. 2mn/turn is good enough, it doesn't stress you too much and keep a proper tension in line with the theme.

If you like it I recommend getting the first expansion too as it allows for many variations, plus there are various scenarios available on the net. The other expansion are more technical and for the real fans.

Not for everyone, but quite unique and excellent in its category.

Good and active community, still tournaments and conventions 10 years after the game was released

RATING: 9.25
Interested in this brain burner. 
Plan to use 2d7 and diff the dice values during combats to reduce AP.
UPDATE: played a few times. This game is fun! Wow, really satisfying with many possible interactions and combos. This is the game to take to a desert island (provided you have an opponent). I feel like I don;t need to add the expansion which I did buy, there is so much here. The combat system hardly has the AP probblem that I was worried about. The majority of the timesink comes from planning your turn. Still, plays in a decent amount of time. Highly recommended for 2, if you are looking for a 1-2 hour game with a gamer friend. 8.75
UPDATE: Still enjoying this and would be a top choice when limited to two players. Score holds at a very high 8.75.
Some fair criticisms: 
There is no box insert to keep the bits organized. (No effect on gameplay, but would be nice)
Since "carried" items are underneath the character, it is too easy to forget at times that there is a combat modifier when prepping your power card. I lost a game because of this. The easiest possible fix would be to have a notch cut out of the edge of the item chits and the top of the character standups so you could mount the carried items above. This can be a DIY project, but considering how well put together the mechanics are, and that it would not add further cost to the production, I would have thought the publisher would have come up with this idea during development. I will do it myself soon. 
update: 9.25. this game is great. perfect depth vs time and nice production quality for the price.

Easy to learn, difficult to master. Some compare it to chess; I don't know if that is fair. Doing so, I think DT is a lot more complex than chess and infinitely more interesting. Love it!
The only bad thing I can say about DT is how inaccessible some bits are. Do I strictly need characters like the Minotaur, Beggar and Purple Dragon? No. Or rooms P1 and P3? Maybe not. I would like to be able to get the replacement items for Forces of Darkness though.
I do find the design inspirational and the game absolutely hugely fun (just remember to make moves based on what you want to do and not on trying to calculate the optimal move - it'll only fry your brain).
Many thanks to Chris for making this and for being a really nice person.

The best dungeon crawler game that I have ever played. It has strategic thought, battles, treasures and scenarios. It reminded me Heroquest but it has more options in every turn. The combat is very easy. It ends in 1 round but you must think nery much what card to play because it may cost you in the future. A session lasts 1 hour and it is a very enjoyable experience every time we paly it. And it has many expansions, that they add many many choise to the game. Excellent!!!

Great little chess-like brain-burner with semi-random setup and a dungeon crawl theme. You can set up elaborate schemes or go for quick strikes to score points.  Combat system (play a card and add it to your character's inherent strength) isn't my favorite, but it works OK here since there aren't a lot of battles over the course of a game.  Rating may go up or down as further play reveals the true amount of replay value.

RATING: 9
Very fun and original Dungeoncrawl game with beautiful artwork and components (okay, it may not be a Dungeoncrawl in the normal sense of the word, but read on...) 

Players randomly lay out a series of eight dungeon tiles facedown and take turns placing 6 objects and 4 characters facedown on those tiles. Each player starts at their end with 4 characters, each with special powers appropriate to their class (the Thief disarms traps, for instance). Dungeon tiles are flipped, for one action point, by an adjacent character. The first player to obtain five victory points, by killing characters or escaping through the far side of the dungeon, wins. 

The unique twist is that colored pairs of dungeon tiles can be rotated, which can get your characters closer to the exit or get your opponent's characters further from their goal (or even trap them entirely). 

All of these elements come together to form a game with surprisingly deep tactical play and difficult decisions. Two types of analysis paralysis can be witnessed in this game: the normal min-maxing that involves picturing every possible move and its repercussions, but also just the ability to envision how these moves will play out. It can also be frustrating to track the opponent's combat card loadout. None of these concerns prevent the game from being a ton of fun. Highly recommended.

I love this game.  Always different, oozing theme, an unforseen move by the enemy can quickly turn the tables, lots of strategy in terms of where to place and whether to play defense or offense.  Only downside is so much freedom with such tight limits = analysis paralysis.

Tedious - lots of turns required to achieve minor tasks.  I didn't read reviews carefully enough, but this is even more of a brain-burner than I would have expected.  Tried playing several times, but never completed a game - not even getting a single character to the other side.  Maybe I haven't given it enough of a chance, but maybe it has failed to reveal its magic with several fair opportunities.  I'd like to trade, because I don't ever imagine trying it again.  I need Descent or something more like a dice-driven dungeon crawl.

RATING: 6
Players try to navigate their team of adventures through an ever changing dungeon.  Essentially a race game, players sit opposite each other, and try to move 5 points of characters off the opposite end of the board.  The board is 4 by 2 dungeon tiles that have the ability to spin, changing the path layout dramatically.  Each of the eight characters on each team have a special ability, and of course you can beat up the opposition team for bonus points.  A strange mixture of a game - not a dungeon hack, but a race game in a dungeon.  It works quite well, and best of all, it's very quick to play.

A good game that only gets better with familiarity. There's a lot more here than I expected. Reminds me of LOTR Confrontation.

RATING: 6
Dungeon Twister is a very interesting two player game.  Each player controls 8 characters and 6 items each.  The goal is running your characters to your opponents end line through the labyrinth or killing your opponents characters (through card driven combat ala LoTR Confrontation/AGoT).  The labyrinth is not fully known until it's explored and once it's been explored the orientation of the rooms traps, open passages, and locked doors can be altered by twisting the rooms.  Sounds like a thrilling dungeon crawl?  Not really.  It's feels more like playing an abstract strategy game, though I do feel like the designer did a good job on the theme.  After all of the rooms are revealed there is literally no luck in the game and it's this luckless battle of wits that makes it feel like an abstract game.

The game is not completely devoid of luck/randomness/chaos.  At the beginning players will secretly arrange 4 characters on their end line and put their remaining 4 characters and item tokens on the face-down dungeon tiles.  Once this is done the players use action points to reveal rooms, move in the labyrinth and start combat.  The initial orientation of the room is random and this can play a big part in how the game plays out.  When a player reveals a room he places everything in the room, how he wants with the exception of his own items.  This is where the randomness of the tile orientation can suck.  If I have a bruiser revealing a tile that's next to him, but there is a wall between him and the revealed tile, I wouldn't be able to place my opponents squishy character next to him and start combat.  This sounds good but then maybe my opponent reveals a room and there is an opening to the newly revealed tile and he's able to do this.  There are other ways in which the chaos can take the enjoyment out of the game a bit.

With the expandability of this game and the way it works, it's basically the miniatures game I've always been looking for, without the crazy high price tag.  If you're going to try this game I would like to pass on a word of advice: both the games rulebook and I strongly recommend that you use a timer as so that the game stays within a manageable time frame.  

[b]Basic Dungeon Twister[/b]:  This section is to talk about the differences between Dungeon Twister (DT1 for future reference) and Dungeon Twister Prison (DTP for future reference).  It should be noted that these game are not only base games but also expand one another.  All of the expansions for Dungeon Twister will work with either game.  It should be noted that I think the original Dungeon Twister is a better value for your money and a better entry point to the Dungeon Twister universe.

This is a pretty cheap game to acquire and has an interesting mix of characters and items.  In fact it's MUCH cheaper than DTP.  I would say it's easily worth how much it costs.  I definitely prefer the mix of characters in DT1 compared to DTP, though the items are a little more interesting in DTP.  I believe that the included dungeon tiles of DT1 has a little more open feel to it compared to DTP which may or may not be a turn off.  Finally, I think the significants of the luck room reveals has less impact in DT1 compared to DTP.

A wonderful game - perhaps one of the most satisfying 2-player games ever invented (the 3 to 4-player games add an element of chaos which might not appeal top everybody). Plays quick (if players don't ponder their moves too much, which can happen) and rewards skill without being a dry strategic exercise. Very little luck involved (perhaps 5%, not more), which is surprising when you think of the fantasy theme. A nice element of the game is the uncertainty of who will be the winner up to the end of the game, as a player who is lacking in VP's can still manage a win with a well managed series of moves. Everything about this game is well thought out and tested, and it will be enjoyed for quite a while, of that I'm sure.

Seems to be very similar to Wiz-war.  Perhaps a bit more streamlined.  I really like how they kept the randomness down to acceptable levels.  Combat is completely deterministic.  The only random thing is what the configuration of the floor tiles is, which is great.  One downside is that the roolbook is entirely too verbose.  It's like 15 pages.  Could have been 4.  Because of the strong theme and ameritrash feel, I kinda have to be in the right mood to play this, so I gave it a 6, even though I think it's one of the very best of its genre.

Theme-wise, the game is quite evocative and that adds to an already very tense and exciting game. But, and it's a big but, players have to keep the game moving. AP will thoroughly kill the fun in this game. 

Also, talk of this game having no luck is not quite true. You can be screwed by the blind initial placement of your pieces on the dungeon tiles.

A tough, brain bending, part skirmish, part abstract game that has a host of expansions for added variety. It's one of those games I respect more than I enjoy. 

It's a very dry, thinky, chess-like experience in that you move your pieces -- each with different movement and abilities -- on a grid while anticipating your opponent's moves. Then, very unlike chess, you can twist the dungeon rooms (playing boards) to create opportunities for yourself or block your opponent. 

The goal is to get points by exiting your dudes from the dungeon or killing your opponent's dudes. Setting yourself up for the right opportunity via a room rotation is key. People who are good at spatial imagining probably love this one.

This is probably a better game than I rate it (6) but it has no random elements, so it's too much brain burn for me.
And personally I hate the combat mechanic (you both have a set of number cards that you can use each number only once) So it's just a bluffing rock, paper scissors,
I'd probably love this game if you just rolled a die and added your strength for combat.  There is enough to think about with just movement.

For a dungeon bash, it works well enough. The twisting element was very interesting but a real brain-buster. The fact that you can twist the alternate room is the key to this game. If you spend your early game opening portcullises and collecting items, you can make easier for the other player to get through. I also think the early placement of the characters makes a big difference (and where I made my first mistakes). I had my Troll right at the back and it never got into game. It took so long to move, it just didn't work as a guard. Knowing the best way to use each character comes with experience, so an experienced player should beat a new player (and the rules have a variant for this). Play before you buy.

I'm not sure that I want to jump into the several expansions as I fear they would ruin the  great balance of just the right elements  found in the basic set.  Sometimes a puzzle, sometimes a tactical struggle, and sometimes a race.  Great fun.

There might be no luck, but the number of moves possible each turn is so huge that the game quickly becomes untractable. Therefore, I feel like you win or lose this game on a playing error, having forgotten to look at a possible move from your opponent. This makes the game feel quite chaotic.

One of my top 3 all-time favourite games (from 20+ years of boardgaming!). Chess meets Dungeon Crawler! With no luck involved and several thinking dimensions (Overall Strategy, Sort-Term Tactics, 3-Dimensional Thinking, Memory, ...) this one will seriously steel-harden your brain while swinging swords.

This game sat on my shelf, unplayed, for 18 months.  What a waste!  I love it.  I'm 0-4 against my nephew, but each game is closer and harder fought than the last.  No reason to sniff at the theme if you're not into fantasy - this game is about maneuver and creative use of characters' special abilities.  Can't wait to try the 3-4 player expansion.

Played at Origins 2005.  My brain hurt after this one, without much satisfaction in spite of winning.  My opponent and I both agreed that, of all the games played at the con, this is the least likely we'd desire to play again.

IMHO, this does NOT qualify as a dungeon crawl.  Sure, it has a dungeon theme, but it's more of an abstract tactics game with some resource management (your attack and jump cards).  There's no adventure to it at all.

This is one of those games where I appreciate the design, but the game just isn't for me.  Even though it is a fantasy themed game, it felt a little dull, and it is definitely heavier than it looks.  I can see how people would like this, especially here on the Geek, but for me it just wasn't very fun.  Maybe my opinion will improve with more playings.

Update: Yes, my opinion of the game has improved considerably.  I am still not sure if it is my type of game, but it is a good game just the same.  It's a nice mix of characters and the twisting rooms are great.  It does take a while to play, but it is a rewarding game.  Now I have to think about what expansions are out there...

It has a slight space-hulk feel to it (because of the Action Point system and moving around in corridors), and the theme makes you think about D&D. But really, I think this game resembles chess more than the above-mentioned games. That is, if chess had hidden placement, the board could change between rounds etc etc

Great fun for two players. My girlfriend regularly crushes me in this game. It quickly gets a lot more complicated than it looks.

Un juego curioso, que se caracteriza por la total ausencia de azar. Ambos bandos son simétricos, de manera que los jugadores basarán su victoria en su despliegue inicial y en su habilidad.

The game is fiddly, combat is awful, the game is prone to lots and lots of AP because of the designers fear to add any random element to the game, and the components are less than exciting. This game should be nowhere near the top 200 less top 2000.

What else do I need to say? It's a very strategic game with little luck involved, with a great fantasy theme, design and art. It's fun with cool bits, it's fast playing, and lot of fun for two players. The theme is tacked-on, and it feels more like chess than anything.

I highly suggest this one if you like abstracts and strategy games.

I'm still undecided on a rating, but Dungeon Twister is a neat little game. It's not the game one expects to find in a box with the word "dungeon" on it. It does have nice fantasy atmosphere that feels like a natural fit for the game. But the game itself is a tight, cerebral two-player contest of maneuvering and outthinking and looking ahead and solving tactical puzzles. In other words, it's a real thinker, which is unusual in the fantasy/dungeon genre. I would like to play it more, but don't often have the opportunity to pull out a game like this.

Took the rating up one point after more plays - this could turn out to be the next MtG.

Possibly a very expensive game if you want to have all expansions (20€ is rather steep for an expansion), hideously expensive if you want the 'official' miniatures (56€ for miniatures two players, add miniatures for all expansions....).

Another upwards adjustment for the rating - I keep feeling the urge to play this.

I appreciate this game, but I don't enjoy it that much.  Even though people call it abstract strategy, I don't like its focus on direct combat and the action point system is draggy compared to Shazamm! or LotR: Confrontation, two games I do like.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Has a great amount of possibilities, a great combat system, and is almost completely devoid of a luck factor (besides the initial board layout, which is random); however, it's also considerably long if a turn time limit isn't enforced, and even so it's a bit on the dry side. The components are decent - albeit not really worth the MSRP of $20. I don't like the general art direction, either.

My first impression of this game is lack lustre.  There are some really amazing game design concepts here and I can totally see why people enjoy this game, but for me the fact that the game starts in an almost entirely random and unpredictable state, but after that plays without any randomness feels a little backwards.  Maybe playing the newest version with the plastic minis would have made it more immersive, but this one isn't my cup of tea.

Never played a full game of this one, although but it's somewhat fun. It's very conflict oriented, so you might not want to play with the spouse. Don't like the card flipping combat. The variable number of moves per turn also seems unnecessarily complicated and can lead to some AP.

Interesting and great game. As there is hardly any luck in it, it offers more tactical brain burning then any wargame I know - funny.
Game is fun... sure, as usual it depends also on your opponent whether a game is fun -- this game, I would not like to play with an optimiser/analyser. While in fact, I want to play no game with such a freak.

RATING: 3
True, the theme is D&D like, true, there is not *apparently* much luck involved.  It is, however, both dry and chaotic.
You have to do a lot of tactical computation, which can be ruined in a single turn.
Add to that the relatively poor quality of the components.
And the random tile placement in the setup has a huge impact on the game.
It has the sad privilege of being the first game with such a theme that I have no real desire to play again.
[update]
Well, with a timer the game is much better; be strict when time runs out and you'll have some fun.
Just a little.

4 plays.  Still not sure if there's a best startup, but I'm begining to doubt it.  I think there is just enough randomness to keep any single setup from being optimal.  More fun each time I play, just too bad I can't get the 2 player games out very often.

[Initial Impression: 6]
The theme of a head-to-head dungeon crawl and the fact that so much of the information is open and therefore leads to lots of opportunity for strategic planning had me really looking forward to this game.  In practice, however, the theme doesn't really seem to add much, and the gameplay is blase.  I just had the feeling of moving my chits around, trying to avoid the other player, while they did the same.  This makes it simply a race to get your icons out of the dungeon first to score victory points.  Clearly, more confrontational approaches and blocking of your opponent are possible, but there are enough outs that with just a little planning, you can easily avoid such traps.  The twisting rooms mechanism is interesting, but in practice it doesn't get used a whole lot (it usually seems better to advance your tokens than to spend actions turning rooms if they aren't blocking your pathway) and actually picking them up and turning them is a bit of a hassle.

One of these stategy games with very little randomness (actually the initial set of tile is the only random part) and more about making choice. Better, the initial positioning of the pieces is blind, as you don't know what the opponent is doing, nor how the room are. 

I have seen games where the opponent scored 3 of the 5 victory points in the first turns with a very open room, the goblin and the treasure, but then lost.

Bonus: there are scenarios that allow setting different game objectives.

Oh man, this game is not my cup of tea. I really like the idea of the rotating dungeon floors and I am always up for a good fantasy theme.

I bought this as soon as it came out in English and ended up trading it away.  The game is supposed to be devoid of luck and randomness, but actually succeeds in being devoid of fun.  While there is a good deal of strategy and planning, room tile and secret token placement always end up benefitting one side or the other.  Unfortunately what it really all comes down to is that the game just isn't that much fun to play.  It just seems rather dry and unengaging.

Update: Downgraded my rating after I was given the opportunity to get a free replacment set for the misprinted items in the first box I ended up trading away.  I didn't take it...If NOT accepting a free game isn't the mark of a horrid experience, I don't know what else would constitute.  I really have no desire to ever play this game again.

Bought this game after a long dry spell of non game playing.  It sounded intriguing and well put together, so that was good enough for me.  The rules were clear and it made sense when I read the rule book, always a good sign.  Finally got to play it, and I did enjoy it.  Still had to revert back to the rules and what certain powers meant, but it wasn't tedious to do so.  Clever game in all, but I beat my playing partner, and that usually signals the end of a game for him, sigh.

First play. Dungeon Twister is a highly tactical game with a very small element of chance (just the selection of room tiles during set up). It offers the same type of open game play as a wargame i.e. there are hundreds of possible action/move combinations from which to select on your turn. But, unlike most wargames, combat is handled by cards selected by the players rather than any randomising mechanism.

This is a game that I anxiously awaited playing and had high hopes for.  Unfortunately, from the beginning my experience with the game was negative.  The components are thin cardboard with an almost plastic laminate finish.  I was more than happy to overlook this for a solid game, but my copy was poorly cut leading to one of my room tiles being marked.  :(

The gameplay shows promise for me, but was a total flop for my usual gameplay partner. (my wife)  It is unfortunate that the game is very susceptable to analysis paralysis.  With each of us unfamiliar with the game it was painfully slow and dull.  I'm hoping that I can convince my wife to try it again and that future plays will merit a raise in my ratings.

Update: Asmodee replaced my damaged room and the second playing was much better- bumped up my score a point. 

Update: Several nore recent playings have been even better so this rating is moving up again.

Update: Asmodee has replaced all of the thin cardboard components with a replacement kit in order to make the original American base game compatible with the expansions.

RATING: 8
Excellent VERY high strategy game that works very well, combines D & D with a little stratego and it plays like chess. Don't take the last statement lightly, there are so many move possibilities all with their own gain or consequence, if you don't like chess you may not like this for the same reason. 

It is a very deep game prone to AP with almost NO LUCK, tons of strategy, great theme, even some bluffing and fun too. The fact you can use all your action/move points for one character really makes you think and calculate, you need to think ahead several turns also to be great at this. Quick advise, protect your cleric and don't let a single character stray too far! 

Not really a true dungeon crawler which does NOT hurt it at all. Most of the low raters I'm finding had the wrong expectatons right there, it PLAYS very much like an abstract even though the theme is great so don't expect the same kind of fun as a Crawler. Any dungeon crawlers who really need to throw dice and have luck....can! Just add a 4-sided or 6-sided die to the combat numbers and voila, although this will add some luck it will also add some more cool unpredictability. In fact lots of house rules could be imposed here (turn timer being one of them depending on who is playing), possibilites are vast. 

Componets are sufficient and don't hurt the experience at all although after several plays I feel more items and characters could have been given to keep it fresh and even more unpredictable(a.k.a.expansions, I suspect my rating for these will be a little higher). I can see where some of these original characters won't get used once I own expansion(I smell another house rule {random character assignment} )....

Quick update: dropped my rating a little, even though replayability is high, the desire to play isn't as much which I think will change once first expansion is added to keep it more fresh and unpredictable with more characters etc.

This is a frenetic little quicky conflict game that I enjoyed for what it is... While strategy exists, the best laid plans can get all twisted about, pardon the pun.  I think this is a solid 'fast' game, and if you're taking too long (plenty of room for analysis/paralysis) then you're missing the point.  Race for the exits, grab points as fast as you can, and watch out for that speed potion!

A playable mixture of strategy, tactics and dungeon-crawl. Tense. Creative opportunities. Not dry in the least. 

On the downside, there's too much to keep track of, though, especially if you don't play it regularly--all eight of your characters, all eight of your opponents, items and the maddening (yet wonderful) twisting board.

Your party has perfect communication with each other--OK, troll ten corridors away, crank the handle?! I realize it's a complexity/realism trade-off, but it would be cool to have a more dungeon-y sense of isolation.

Overall--thumbs up. Fun game.

My number one game for 2 players. Each game is different than the last and it has many expansions. I love that it has next to nothing regarding luck (only in the random deployment of the rooms). Great fantasy theme (Dungeon Crawler). Always want to play it although be warned, it is a brain burner. 

To avoid a long play time, I recommend to play with the 2 minute per turn rule.

It has a steep learning curve but if you like games that make you think, I mean really think, this game is a must.

Dungeon Twister is the perfect 10.0 for me. It has been my favorite game for years now and I don’t see how a game could surpass it. It has everything I value in a gamea, a high strategy level (99% skill based), memory is important, it has a high spatial facet (not my forte but I enjoy it), lots of replay value (furthermore if you add the expansions), very low luck factor, very deep (experience matters a lot), lots of options each turn. Each expansion adds a HUGE amount of additional options (characters, rooms, objects, terrains) while maintaining the core system the same. I LOVE IT.  The game is so hard, some friends feel they are working instead of playing (Dungeon Twister is not for everyone, better try it before you buy it), but I love it. 

The rules can be explained under 10 minutes, but the gameplay is so deep, I’m still learning new things after 90 plays. I love to play against better opponents, so I almost always lose the game, but my objective is to get better at it so I don’t mind.

Love the theme.

There are still some goodies for the game that I’m missing, but now I own all the big sets. In fact Dungeon Twister: Créatures Sylvestres is the most expensive game I own.

There was a time, I wanted to play the game with miniatures, but now I prefer the cardboard stands, the reason is that the miniatures can block the board, so I have made mistakes thinking there was a clear path when there was a wall. They also hide the object the creature is carrying and they are very expensive.

I was expecting the next expansion (Traps) and I hope they release it in the future. I’m sad that it seems support for the game has now stopped. 

Bottom line, Dungeon Twister is the best game ever made for 2 players AND it is the best game ever made. I won’t ever say no to a game of DT.

Current Rating: 10.0

I should have played the starter game.  I played the regular one, earned 5 victory points to my wife's 0 and now she won't play.  Arrgh.

RATING: 8
2P game, each player has (the same) set of characters each with different speed fight and special abilities. Start at opposite ends of the "dungeon" and try to get out the other side... or kill your opponents. An escape or a kill each count for one victory point.

Our first play was most entertaining (session report [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/176460][u]here[/u][/url]) but I don't think I'll get away with the same tricks in future games.

RATING: 8
An abstract game with pretty trappings! May be dry for some players and to analytical for some others. It really is a strategy game.

It is in no way a fantasy adventuring game, if that's what you're looking for you'll need to investigate some of the others (Return of the Heroes, Runebound, Dungeoneer, Magic Realm, Prophecy, Talisman, Descent, World of Warcraft, etc.). 

Dungeon Twister is a pretty good strategy game.

I haven't liked a game this much in a long time.  A fantasy, dungeon-crawl, strategy game without any luck involved. Combat is resolved like LotR: TC.  I can see the need to play with a timer.  The game is simple, yet there are so many decisions to be made.  Could tend to cause analysis-paralysis without a timer.  I would like to see more wizard spells in the expansion(s) (or maybe an all wizard version a la Wiz War).

I like the bits and the system a good deal.  However, my Euro-snob friends think it is too light and fluffy (turned off by concept, I think), whereas my friends who like lighter games find the system overwhelming.

I am very pleased after an initial play with my wife.  This one is at least an 8.  Second play didn't go so well.  About half way through, my wife was visibly upset.  We ended up not finishing.  What's the point if we're not both having fun?  I had decided at the start of the game to take an extremely defensive stance, and it was mercilessly effective.  It's a fantastic game, but it's too adversarial to be fun for those not looking for a fight, i.e. my wife.  Yes, I know, I know, I should have seen it coming.

I bought it following Tom Vassel's advice (it's in his top 10). This game is so under-rated, definitly. Thanks Tom.

It's often compared with chess. This might be true in some aspects like analisys paralisys and the squared board. I don't play chess anymore because it's too dry and makes me headaches, and here's where D.Twister difers largely from chess. It has refreshing colors, it's varied, it has deep strategy  but not that much to burn your brain.

If you like strategy, almost no luck, fantasy themes, short games, I highly recommend this one. It's 2 players so you can find someone to play easily.

UPDATE: unfortunately, it's too similar to chess ... I love this game, but my gaming group get headaches when playing, so this game hasn't seen the table for a very long time.

RATING: 7
Fun game of limited actions.  I wouldn't want to play all the time, but it's quick to learn, and if you can avoid analysis paralysis, plays quickly.  I am impressed with the clear rulebook, sometimes things get lost in translation, and that doesn't appear to be the case here.  I do think the game might be a tad over-priced for what you get, but it's fun, so I won't complain!

RATING: 10
A truly wonderful 2-player dungeon crawl/strategy game of hand management with lots of forward thinking.  The subtle rotation of a room adds a deviously significant and tactical challenge to this game (...which might be cause for concern to those of us who are spatially impaired).  Careful consideration in set-up placement of your 8 characters is a must.

Expansions Owned:
Paladins & Dragons

UPDATE :  I've since replaced the base set cardboard cut-out figs with the Asmodee blue/yellow set of resin characters.  Very nice.

The game strikes just the right balance between abstract strategy and fantasy. It's not a dungeon crawl, but neither is it chess. The balance between players is absolute. The characters' unique abilities forces them to work together to achieve their goals. Wonderful. There is nothing like it. This game just clicked with me. 

Worth noting: The experience level of the players makes a huge difference. An experienced player will see 10 more options on a turn than an inexperienced one. Do be prepared for this if you are a novice or prepare your novice opponent. It can be daunting to be beaten 5-1 without any sense of how or why it happened. I recommend calling the first game a teaching exercise and walking your novice opponent through their options.

UPDATE. My love for this game continues! Upped my score a point.

El juego me parece que está bien, bastante táctico, y con un buen componente psicológico a la hora de jugar las cartas para afrontar los combates.

Creo que es más fácil ganar por combate que por sacar a tus personajes de la mazmorra.

Desde luego no puedes jugar a lo loco, y tampoco puedes basar toda tu estrategia en intentar salir por un sólo punto, porque te puede salir mal y regalarle la victoria al contrario mediante derrotas de tus personajes.

Good game, a tactic one, with a good psicologic factor once you have to play your cards in a combat.

I think it's easier to win by combat than by taking out your characters from the dungeon.

Of course, you can not play in a crazy way, and you can not try to go out by a single exit also, because it can go wrong.

I think that the design of the game is solid and clever and deserves all the praise it gets.

For some reason I just don't like the combat resolution mechanic of selecting cards and comparing the values and the all or nothing consequences.  I didn't like it in Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation and I don't like it here.

An atypical fantasy themed game. The art looks like 1980s American (e.g. Necromunda) but the gameplay feels more like Mr. Jack (a newer Euro). No luck. Lots of movement. Simple combat. Think I will grow to like this even more. 

Warning: not your standard fantasy game. This is move / counter-move, not "I roll 2d6 for my two-handed sword." 

Rating may go up with further play. I'm hoping it doesn't bog down once I become more familiar with it.

A great strategy game that I would consider "modern chess."  It's a very good game that involves quick thinking, good decisions, and dealing with a change in scenery. Very little (if any) luck is involved and that makes the winner feel even better when defeating their enemy.  A great game with tough decisions, unique characters, and a good gaming system.

RATING: 7
Unlike chess, this game is so difficult to see what all of your opponets options are, thus it can be real challenging to play defensively.  That is to say, it's very hard to base your moves off of what you think your opponet will do.  Sure there are general stratagies and tactics you will have, but it's so hard to account for a single character moving 15 spaces and two dungeons twisting for him and . . .
but that's just the nature of the game and not necessarily a drawback.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Dungeon Twister is an intense 2 player game. It has the intensity of an abstract but the theme is very deeply integrated into the mechanics. The game is close to perfect information, and notably combat does not involve dice (YAY!). 

You must be the first to score a certain number of VP which you can do by escaping from the opponent's starting line or by killing your opponent's pieces. There are terrain effects and maze-like dungeon tiles, pit traps, locked doors, magic wands, rope, etc... Characters each have special abilities such as being able to move over pit traps, smash through doors, walk through walls, etc... It all adds up to immense replay-ability, add in an expansion or two, or three, and you're set for life!

Combine an abstract chess-like nucleus with a dungeon crawler theme, an action point system and card-driven combat et voilá: Dungeon Twister.
I'm not a big fan of dungeon crawlers but luckily the focus is on gameplay. Heaps of options and decisions are generated by up to 5 action points available per move. DT is AP prone and surprisingly deep/dry which might be a bit of a disappointment for players expecting a more theme-driven quick dungeon experience. Notwithstanding its abstract core, the game succeeds for me in generating a story.

This is one I like--lots of strategy, low luck (which is sometimes but not always good), and a good but not overly complex range of options. My only problem is that even playing fast, it's probably too long to play at lunch. (We tried again and still didn't finish, though I got to three VPs with good prospects for winning.)

RATING: 9
Elegantly put game - [b]optimal for strategy and lots of laughs with the thematic situations[/b]. Unit abilities aren't overbearing and the straight value   hand management combat is simple (synonomous to Lord of the Rings Confrontation).

As a 2-player game, this is all about strategy. Plays like a twisted chess. The major gripe I have over this game is that [b]people can be stuck with 'analysis paralysis' [/b]where they try to find the most optimal move for the 4 action points they have. This game definitely needs a timer.

As a 3-player game, there is a lot more chaos and chicanery. It's even to say more exciting because when someone uses their 6 combat card, the other 2 players have an advantage with their hand management.

I can't wait to try it as a 4-player game!

Also, the lame thing about the 3-4 player expansion is that it's the same thing as the original game but with 2 different colors. I suppose it's a way to cut down production value for people who only want the game for 2-players, but I think this game is alot more fun with more players. [b]And it needs a timer![/b]

RATING: 7.5
This almost feels like LoTR: Confrontation. Move characters to the other end of the board, and Combat cards to resolve combat. However the twisting mechanism adds a weird touch to the game.

Rules were a little heavy, but I enjoyed this game quite a bit. And its a lot quicker than I expected (after hearing tales of it being like chess and lots of analysis-paralysis). I could definitely do a game in 20 minutes. Components were a bit iffy, but the game more than makes up for it.

Not a bad game, but I expected it to be something different. A monster-slaughter, that is. It isn't such, but instead a bit abstract feeling dungeon game about getting out of the dungeon.

Also, just as with A Game of Thrones and LotR: The Confrontation I have a minor love/hate-relationship with the combat card system.

RATING: 8
This being the second game bought this weekend, I see huge potential here, which could even potentially scratch my tactical miniatures itch.  My bro and I played a game yesterday afternoon.

Dungeon Twister is similar to a broken down version of DnD miniatures and has a similar feel to this as well as video games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre.  In the base set, you have 8 characters, 8 rooms, and 6 items.  Each expansion adds an additional 8, 8, and 6, respectively (there are currently 3 expansions in English and at least 3 more down the pipe that have not been translated yet).  You pick 4 characters to represent your squad and deal out 8 rooms and pick 6 items to distribute around the board and then go at it.  You get victory points for killing an enemy character or from one of your characters escaping from the dungeon.  And that's it.  Each character is only variable in their combat value and speed, as well as one or two special abilities, so it is very stripped down, but plays much faster.

(Oh and the reason why it is called Dungeon Twister is that there's a mechanic to turn the rooms around in game, creating another tactical element.)

This game may get a higher rating after a few games.  It felt kind of messy, but then again, so did Arkham and TI, and they are now 2 of my top 3 games.  But I see the replayability as almost endless.  I'd like to get a few more games under my belt before making a full opinion, but right now I'd give it the rating above, plus or minus half a point depeding on if the rules feel tighter after a few plays and if I feel like it lives up to its potential.

Based on 2 plays.  Maybe my first games shouldn't have been against an experienced opponent, but DT just left me cold.  I have a number of problems with the game - the sterile combat system, the counting involved, etc.  My biggest beef is that the decision tree is just too broad.  There are countless permutations of actions at your disposal on any given turn, so that picking a move is a chore.  To make matters worse, to do it right you need to figure out what your opponent's probable moves will be.  It's all interesting enough, but the AP just drains the fun away.  I suppose that with more plays the strategy might become more intuitive, but at present it just gives me a headache.

Based on one play; three-player game.  Fun game, neat concept with the twisting rooms.  I almost would prefer it if the rooms were all revealed to begin with and maybe that you knew where all the characters and people were from the start.  Because of the movement restrictions in the dungeon, the characters won't be traveling very far during the game.  They'll pretty much be hanging in the area where they started which seemed kind of like a drawback to me.

Wow, one play and I'm running out to buy the expansions.  I love this game.  The next time I see my best friend, we will put away the chess board and I will teach him this game.  I can't wait to implement a 2 minute timer, as it does seem like the game can degenerate into analysis paralysis near the end, when each action point becomes crucial, both yours and your opponent's.

This game has in-depth strategy, yet is very approachable.  I would unreservedly recommend this game to everyone who enjoys games and has even the smallest appreciation for a dungeon, a troll, or a wizard.  

The multi-player version is only recommended for players who are comfortable with the 2-player version, but I've seen experienced gamers pick it up fast even under these conditions.

I play it every time I get a chance with my wife, who adores the game.  It has extreme replay-ability.

The game has a nice level of logic and planning to it, but there is just too many details to follow within the rules.  Plus, the movement of some of the characters gets to be too slow.  MAybe I just need to play the game a few more times.

Played just once and was a bit startled about how many possibilities one has. And sometimes how few. It'll show up one of these days. Though for the length I find it a bit too much of a brainburner. I'd rather play an abstract like Hive instead...

RATING: 8
Chess for adventure gamers. Sort of. There's enough elements and choices that to be able to fully predict and see multiple turns ahead is impossible. Still, a dungeon setting with no dice and a combat system based on memory and knowing your opponent...? Pretty dang original and very worthy of the hype.

I'm not into dungeon crawls in the Classic co-op setting, but DT's quick and fun a bit chess-like duel appeals to me. Seems it's difficult to find interested opponents though, gave it away in the European Chain of Generosity. Glad there's an Xbox version too.

Outstanding.
The game I've been waiting for ages, it's a fine blend of different styles of games like chess and dungeon crawler.
It's very tactical yet fun even if people think it's mostly about thinking hours between each move, it's not.You can play with a timer and add great tension to the game.
And the game is as good in its basic version as it is with expansions.
The 3/4 players version add a bit of chaos to it so more fun if you find it too cold to play for two.

The goal of each team is to get out of the dungeon but only the team reaching 5 victory points will be able to make it! Points are collected by making an adventurer crossing the whole board or by killing an opponent's adventurer. Treasures are, of course, disseminated across the whole dungeon and will bring you additionnal well-needed powers! Each player has the same characters, each with different powers. Some run fast, some fight or disarm traps. The cleric heals, magician burns everything in sight and the goblin is so weak that the simple fact of getting him out will bring you two victory points ...

I wouldn't say it's a bad game, but it's just not one for me. Generally I don't like the action point allowance system mechanic. There are too many possibilities to handle, but in a brute-force way I don't enjoy very much.

Played twice.  Meh.  I suppose the game isn't terrible, but I'm just not into it.  It's not at all a dungeon crawl.  So, it's either too mentally taxing (i.e. takes far too long) if played "right", or just a stupid random waste of time if played quickly.  Pass.

Loves the concept, loves the theme.

Huge amount of brain burning. I am strongly considering making a variant to use dices instead of cards and I have also in progress a gem collecting variant.

There is no possible way that this game could be played in 45 Min due to the amount of brain burning behind the game.

We just couldn't get into this one...possibly because, as the more aggressive player, I dominated every game.  The pieces are also a little annoying, particularly for the "how do I slide this tile out and turn it around without moving the cheap cardboard dudes out of place?" aspect.  It's a decent game, but not one I see us playing very often.

Reviews that attracted me to this game stated it was a "chess-like dungeon crawl". I was intrigued. 

In general I like the idea of this game and how it should work, but something is a bit off. The graphics are good, but it is difficult to see at a distance. In fact, we played the board sideways as lengthwise was too difficult. This is further hampered by the fact that the character stand-ups are difficult to see through or around. Items are a good idea, but don't travel well with the characters. The action point system works, but the variable nature of the scheme seems counter-intuitive. The character abilities make sense, yet I would forget what they all do and the icons don't help.

I really wanted to like this game, but didn't because the usability issues were bothersome.

Traded.

I am a big fan of this game. There's something refreshing about a fantasy dungeon crawl that involves (almost) 0% luck... in a way like a very convoluted form of chess. Unfortunately it hasn't seen much play, I've played it once and only once with just about every gamer I know. I suspect the 3-4 player expansion will get this into the more regular lineup, though.

If you can spacially reason and twist things about in your mind this will probably be a fun game.  If not this game will frustrate you as your plans fail to turn out the way you visualized.  I consistantly win this game when I play so I may be more a fan than others.  The characters that you draft are not all equal.  Placing your oponents items is one of my favorite parts and one of the parts that I dread doing the most.  I really want to try this with the 3-4 player expansion and the extra players, more item and character selection from the expansions would also be fun to try.  A few components are made of thinner card stock than I would like to see.

Classic dungeon crawler theme with a "twist".
Hidden sections are revealed gradually and characters may twist them at will, thereby changing mazes in unpredictable ways.  Players score points by getting characters out of the dungeon first.

RATING: 9
Played the base "quick game" only once. Also played the Paladin and dragons expansion. This is a real interesting game. Strategy is the key of the game BUT you absolutely have to play with a timer. We tried with hourglass of 2 minutes but that felt a bit tight especially when you are planning a big move. MAybe it would be better to play with a chess clock (45 minutes per player). It is a very thoughful game. Card counting skill are welcome when it comes to you opponents combat card. It is easy to feel overwhelm by the amount of thing you can do in a turn. Don't forget that the goal of the game is to score points not to maul your opponent! So even a losing position where you lost most of your muscle can be saved (Goblin + treasure anyone?).

[Update] This game is really really good. I prefer the base game to expansion since it is a bit simpler so positionning strategy is more important than checking the floor where you put foot. One of the best 2 players game I'vge played in a long time.Each expansion add a lot to the game.

I usually don't go out of my way to denigrate a game, but this one is a special case.  The puzzle-solving aspect, the shoddy components, the mind-boggling number of possibilities and consequences of each turn all conspired to make this a horrible gaming experience for me.  The game isn't broken, so I won't give it a 1.  This may be the one game that I will refuse to play.

Feels like LoTR:C to me, but not as elegantly streamlined ala Knizia.  The abscence of luck works in LoTR:C due to the hidden information element.  Here, I would like a bit of luck, actually.  The theme is thinner than the standup cardboard cutouts representing the characters.  Doesn't really have enough additional flair to justify the additional fiddlyness (for lack of a better word, if indeed it is a word).  Still a fun game, that deserves additional play and perhaps a higher rating.

and
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/322352/french-people-are-just-plain-weird

Very strategic brainburner hiding behind the theme of fantasy/dungeon. Strategy builds with multiple plays, thereby making it progressively difficult (and less enjoyable) for newcomers: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/182462/dungeon-twister-good-for-newbees

That being said, I think the game will definitely appeal to those who enjoy the depth of chess-like thinking and the fantasy theme. It should be noted that regarding my hesitations, it can be sped up by implementing the 2 minute per turn tournament rule (with a timer) and can be handicapped so newbies are competing at fair level with experienced players. Nonetheless, newbies will still need to want to play a deep thinking game and one that deals with a fantasy theme.

Great quote that sums it up: "DT is a great game, but I'd advise against playing this with a non-gamer. You'd be better off with something like Mr. Jack."

Interesting tactical game, kind of like a Battle Chess in a maze.  Lots of different kinds of characters to choose from.  Gets a little complicated with some of the environments and special rooms and the rotating of the level adds another level of complexity that may not be necessary.  Flimsy components, very easy to get warped, easy to knock into and jar all the pieces, ruining your game.

Along with Mr. Jack it is the best 2-Player game - high strategical, very beautiful with its miniatures, very interactive, good playing time and very diversified with a lot of expansions. It is a kind of abstract strategy but with a great thematic implementation and more opportunities.

Originally I wanted to give a 6.  Yes I like the game alot, but the parts sucked and product means alot to me. Then my gameshop tells me that they have the new improved parts of the game!  Yes, I now give it a solid 8 and bought the Paladins expansion.  Hope it enhances the game.

GREAT abstract game with a theme :-)

I love abstract that's probably why I like dungeon twister.  I didn't get into the expansion frenzy, but the base game is enough to have fun for hours to come.

I'm not very keen on the 3 or 4 player variant, but in it's original form with two players it's a perfectly balanced chess-like game. 
Easy with the expansions though, as too much of them could choke the game.

A good little game from Christopher Boelius, the maker of Earth Reborn.  It's a labyrinth style make it through the Dungeon game in the spirit of Dungeon Run.  However, there are absolutely NO random elements.  I found it a little too dry and mathy for that reason.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game seems very cool, although I won't get to play it other than solitaire for a couple of weeks. It's a little bit like a less nutty Wiz-War. Will be open to hyper analysis for those who are that ype of gamer. I think Wiz-War is more giddy fun, but this is much less chaotic. It's also a lot more 'meaty' than most Dungeon Crawl type games. I would like to get the expansions, since this looks like a fun three player game.

2 player fight in an ever changing dungeon. Slightly fiddly to rotate map tiles but it makes the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Game in a Nutshell: Players square off in a moving maze to score points for escaping and eliminating one another.

Played as: 2 player only.

Played with: Base game only.

Pros: Variable powers for the different characters makes for different tactical possibilities. The game handicaps itself well as players escape, there's less for them to work with. It feels really good when your wizard can toast someone with his fireball (about the only thing that invoked the theme for me).

Cons: Too many niggly rules to remember for a game with enough to think about already. Which brings up how easy it is for the game to be bogged down by over-thinking a move; and I didn't find it particularly enjoyable to sit and puzzle out my move either. Art was derivative and unrefined. Bottom line, I never found where the fun was hidden.

Other: I was under the impression this would be a no-luck game, but I found that to be far from true. Sometimes tiles flip up and through a matter of chance create a free path to the exit. For the opponent's exit, it could come up as an impossibly congested maze. In a shortish game, this can make the difference of who will come out on top... just by a flip of the tiles.

Best Use: A slightly more thematic game for those who know how to make a game of chess move quick.

While I appreciate the design this game just isn't for me.  It's a dungeon crawl that's too much of a burner for my tiny brain.  There's just too many options and once you add in the spatial mind-twisting rotating rooms it all falls apart for me.  I want a quick light crawl and I guess I could try to play it that way but I don't see that happening anytime soon.

Fascinating 2player game (4player with expansion), that rewards tactical play and deep strategizing, while being light and quick enough that you can finish up a game relatively quickly and move on to a new game if you much something up

The way that your characters are placed in the dungeon and then rooms are opened up gives you a sense of 'dungeon crawl' type atmosphere, and reward the careful player who consolidates his forces rather than rushes through

RATING: 9
Some randomness through hidden information, and a bad tile topology can give one player an apparent disadvantage.  My current feeling is that this can be compensated for by clever play, and reading the board may cause you to play an attacking or defending game by way of compensation.  May change my mind later, but I doubt it; more likely to end up as a 10 after a few more plays.  Looks like this is the holy grail of dungeon bashes - lots of flavour, lots of skill.

My copy came from www.philibertnet.com - who are doing a special offer on DT + Paladins + 3-4 player expansion at the moment (8th Feb 2005).

It's fine for what it is, I suppose.  I enjoyed my first game of it and would play another.  Gorgeous production values.  But there are finicky bits I'm not quite fond of.  Combat is right out of LotR: The Confrontation and just reminds me what a great game that is.  I'm not crazy about the placement system:  "Oh, I've got two characters in this area and you one.  Guess I'll place them all so I just hammer your character with no hope of escape."  Seeding the treasures felt a bit like Clue:  "Mr. Troll with the sword in Green 3!"  Maybe I'll play again with one of the expansions.  A friend's copy.

Strategy, combat, screwing over the other guy...  This game has it all, and with nice components, fast gameplay and lots of 'Doh' and 'Aha' moments.  Can almost be played as a chess game, but IMHO then the mood loses.  A game involving frantic adventurers trying to get out of a trapped dungeon while trying to avoid/kill the opposition should not be overthought/overanalyzed!

When the players know the rules and the game's mechanics, this game is quite fun. 


The components do not justify its price, however. For its current price-point, players should have received plastic miniatures, wooden tokens, and a better means of keeping the playing surface together.

Nice concept, divisive implementation. The tiles are unnecessarily busy and detailed, to the point they only increase the oddness of the pastel orange and baby blue character cardboard standups. The board being hard to read doesn't help the fact that the main selling point, rotating complex tiles in a labyrinth, is ultimately the game's downfall. The rules go as far as admitting the massive amounts of pondering required to plan ahead, suggesting enforcing a 2 minute limit to each turn.

(Busty female characters in more-or-less impratical clothing featured on the side of the base game and every single expansion don't help me like it more.)

First play 6/15/14

Fun game, the rules took a bit to get through but honestly once gameplay began things sorted themselves a bit more. Between the rule set and a couple spur of the moment "house rules" the game played very easily.

I will update and rate after a few more plays but so far it is showing promise as being in regular rotation and possibly picking up some expansions. I could see the 3-4 player expansion being on the soon to have list.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I liked DT much better initially. But the gameplay is simply frustrating: most of the time, you advance very slowly, until one player sees a golden opportunity and does something nasty which his opponent did not expect and has no chance of stopping. There are simply too many options, which tends to induce analysis-paralysis. And the random starting arrangement of dungeon tiles can make or break the game, creating avenues for one player and dead ends for the other.

My girlfriend's kicked my ass during the first play, so i'm eager to try it again, but I have already a strong feeling, that it's going to be one of my favorites due to the amount of choices to make, fast paced play, smooth mechanics and nice theme and components.

Oh, what a neat game!
I took my time before picking this up, troubled as I was by the chess analogies and reported AP issues rampant here on the 'Geek, but when I finally took the plunge, I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, it's not really the dungeon crawl I was secretly hoping for, but a tense, tight and thematic fantasy bash all the same. The lack of setup options might hamper replayability somewhat, but probably not before the expansions arrive.
Rating based on two helpings of bitter defeat graciously served by my wife – might even go up once I manage a win.

It's like playing chess on a different board each time and have your game surrounded by a very good theme. Highly recommended for those players who like brain burners.

My idea of a nearly perfect game.  Always up for a game of Dungeon Twister.  I own all the expansions including the non-English expansions.  I would say that all the expansions are worth the purchase but would also add that with each expansion the game becomes more complicated.  As the rules start to grow so do the exceptions to the rules.

Dungeon Twister is a game where strategy reigns supreme.  It's a game that allows for multiple play styles to face off in a dungeon.  I enjoy it because the game is fantastic at allowing me to build a team that fits my playing style.

The biggest complaint I would have is that it can be a long game if you play with someone prone to AP (Analysis Paralysis).

Really love this game, it's so close to getting the perfect '10' that it hurts!
Finding the best way through the dungeon and at the same time preventing your opponent from doint the same is quite challenging.
Why not 10? Four things:
Some boards are a bit cluttered. There's one in particular, where traps have the same colour as empty square. This has messed things up more then once.
The random placement of the boards can also make or break the game. Usually there's no problem with this, but occasionally one players is doomed from the start.
Rule book could've been clearer.
Also, 3/4 players should have been there from the start, not an expensive expansion.

RATING: 5
5+ games played Despite having no complaints about the combat, the motion, the purpose of the game (less crawling and more footrace),  I just don't reach for this anymore.  The items dance around too much and the propensity for twisting is unpredictable enough to really throw things off kilter.  Managed chaos is the name of the game- I don't mind this.  The base game could have also done with varied artwork for the two sides, (even something as uninspired as dark side characters).

I seem to have problems with strictly two player games that pit you vs the other player.  Sometimes it works, but I did not enjoy this game as much as I would have liked.  

In the beginning you choose 4 characters and items and place them in the middle of the board (the items).  Each character has different abilities and if you encounter an opponent you play cards to see who wins the bout.  

An OK game, that has the potential to become one-sided destruction.

Ambientación fantástica para un juego de estrategia con un azar prácticamente inexistente. Los materiales no son muy buenos, alguna ficha se estropeó al destroquelarla. Las ilustraciones son buenas, correctas. La mecánica es muy interesante y promete horas de rechinar neuronas. 
Si tienes poca visión espacial estarás en desventaja, es importante evocar en tu mente cómo quedarán las salas al rotarlas.

The thinkier cousin to Wiz War, specifically built for 2p play.  It's bizarre and AP-prone and very, very French -- but it laid the groundwork that defines Christophe's game designs of simple changes leading to deeper innovations.  And it's sad to think that we won't see the remaining expansions unless and until he Kickstarts the entire package.

RATING: 6
First impression: There is quite a lot of rules. More than you'd think after seeing the components. Most of the rules are quite clear and logical so it's not that hard to learn. There is some hidden information at the beginning of the game but later it is almost full-knowledge game (only in battles you have to outguess your opponent). Playing is chess-like and there are many, many combinations to think about during playing. First games can take a while and even once you learn the mechanics you can easily spend a lot of time thinking your future moves. This is either a good thing or a bad thing depending what you're looking from the game. No wonder rules suggest using a timer while playing once you're familiar with the game. The game isn't too bad if you like this sort of chesslike optimization but it's clearly not a game for me.

RATING: 8
Quite a unique two-player dungeon crawling puzzle. Very tricky. Essentially about action point optimization. Very much prone to analysis paralysis. The combat system is similar to "LotR: the Confrontation". 

There is a seemingly unlimited number of expansions available and upcoming but I am not interested in those at all. The base game is way too complex already and I really suck at it :P (edit: bought them a few years later anyway from a sale)

Components are a bit on the cheap side (unless you have the free replacement room set which uses thicker cardboard), and the artwork is not so good. The characters look like they have been drawn by a teenage RPG fanboy, and the usability of the terrain tiles suffers because of the confusing graphics. In the expansions, it looks like the artwork on the terrain tiles has been obfuscated even further.

I never use the cardboard figures; The counters are so much easier to use and keep track of.

RATING: 9
Got my first play of Dungeon Twister in, using English translation of the original rules. The 9 rating may fluctuate over time, but DT succeeds for a few important reasons for me : 1) Dungeon/exploration theme = high bonus points, 2) Taking that beloved theme and actually making a strategic "euro-style" game out of it, instead of another rehash of previous dungeon delving games, 3) unique and interesting mechanics that don't strangle the theme out of the game.

The downside I feel might taint my rating after more plays is that there was *alot* of downtime between turns, as each of us spent agonizing minutes counting out moves to ensure no mistake was made, as a single mistake can *hugely* change the flow of the game. This is usually a good thing - each decision you make being very important to the outcome of the game.  With our first game of DT, however, it became absolutely paralyzing, as there are many factors to include in each decision, and alot of pacing out moves in your head, as a move can become a complicated thing. The suggested "2 minute timer" for moves only fills me with dread that I'd become even more frustrated when a mistake was made, as I'd feel it was because I was rushed.

Even with the frustration level it can cause, however, I see a wonderful game here. Once we become more comfortable with the rules, I feel like alot of the frustration with mistakes changing the game will be taken out, and moves will come along much faster.

Think of it like chess, in a way : small mistakes can spell catastrophe, and there are many possible moves and counter-moves to play out in your head.  You may feel paralyzed at first, but with time and experience the frustration floats away and you see the core beauty of the game.  At least, that's my hope. :)

Great addition! Love the way the theme makes for a deeply strategic board game! There's a lot to think about and the many different characters provide lasting appeal as players try to combine the many abilities to obtain the best possible team, and since each player plays differently, this makes for rarely similar teams. Simply great! Hope to push up the score after a few more plays!

Based on one play: The theme appears great and looks like it would be a lot of fun, but once I played, i realized it was more of a race or maybe I was missing something.

This 2-player race game has no luck aside from the initial board setup.  As you need to plan out your entire turn before choosing which action card to select, the game seems very prone to analysis paralysis.  The simultanteous action selection combat mechanic is somewhat unsatisfying, but overall I do like the game's concept.

One play. Standard 4 player scenario.

Boy is this game hard to overview. The amount of information and possible permutations during play makes it very hard to digest (esp. in multi player). The two minute turn limit feels like a must for the game not to totally bog down. Keeping track of what combat cards your opponent(s) spent is very important.

This aside, DT is fun game and the theme really helps setting the right tone. The french mecha fantasy calls for action and adventure thus leading the players away from a too abstract "chessy" approach. At least in my experience.

The quoted playing time feels like a joke though. Our first play took over two hours. Even with constant cheering on whenever someone started to get that ruminating distant look which is a certain sign of that fatal condition we all know and fear by the acronym AP.

Looking forward to more plays.

Even though the mechanics are very shallow, the game takes quite a long time to play. The box states that it takes about 45 minutes, but that's just wrong. Add at least half an hour to that time.

The lack of depth makes this game quite tedious. After all the rooms are revealed, nothing much happens until someone wins, and that portion comes off as uneventful. The revelation of rooms, the setup and the revolving pairs of rooms felt promising, but you'd really need something for the late game as well.

A fine abstract-like "dungeon crawl" (in the loosest sense of the word) that plays quickly and provides a lot of tactical play.  There are some aspects of it that remind me of the old GDW game Asteroid, a cool 2-player game that only suffers from a longer set-up time.  Instead of being set on an asteroid hurtling towards earth by a maniacal computer, though, Dungeon Twister is basically Chess in a Dungeon.

I loved this game when it first came out.  Simple rules for a surprisingly involved game experience with lots of strategies to consider.

Busted it out again recently and I'm afraid it didn't age well.  The components were passable in 2004, but feel flimsy and low quality today.  The game play is still fun, but has some quirks that seem strange, particularly with the action system.  It's a strange hand-management system to control your actions, and being able to assign all your actions to the same character can lead to sudden swings in score.  Still fun, but not the classic I used to think of it as.

Fun, fun, 2-player game. I tend to bias toward fantasy elements, so I love balancing the character powers and items, trying to come up with the best possible team/strategy. The "fog of dungeon" effect is nicely done, and combined with the ability to have rooms change direction adds great spice to each play. My wife enjoys this one as well, which adds tremendously (she wins quite a bit...frustrating but excellent because she's more likely to play again). 

Love the artwork, too. The bits are nicely done in general; wish it came with the figures I've seen available, but I imagine the price would skyrocket. Besides, it's really about the playability, which in this case is tremendous.

RATING: 5.5
Dungeon-themed tactical game with some chess-like qualities: very little luck/randomness, 2 equal armies of pieces with different capabilities go head-to-head.

The multiple action points you have to spend each turn, coupled with the number of different characters & unique abilities leads to an overwhelming number of choices to consider. Perhaps playing with a turn timer would help, but only once a certain level of comfort with all the abilities & rules is reached.

The concept and theme are really appealing to me, but in practice it makes me feel like I'm playing a game of chess where I've forgotten the rules of how the pieces move etc. The whole system is clearly well thought out, but not being a fan of chess, perhaps this simply isn't the game for me.

If I manage to try this again, I intend to take a step back and play with the suggested "beginner" rules for a while rather than jumping in the deep end. This will reduce the number of characters, abilities, rooms & objects to consider, so hopefully would be a gentler introduction. I'm sure that once the options available to each character become second nature, the experience will be more fun & just slightly less mentally tortuous!

NOTE: It turns out that we've been playing a rule incorrectly. When revealing a room, the revealing player gets to place *all* characters, not just those belonging to their opponent. The opponent only gets to place the *objects* of the revealing player. Should make quite a difference!

Various expansions are available, though how necessary are they? And how much do they actually add? The base game is pretty deep alone, and it seems a lot of people who own the expansions have yet to actually try them out! I suspect you'd need to play this game a LOT for them to be worthwhile & appreciated.

Basic game is 2 player only (though one of the expansions can increase this to 3/4).

Components are just okay (the cardboard is a little flimsy, and the room tiles are slightly warped). At least the included cardboard stand-up figures means there are no miniatures to paint so that you can tell them apart!

[floatleft][ImageID=53797][/floatleft][floatright][ImageID=485469][/floatright]Dungeon Twister is one of those games I wish I had a steady opponent to play with. I thoroughly enjoy this game while most of my gaming friends do not. The theme is fitting and there is a significant amount of tactical strategy packed into Dungeon Twister. Players must balance mobility with strength and at the same time be tactically mindful of their current game position in respect to their opponent. The card combat system is strategically tactical. Players must balance when to play their large attack cards to win critical engagements. I like the fact that speed is just as important as strength for characters. 

I love the modularity of Dungeon Twister with all of the expansions. Just having one expansion really opens up the system and allows for varying formats beyond the standard game. I love the idea of players drafting for different characters or picking characters secretly and then pitting their team against another.

RATING: 6.5
My son called it a "brain buster", but still enjoyed it.  Very easy to pick up, quick to play.  I think mini's would enhance the game, but I'm nowhere near patient enough to paint anything.  Rules are VERY well written, but don't address what happens if you have no way to get more victory points (say, three guys have exited and one is dead...which almost happened in our game).  Might look around for a FAQ for it.

Edit 08/14:  Played it recently and found it dull as dishwater.  Score altered to reflect my grouchiness.

? - I need a few more plays of this before I can give it a rating. In theory since there's no random element and it has identical sides this should fall somewhere near chess, but since I've only played once I feel like the game dragged on too long to be fun.  I think this game should be an 8.5, but something about it rubbed me the wrong way and makes me inclined to give it a 6.  I think the game gets lopsided very quickly once a hero falls but a few more plays may balance that feeling out.

6 - As a soley two player game it's not going to hit the table very often and while I appreciate the mechinisms it's just not engaging enough.

A good game, simple but very deep (too much for my tastes) and strategic. Despite the theme, it is not a dungeon-crawl game but more a chess like one. On the weak side, the theme: it's too cold and the game too deep for occasional play, with very high thought factor. No luck involved.

Good game but I find it very fiddly with the board rotating and stuff. Plus I have a ton of other 2 players I enjoy more. Plus, as a completist, I must buy all expansions so I traded to rid myself of the temptation.

Wow.  After my first game was left with possibilities in my head as to different starting lineups to try and strategies to employ.  I've played with two and with three or four players (with the expansion).

It's the kind of game that afterwards you will formulate strategies to improve the next time you play.  Wonderful.  Deserving of the 9 rating.

Not bad for a quick game. It does have nice tactics, but the puzzle aspect of twisting around the tiles combines 2 genres in a way that I'm not really sure about.

Pretty sweet game, actually. It has grown on me a good bit from the initial play.

RATING: 9
This is one cool game. Allows for  strategic gaming, but requires heavy tactical thinking. Totally devoid of luck, short playing time, and a great fantasy theme (classic D&D characters working their way through a dungeon) makes it one of my favorite games. Somewhat of a brainburner (in a good way), if you play it competitively.

RATING: 3
Awesome concept, but poor execution. There's modular, changing boards; the ability to control a team of characters, with individual special powers;  straightforward combat mechanism; and you get to wander in a maze!

What sucks though is most of the time, you are simply moving around the maze, which is boring. Many pick-up-and-deliver games suffer from this; it's lots of fun planning your route, but actually doing it is a chore.

A better comparison would be RoboRally played on 4+ boards. The playing area is so big that there's barely any player interaction. (However, the game is about the puzzle of programming your robot, not necessarily shooting others down.) Of course, there's the maze manipulation and the combat, but the former is more take-that than strategic, and the latter doesn't happen that often.

This game is solid!  Played at the TABS Winter CondoCon with Pete...  boy was I in for a surprise.  At first glance it looks like a simple game but once the APs start getting spent it's a brain burning affair!  The board is constantly changing...  just when you think you can free a character, bam, the board is changing again!  Zero luck in this game, the chess-like tag does apply well.  Combat is NOT the way to win as I found out...  it'll have to wait till 2006 but I'll probably add it to my collection (damnit).

It's like chess in a fantasy-setting, only much more fun! The definitive two-player game of all time. If you like brain-burning games, it's a must! If you like fantasy, it's a must!

RATING: 7
Dungeon Twister is a nice change from my usual round of Euros: a two-player strategy game, essentially luckless, but with plenty of hidden information to keep players guessing. The action card system allows you to decide when to make a big push and when to hoard actions for a few turns, and the basic rotate-the-dungeon-block mechanism is just plain cool.

Nice blend of D&D atmosphere, Dungeon Race, Maze.  Don't like the hassle of twisting boards much and in the games I've played and watched, only seen it happen one or two times.

Pretty nice idea, but the game could be a bit stream-lined. Why not just making it 3 actions per turn instead of making this variable. Also the room layout could be simpler. Four of the eight rooms are damn mazes, through which most character cannot really pass. In this game there is a bit to little happening for the time it takes.

A euro-styled dungeon crawler. Turns the dice-fest game into a game of chess, without losing any of the theme. Simple rules, neat little abilities for each of the characters that enable different strategies.
Funky straight board that puts you face to face opposite of your opponent, adding to the tension.

So many possibilities in each turn that it makes your head explode. Must try under the influence of alcohol.

rating after 1 play - no idea!

looks a lot of fun but cld just be too random - dunno yet
played it once with a 2min per move timer and hated it - way to rushed...
so - tried it with a chess clock - 30mins each total and worked a lot better - still felt a bit rushed but will see how it works with more plays
current ratin - 7ish

rating after 2plays - 6

i like the idea but doesnt really work - i dont like action points system, i dont like the combat card system and im not sure the rotating rooms actually adds anything to the game - only AP hence the need for the timer which just makes games messy

i am going to try it next time with 1 move each and no action points cards and mb shuffle ur combat cards to form a deck and each pl has a hand of 3 cards at any one time...if this doesnt improve things it hits the trade pile...

Finally played once; didn't live up to my too-high hopes.  The very flashy fantasy art and theme (and the randomness of the facedown tiles and their revelation during play) was a turn-off for what is sometimes touted as almost a pure strategy game.  But I hesitate to rate it.  I still want to like it.

After playing 2 times more at 2009 BGG.CON, I feel like it's a solid 7. The randomness/simultaneous decisions detract from it for me, but I still enjoy it. The graphics are too flashy, occasionally to the point of being unhelpful. But it's neat when you pull off a clever sequence of moves!

RATING: 7
A fun game that's part dungeon crawl, part chess, part frag, part puzzle.  All of it fits nicely together.  I especially enjoy the fact that you can play with anywhere from 2 to 4 (with the expansion).  It plays well; just about the time that you begin to tire of the process, you realize that the game is suddenly on the verge of being won.

I expected to really like this game. The mechanics and theme just sounded spot on with my interests, but it fell short? Why? I think it's the way it actually plays out that really just didn't do it for me. After one play through I just don't have a desire to play it again.

There appears to be some strategy there under the surface that I'm not seeing, but I don't think I want to dig for it. I really don't enjoy this game. like I think I should.

Enjoyable crawler with fun mechanical twists on the typical "grab loot & get out" theme.  Stand-up pieces would be nicer if they were molded, but of course that would probably impair the handy numbers being right on the cardboard pieces that are in the box instead.  Overall a decent game with decent quality components (a little shiny and therefore somewhat hard to read under harsh light, but that's nit-picking) and the instructions are straightforward--if wordy.  I like the expandability and the early commitment to added value down the road through downloadable content.

I would like this more if the theme made more sense. The victory conditions, in particular, seem kind of weird, getting a few characters off the board, or killing a few of an opponents'--then it's over all of a sudden. No story arc. 

But this is a deep, thinking and planning person's game with a lot of variety. I'd prefer to play this one with some sort of time clock, so moves cannot be infinitely plotted out and potential changes assessed.

Ugly components for the most part.

Finally played this (the shorter, six room version), and it's actually rather good. It has something of a wargame or abstract feel rather than a dungeon crawler feel.

One criticism I have is that the rooms are too symmetrical, to the extent that there's often no advantage to twisting them. If there were more rooms with single square exits rather than whole walls missing, there'd be more twisting.

I think the squad level combat here would work better with a sci-fi theme.

Want the little minis, because they're cool beans :).

OK played it and I find it too fiddly and mind-fucky. If I wanted to play something with this level of calculation and guesswork I'll play LotR: Confrontation. If I want to have fun with a fantasy theme I'll play Dungeoneer. I would try it again with 3-4 players all in a fun mood. But as it stands this just doesn't get me at all.

Nice fun factor in navigating through a dungeon maze all the while encountering helpful items or opponent's creatures. Good replay value as each time is different.

It took awhile for me to get into this game, but I really enjoy it when I do play it. There is so much to think about in this game, and I like the variety and flexibility of the twisting rooms. Simple mechanics but the huge amount of strategy makes it a complex game with lots of theme.

RATING: 6
Ok, I'm a little cheesed off that I have to pay good money for a 2 player game and essentially almost double that if I want to play it with 3 or 4. Oh and if I want miniatures, triple the base price please.

No thank you. There are other better games that take 4 (with and without miniatures) that cost a THIRD of what DT costs.

Having said that, this isn't so much a dungeon crawl as it is a game of tactical movement and placement. A mild brainburner in the form of limited APs, numerous chromey character rules, etc.

It's a mishmash of mechanics (battle from LOTR confrontation, movement, etc). But the dungeon rotating mechanism is a good one.

RATING: 6
Fun game, but its lack of randomness, which is actually usually a strength, can become a burden. This is exemplified in the instruction manual actually recommending a timer be used.  In essence this seems to make the game feel like glorified chess. Possibly playing it with the expansions eases up some of this tension - I have yet to play with any of them.

Would rate higher but I stink at it because I constantly rush out to battle, burning up my high combat cards. Then I spend the rest of the game trying to avoid everyone to "sneak" my characters out of the dungeon. Obviously I need to play it more consistently so that I can rate it higher.

A serious game for two players. The theme may fool you to think it's a light beer & pretzels game, but DT has more in common with chess. After the initial setup no luck is involved. The estimated playing time of 45 mins can sometimes stretch to two hours (or more). DT can certainly make your brain hurt when you calculate your and your opponents future moves.

Confusing, dryish. The german edition was not very well-produced which meant that the pieces easily wore off and then gave away information that needed to be secret. But the game is not my cup of tea even if that problem was not there.

RATING: 7
Interesting little game. I can see it being a brain burner if you really get down with it. Will take a few more plays to see if its rating goes up (depth continues to entertain) or down (becomes draining or stale).

Update: dropped rating slightly to a solid 7 (I ended up trading it away because others in my group didn't care for it that much).

RATING: 4
It's a neat concept, and mechanically it works very well. I also like the different piece abilities, and the maze-like theme. What I don't enjoy is the feeling of playing chess wherein parts of the board can change orientation at times. Dungeon Twister requires the far-seeing planning of Chess, but even if your brain is Big Blue, you will have a hard time computing all the possible permutations because of the "twisting" element. So the game "appears" amenable to analysis, but allows much less analysis than you might think. For me, this difference between appearance and reality leads to constant frustration, and robs the game of much of its fun. Should I play it analytically? If so, there are too many permutations possible for my puny brain to even work 3 moves ahead. Should I play it intuitively? If so, there isn't much to recommend moving one pawn over another. Playing Dungeon Twister makes me feel like my personality is being split in two - and not in a good way. I can tell that my wife would hate it without her having played it.

RATING: 2.5
DIFFICULT TO RANK.  It's got the same stupid diceless combat system as Lord of the Rings: Confrontation. I think I'd replace the combat system with the roll of a D4 or D3 + strength and get rid of the silly movement cards. Even fixing the combat system like this might not allow multiple attackers for one player. I liked the rotating rooms. There should have been more of that. Having the rooms rotate randomly somehow might be interesting. I certainly didn't think I was buying a two-player game. I guess the expansion(s) fix that problem.

The combat system is the worst!!!!!

Decent enough dungeon crawl.  Certainly better than Drakon, but pales in comparison to Wiz War.  

I don't know.  This kind of thing has been done so many times, this just felt like more of it.  Sure, it does a good job, and if you can get past the lame name and you are looking for this kind of game it will be a good addition on your shelf.  But, it isn't amazing or surprising, it gives you exactly what you expect.  If that is what you want, then look here. 

I personally think that Wiz War in its clunkiness (and that too is also part of its charm) just surpasses any of these games in fun factor. Perhaps with a timer this game wouldn't feel so slow, and the fun might squeeze out.

A really nice two-player dungeon crawl. On the surface, you have a simple hidden placement game first combined with a simple tactical game. But then you've got the killer mechanics: a really nice action selection mechanism for how many actions you get, which means every now and then you get either vastly more or less actions than your opponent, combined with the super sweet rotating dungeon tiles. While it does lend itself a bit some AP, it's a really cool puzzle to think through how you can rotate the tiles to twist yourself into a position to get through the dungeon to where you want to go.

I'm not particularly good -- the twisting rooms get me every time! -- but Dungeon Twister is a lot of fun.  My brother and I have played quite a few times, and while he is pretty much just a Chess guy, he's also a big fan of Dungeons & Dragons.  A very nice fit indeed.  As a fun, brainy hack n' slash, Dungeon Twister is top notch.  I also love the wonderfully cliched backstory.  Great stuff!

A very fun 2 player game! Reminds me of my favorite parts of Blood Bowl mixed with my favorite parts of HeroQuest. However, the game falls prey to accidentally leaving one hole open in your defense which quickly vaults your opponent from 2 VP to the 5 VP required for a win in one turn. Looking forward to the 3-4 player expansion (not sure Paladins & Dragons can add much to the game)

Dungeon Twister is a pure strategy game wrapped in a dungeon crawl theme. There is almost no luck element, just a small bit of chaos as rooms are discovered and tokens revealed.

It features deterministic movement and combat, which can hang many people up; with no chance element, it's not uncommon to become lost in searching for the optimal play. Those who can get past that and play quickly will be well rewarding by an entertaining game which has that just one more' quality. Those who dislike games that reward chess-like thinking, or are prone to becoming lost in brain burn, should look elsewhere. Bottom line, it's a love it or hate it game, with not much middle ground.

A great game, but too chess-like and deterministic for its theme.  The cards add a little bit of trying to outguess your opponent, but it's really all about manuvering to make sure they're outnumbered in any conflict.

Not since "Mr. Jack" have I been so enamoured with a 2-player board game!  I've overlooked this little gem for the past few years simply due to the fantasy/dungeon theme (much like I overlooked "Mr. Jack" due to the serial killer theme and "Nexus Ops" due to the sci-fi theme), but what a mistake that was!  Much like "Mr. Jack", it is a fairly simple little game that hides a great deal of depth and strategy within its small package - just the type of game I love!  And also like "Mr. Jack", there are 8 characters, each with their own unique movement allowance and special ability, as well as one of the goals being to get the characters to walk off the board.  But that's where the similarities between the two games end.  "Dungeon Twister" is definitely a very unique game, and one which I hope will get a lot of play in the near future (Edit:  With this game`s propensity for turning my brain to mush, I find I can`t play it too often...).  The production value of the game is quite good, and it is small and very portable.  The artwork is a little cheesy, but I don't mind the cardboard stand-ups for the characters and the detail on the dungeon boards is pretty fun.  One word of advice: skip the first page of the rulebook.  The scene-setting background story is one of the dumbest things I've ever read in a rulebook...  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment:  4/5  Total: 8.5/10

I don't so much care for the theme or the art, but I like the concepts, and I could see it becoming a regular game between me and another player.  Fun, tense game.

I can't wait to get the expansions and create assymetrical teams.

Pros: It has very little luck, it plays almost like an abstract game, it is a good thinking game with loads of strategy and planning.  It is overall fun to play especially when you put together a plan and it works out.  
Cons: The dungeon theme just doesn't seem to fit, the dungeon theme just strikes me as a treasure hunting or adventure theme and this game is not that.  The rules are not simple and elegant like some games, each character and object has its own set of special rules.  
Update: My rating went up .5 as I have played this game again and taught a few other people how to play it.  I am liking it more and more and find it a good challenging game to play and it is a lot of fun.  It doesn't take super long to play, and has very good depth to the strategy.

I feel like I'm going to have to play this several more times to be able to make a fair assessment of it.  Right now it feels far too complicated and fiddly for what it is, but thankfully it only plays to 5 VPs and so doesn't take too long.  I think, like chess, it's going to take a lot of getting used to in order to play well, and if I were playing an experienced Dungeon Twister I'd get slaughtered.  I'm not totally sure I feel like the game is worth all the effort of getting fantastic at, but I'll give it a few more shots to see if it grows on me.

Dungeon Twister is hands down the best two player fantasy game I own.  You have to lose a game to get the feel for it, but then you are hooked.  There are so many options and surprises.  Dungeon Twister uses one of my favorite mechanics: A small deck of expendible power cards instead of a boring randomizer. Conserve and come on strong at the end, or shoot your wad early and spend the rest of the game running....  You can win either way with a little luck or skill.  Beautiful artwork.

Played 3+ times.  Neat little abstract.  Takes a game to get the character powers and their effects on the game down to the point where you know where you want to put them in the starting set up.  The twisting tiles are very fun.  The need for killing your opponent and escaping make you balance offensive and defensive play.  The combat system is blind bidding from a limited set of cards which probably lowers the game a half point for me. ** Update** Hard for me to get past the combat system to enjoy the game.  2006/06/18

I always feel like movements are wasted, that the action points are always lacking and cause the game to be alot longer and bogged down.  While the hidden placement aspect works well there's something about the play I dislike, there's not much point in combat really.

This was my Secret Santa gift in December 2005 (thank you Secret Santa!).  Do I have more to say about it?  Not too much, as I don't think I've logged enough plays to be willing to rate.  But for a fantasy game, it's the most oddly strategic thing one will find.  And that can be a good thing.

Despite the theme, Dungeon Twister isn't a dungeon crawl. Instead, it's a think-y, brain burning game of dungeon "football," with characters dodging, blocking, and pummeling each other. The lack of luck in this type of game is refreshing, but this also means that an experienced player will wallop a new one. Definitely worth a spot in your collection!

Man this sounded like a fun game. Running around a constantly changing dungeon pulling levers to spin a room, throwing a grappling hook to swing over a chasm and ducking it out when you meet your opponent.

I think it is a fun game for those who like such challenging games, but the brain melty-ness of it all made it very difficult for me to enjoy. A great game, but not for me.

Hoops Says: I went into this game thinking that it would be taken over by rules having 15 pages to study before you can start, which could have made it confusing. But it's well worth the reading because into the main play it is strategic, fun and methodical.  I found that on the second play you were able to form good strategy for play and on combatting opponents, develop new techniques and much bluffing your opponant into losing.  The board is inventive and colourful.  I do think it in 3d would make it even better. I would like to play this with more then 2 players with the expansion.

Miss Rhodes Says: This game took a little getting into as there are a lot of rules that you need to go through before you start, but once I started playing it was much easier to pick up, and I would definitely play this again now as I feel I have a much better grasp of rules and tactics. [It] was a bit tricky to start with as I hadn't really got a grasp of all the rules, but I would be keen to play this again now I understand how it works.

A lot of enjoyable buildup to a quick endgame. Speed potions seem to be an essential tool, but I suppose there are quite a few winning strategies. Tons of possible decisions, so I should probably play with a timer!

I don't think Dungeon Twister is for everyone - some may be turned off by the dungeon theme, others may not like the dizzying array of choices each turn. Still others may not like the odd merging of fantasy and strategy. But for me it was a tremendous pairing, a dungeon game that I could tout as having a lot of strategy; fun, but full of depth at the same time. I'm looking greatly forward to each expansion and can't wait to see how the new characters interact with the old; but even with just the base set, the game is one of the best gaming experiences I've had this year.

Good two player game that is not as abstract as most of the two player games I own. After reading the rules, I thought it would be hard to explain to a nongamer: Each piece has its own rules, there are rules that change according to the situation on the board, and there are a lot of exceptions to the core rules. After explaining the game, however, it appeared that the rules are quite easy to remember and soon felt "natural" (up to the point that they can actually feel a little dry). It is a tactical game, but also quite chaotic. It does, however, play fast, with very little downtime (in our case). My only criticisms are that the game is quite pricey for what you get, and the stand-up character cards are pointless and cumbersome (considering their size and abysmal quality).

I finally got a chance to play a partial game at Origins 06.  I actually own the game, but the one time we tried to play it, we got a little bogged down in the rules and never went back.  It's not that the rules are all that complicated, but I guess we didn't feel like learning something new and there were enough exceptions to put us off.  The solution was for us to both sit down at the Asmodee booth and make them teach us.

Unfortunately, we could only played about 1/4 of a game before the exhibitor room closed, but we got a nice introduction.  The game seems pretty interesting, but I hope it doesn't get too chess-like during play.  That has been my biggest concern about it, but I am hoping that the fantasy theme will make up for it.  Terri seemed interested in trying again, so that is a nice bonus.

My better half isn't so fond of having to visualize the twisting.

Last time the "twisting in your head" went much better, and we made an effort to keep the turns moving.  We still don't have any idea how to defend.  Right now the game seems to be mainly about figuring out how to zip out quickly or whacking an enemy without losing one yourself.  Definitely will play it again but she's got to be in the mood.

One play, with the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/14533/dungeon-twister-3-4-players-expansion]3 player expansion[/url] rules, in which I got slaughtered very quickly into the game.  Obviously, my opinion of the game suffers mightily as a result, so it would be good to take this comment with a heaping helping of salt.  My limited experience was that this was a misleading game, promising some kind of a dungeon crawl, and ultimately delivering an abstract.  I'm not into abstracts, and this one isn't an exception, for all the bells and whistles.  The theme and gameplay don't match the Ameritrash that the box pretends to have, and the gameplay is not clean enough to take advantage of the crispness of a great abstract.  Dungeon Twister tries to capture the greatness of two different genres, and not surprisingly, can't quite do it.  Too bad, because it coulda been a contendah.

After one play I'm not too excited to try it again.  There were just too many possibilities on each turn.  I felt like I was standing on the bottom of a very tall learning-curve, and decided I would rather play another game than devote the time to climbing it...

Also, it is WAY too fiddly with the roating of room-cards covered in counters and stand-ups, and keeping track of who has what item etc etc.

RATING: 5
I like the random setup, along with the pseudo-perfect information of the game.  I don't quite see this as the brain-burner that some people describe, but then again, in games like this, I tend to play based on my gut instinct.  We made a few mistakes in the rules as we played (we carried more than one item for part of the game), but we generally played it correctly.  It's not bad, and I can see how some people really like it, but it doesn't have much appeal for me.  I've had no interest in playing the game a second time.

Dungeon Twister is a 2-player high level strategy game where 2 teams of adventurers with various powers are trapped in a dungeon. The board is composed of 8 rooms that can be moved and rotated by the players. Each turn, a player is able to spend actions to move around the dungeon, pick up and use items, battle with the opponents team, or turn and move the rooms of the dungeon.
\13\\13\
The goal is to reach 5 victory points. Points are collected by moving adventurers out of the dungeon or by killing an opponent's adventurer. Treasures are disseminated across the whole dungeon and will bring the adventurers well-needed powers.
\13\\13\
Each player has the same characters, each with different powers. Some run fast, some fight or disarm traps. The cleric heals, magician burns everything in sight and the goblin is so weak that the simple fact of getting him out will bring you two victory points.
\13\\13\
Combat and actions are managed via cards. To move, fight, heal or turn a room, you must manage action points obtained by playing cards. Those cards are not drawn but selected from a set of cards by both players. Both players have access to the same panel of cards at the beginning of the game so the game is really about managing the resources and adapting to the changing environment.

I appreciate what this one is trying to do, but it just wasn't my type of game. I didn't love the combat system. It seemed pretty easy to take out characters, and if you lost certain characters early on you were at a fairly distinct disadvantage. The gear mechanic was interesting, but again, I didn't love it.  It seemed to often be the case that even turning a room multiple times didn't lead to an advantageous arrangement.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Sometimes you run across a game that makes you appreciate its design, even though you don't like playing it. For me, Dungeon Twister is that game. The action system is simple and elegant, yet it creates a lot of tactical decision making for the game and manipulating the orientation of the rooms adds an interesting puzzle solving element. Although it has a fantasy theme, the game plays more like a chess variant than an adventure or wargame. It all fits together really well and I should like it, but I just can't get into it. I'm not sure if it's the irritation that comes from having to carefully rotate tiles every few minutes or the rather dull combat system, but something about this game just strikes me very flat.

I see why other people like it, I just don't. Maybe someday I'll get to try the second edition and it will work better for me...We'll just have to wait and see.

Pushes most of my buttons: rewards lookahead, conflicting priorities, alternate victory conditions (kind of), aMAZEing pathfinding.  I do wish combat was less critical, as it's less interesting than the movement.

There's a sense of waste here: the superfluous standup figures and extra start spaces could've easily been replaced by the red & green pieces as a consolidated set for 2-4 players. The figs are ridiculous, and needing a separate 3/4 for every expansion is lousy.

But most damning is the theme, which means I don't play it often enough.

Finally a 2-player dungeon crawl (or race for the exit) that hits all the marks for fun, simplicity, replayability, good components, and fun.  This one's a keeper with or without any future expansions.

RATING: 8.5
I bought this without much prior research when I was looking for a dungeon crawler to play with my RPG group. Dungeon Twister is definitely NO dungeon crawler, but rather a brilliant puzzle game. The theme is almost pasted on, but to figure which characters to use, where to go, what section to turn and how to win is a very rewarding experience.

A very solid game which mixes the dungeon crawl experience with an interesting mix of pure strategy and competition.  Not everyone will like the them but I enjoy it.

This is a Fun game!  A lot of people point out that the theme is just pasted on, but really, it isn't so much as other games.  I'd really like to get some expansions to this game and try more characters.

9 years after my first play I tried this again.
It's OK, but waaaay to complicated for me. Rules are full of little details that detract from the fast pace that i would from a game of escape. Traps are confusing, managing objects a mess and counter-thematic.
The worse aspect is a terrible AP: it's more similar to chess than I'd like.

This said, it's not a bad game and every game will be different thankx to the different characters so you can build up your game in all sort of ways

Just played this for the first time 9/4/2005. Played two games... first game was mainly a "feel through". Second game whent a lot faster... in the end, I managed a quick win with creative use of the Speed potion enhanced Wall Walker helping a treature laden Goblin to the other side with a 180 twist. I am seeing strategies start to develop for me... looking forward to playing this more.

All strategy with little luck, but its not too much of a brain burner. Dungeon crawl theme is implemented well with the artwork. It's great when the twisting tiles allows you to set up some moves well in advance that your opponent did not see coming.

RATING: N/A
Dungeon Twister is a 2-player high level strategy game where 2 teams of adventurers with various powers are trapped in a dungeon. The board is composed of 8 rooms that can be moved and rotated by the players. Each turn, a player is able to spend actions to move around the dungeon, pick up and use items, battle with the opponents team, or turn and move the rooms of the dungeon.

The goal is to reach 5 victory points by moving out of the dungeon or by killing opponent's.

Two-player games are a tough sell.  I don't have a problem owning a million different multi-player games, but my need for games that can only be played head-to-head is limited.  Plus, many multi-player games play perfectly well with two.

Therefore, a 2-player outing had better be really good or really unique, or both.  Dungeon Twister [i]is[/i] unique, but it's just not as fun as Jambo, Magic: The Gathering, Dracula, any of Columbia's lighter block games, or countless others - and it's more of a pain to explain and set up.  

I could see how you could get into it with a regular opponent, though.

I find this to be a kind of cool 2 person strategy game.  I bought it because it sounded really cool.  I have only played it a couple of times, and perhaps that's why I still rate it so high.  I have not over played it.  My daughter thinks it takes too much thought, & my wife just plain refueses.  So my options are limited.

Hmmm, I like that it is a pure strategy game but:
But after 2 hours you (I) lose my motivation to think about what will happen if...
Gamedesign is great (and I don`t like fantasy themes that much).

I really, really wanted to like this game, because of the awesome theme, unique mechanic of twisting rooms and the excessive amount of expansions!  I was ready to put down my money and purchase all those expansions in one clear shot, but I am so happy I decided to wait and play the base set first.  

This was not at all what I was expecting and goes to show that you can learn all that you possibly can about a game before purchasing it, but obviously the actual game play is what matters the most in the end.  I HIGHLY recommend that you test the game out before making your purchase!

Everything aside, I do like the fact that the game is relatively cheap if you purchase it online like I did.  The expansions add so much more to the base set and I just think that is awesome!  I just found the game play somewhat dull.  Sure it has some pretty interesting concepts, but I am not very impressed.

I have to say though that I do like the components despite the negative comments.  The artwork is very thematic and everything is pleasantly colored.

I just wish it was better.  :(

~UPDATE~ [3/13/10]
I just got done playing a couple of sessions and have to say that I enjoy it more than previously.  Although I still do not consider the game play exciting, it was much more enjoyable this time around.  I had to increase my rating to reflect this (5.5 -> 6.5).  I am considering spicing the game up with an expansion or two; maybe adding more characters and rooms will add enough variety for a more satisfying gaming experience.

From a first playing, against a very experienced player:  [b][bgcolor=#cc99ff]&nbsp;5.5&nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b]  An analytical game which favors experience, but I think there's a decent game formula at work.  I'm anxious to increase my rating. :^)

Having played on a more level playing field, this is interesting, and very tactical; however, you will fail if you don't think strategically as well.  I look forward to more twisting!

I like this very much. I like steampunkish theme and the stressful atmosphere of this game. You really feel you're strugling to survive when there isn't any random mechanics in this one, you have to really think & give your best to beat your opponent. This has very harsh feel to it and very unforgiving for beginners. Sadly this has scared many players in my groups away from this gem and I can't play this as much as I would like.

I'm thinking about getting 3-4 player expansion to this, maybe it would be a little less harsh and would give this game a second chance within my group. Only concern is downtime..

RATING: 7
A non-random 2-player game. Would rate higher, because the game is ingenious, but this is the kind of game that stresses me. This is not a dungeon game, but a chess-like game. You're supposed to get your charas to the other side of the dungeon by a clever use of action points, movement points and special abilities. Both players have exactly the same abilities. Partly influenced by the luck in which the tiles lie, but very little.
In these games I always tend to be outsmarted, and when thoroughly defeated, I feel like a dumbass who is worth nothing. It's my worse aspect as a board gamer, but it still brings down the game.

1/1/12 -- I still regard DT highly, but I ultimately sold my set to recover some shelf space.  Though it was good, it wasn't quite good enough to have a place in my elite collection.  Dropping my rating to a 7.

3/15/07 - Dungeon Twister takes a few games to get used to, but once you're past the learning process, the game is just awesome.  The card management (between managing action cards and combat card usage) is pretty compelling, in my opinion.  Combining that with the rotating dungeon tiles and varying character powers makes for a thoroughly engrossing, tactical contest that ends in just under an hour.  The theme is quite well executed to boot, making DT one of the best, middle-weight, 2 player games available.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Highly tactical and strategic with tons of options to consider. The production values are a bit low, but it's a solid game.

Adding Paladins and Dragons is a good bet since it doubles the amount of stuff you get and allows for a great deal more variety.

The game can also be played in under an hour, which makes it a solid choice when there just isn't time for Descent.

Wow... wenn man das Dungeons & Dragons Brettspiel mit dem verrückten Labyrinth kombiniert, kommt das dabei heraus. Da sich das Spielfeld ständig verändert, muss man hellwach sein.

Interesting chess-like game.  It doesn't fill the niche I thought it would (dungeon tactical combat) and is more of a slow paced game.  There is a lot going on from how to advance and back up your pieces to when to use your best attack cards.  I like the variety and have gotten some more expansions to allow for army building strategies.  This is definitely a brain burner!

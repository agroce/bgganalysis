If you want to try out a wargame and never have, this is as good of a place as any to start.

It's very light and easy to learn, but has some depth.  Its greatest asset is a clever activation and combat system.  You roll a die for initiative: high roll goes first.  However, the bigger your die, the less units you can activate, but the greater their movement.  It is a bit "gamey", but I like it.

You manage your strikes and try to cover your defense, terrain modifiers, and recovery.  It's wargaming 101 in a box.

RATING: 6
A simple battle that was very well designed for both beginners to Wargames as well as old timers that just want some quick battle before the night is over.

The map is one of the most beautiful desert maps I've ever seen. Most African battles/Wargames gives a very dull yellowish tone and artificial hills and dunes to fit the game play. This does the same, but does it better than others.

The game system leaves a lot to be desired but yet is simple enough that makes the game play fast, furious and fun. The lack of terrain modifiers, the lack of blood for the attackers and the badly written rule booklet, left quite a few questions to be answered. The lack of retreat rules too, make the battle system gamey.....go in, make the dice rolls while the rest sit around and wait for initiative....

Overall, it does provide a sweeping, open land, swirling battle that is so Africa.

A reasonable beginners game, but lack quite a lot as compared to other hex and counter Wargames. I would not introduce this game to beginners.....I felt its more for seasoned Wargamers that just want a fast "variant" hex and counter wargame for the evening.

RATING: 7
Depicts a portion of Operation Crusader centered on the intense fighting around Sidi Rezegh south of Tobruk. The counters represent regiments and battalions for a combined total of several divisions per side. Not a bad game. The rules are pretty straight forward and very simple. The game has a low counter density so there's not a lot to keep track of. Good beginners wargame although there certainly isn't a lot of variety in the game. You get a single scenario with a pretty specific set-up and reinforcement schedule. Still, it's a decent and inexpensive game. The box is pretty small compared to most games and you get a nice mounted map. My only complaint would be that my map was warped. I've heard others complain about the same thing. As much as everyone complains about paper maps, mounted maps aren't always a good idea.

RATING: 6.5
Less engaging than Dawn's Early Light, which I prefer from many points of view. Totennsontag is a basic game with nice intuitions which are more deeply explored in the following game of the series. Yet, this game delivers a nice experience: low complexity, small size, nice map board with all the charts you need to play. A major flaw, in my opinion, is the designation of the unit, which is not clear and it requires a bit of time to sort and set up. As I said: if you enjoyed this one then you MUST have Dawn's Early Light as well. I believe some extra rules and chits could be designed by LnL to expand the game (like assets chits)

RATING: 8
A fine game. The initiative die roll system is novel; it brings the same uncertainty and tension as chit pull systems.  The luck of the roll is reduced somewhat by compensating players for high rolls in one impulse with the ability to modify or choose their die roll in the next.

The counter artwork is very nice, though I didn't appreciate the tiny print used for the important division numbers.  The board is functional and thick card, though mine won't quite lie flat. The rules are an easy read, but lacking clarity in one or two places.

The game is challenging for both sides.  The Commonwealth has the Axis outnumbered, but the Axis has in the Panzer III's the most potent, mobile and durable weapon on the battlefield.
The game repays aggression and manoeuvre.  There seem to be a few strategic options to explore and the vagaries of the initiative system add variability.

Totensonntag is compact enough to slip into my overnight bag and play on a hotel room desk.

Good game. The activation system allows to dare some risqued actions like approching and hoping you'll have the initiative in order to attack the first.
According to the facts there's a 3 units stacks, the game could take a long time to advance in the firsts turns.
But the rules are more logical than complex.
To play in more than one hour for being cool.

Great wargame in a little box. Totensonntag has one of the most beautiful map and counters I ever seen in a wargame. Also, the rules are short, clear and easy. You could read the rules, cut the counters and play your first game in the same evening! That's great. The impulse system works well which makes the game fun and challenging and it plays fast.

A short and sweetly nice WW2 game set in N Africa.  

It's a good one to play as an initiation into wargames.  It doesn't make you feel like the rules "are" the game.  You spend a lot of time looking at the objective towns and this game drove my attention to the various divisions I was commanding.  I don't remember this happening in other wargames as much.  

As the Allies, once you lose that fourth unit of a division, its all or nothing and you might as well spend it on down and try to save other divisions units so there isn't VPs going rapidly through the door.

Preserving the armor for the allies is rough (which maintains their ability to cover distance...)  The Panzers rock=).

Nifty little game, it's not deep enough for me to rate it higher on any front yet BUT i don't believe it's meant to be, it's an excellant fast playing well thought out system. I'm penalising it for lack of content which is somewhat unfair, think of this as being a big 7 for a small box. Highly recommend this for hotel, holiday or lack of gaming space.

I am not sure that a central mechanism (your activation number is your speed)really works, but the game is fast and bloody - rather like a quad game with attitude. The lack of defensive fire made attacking a very popular activity, but it did not make it feel like the Western Desert.

I think the design would have benefitted from moving away from the central mechanism

RATING: 6
Good beer and pretzels game and a good introductory war game, especially for $20. It's similar to A Victory Lost and Clash of Giants but lighter and quicker than either of those titles. Even so, it still packs in a surprising amount of game play for such a small package. My only complaints after one play are that too much may depend on the initiative rolls and, although it looks great, the counters are too thin and the board warps.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Replayable wargame due to the many ways to score victory points. It seems to be reasonably balanced. The wording of the rules could be tightened up (particularly with regard to the naming of the types of units) and took me one play through to make sense of. The 'Corp Command' system is novel and I enjoyed the uncertainty of whether I would get to move a few units far or most units a small amount. 

The art on the components is good but the counters are too small to read easily and too thin to pick up and the board doesn't sit flat which is annoying. I would have preferred both counters and board to have been larger and to have illustrations on all counters, not just the armour and recon elements. I resorted to colouring the edges of the 15th and 21st panzer divisions red and black to make it easier to keep track of their losses (the Commonwealth player needs to destroy 4 units from each for some victory points) and ironing the board to make it lay flat without a layer of plexiglass on top, a method I really can't recommend you try as mine ended up wavy!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty, but disappointing production quality (thin counters, warping to the board) mars the experience. The game has merits; it's fast, interactive, and both players have non-obvious decision points. But a run of unfortunate activation rolls can swing a game in a big way. Still, I think I have a way of dealing with that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Top notch components, short rules, and knife edge victory conditions all make for a fun game. Lack of defensive fire is odd in a desert game, and supply is perhaps underplayed beyond the nightly recovery rolls. Initiative mechanic is innovative, as going first usually means doing the least, which makes for some interesting decision-making.

Great little game. Initiative system works well and is very unique. You never really know who will have the next turn which makes planning a little more difficult. Very random with 2d6 per attack and initiative die roll. Looks great and feels like Africa, great colour coded and classy pieces. Only let down is that there is no hidden movement when Operation Crusader was a battle where no-one really knew where the enemy was.

It's so cute! Seriously, though, the production is quite good, even though it comes in an itty bitty box. This game should serve as a great introductory wargame for players just getting into the hobby, but it's not bad for seasoned gamers either. It models an interesting conflict, has low counter density, short rules, and it's playable in a couple hours. It introduces an interesting "Activation Number" game mechanic in which a low roll allows more units to move, but  high number allows units to move first. The map and counters are great, although I would have liked a couple of additions; terrain modifiers could have been displayed in the terrain ID hexes and the reinforcement letter codes could have been included on the turn impulse track. There was also some brief confusion, because I thought the initiative number was also the Movement Point allowance. I'm looking forward to future releases in the series.

I really want to like this game.  The components look great.  The mechanics of it are really interesting, especially for solitaire play, with lots of variability between turns in terms of which units may move and how far, as well as the fact that there are multiple "fronts" at once.  So the system is good, but the problem is the game.  It seems completely one-sided, and I cannot figure out a way for the Commonwealth to win; the German panzer units are essentially unbeatable and by the fourth turn (out of only 6!) it's clear which way the game is going to go, and not worth playing to completion.  With some tinkering, this could be a great game, but as is, it's not one I'm likely to replay too often.

Rating based on one play so far, may change upwards after more. Excellent graphics, handsome counters. Board warps a bit. Game is small enough to transport, and to play on any average-sized table.

The designer has managed to create a fun and intense little wargame that can be played in an evening with very few rules and simple but clever mechanics.

I just bought it and haven't played it yet, but the rules and components look fantastic (although the warping board is kind of dissapointing).

There might be a truly fresh and dynamic wargame in here. 
--------------------------------------------------

UPDATE: After my first play, the game has certainly lived up to my expectations. Fast and furious combats with tons of tension until the very last minute.

However, strategies for both sides seem to be quite limited, so I'm decreasing my initial rating until I get to play two or three games more.

---------------------------------------------------
2ND UPDATE: The more I play, the more I like the simple and refreshing mechanics of the Corps Command system but the less I enjoy this game in particular given the more than evident imbalance in favour of the Axis. 

Looking forward to new games of this series in the hope that will be more balanced.

RATING: 6
This is a nice, light, introductory level wargame of the battles around Sidi Rezegh during Operation Crusader.  Graphically, the components are top notch in terms of design.  Physically, they are a bit of a dissapointment.  The counters are very thin and the mapboard simply will not lie flat.  LnL would have been better off going with a normal paper map I think.

The rules are well written and easy to grasp (with a few niggles/bloopers, Deutches Afrika Korps is rendered as "Desert" Afrika Korps for instance).  The game plays well solitaire.  The command and control mechanism is central to the game and players will need to plan around not being able to do everything they want to in a particular impulse.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A game that ably illustrates the astonishing versatility of the German panzer division in action against the unimaginative British command during Operation Crusader. The problem is, that with no consideration of supply, there's simply no way that the Commonwealth forces can win the game as presented here. Their divisions will simply be shattered with little prospect of gaining a VP lead. This is an object lesson in history, but there's simply no game here.

A rather shallow light operational wargame. I think it is a decent game, but it doesn't really capture the feel of the contest, it often seems like a slogging match, manoeuvre seems to matter far to little. Not bad, worth its price at less than 20 dollars on line I think.

Tough for me to rate...so much potential, marred by too many questions.
Why would an opponent know who belongs to a specific formation for victory purposes? (see Beda Fomm for a similar complaint.)
Why would highly mobile units become hamstrung if infantry units were to move at the same time?
When going first in an impulse, why should I know exactly what my opponent can do in terms of activation before I move my units? 

I agree with Vasey's conclusion here.

RATING: 6
Breezed through the rules in about 10 mins, a few rules clarifications may be needed but all seemed to work out easy with a bit of thought. A very different game design, you never really know when if you or your opponent will get a double move with the impulse system which is both interesting and maybe a bit too chaotic.

CRTless combat leads to a lot of dice rolling. The armored vehicles were truly the stars of this desert battle as they get the most movement and fighting due to their generally high activation value. You can take out an enemy unit fast if planned right as you can attack it multiple times in each phase. 

Great graphics but hard map does not lay flat! Counters could be thicker, they were knocked around to easily due to their light weight. Also it is very hard to read the unit ID's.

RATING: 7
Quite a good light wargame. At first it seemed overly simple but I think there is enough meat to it to keep me coming back. I really liked the activation system, even though it doesn't seem to work perfectly in this scenario. You almost always want a '2' or maybe a '3' so that you can activate the most guys. Going first rarely makes it worth it and movement is rarely an issue. Never the less, it still works and its very clever.

The victory conditions are very tight and keep the excitement going for most of the game, it seems like it will usually come down to the last victory point (although I'm yet to see the allies actually win).

I'm less of a fan of the combat system which is a bit too dice and modifier intensive for my liking. It's a nice break from most wargames not having to figure out odds on the CRT all the time but in the end i think having to roll two dice for every single unit involved in combat and then add all the modifiers is more tedious.

Just a couple of words of warning:

a) I really don't think this is that great an "intro" wargame if you're looking to get into that sort of thing. Almost none of the concepts in this game translate to other wargames out there except for the ZOCs.

b) The components, whilst they look nice in pictures, are fairly poor in comparison to those commonly seen in wargames. The counters are extremely thin and the "mounted" board is probably less usable than a paper one due to warping.

The game board was grossly warped right out of the box, but it's inexpensive so I guess it's okay. I should be thrilled with this, but I am not so taken with it. Seems all we did was move next to the opponent and start rolling dice. The wargamer newbie I played with liked it.

Some nice ideas and mechanics here, but somehow the combat seems flawed.

Simply disappointing. Does not capture in any way the mobility of desert warfare. Combat system with great inconsistencies (i.e. the defense value of an armored car is equal to that of any medium tank in the game...you cannot defend if you do not activate ... etc).

This is a good introductory level wargame that plays easily and quickly.  Very good graphic design and good production values, but the counters are a little thin.

Decent replayability for a small game.

I like the system, even if it is a bit dicey, and I'm looking forward to future games in this series including Dawn's Early Light.

Good stuff in a compact package.

After reading the rules, I find that the game probably suffers from a lack of replayability.

RATING: 2
On first blush, nice looking components with not many rules, but ... map won't lie flat, counters have important info that is really hard to read, the counters are thin, and, most importantly, the CENTRAL DIE ROLL of every couplet determines initiative, the amount of units that can move, and their movement allowance. Too much hangs on this, and it can ruin a game very quickly. Oh, and the German panzers are uber-mensch, a really tired plot device.

I bought this game because my late dad fought at the battle of Sidi Rezegh with the SA 5th Brigade, and I struggle to play this without thinking of him.

"Totensonntag" provides a nice balance between simplicity and detail, and, as an interesting and competitive game. 

I might have bumped my rating up a half point had the rule book and all the components (you'll need a mangifying lens to make out the type on some of the counters) been equivalent to the quality of the design itself, but hey, it's a very good design for this level of complexity. 

I would hope this design could be a model for a simpler generation of war games that nevertheless delivers as such. The designer manages to sweep away unnecessary layers of rules, something which bogs down innumerable other war games. And, it seems like there's a decent amount of replayability, given that it's not very complex. 

As others have suggested, I've taken the time to color-code the various units, by country, as the type on the counters is impossibly small and no summary of the various units comes with the game. 

Ordered new, August 2009.

Played a few turns of this and couldn't get into it for some reason.  Didn't give it a fair chance, so I won't rate it.  I'll probably trade it away.

I wish I had enjoyed this more, but I can't seem to understand how to effectively use the very "gamey" activation system, and was left wanting some other alternative - formation chit draw, shorter alternating impulses, IGO-UGO, action points, anything. And, BTW, these springy, articulated-cardboard mounted maps were consigned to the lowest circle of Hell after Avalon Hill tried them, and for a very good reason - they're crap.  Paper would have been better.

Maybe best thought of as an adolescent version of Dawn's Early Light, which improved the system by adding defensive fire and tactical chits. My biggest problem with CC:T is many units have to "pass" for several turns in a row. Still, I like the (one) historical scenario of CC:T, with it's swirling attacks and lack of clear battle lines. And I love the colorful regiment names (e.g., Duke of Edinburgh's Own Rifles), although that's merely cosmetic.

RATING: 8.5
Great little game. Nice system, easy to learn and fast of play. The game gives s great sense of manouevravability and fast, tense mobile warfare. It can be a pretty close run thing, though I feel that an experienced German player would definitely be at an advantage. I would rate higher but its not overly replayable, there are only so many commonwealth strategies. It would be good to have a lot more of these easy to play in an evening games on famous battles.

An OK war game.  It felt a bit daunting for the allies going up against those panzers.  It was strange that when you assault the attacker can never lose anything.  On a second try I liked it better.

 A nice game with simple rules and some conciderations to take. I like the activation system even though it has quite an influence on the outcome, two attacks in the row can be devasting. I think it will be good for a couple of plays.

Compact gamebox.  Small mounted map with low density counters. Excellent initiative system. Just the right amount of chrome. Rules maybe not very clear in some points. Plays quickly and it's a lot of fun.

 It's a pity Dawn's Early Light doesnt have the same box size.

Interesting activation system that I enjoyed.  Game is also small and quickly played which is another plus.  However, concerned that the Axis Panzers are just too powerful so finding myself just not that eager to pull this out to play.  Will play if someone else offers it up, but unlikely to do so myself.

This is an average vote between the game system (10) and the game (8). The game is great and every battle will be different. Of course you need good dices....but the balance is excellent. Need more titles on this system. Have fun. And list but not last Italians....do it better.... (in the game, as it's historically proved, they are very good in fight but a tragedy in logistic and strategical organization).

I used to think of this one as a good gateway wargame, due to few simple rules and not too many chits. But I think the game lasts too long for an introduction.

Very impressed after one playing, I enjoyed Totensonntag more than any other smaller wargame I have tried. The variable impulse system is ingenious and enhances solitaire play. Map, counters, play aids all top-notch. Game is well balanced with maybe a slight edge to the Germans. Rules are only 4 pages. Rating will probably go up after more play. Actually I am surprised LnL doesn't have more games using this system.

RATING: 5
Simple system that is easily playable and somewhat evocative. Some annoying production glitches (my board really warped and some minor counter errata). 

I do like the clever activation system; the designer implemented a nice touch here.

The Axis seem overwhelmingly powerful (w/Panzer III's that rule the battlefield, though do note they are worth 2x VP) so it will be interesting to see what effective Allied strategies may develop. 

Overall, the game hits the mark that it was trying to achieve.

Corps Command stands out for two reasons; as a well thought weeknight war game, and for the innovative variable movement/activation mechanic.  The Commonwealth player drives the action (with some choices for victory conditions), while the Axis must respond in a flexible manner.

Quibbles; Combat is a tad simplistic, and IMHO, misses an opportunity to further enhance the activation/movement rules.  How?  If the combat resolution rules allowed for more rewards for combined arms stacks, the game decisions and tensions for maneuver would be increased.  Adding retreat after combat rules do likewise.

Bottom line - the system is so simple yet compelling that it yields great potential for larger scenarios and/or additional chrome.

Very good introductory war game. Small size, few pieces, great production values. First edition rules aren't written very well, you'll need to download the setup guide and check the FAQ's before you start. The game mechanics work well for this game which also helps when playing solitaire.

Totensonntag has some tremendous advantages:
- Short, crisp rules
- Good looking counters
- Very interesting and useful initiative system
- Lots of play action for both sides

BUT, there are also some small concerns:
- Some ambiguity in the rules
- Artillery is rather impotent
- Recon has an interesting habit of lurking in trenches taking effective potshots at enemy armor
- Rather counterintuitive combat resolution

AND, one larger concern:
- Play balance. I can't see how the superpanzers can lose in the end. If I am convinced otherwise this rating will definitely go up.

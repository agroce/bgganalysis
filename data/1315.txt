Played with more than 2 players it is really fun (though even with 2, yet trading doesn t offer much of a choice then of course). Still easy to learn and a bit of adventure atmosphere comes up.

A light game, but with a bit of thought one could win rather consistently. Knowing how to make the most of what you get is key. The natives can be put to great use towards the last third of the game... knowing that now makes me think that I would do much better with a second playing. I feel no need to own this game.

This game works very well as a two player as well as for up to 5 players. It can be played by adults and also by families with children as young as maybe 6 or 7 (if they are game players). I expect that a child who could play Enchanted Forest might well be able to graduate onto this with a bit of help and encouragement. But that's not to say that it's a child's game, because adults do enjoy it, but it is very simple in tactical terms. I guess this makes it a perfect choice for those who would want to play in pairs, adult groups or with the kids.
When you read the rules, it sounds a lot harder than it is. All you have to do is roam around Africa turning over hidden counters and taking actions according to what you find - for instance, if you find one of 6 types of animal, you can move them to be with others and thus make a herd and score points. There's a certain child-like magic to turning over the counters and finding something you want. Typical examples of tactical choice would be that sometimes, you want to do more things than you can, or you want to build a base camp somewhere lucrative, but the journey there will just take too long and may not be worth the effort when you consider points you'll miss out on by not doing something else.

Anyway, me and my wife enjoy it and I think we will be playing it with the kids in years to come. Nice board too. 

Edit - yes have played it with the kids (8 and 6) three times now and they really like it.  Perfect for the age group if they know the basics of Euros.

Hunh. Well, it's got that colonial touch (let's rearrange all these things in Africa! let's resettle some nomads!)... My rating is low, but I might consider breaking this out for some non-gamers. Animalses is always a great draw.

As a light, family game this one works well. It's easy to explain and moves along pretty quickly so it doesn't overstay it's welcome. The set collection aspect fits well with this style of game and the exploration theme is appealing. My 8 year old likes this one a lot but I don't label it as a kids game.

I'm a sucker for a game with an exploration theme. Africa has a gorgeous board featuring a classic map of Africa which starts totally obscured and unexplored except for five coastal cities. The rules, once you tease them out of the rulebook that comes with the game, are classic Knizia, quick and simple, easy to teach. The decisions aren't that difficult and the game just snaps along with very little downtime. The monument countdown clock is an interesting way to measure the progress of and time left in the game.

This is a family game that I would play with non gamers and children.  Very nice components, I really like the board.  The score would go up to a 7 with children.  Seems to be very luck driven.  I like the exploration theme, but for gamers there is so much to this game that others such as Tikal simply do better.

I've played this once with 2, 3, 4 and 5 players and it's fallen flat everytime. Optimal decisions after a flip are obvious and the only non-obvious choices are the movements to flip tiles, which is dictated by randomness. As for those claiming this to be a good family game: I think it's a touch too complicated for the youngsters, with all the possible actions you can do. So all in all, a fairly lackluster game.

Update: On to the trade pile!

----------

Strange game.  I've gone back and forth between throwing this one on the trade pile and keeping it so many times since acquiring it at a 50% off going-out-of-business sale.  Because it's kind of light and fluffy, I only bring it out once and a while with the appropriate group.  But because it has some very quirky rules which are impossible to remember, those few times I do get it to the table always require a refresher read through the rulebook.  This characteristic alone normally mandates a game make its way to my BGG trade list.  But for some unknown reason, I can't get rid of Africa.

Horrible game. Where is the strategy? There are almost no decisions to be made, and it all depends on how lucky you are. The decision that =can= be made only help you in the short run. In other words: just no depth whatsoever.

Nice art, though.

RATING: 7.7
This game has some abstract rules, but stil manages to be little thematic (exploiting africa). The game delivers some excitement through exploring and flipping tiles. The game misses some variety in the amount of tiles and lacks strategy since its quite high amount of luck in the game.

Three plays now.

Was taught a few incorrect rules, the first time through, but have played correctly twice now.

I'm liking it - I almost find it soothing in a way, because there aren't a great deal of decisions to make - but there are enough so you at least have to take your brain out of park. It's easy enough to explain, plays in a very reasonable amount of time, and seems very accessible to newcomers. Yes, there's quite a bit of luck, but I've never had a problem with luck in games, so it doesn't bother me at all - if you know it's there, what's the big deal?

This is a quite enjoyable light weight strategy game, that I feel is under appreciated for what it is.  The mechanisms are easy to pick up and gameplay is relatively easy to explain.  This would work well as a light game with your group or with a non-gamer.

RATING: 6
There's nothing extraordinary in the game, but it's light fun.  Players are exploring Africa and discovering goods, jewels, nomads, monuments and animals.  They get immediate points for jewels, animals, and nomads.  When they find monuments, they get a base camp that they can later place for points (either setting up a vacation getaway with lots of animals, nomads, and monuments nearby) or to remove nearby jewels.  At the end of the game, player score points for sets of trade goods and majorities of removed jewels.

I don't think there's anything deep here, but it's fun and surprisingly thematic.  It really felt like an exploring game.  

Keeping it will depend on it getting played.  But it fills a niche of "just before bed" games where I don't need to worry about my daughter getting upset with people stomping on her.

RATING: 9
Delightful, light exploration game that is great to play with families and non-gamers.  There is definitely a luck factor, but good use of "teleporting" your explorer, placing base camps, and aggressive nomad relocation can mitigate some of the luck.  Fine with 2-3 players, but more fun with 4-5 because the explorers are close enough to mess with each other (steal resources, etc.).  Perfect game length (30 - 45 minutes).

UPDATE:  Over the last five years, my opinion of the game has only improved.  We always have fun playing this game - maybe one of Knizia's best when it comes to the theme-mechanics marriage.

Very good game to play with my daughters - 6 and 8.  The element of discovery is very high on the fun scale.  Plus, my daughters will develop an understanding of point maximization as they play the game more.  I predict a solid 10  plays of this game.

Ok, so you don't have much control over a lot of your scoring, but the exploring part is still fun.  Great to play with non-gamers and family!  If you go in expecting a deep, heavy, Knizia title, you'll be sorely disappointed.  However, if you go in realizing it's a fairly light exploration game, you're in for a treat.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Although I liked the concept (exploring, moving bits around the game board to improve their locations), the game felt much too luck-based and ended too quickly.  Most of the time, there weren't many decisions players could make ("this nomad can only be moved *here* to improve its position; all other plays are illegal").  The trade rule that lets you force others to trade with you as long as the trade doesn't hurt the other player is interesting.

RATING: 6
This is one of the first games I bought when I came back to board games. As I had younger kids this game got many plays in its early days. Now the kids are a bit bored of it and need something more challanging so this one does not get played. I must say this is a fantastic game for a family with young kids say 6-12. I just played a game with 3 adults and we all enjoyed it but much like carcassonne you feel like whatever you do there is no options just the best place to put a said piece.

Overall Score 6, Appearence 8, Components 6, The Box (storage) 4, Rulebook 8, Ease of Play 8, Mechanics 7, Involvment 6, Replayability 7, Uniqueness 7, Luck 7 v Strategy 3 (The higher the number the more it leans that way.)

RATING: 8
10+ plays (1x 3p, 5+ x4p, 4x 5p). Good game. charming and fast. the heart is in the scoring, like many Knizias. Lots of luck, plus tactical and strategic decisions. Light (but not too light) fun of exploring and maneuvering. With fast game play, a gem. Everyone I played with said they loved it. One after multi plays said it is her favorite board game. (update, year layer, still her favorite.) The panoply of if/then action choices take a careful extra and sustained effort to learn (Knizia trickiness). For example, there are numerous small differences in the scoring on actions on undiscovered tokens v. discovered tokens of the same type. Because of that, it is a bit more than a light game. I think the nice player aid cards in English are incomplete in one category, so I suggest you use this one instead: http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/22559/africa-color-quick-ref-v1-0-pdf . There is luck, but numerous tricky maneuvers, choices to score. The luck could be a problem that prevents some from enjoying this game. On the other hand this helps the game in some ways too-- no A/P, fast play, and no mini-maxing. Its theme probably does not bear scrutiny.

RATING: 6
Played once.  This game is quick and fairly light.  If you enjoyed the exploration aspect of Tikal but were held up by analysis paralysis, Africa may be a nice choice.  Like most Knizia games there are several ways to score and a variable game-ending condition...but the rules are easy to swallow and the play becomes very intuitive in short order.  I found that luck played a larger roll in this game than I care for...but I do think Africa could be a successful choice for a cross-over game with the casual group.  The playing time, components, and exploration theme are appealing. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Strange game, this has too many rules to be light, yet too much randomness to be heavy. I'd be willing to play it again, but I'm in no hurry. I get the sense that having a strategy is well and good, but playing it 'well' would generally come down to opportunistically doing whatever the tiles and other players allow you, which is well and good in a game of low randomness (like Java) but this game has such a luck factor that it just makes it frustrating; you either get the tiles you need, or you don't, and winning or losing essentially turns into a toss of the bones. There is some room for skillful play, but 'seeing the board' isn't that difficult, so the game devolves into randomness pretty quickly.

Certainly feels like a Knizia game in the scoring and some of the mechanics which don't feel particularly integrated to the theme. However, Africa does have a bit of an exploration kind of feel which certainly suits the theme. Fairly enjoyable and I wouldn't mind playing again. Based on 1 play.

My Third least favorite Knizia game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Afrika is such an enticing title: a big board of Africa, beautiful markers, a large and imposing elephant on the cover... But once you begin to read the rules you will realise that this is not a game of strategical or even tactical renown. The main problem is that players have no way of knowing what lies in store for them once they turn over a marker, so it all comes down to scoring for the moment and maximising your own point potential. Now for children yearning to play a Big Box game like mommy and daddy this game might actually be spot on, but why oh why did the good Doctor introduce such a heavy ruleset into the game then which does nothing but hinder play and confuse things for the youngsters...?? Even worse: the ruleset does not actually address the raw randomness; it just presents the players with a means to 'do stuff' with the opportunities it provides thusly&mdash;assuming there are any, that is. I have no idea why this game was put out at all: it's too complex for families, and too unwieldy and unpredictable for gamers. Selling off this game was a decision I very quickly took; my girlfriend took some more convincing but even she conceded in the end there wasn't really much in this game to keep coming back to.

RATING: 6
A light strategy game. Lots of luck in that the tiles you turn over during your turn will have a strong influence on whether you win or lose.  Much of the gameplay seems automatic because once you turn over a tile, it's usually pretty obvious what to do with it. There are a few choices occasionally,  but not a lot.   As well, the game is nowhere near as complicated as the rules first seem to make it.  It's much better with 2 players than with 5 players!  With 5,  the luck factor becomes overwhelming.  All that being said though, it can still be fun (with 2, not 5) at the end of the evening when you want to rest your brain,  or if you're playing with younger folk.

Components: The components are certainly workable and durable, but there is nothing remarkable about their artistic design, excepting the nice score track winding around Africa.

Experience: A total crap-shoot for the first two-thirds of the game, without any sort of strategic decisions; a few decisions popped up near the end, when we had opportunity to at least calculate the points certain moves would net us. Toward the end, I started to enjoy the random turning over of tokens as a game of mere chance, but I didn't find much in this game to occupy me.

I have not managed to get too excited about Africa. It was recommended to me by someone and I&#039;m afraid so far it has been quite disappointing. 

I recently tried it with two players thinking it might be better, but if anything it was worse. It ended up being little more than a two people independently aquiring random points for various things. There were some tactical decisions about what action would produce the greatest return, but almost no interaction between the players and I could not see much in the way of strategy.

RATING: 9
Players plunge into deepest Africa, turn up exploration counters, then try to position them to their best advantage in order to score victory points.  Animals like to huddle together; nomads like space; treasure likes to be mined, and so on.  This game on first appearances seems plays itself - the moves seem very obvious.  However, this is not the case.  There is quite a bit of subtlety here, as well as nastiness.  The story of the game develops nicely, as the tiles are explored (about half of them are removed, half remain), the board opens up, and the relocation game begins to shine.  I always think this game, and Carcassonne, as cousins - they share a lot of common ground.  Africa and Res Publica are two of Knizia's most underrated and misunderstood games.  Superb.

Knizia really did a good job making it interesting, and fast-playing. There's a careful balance here in allowing minor interference and interaction between players, but preventing major screwage. It really feels lke exploration here, not a take-that game.
 
Highly recommended for family play.

I played this game 3 times at gencon03 with 2 players. It played quickly, even with 2 people who had never played before. It just wasn&#039;t fun. The different scoring elements seem randomly thrown together.

RATING: 7
I'd probably rate this a bit lower in terms of gameplay only (there is indeed a fair amount of luck involved for a Knizia game), maybe a 6.5. But the fact that it's quick, fun and colorful means it will make it to the table more often than most other 6.5 games, so I've bumped it up. Good as a diversion from the heavier stuff. I like it. It's not as brilliant and deep as Samurai, for example, but it's also much more likely to get played at my house.

Some speak of this game derisively because they expected a heavier game to come in a big box Knizia title.  I actually enjoy the game - even with its luckfest aspects - as it plays quickly and works will with my students at school.  The exploration theme jibes nicely with the mechanism of flipping the chits and there are multiple ways to gain points.

Yes, it's random and mostly luck-based, but as a short diversion it's quite pleasant to play.  The components are very nice.  The rules are actually quite fiddly for such a simple game, and that may be it's biggest flaw.

RATING: 6
Mildly fascinating "exploration" game by the master himself, more luck-driven than most of Knizia's other games. The feeling of exploring the dark continent comes across as a kind of sidenote, as this is more as a symbol collector's race. There are too many games which explore similar territory, and most of them are better, but this game has very simple rules and a certain family appeal going for it. Called racist by some, but I've never understood why.

I like it because it moves around fast, and there are some interesting strategic decisions.  The theme helps as well.

I am quite certain my girls will enjoy playing this for its adventure and exploration theme.  There is a lot of luck involved, perhaps a bit too much for my liking.

Family fun surely; avid gamers may be left a little hungry after trekking all of Africa.

Africa is a very light game, but I've actually been enjoying it more after a few plays. Nice 20-30 minute game that doesn't hurt your brain at all.

After 5 games I've at last recognised how much depth there is in this game. There are a couple of decent moves you can make - blocking opponent's great spots for camps, setting yourself up for a great move, etc. Last game I made a lot of points by clearing an area by mining then relocating a lot of nomads into it. Every time I play I see more.

After 14 plays: OK, I think I've seen all the depth there is to see. I still like this game.

A game to break out when you have non-gamers around. Simple rules and simple play. Perhaps a nice way of getting new players involved in German Type games. This won't scare them away.

[Original comment] I like this game, and I'm willing to play it, but it isn't as outstanding as other games in its category.

May 2009 -- Although we haven't played this game in a long time, I would enjoy trying it again. The biggest drawback is the set-up time required.

October 2009 -- Played again recently. Discovered that we had misplayed several rules in the past. I downloaded some player aids from BGG and then created my own. Next time we play, we should be able to do so according to the rules. I still believe it can be a fun game.

October 2011 -- We have played a couple of times in the past two years, and I enjoyed it. It's not an exciting game or truly challenging, and it takes a while to set up and to play, but I would like to play it again.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite exploration games.  Like any of them, chance plays a significant role.  However, the multiple, typically Knizian means for scoring provide some real decisions on whether to explore further or to score based on what's around you.  Finding multiple monuments can seem like a letdown at first, but claiming good spots for bases (tents) can score big.  I just really enjoy playing and watching the board change.

RATING: 7.5
Three plays: one with three, one with four, and the other I don't recall. A fun family game that does a great job of creating an "exploring" vibe. It's all pretty light, though there are still some things to think about; obviously players are trying to cover more territory than their opponents, and deciding how to best use the base camps can be tricky. Additionally, there are small ways that players can mess with each other if they're clever, such as moving an animal or nomad somewhere that interferes with a prime base camp location. 

That being said, there is one problem with the game, which is that the rules are far too unintuitive and hard to explain given that the game has a lightness that clearly makes it geared more towards kids and casual gamers. Even seasoned gamers may find themselves scratching their heads at it all.

Really didn't like this one.  The rules were extremely poorly written (or translated), and it just didn't seem to have any elements that would have made the game that fun even if the rules were written well.  It seemed a bit like Tikal, but only enough to make me wish I was playing Tikal instead.

Brainless, but short. Great theme, but the exploration aspect gets repetitive. It probably would've helped to make some tiles hazards, and perhaps ditch the scoring system and make one tile Dr Livingston or some special monument that everyone is looking for. Could've been so much more.

Not a whole lot of depth, but it's a good time as long as you're not expecting a Knizia masterpiece.  The end game  mechanism is somewhat broken, as the game can end after just a few turns if the monuments end up being flipped quickly.

RATING: 8
This is an easy 8 for me. I like the randomness and the ability to move tokens to better your scoring. It may be light but it plays fast and challenges you to keep on your toes where you stop your movement and what tiles to turn so as not to benefit others. I suspect the rating may go up on this one.

Since this is a Knizia design, I thought I'd give it a try. What a mistake. Mindless randomness that is suited for very young children. Is there a point here? I was looking for some strategy or tactics, but there is very little, or I just didn't care to look. There is an element of exploring, and treasure exchange similar to Tikal, but that's it. Whatever.

First played August 29th, 2007.  This takes only a few (5) minutes to be taught and is less complicated than what it sounds.  It can be played in an hour as well.  There is perhaps more luck in this than strategy.  You flip over tiles and do actions depending on what the tile is.  Strategy is deciding where to place the tile to maximize points, deciding when to collect certain tiles, and perhaps where to move since you lose a turn moving from one side of the board to another if you run out of tiles where you are.  It's a good light game to play if you need a break from strategy games.  If you need such a game, give it a try if you know someone who has it, otherwise, I wouldn't bother ordering it unless you like it's theme.

RATING: 7
Simple to learn, fun, deceptively strategic. Early on all you do is explore unknown regions and take whatever points are available. As the game progresses you need to look for point opportunities that do not involve exploring new regions. Moving animals and nomads is a great way to pick up an edge on your opponents. Well timed base camps are critical. Keeping track of the gemstones and precious metals rankings adds another level of competition. So, what initially looks like a simple move and explore game, is actually a great multiple-choice system that rewards effective use of your two actions per turn. Granted, often the choices seem obvious. Turning over unknown tiles is exciting. Migrating animals and nomads is fun. Collecting treasures is satisfying. Game play is short. The "Darkest Africa" theme is awesome. This is easily one of my favorite light/medium games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Lots of luck, but enough tactical elements to keep it interesting. I really like the mechanic here (turning over little tokens - there's always the hope that the next one will be a biggie). This was really popular at a family camp we were at recently.

RATING: 5
I acknowledge that this game could potentially be deeper than it first appears, but I'm not sure that I'm disposed to put forth the time and effort to get there.  It feels very light and quick, which I like.  It is a nice family style game that has a pleasantly short play time.  I also like the exploration component, which feels moderately thematic.  But even in a megafiller, I am looking for a little more meat - there are games that play in the same amount of time that engage me more.

Sodaklady did a Geeklist on "comfort games", and this is the perfect example to me- I would never suggest this when meeting with either game group I sometimes play with, and I think many gamers who take themselves seriously would scorn it as too random, lacking in control, not strategic, etc. But it is a perfectly fine game for my wife and I to relax with. The bits are pretty, the game lacks tension, we play it non-aggressively. In that environment, there's nothing wrong with this game, apart from the clunkiness of the rules (for a game that feels simple, it's a big pain to explain).

This was a big dissapointment.  I thought it would say something about the exploration of Africa; maybe even a light version of Source of the Nile, but it's just an abstract set-collecting mathematical exercise.  Should have expected it, from a Knizia game.  Got rid of it at the first opportunity.

One of the lighter games from Reiner that I like. Chits are laid out on a board and on your turn you turn over a couple of chits, dependent on what you turn over you get to collect some points. This is fairly luck based, skill comes in the way you move your explorer to get the best out of them (you do not want to waste turns teleporting about the board) and manouvering Nomads about the board to maximise points. Luck on discovering the right artefacts may be a game decider, however this aside with the number of chits turned over and other point making opportunities the luck usually balances out, though the loser(s) may not always think so.

Seems to me that most times you want to avoid Action A which is solely moving anywhere you want in Africa as it prevents you two opportunities to score.  In a game where the spread is often very little, that can be fatal.  Box is way bigger than it needs, but it is part of the GoldSieber big box line.

What I was hoping for wasn't really here. I love Source of the Nile so I was kind of intrigued at something similar on a light scale. I think the problem lay in the rules. The rulebook had some inconsistencies that crept up several times during the game. It needs some clarifications right out of the box.

12/28/10 Played a three-player game once. 
Africa is an OK game as long as you go into it knowing it will have little resemblance to reality (the "beaming" of animal herds and tribes around. Teleporting explorers to anywhere on the map. Finding a monument gives you another camp.) I'd play it again. But I doubt I'd ever ask for it to hit the table. Its a little too light weight and unrealistic for me to really warm to it.

Wonderfully easy and light exploration game for the whole family. Decisions are often sort of obvious, but the game is fun, nonetheless. Beautiful bits, too.

The game reminds me a lot of the most succesful Finnish board game ever, "Afrikan tähti" ("The Star of Africa") - map of Africa, players roam around on it flipping tokens. The Finnish game was published already in 1951... 

Suggest.

Pretty cool game.  Not too complicated, rules are easy to explain, and younger ones can play and have fun.  However, it can be VERY strategic if so desired and becomes a very interesting game with the right set of players (although much is still left to chance, studious players can chit-count and play probabilistically in later rounds).  One drawback is that there are a LOT of chits to keep track of and risk losing.

Game based largely on luck - it's an exploration/discovery game set in Africa.

Light family game from Knizia. As an explorer in Africa, move, then turn over counters. If an animal counter, score points by herding with other animals. If a gem, build near a mine to try and obtain majority in that gem. Decision making was generally not too tough, optimize your turn wait for the next player. Most of us in the gaming group were disappointed with this Knizia effort.

-- update -- more here than meets the eye.  Yes, there's a fair amount of luck.  Yes, the different methods of scoring are fiddly at first blush, but get past both of those and there are a lot of interesting decisions to be made here.  This is an aggressive exploration game with more than one approach to take.  Best with five.

I appreciate this more and more every time I play it.  There is room for some clever play here if you are willing to play the odds.

I only play this as a 2 or 3 player, which offers a nice gentle flow, with the main decision process being when to balance exploration vs hut and nomad placements. If you're looking for anything else you'll be disappointed, but if you position it as ultra-light tactical affair, you might get good time out of it. The rules are perhaps a bit too long for the lightness, which damages its position in the niche.

I didn't play the rules correctly for over 5 games. Once I finally figured it out, I bumped my rating up one.

Africa is a solid, family game with a nice exploration theme. There is typically one "correct" decision when it comes to taking an action, but that is OK to get the kids to learn how to optimize. Clever players can choose to use their actions to foil the obvious plans of others.

This game offers almost no strategic outlet.  Although it has a large luck element, I think many people fail to realize the simple truth that there is a world of difference in this game between pursuing chances for 3 points and picking a random tile, generally worth 1 or 2 points.  Many small victories determine the winner in this game.  Finally, Africa is short and offers plenty of opportunities for laughter and groans and gotchas.  I enjoy this game and after a few plays I have seen the light in terms of tactical decisions to be made.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Update: a recent play with 2 and the desire to explore has diminished a little. This is mostly due to the 'work' involved to assess the end game variables, just so you can get the dramatic countdown of the monuments. Lost Valley, another exploration game, does this endgame so much better.

Underrated game, has more player interaction and sit-com than Carcassonne IMHO. Even when it's not your turn the game is interesting to watch not only for the humour payoff but also there are evaluations to be made, if you're thinking competitively. Accused as having obvious moves which in some cases is justified, but this helps in keeping the game running at a brisk pace. However, some movement of animals/nomads require evaluating in terms of increasing scoring opportunities for yourself or other players. Other considerations are the order in which to execute both of your actions, as well as how near other explorers are. Randomised set up ensures different patterns occur which makes visual evaluations different, making the game feel fresh and increasing replay value: I haven't tired of the many, many plays yet. One criticism is the slight fogginess in tracking player status: to get the delicious tension of the uncertain game end in a close scoring game you have to compare and evaluate every player's gem/trade good holdings(a simplified and better aspect of this tension is in Lost Valley). This can be mentally unwieldy.I've downgraded by a point as I realize that some players probably feel wrung out by the maths and scoring permutations involved, rather than "seeing" the spacially interesting scoring opportunities. I find the best way to introduce the different actions and scoring is piecemeal:i.e. explain what action/scoring can be done when the tile is turned over;this makes the game less confusing and less long winded than it needs to be. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It really is possible to explore aggressively and not find a single monument.  I guess that's why you start with two. But monuments represent major scoring opportunities and if you get none, you are done.  

I'm a theme guy and the theme in this game is too weak to make up for the flaws.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised based on the designer.  Plenty of other better games of this type and weight.

This is an elegant light game that is perfect for families and kids. The components are gorgeous, especially the big and beautiful board of the African continent with pretty illustrations. It's a pleasure to play this game, not heavy but not entirely without strategy either. The exploration theme is a winner, and its a nice tension when you see what you get by flipping your tiles. An under-appreciated game.

need to try it again, but seems to need some tinkering.  This is one of the few Knizia games that I don't 'get.'  The scoring is probably too complex for the kids, but the game isn't overly engaging for the adults.  Possible that I am missing something, since I've only tried it two or three times, but almost all of the moves seemed obvious.

RATING: 6
Colorful, light, and random.  A family game that has every appearance of delivering a good 'Euro' gaming experience but falls short of that expectation due to an excess of luck and lack of depth. Gem/Gold/Artifact collecting outweighs the other scoring in the game.

An introductory game.

Gorgeous looking board...sad gameplay. A nice bit of family fluff that takes too long in set up and execution for the payoff. Game can also be very abrupt if the Monuments are clustered together. Points are primarily obtained by postioning scoring pieces (animals next to a similar hera and nomads next to empty spaces) and set collecting (artifacts, gems, gold). One of the worst Knizia games I have played for the time and money although it does have a place at some tables due to the intuitive gameplay and lack of hard choices.

Unfairly maligned set-collection game masquerading as an exploration game. Appropriate for the whole family, my gamer friends nonethless enjoy it. Much has been written about the "nonsensical" trading element in the game, but we don't mind. We play with the original rules. Like Goldland, the game suffers if players stick to their own areas; it becomes much more tactical and fun when players fight over territory and jockey to get the best camp placement. Great presentation with a beautiful big board.

--Dec2007-- Quite interesting.  Prior to play, I couldn't imagine how an "exploration game" might work - but it does.

My parents would likely enjoy it, for example.

Africa is a game in which I can't concieve anyone turning down a game.  Its a quick game and the mechanics make it not particularly cutthroat.  As I look at it, the game is about managing luck and knowing where to move in terms of not running out of areas to explore.

A rather pedestrian simple game completely devoid of any excitement or interesting decisions. The best choice seems rather obvious on your turn and then your turn is over. There are plenty of other games to occupy your time with than this game that has very little to do with Africa.

RATING: 6
Relatively simple abstract set collection game very much in line with the typical Knizia design. 

Produced during a time when publishers still thought it a good idea to sell customers lots of air together with a few game components in an obnoxiously oversized box. I look at this mostly empty giant box on my board game shelf and wish I can swap out its contents with the contents of one of my GMT game boxes (which never seem large enough to store all the components)!

This game has a lot going for it.  It's simple and accessible - a perfect family game or introduction to euros.  It plays in less than an hour, and it has an imposing and beautiful board, cool plastic figures and really nice, attractive tokens.  There's lots of different ways to score, and enough decisions to keep gamers interested without overwhelming nongamers.  Altogether, a great game for everyone.

This was my first Knizia game and really spurred my interest in his games.  I really like the fact that there are a lot of ways to score in this game.  I disagree that the optimal play is always obvious.  Or that it is too luck driven.  At any rate, a game I am very happy to own that has played well with anywhere from 2 to 5.

Fun, light Kniza exploration game. Players flip over chits to score, collect (for later scoring), moving into various positions for scoring etc. 

The two-player game works but isn't as cut-throat or tense as a 4 or 5 player game.

Slightly fiddly to set up but quick to play. Great graphic design (what happened to Vohwinkel?). Loads of air in the box. Love the series...shame that Goldsieber is no more...

RATING: 7
Yay!  This really is a nice light enjoyable explorations game, there are a number of fun choices here, and while there is certainly a heavy dose of luck, you can't exclude the value of good decision making here.

I'm impressed by Knizia making a realistic themed game about colonizing Africa -- Dislocating tribes, herding up animals, and pilliaging the land with only ramshackle tent cities to support the locals.  Here comes The Man!

This game sat on my shelf for over a year before I played it, and while I've certainly gotten some good games in I am kind of bummed that this never got the chance to puff it's feathers.

It really is a fantastic quick, almost filler boardgame.  A nice light closer.

Fun game, nice luck factor with exploring combined with enough strategy in getting to move pieces around.  

UPDATE: Started as a 8, but downgrading to a 7 as I can't see myself suggesting that we play this one.

UPDATE #2: Got to finally get around to playing this after it not hitting the table for a long time and it's not bad.  I like the setting in Africa and there are some OK decisions here, but this isn't something I'd want to play too often.

UPDATE #3: Still liking the setting, and I do really think it's got a pretty clever exploration mechanic, even if you've got some choices forced upon you by the luck of the draw.

UPDATE #4: Played it again recently, and I do like the setting. It's overall a simple title that probably still retains a decent rating just from a nostalgia factor.

this is a pretty straightforward set collection game and exploration game.  as with all Knizias, it is more fun than this simple description would have you believe.  

good fun, although i confess that the theme bothers me a little.  displacing nomads makes me feel icky.

RATING: 7
Fun exploration game with enough complexity on the tile flips to keep the game interesting and strategies fluid. The worst part of the game is the setup.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
OK, this is kind of a neat little game. It's a pretty light set-collection game, lighter than I generally prefer, but I wouldn't mind playing it once in a while. The initial exploration stuff is totally random, but I think there are still some interesting decisions to make as you play along. 

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Setup: the board is a hex map of Africa. Randomly place a face down chit in every hex except the 5 start locations. Players each start with 2 base camps, and place their pawn in a different start location. 

Your Turn:
Either move or teleport. 
Teleport: move your pawn to any empty (= hex with no chit) hex or a hex with a face up chit. 
Move: move 0-2 spaces (may not move through other pawns, or onto face down chit). Then, either build a base camp in your space, or act on a chit in one adjacent hex. 
- Chit action: if face down, reveal it and do the associated action. Acting on chits could score you VP (animals, nomads, good/gems -- each score differently), earn you a base camp (monument) or the chit itself (statues). 
- Building a base camp earns you VP or gives you the adjacent gold/gem chits. 

The game ends when the last monument is revealed. That player gets 3VP, then you do final scoring: 
- the players with most/second most gems and good get 10/6 VP for each type
- Statues score in sets: more of one type score more
Most VP wins.

Knizia's games are often criticized for lacking in theme, which doesn't bother me much as long as it plays well.  Africa is interesting in that it's obviously not his best work but does incorporate the theme better than most of his games.  The mechanic of turning over and revealing the tiles did make me feel like I was exploring.  I agree that the rules, while not too difficult, are a bit fiddly for such a light game.  Still, an enjoyable game to play every once in a while.

This has been somewhat unfairly maligned as a too complex family game or a too shallow gamer's game. I think it's a nice set collecting game, vintage Knizia.

This game isn't bad, strictly speaking... it's got some fun things about it. But I think it's really held back by too much luck. Just when to move nomads and when and where to build base camps are important and interesting choices, but that's not quite enough to keep it engaging. I love the visual spectacle of the game and the box though.

RATING: 6
Africa is one of Knizia's more family-friendly designs, if only because it's very tactical, a little bland, and it creates the illusion that luck plays a bigger role than it really does.  The tile flipping and lack of free space limit the choices to a very manageable bunch.  Africa has a horribly written instruction manual, so download a player aid before you start.

A fun family game.  My five year old likes it a lot and we enjoy playing it with her.  With younger players, it can be a puzzle game, where everyone tries to help the active player figure out their highest-scoring move.  We enjoy it more and more every time we play.

Make sure to check out the errata note for the English language translation: http://boardgamegeek.com/article/45740

This is also  good for adults, with both tactical and strategic decisions to be made.

Its an exploration game taking place in Africa.  There is very little actual decision making involved.  Maybe, the good strategy in this game is subtle, and I just didn't uncover it on the first play.  Regardless, I think this game is going to sit in the one play pile.  The game seemed to play you, plus your actual decisions are blind.  The scoring was interesting..... it just didn't seem to be any consistent way to get ahead of the scoring curve.  This was a miss.

It wasn't offensive or aggravating, its just there.

This reminds me a bit of Tally Ho!, in that you're a bit helpless in what turns up during the game.  There are some mechanics to compensate for the randomness, but if you're stuck in an area with lots of monuments, you'll get little chance to score.

It's a light and enjoyable game, but clearly geared to families. In that game space, it works very well. So, a 7 in one context, a 4 for gamers. Any depth seen here is illusory, unless you're really, really interested in eking out fractional advantages over the course of hundreds of plays.

Not Knizia at his best, it's an acceptable game of extremely scarce Strategy, some tactics and quite a lot of luck that you try to tame. I like the way you collect items just a few timew by placing limited research sites.

Africa feels like a transitional game from old school to modern, perhaps just because of the artwork.

Nice family exploration game (I seem to like light exploration games). Lots of luck, but a fair amount of tactics and a tiny bit of strategy in how and when you use your tents. Scoring seems fiddly at first, but my 7 year old understood it completely by the halfway point of her first game, so it really isn't all that complicated.

Despite being mostly an abstract, it has a fun feeling of theme as you play. "Oh! I found another elephant! I'll put him over here with this friends..." :)

Playing again recently I see this is just a colection of Knizia mechanics to be solved tactically (except for using up your base camps in the end game, strategy isn't part of playing this game).

A nice exploration game.  All the games I've played have come out fairly close, so it seems that no matter what tiles you discover, you can still compete.  It seems to me that the best strategy is to take your little "piece" of Africa and discover all of the tiles in that area.  Trying to go from one part of Africa to another in a line (or close to it) doesn't seem to work well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very much luck driven, but then the scoring systems are so well balanced that it almost doesn't matter what you do anyway. As a result scores will be close and the difference will be made by spotting tactical opportunities. 

As a result, it's a very light game, but one with just a few too many rules and too many ways of scoring points to play it with the family. That makes the game fall in a uncomfortable niche of being too luck driven to be enjoyed by gamers, and too meaty for the family.

Despite all it's flaws, I did thoroughly enjoy my one and only session of this game. It's really been a long time since I laughed so much while playing a game. That alone is worth the '7' rating I give for this game.

It seems to have a even balance between luck and strategy in that which tile you uncover is just as important as where you set base camps and move tiles. It has some nice bits and it plays a lot quicker than the stated 60 minutes. At the very least you'll learn some geography while you play.

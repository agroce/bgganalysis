I wanted this game immediately after reading rules.  Gameplay was as good as expected.  I've still got to work a bit on improving movement strategy, but game is still very enjoyable. Excellent portability with VCR case packaging.  Like to see more people give it a try, so eventually, a deluxe edition could be produced.

RATING: 6
Not too organic, not too mechanic, opening, midgame and endgame are quite different from each other. Didn't quite tickle my fancy, but seems to be a very good game.

-------

I enjoy it more now. I like to see it as a cyborg game. See Freeling's definition of games as either organisms or mechanisms. In this one, all pieces move the same, but how they move is quite arbitrary. It's great to see how all those seemingly unrelated movement rules come together beautifully.

Just when you think you've seen all there is to see in the world of abstract games, along comes something like Cannon. Arranging your pieces into several cannons at once is a good way to defend your own city. But the object of the game is to take your opponent's city, which means exposing your precious men to enemy artillery. Well balanced and delightfully tense.

RATING: 8
200 years from now, people will still be playing Cannon.

Finally, a game the deserves the description of 'the simplicity of checkers and the depth of chess'.  Power comes not from movement or piece type, but by formations.  There are a lot of subtle decisions early on that affect the course of the game, giving it a high replayability value.

I wish I owned a high-quality set, one that would look good on my coffee table, worthy of handing down through the family as a treasured heirloom.

There are three aspects of this game that make it play brilliantly.

1. Town placement. Some town placements are more common than others but the option to have different starting positions makes for great replay ability.
2. Cannon movement. What an interesting mechanic for a game.
3. Pawns cannot move backwards unless threatened. Probably the most important mechanic of the game. Players have to play aggressively because pawns are forced to move forwards.

This is an overlooked gem, if there ever was one. A beautiful abstract with extremely short and intuitive rules, and such a complex gameplay. The games are always very short, yet deep and thinky. Since the goal of the game is such a straight forward one, even beginners can start playing meaningful moves right away, yet it takes some while to catch up with all the tactical tidbits. Sometimes the games also come up with some quite surprising comebacks, since having only one free well positioned piece can still be enough to achieve victory. And the games really vary according to the starting town positions, so there's also a lot of variation.  If you're an abstract lover, you must really do yourself a favour and try this masterpiece.

Seven plays. I really like it. It's chess-like, but because of the limitations on the pieces' movement it feels more focused somehow. Pieces can't simply jump around the board in the same way and so the endgame moves more quickly.

RATING: 7
A very cool and simple checkers variant (not so much like chess) where a row of three pieces is a cannon and can kill pieces at a distance without moving!  A couple other differences but essentially that is the game, each player places a "town" at his end of the board which is immobile. First player to capture or "shoot" the others town wins. 

I think you can play with a regular checkers board or maybe a GO board.  Some little clever moves possible since cannons can move together as a group and possibly setup another cannon in the process, even moving sideways which opens it up a little.  A very tight game where a mistake will cost you, more so then some other abstracts since this is fairly simple and there shouldnâ€™t be too many mistakes.  Mostly tactical and dynamic (some planning but maybe too dynamic for longer term) and limited depth compared to any of Burm's games or Chess, some here though and you do need to consider your moves carefully.  Games are fast too like maybe 20 Minutes which is nice

Cannons are COOL and fun! Also the retreat option is pretty nifty too and gives you nice options when being attacked, it can even help you.

[u]Tidbit[/u] - Oct 09 - Im thinking of a variant where "two's" can move like cannons but not shoot like them. This might really open it up more.... I might have to try this. I'm also not sure about the rule when I guy gets to the end of the board and just becomes immobile, seems like he should at least get to move sideways since he got across. 

Update - 6.5 => 7 Okay there is a little more here than seen on first blush, this often happens with abstracts. Takes a couple games to see the trickier moves, or at least a couple "slower" games since it can be easy to play quickly and miss them at first. It looks like getting about 9 guys together close to your town might be a strong strategy that gives maximum flexibility. The ability to move backwards through the cannons does open it up and allows some longer term planning.  Cannons almost make it seem like a sea battle, especially on the computer with the sound. There is some sneaky stuff here...heh cool game.

A clever abstract that is easy to make at home. A friend and I played it a dozen times, but got absorbed in Go again, which shelved Cannon. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A new abstract strategy game that feels new but also feels "classic". (Reminds me of Summoner War too.)  Neat how the movement and capture abilities are determined by patterns of pieces rather than types of piece. The variety of ways you can be captured; the forward only movement, with exception of retreat and cannon rolls; the forming-and-unforming, and blocking of cannons--all this variety keeps you on your toes and gives you challenging options. Plays so short I think it's easy to go too fast and not plan ahead. Liked it live and also AI at boardspace. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A clever crossing game where formations matter, somewhat related to Murus Gallicus or Epaminondas. Interesting situations develop once your pieces start gunning at each other. I'm slightly concerned that rolling cannons back and forth reduces the importance of zugzwang, but I don't know if this is a problem in practice.

RATING: 6
After more games of this I have realised that I should never be left to defend a city.  I really can't get this game.

Like a nervous trapese artist, if you don't get to grips with this quickly you are going to come crashing down to the ground very quickly.

What looks like an early arcade game delivers a new kind of pain which for for some abstract fans can become very addictive. The direct assault of your opponents pieces and the nullifying of their cannons can produce some heated moments.  I so far have not won a game of this and honestly have difficulty picking the tactics and strategy up but my opponent does so, in contradiction to my arguments, is some real depth to the game.  If you fancy this try first before buying.

Extremely good modern abstract game.  The difference between a winning and a losing position can be very subtle and difficult to spot.  When playing turn based on Super Duper Games, I found myself spending hours on some turns trying to work out the possibilities.

Probably my favorite "obscure" game.

Rediscovered it after a while. I still think that it rewards aggressive play, but now I see that there are more defensive options than I thought. One of the 4-5 most interesting abstracts out there (and I know a lot of them !)

RATING: 7.5
I don't really do [gameid=171], but Cannon has a very attractive tension between preservation of material and positioning... which I am sure I will never grok. Still, fun. Cannon formation provides a concrete goal, so while a good degree of look-ahead is necessary, it's not *just* look-ahead.

I should add that I am now the owner of a nice wooden Cannon set, thanks to Unic, who won the Cannon tournament at superdupergames.org, and put up half of his prize for a random drawing. So I can tell people, "this was part of the prize for winning the Cannon tournament at superdupergames". Also thanks to dralius for running the tournament, (and incidentally designing Cannon) and to Striton for running superdupergames.

A suberb and elegant game, fascinating and enormous fun to play.  I own the neat original "VCR Box" version, the deluxe Blue Panther acryllic set as well as their wooden edition, and the  beautiful NestorGames version.  

Updated from 9 to 10.  My favorite game, Cannon deserves to become a classic.

[Update] Wish more people knew of this genius game, so I could play even more often!

Love this game! Have a homemade set consisting of a Shogi board and XiangQi pieces. Played on SDG and Boardspace many times and find the game play challenging and engaging. It's a blood-filled race game at heart. A lot of attack, counterattack, and positional maneuvering goes on in order to be the first to sack your opponents town!

Simple and clean abstract strategy game.  Rules are quick to pickup and the strategy can be very deep.  I look forward to delving further into this game.

RATING: 7
Good abstract strategy game. Sort of Chess-like (kill the stationary enemy town on the back row) with a single type of moving piece, but 3-in-a-row of them form a "cannon" which can shoot targets 2 or 3 squares away, and also move as a unit (giving you effectively 3 moves in 1 turn).

It is also realistically possible to win even if you are behind on material (which is a satisfying win!) - position and maneuver are very important!

I mostly play online at Super Duper Games.

One of those games i perceive they are good somehow but i still dont like. 
Rules are simple and there's a good amount of strategy to be used.
I fear nevertheless all the games will result a bit all the same..
One thing i like is a sort of subtle theme: to operate a cannon you need 3 men and you can hit only from a certain distance.
What i really dont like is the developement and the slowliness of the game.

The game is quick, agressive and elegant... but there is too much to see in the board positions for me to have a natural handle on the game right now (hence the low rating...).

2010-08-19 [b][bgcolor=#99ffff]â€‚7â€‚[/bgcolor][/b] Tricky, very unforgiving game.  What's great about that is that it pushes the game to a quick end.

Novel racing game which requires some planning ahead, and thus feels quite thematic.  One minor flaw is that turn order seems to give a slight advantage.  Unfortunately the game isn't interesting enough to warrant multiple plays to balance this out.

What a SMASHINGLY great game! Simply one of the best racing games I've had the pleasure of playing in a very long time. The mechanic is simple, but novel. The "feel" is just like driving a rally car, if you could draw such an analogy from moving a piece of plastic on a board.

The modular boards can create myriad course configurations, but each stage isn't really all that long. A nice press your luck mechanic works very well, with the only niggle being that rolling one die at a time is just a WEE BIT tedious. Overlooking this, it's an EXCELLENT play! Highly recommended!

1st play: I don't watch a lot of racing, but my favorite kind of racing is rally racing.  The cars flying around corners, drifting through mud and snow, it feels so frantic and the courses are so crazy they need a co-pilot to warn them of what kinds of turns are coming up.  Unfortunately the game isn't quite as exciting.  We played the same track 3 times in a row (Time Trial) and by the 3rd time, I felt like we had played out the dice rolling mechanic.  It's essentially reverse yahtzee with some theme thrown in.  The game is simple, and I'd be happy to play it again, but I won't seek it out.

2nd play: A lot better on the second play as I had a stronger understanding of how important the gears are, how jumps worked and generally the flow of the game.  It's still a dice chucker and most of the decisions are pretty obvious.  I like the theme and find it fun enough to play if suggested.

A surprisingly accurate simulation of rallye races. It might be better than Formula D, design wise, but I feel it lacks a bit in the "confrontational" aspect. I'd say it evens out and I like both games as much as the other.

Nice racing game with simple rules. Gameplay is quite engaging and thematic. It really feels like a WRC race with each driver competing against time. The game is perfectly suited for organising series of races. A championship. 



Το Rallyman είναι ένα racing επιτραπέζιο με θέμα τους δημοφιλείς αγώνες WRC. Το διαφορετικό σε αυτούς τους αγώνες ράλι είναι πως δεν ανταγωνίζεσαι όλους τους αντιπάλους ταυτόχρονα μέσα σε πίστα αλλά αντιθέτως τρέχεις μόνος και σημειώνουμε τον χρόνο που χρειάστηκες για να διανύσεις την κάθε ειδική διαδρομή. Νικητής φυσικά είναι αυτός που θα κάνει τον λιγότερο συνολικό χρόνο.

Στο επιτραπέζιο έχουν περάσει το θέμα πολύ ωραία. Έχεις όλη τη διαδρομή μπροστά σου για να μελετήσεις γενικά το πώς θα κινηθείς και με τι ταχύτητα θέλεις να περάσεις από κάθε στροφή. Καθώς προχωράς ανεβάζοντας ή κατεβάζοντας ταχύτητες στο κιβώτιο ρίχνεις σταδιακά και τα ζάρια για να δεις αν όλα είναι ΟΚ. Τα ζάρια έχουν κάποιες πλευρές με το σήμα του κινδύνου οπότε αν φέρεις συνολικά 3 κινδύνους τότε χάνεις τον έλεγχο του αυτοκινήτου με κίνδυνο να φας damage. Αυτό δίνει ένα αίσθημα push your luck καθώς όταν φτάσεις στους 2 κινδύνους νιώθεις ένα σφίξιμο.

Υπάρχουν φυσικά και κανόνες για επιθετική οδήγηση (με σαφώς μεγαλύτερο βαθμό κινδύνου), 2 ειδών επιφάνειες (άσφαλτος, χιόνια), 2 τύποι ελαστικών και 4 ταμπλό διπλής όψεως που σου επιτρέπουν να φτιάξεις άπειρες διαφορετικές διαδρομές (πολύ καλή δουλειά). Προτείνω βέβαια να κατεβάσετε τις επίσημες διαδρομές που χρησιμοποιούν και στα πρωταθλήματα Rallyman. Όχι τίποτα άλλο αλλά για να μπορείτε να συγκρίνετε τους χρόνους σας με τους βετεράνους. 

Το παιχνίδι παίζει μέχρι 4 άτομα αλλά είναι τέτοια η φύση του που ταιριάζει πολύ καλά και σε σόλο καταστάσεις. Είναι κάπως υπολογιστικό το gameplay του και δεν έχει τον χαβαλέ που πιθανώς να περιμένει κάποιος από ένα racing παιχνίδι. Ξεχάστε κλεισίματα και προσπεράσεις. Εδώ νικητής θα είναι αυτός που θα έχει το θάρρος (και την τύχη) να πιέσει το αυτοκίνητο στα όρια του, προσπαθώντας να γλυτώσει δευτερόλεπτα.

Έριξα μια ματιά και στο expansion και θεωρώ πως είναι must buy καθώς ολοκληρώνει την εμπειρία. Προσθέτει τις χωμάτινες διαδρομές (απαραίτητες για το ράλι Ακρόπολις) καθώς και καινούργιους τύπους ελαστικών. Κακώς κοίταξα το expansion γιατί τώρα νιώθω πως το βασικό είναι λιγάκι λειψό.

Αξιόλογο racing παιχνίδι με απλούς κανόνες και πολύ καλή προσέγγιση του θέματος. Βαθύτερο από ότι δείχνει. Το αρκετά solitaire gameplay του μάλλον δεν ταιριάζει σε όλους όμως, οπότε try before you buy.

RATING: 10
Fantastic game that does capture the feel of attacking a rally stage.  You can choose to either roll dice singly or all at once but if you roll 3 (or less depending on tyre choice) warning signs you risk spinning off and damaging your car.  If you succeed, the rewards are great and you can get a far lower time than a more cautious player  This adds tension to the game and really does give the feeling of pushing your car hard through the course.

There are a number of brilliant on-line challenges including on BGG's 1 Player Guild and the Facebook Solitaire Racers group.  Just a pity that the "Official" chamnpionship is ran exclusively by hypocrites and cheats who play to different rules

Fabulous game, full stop.  

Very few race games manage to capture the theme of racing as well as this game does.  It puts all other race games to shame.  

A nice combination of forward planning for the perfect run coupled with a element of luck.  

The unique use of gears to determine timing across stages encourages a degree of risk-taking.  The multi-speed corners allows you to drive conservatively or aggressively.  Played over several stages, the game plays quite fast and with the right crowd is riotous fun.

A brilliant game for followers of rally sport and a must have for lovers of race games.

Good fun racing game although technically probably not great. The idea of gear changes and short cuts facilitates scoring, but rolling hazards and crashing can be amusing. A high degree of luck involved as it centres around the dice rolls.

Especially the solo puzzle. 
I participate since begin 2015 at the SGOYT Rallyman cup (organized by [geekurl=/user/ShaunGamer/] ShaunGamer [/geekurl]).
When I have sufficient experiences with the base game I like  to enter the next stage by playing the Dirt expansion. The original Dirt expansion is out of print. But the light version from the game author is a very good alternative. See my [geekurl=/article/18793377/] Rallyman Light comment [/geekurl].

Dice game meets racing game. Easy, engageing and a lot of fun. Roll a number of dice depending on what gear your on. If you roll 3 missfires you loose time and risk crashing. After each turn you take a timecard depending on what gear you end on, lower gears means more time. You win the game on completing the track in the least amount of time, not being the first player to reach the goal.

If you enjoy racing and especially if you enjoy Rally style racing, this is a fantastic game.  The mechanisms are odd and there is no way to equate them to real driving.  Are the black numbered dice gears?  not really.  Are the white dice really only acceleration?  not really.  No matter how you slice it, the dice are just strange.  BUT in the end, everything comes together and the game really really shines as a rally race game.  Staggered starts, variable weather / road conditions, car damage and crashes, flat tires, - check, check, and check.  Played over several stages its a real fun little game.  For its unique feel, this game needs to be played.  For fans of rally racing - its a win.

Got this for free at my local gaming store.   Played it once solo using the basic rules.  I need to play it more to give it a fair chance.  I mostly got it to participate in 1-Player Guild Rallyman challenges.

Well-made components, original and interesting game design concept, well-written rule book for the most part, although I did need to look on BGG for some clarifications.

Simple rules, complex behavior. Easily my favorite racing game. Probably best with 1-3 players, four drags a bit much. Players should be encouraged to play quickly and not study the board, otherwise AP sets in. So, with the wrong group this rating can fall but with the right group, a great game.

Altough the theme doesn't get me I rather liked it.  Difficult to get a good view of the scoring of the players.  In my game, I really had the idea that I was going to win, but finished second anyway.

RATING: 7
Rating based on introductory play with just basic technique used (without Time Attack) but still even in this streamlined version it was fun. It was especially strange to understand that it's not necessary to cross the finish line first but rather to does it in the shortest time frame and those two need not to be correlated. I can see that with time attack technique it can be even more interesting game as it would add another dimension of risk managment. One complaint would be that the game can slow down significantly had players analyze things too thoroughly thus detracting from a race feel, which should be fast and furious, sort of.

RATING: 5
I am not the greatest fan of race games, and while Rallyman is quite unusual in its class, it didn't impress me.
The game is clever and I appreciate its mechanics, but it quickly degenerates into a luck-based dice fest: after planning the best course, everybody must go on time attack mode, then the player who got the best rolls can begin play safely until someone else recovers thanks to time attack, then the leader begins to time attack again...
The first games are funny while one learns the system, but everything quickly fades in a quite boring luck-dependant diceroll party...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I was expecting a LOT more. big downtime, and the decisions seemed very obvious/trivial. as such VERY random - everyone should play almost exactly same moves, until someone gets very unlucky with dicerolls or card draws, when suddenly he is very far behind. being slightly better is insignificant compared to the need to not be slightly less lucky with dice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial Impressions: This fun race game is part puzzle and part "push your luck". There's a large amount of variety based on the tracks and weather conditions. Since the game is based on amount of time to the finish line, it sometimes feels a little bit solitaire. Racing a season adds another layer of challenge, as your stats and car condition affect the next race. This is one of the best racing games I've played. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Very original racing game. Even after finish you're not sure who won the race. We had a very exciting and tense first play. This game is made by a rally-lover and you can feel it.

RATING: 9
My new favorite racing game.  Excellent risk/reward mechanic for the time attack, really gets the feel of a rally race, and the rules are easy to teach even for a non-gamer.  Also, great support from the designer.  Looking forward to an expansion and maybe even some more detailed rules for weather and tires.

To get the full effect you should play with all the "advanced" rules, and honestly they are very easy to grasp.  Without them there is not much tension or variation in strategy.  The component quality is FANTASTIC for an independently produced game, and the modular boards provide a ton of replay value.  Also, this is a great solo game - each track is a puzzle, and usually not an easy one, so playing to beat your best time is both fun and a challenge.
  
If you are a fan of racing games, you should own this!

Really enjoyed the solo run through so far. At first glance it doesnt feel like you have many options on your turn. If you have the balls you can push your luck so hard that you MIGHT roll exactly what you were after. I do like that if you are a risk taker you do get a reward even if you fail. These rewards let you preselect your dice without rolling or you could save these rewards and use them to take seconds (or minutes) off your time! Keeper.

RATING: 8.5
Basically this is a push your luck game with a very strong racing theme. You could just take no risk every turn and finish in an avarage time. Or you could take risks, varying from small ones to insanely big ones to gain seconds. You can subtract these seconds from your final time or use them to buy of later risky moves. The dice mechanic is clever and therefore it can be forgiven that it does not fit the theme that well. The rallyfeel of racing for time is very much present and cleverly implemented in the game. I also feel that players have much more influence on their result than in formula D. Other big pro is that it can be played with a low number of players and still be fun. Components are good and replayability is high due to the large number of tracks you can create and the different weather conditions. Solid racing game and a must try for racing fans.

An exciting push your luck racing game that has a much different feel than Formula De.  The way you collect time cards is pretty unique for a race game.

This reminded me a little of a souped-up version of an old Waddington's game called Formula 1. More depth and options though. The mechanism of using gears to score times etc is clever.

If you search for something Special and not another dice roler, dungeon crawler etc... this is the right game. It even beats so many racing games, as not the first Player wins, but the one with the fastest time. And there are on each turn so many possiblities To drive differently.
Even after 7 years there is still the online league running where you can compare your results with other Players. You can build so many different tracks, the designer did so many things right.
What you finally Need is the Dirt Expansion to have the full Rally Feeling with tire decisions, different grounds and gear shifting. You can get Dirt online from the Homepage... in light Version...but still good enough.

RATING: 4
Nothing dramatically wrong with this - but it feels mostly multiplayer solo.

Of course the theme is also multiplayer solo, you're in a time-trial race rather than a traditional race.

Major interaction is messing up the track for those following, all of which means its just better to go first!

My interest quickly waned, push your luck mechanism didn't add much, and I suspect with some this will generate AP hell (trying to work out which is optimal high gear but less dice or moving further but ending in a lower gear).

All in all, would play again if someone else desperately wanted too, but zero desire to own.

Un juego de rallies. Cronometrado por tramos. El tablero es modular y combinando los cuatro o seis tableros que trae se pueden conseguir miles de tramos distintos. Tiene un modo básico de juego que resulta algo soso. Es preferible jugar al modo avanzado que incluye segundos extra (tiradas simultáneas de dados), saltos, distintos tipos de terreno, neumáticos, etc. Cada marcha corresponde a un dado. En cada dado se puede dar un problema. Al tercer problema en un turno, el coche se sale de pista y puede perder capacidades. Al final de cada turno, el jugador coge una carta que simboliza el tiempo invertido. El valor de la carta depende de la marcha en que ha quedado el coche.
Es bastante entretenido, aunque hay poca interacción entre jugadores. No obstante, se trata de una prueba cronometrada, no una carrera. En mi opinión es mejor que le FormulaD

A great game system that conveys the feel of Rally racing in good fashion.  Works equally well as a solitaire game or multiplayer game, since you are racing against the clock.

All things considered, a brilliant game design.

I'm a huge fan of race games, so as usual for race games, I liked this one quite a bit.  The feeling here is a lot different than other racing games in that you're not trying to cross the finish line first, but rather finish with the lowest time, which is determined by gear cards you acquire.  Each card adds so many seconds to your time, with higher gears adding less time than lower ones.

The only frustrating thing in my first game was that the staggered start did not work well.  Near the end of the race, all of the cars had caught each other, and the track was continually blocked by the cars up front.  I think this was a fluke in our game, but I'm pretty sure this situation wasn't meant to happen.  One of the players had set up to win the game, only to see the track blocked and his plans ruined continually, which I don't think really fits the rally theme, where cars should be spread out.

Overall, a clever and innovative racing game though with plenty of options for risk taking and clever maneuvering.  Good stuff!

It's a racing game that works unlike most other racing games I ever played.
Using less dice to move less spaces each turn is often the better strategy here as it means you'll get better times and run less risk of losing control in time attacks.

So taking more turns might actually win you the game!
Sounds strange, but it works.

And it's a fun game with a twist on the whole racing mechanic as you start off staggered and don't race for positions but rather for the best time.

Full disclosure:  I love rally racing.  I bought a Mitsubishi Evo because I love rally racing (not that I will ever do it).  I also like math-based strategy problems.  Yes, there are "optimal lines" through every map -- but those optimal lines can only be taken by chance.  So, the question, as with any good game with a chance element, is whether or not you have the stones to try to stick it out to 5th gear when you're staring down two hazards -- knowing you're either going to shave 10 precious seconds off your final time, or you're going to end up in a ditch and lose an extra 40 seconds?  Or do you wuss out and stay in 4th gear, take the extra 10 seconds...  And what does that do to your planning for the next turn coming up?  Do you even contemplate going for the time attack with five dice... six dice... seven dice?  You gotta ask yourself...  Do you feel lucky, punk?  Well, do you?  Awesomesauce.

Good "Press Your Luck" kind of racing game. Amusing though not my favourite racing game. I still think Speed Circuit is the best racing game. But it is much better than Formula De IMO. More to it then just picking one die and moving your car.

Very well presented and great components. Very cool movement mechanic with dice and the resulting time cards. The perfect blend of strategy, push-your-luck, luck, and fun.

The upcoming dirt expansion is a must have.

A 110% rally! Rallyman is a very unique design. As the players are competing on being the fastest (instead of being the first to finish) Rallyman does occasionally feel like a solitaire game, as there are only a few ways to affect your opponents. The choice between aggressive and safe driving is an interesting one although at this point it does feel like aggressive driving is almost always the better choice. Great components too.

The best of all the racing games I have tried. Only one play so far, but so much fun! I think this is the best of the Essen 2010 crop so far.  Not deep that is for sure, but a brilliant implementation of push your luck, with a two turn horizon of planning (you can make allowances for further on) which makes for a fast paced exciting game. Looking forward to additional plays.

Joguei e gostei bastante. Para quem curte jogos de corrida esse jogo merece ser visto. RALLYMAN simula uma disputa de RALLY de maneira incrível, com muitos detalhes característicos, mas é necessário bastante desapego a jogos como FORMULA D e RACE! FORMULA 90 pois não há uma competição direta (sem ultrapassagens, sem vácuo, pouco gerenciamento de recursos), trata-se de uma competição solitária onde seu maior oponente é você mesmo.
Considere bastante a expansão DIRT, ela acrescenta DEMAIS ao jogo.

RATING: 8
A quite clever implementation which does seem to reflect rallying's specific attributes very well.
The disjoint between a car's position on the board and the time its actually consumed to get there creates a bit on confusion at first. Tracking time via a track (ala Around the World in 80 Days) could help, but just taking a card is a simple solution.
The handling of short cuts, spin outs, snow, punctures, damage, jumps and corners are all clever in the way they reflect reality without getting bogged down in administration.
Its a more "thinky" game than Formula D and its ilk, involving more planning. But its straight forward and fun to play and the down time wasn't too bad for a race game.

A clever push your luck rally racing game. It succeeds in conveying the feeling of rally stage racing, which is no easy task. It has many layers of depth, but almost no unnecessary complexity, and despite the luck it has many ingenious mechanisms to give the player a very high level of control in choosing the next path, the suitable speed, and the risk that one is going to take.

RATING: 8
Excellent race game with some novel mechanics that really fit the theme.

It could be regarded as a push your luck game (a la Pass the Pigs) but it manages to be a lot more - best played without too much analysis of every move.

Boards, dice and cards nicely produced - a little more could have been done with the cars themselves, but the marker tokens and the time bonus tokens are a bit naff and overproduced respectively.

Am thinking of playing using a timer - should definitely be played fast with no AP.

This game is Rally Car racing in a board game.  It has very little randomness and when there is randomness, you have made the decision to push your luck.  You choose the length of game and it is super simple to teach.  This has got to be the best racing game out there.

RATING: 10
Players are rally drivers trying to navigate their cars around preset courses as quickly as possible. Brilliant, fast playing game where the active player rolls a gear die per space moved. The catch is you can only roll each gear once per turn but can pad them out with two accelerator dice. There are speed limits on corners and bumps as well as rules for tyres and snow. The game is measured in time taken to complete a stage, and time is measured by what gear you ended your turn in. The risk is built into the dice - the dice either have one or two "!" symbols on them; roll three of those in a turn and you're off the road with bits falling off your car.  The onus is on the driver to roll the dice one at a time, stopping when you're getting nervous - or you can just stick them in your fist and roll them altogether (picking up time chits for each die rolled - subtracted from your time at the end of the stage or spent to avoid disasters down the road).  Clever and punchy, and it really does feel like rally driving - especially working the throttle skidding around a hairpin and accelerating away. Thematically brilliant - so easy to forget this is actually a puzzle to solve, and not an easy one.  Easily the best car boardgame I've tried, and I've tried a lot.  Caveats - downtime with 4 players is a problem, especially with analytical types - shines solo or 2 player, and recently three players games have been fun too - possibly the sweet spot?  Lots of goodies included on the Rallyman site - Rally Events, variants, etc.  Well done, great game. 

2012 update - still playing the tyres off this one.  It's taken 12 months to actually begin to approach good at this game, based on the pro's times posted at the designer's WRC forums.  Sure, I could play the pants off it, and "solve" the various sections, but why kill the fun?  Upgraded to the 2011 edition, with the fantastic dashboards and smaller cards.  Best motor-sport game ever.

I'm not a huge fan of racing games, but this one is different.   The staggered start and the fact that you are racing against the clock, and only indirectly against each other, are key differences.   It is essentially just a push-your-luck dice game.  You can decide how far you want to go by risking more dice.   The itty-bitty cars are cute, but the tracks could have been larger and so could have the cars.

[2 plays] I think the problem with this game is that if you make a mistake or are unlucky early on, then you just have to play it out knowing there's no way to catch up.  And the game isn't played over enough of a long run that everyone is sure to have accidents. Indeed, the more other players blunder, the more incentive you have to be superconservative. I don't like it when you win a game just by not falling off the tightrope.

The implementation of the theme is superb, but outcome is more down to luck than skill (the probability of crashing seems too low to make it worth NOT risking a time run), there is very little player interaction and there is a lot of downtime, especially for the last player to start in a four-player game.  Probably better with 1-2 players.

Buen juego de carreras, de mecánica push your luck: tú decides si arriesgas o no, por lo que carece de la influencia del azar que sí tiene el Formula D.

Enjoyable. Successful mechanism to simulate rally driving rather than motor racing. Fairly fast decision making but a lot of down time waiting for your turn. However, the staggered start works in the game and as a recreation of real rally driving, so adding to the thematic feel of the poor. Teeny tiny cars and graphics, finished boards have a slightly amateurish look. But I did enjoy it and could be persuaded to play again. Way better than Formule De for example.

Upon request, a friend sent me this from Essen 2010.

Awesome race game that features less luck and more control than Formula D, even though still controlled by dice. You can use a stronger luck element, but that is your choice.  

The winner is not necessarily the first to cross the finish line, but the one who does it in the shortest time, and this is not clear until the end of the game which consists of three stages.  

A driver can be aggressive or conservative, take chances, modify his tires for varying weather conditions, and try to inhibit the other drivers. 

Rulebook is well-written, well-illustrated, and easy rules are only 6 pages.  Components are nice.  The 4 boards are double-sides (one side asphalt, the other snow), & according to something I read, can be configured 600 ways.  There are a lot of nice, little touches in this game such as the positioning of cars in a skid around corners and tokens that are notched for stacking.

There is an advanced game, and a variant.

There is also a circuit generator online on a French site--My Windows 7 Media Player wouldn't allow use--possibly because of the language?

Only 4 players, so the game is fast.  With the special Essen car, I have 6 cars, but I don't think there are enough cards to play more than 4, and parts of the track might get too congested. Still would like to at least try playing with more.

A game that truly captures the mechanics and spirit of rallye racing.  I played through a couple of stages by myself and it works in solitaire play just fine.  But the game really shines with multiple players. The rules are clear enough so one experienced player can get a bunch of first timers playing with a quick run through of the rules and mechanics. 

My only real complaints about the game are the teeny tiny pieces and lack of any trays in the box for storage.  That is easily remedied with a small parts organizer and a few rubber bands.

Oh man, I wanted to like this.

A racing game that had somewhat more favourable gamers reviews than Formula D, a bit less luck, a bit less AP supposedly, less finger counting...

But no, it still suffers from all of the above, I don't feel like I'm in control of the car, just chucking dice in response to optimum moves. It feels like each stage can be 'solved', and the car pieces are so small (doesn't sound important, yet it makes an impact).

Shame. My hunt for a simple but excellent race game continues.

Rallyman is a racing game without a lot of player interaction. True to its theme, players mostly race along the track on their own, racing the clock rather than the other players. The game is heavily tactical, so much so that it often seems like a puzzle to get your gears in proper order.

The most gamey elements are those that allow you to press your luck a little in order to squeeze out a few more seconds. When that misfires the results can be devastating, and that's the main reason why driving just a single stage doesn't really do the game justice. Over the course of several stages the luck of the dice doesn't play such a big role.

The movement system used in Rallyman is nice. It's a bit unintuitive when you start first, cross the finish line last, and still end up with the best time, but that just emphasizes that it's the clock that needs to be beaten. Of course that also means that it can get rather lonely at times.

It's a fun little race game where taking some risk on rolling the die can change the outcome. When you roll the die one at a time you don't gain as much time but you also avoid the risk of sliding off the road.

You can damage your cars by sliding off the road, getting flats by taking short cuts, etc. Fun to tinker with solo too just to see if you can beat your scores. 

I can see a bit of die throw copy from multiple players racing here but it can be offset by having players start the race by taking double turns one at a time. That way all players are 2 turns behind the player in front of them. There's also less chance of overtaking. It can be fun either way though. 

There are 4 boards that can be flipped for a total of 8 boards. There are snow Rally on one side and no snow Rally on the other side. Each side of the board has multiple Rally sections that can be connect any way you like to form thousands of different Rally setups.

A different kind of dice fest. You are either conservative or a risk taker with the dice.  With risk comes reward or misfortune in terms of the time card that you take into your hand.  The lowest sum of time card values determines the winner.  Watch the video for a more complete rundown of this game. Not very much strategy, mostly tactics that include risk management.  A whole bunch of fun.  You do not need to know anything about Rally style racing to enjoy this game.  If you do know about Rally racing you will appreciate how well the game fits the theme.

Rallyman is a goog racing game in which you try to cross the finish line with the fastest time.  

You move your car using dice but it's not as random as you might tink.  There is a lot of strategy in this game.  
You can throw dice one by one and stop when you think it's too risky to continue.  You can also use "time attack" and throw all the dice at once to save a few seconds but with a greater risk of losing control.
You have to plan ahead at which gear you're gonna take the next turn.  Are you going to use the inside of the curve at a slowest speed or skid on the outside at a faster speed?  Some corner also have shortcut (that are taken at a fast speed) but are you going to use it and risk a flat tire that will bother you for the rest of the race?  Or maybe throw dirt on the curve and disturb the other players behind you?

After each of your turn, you take a card corresponding to the gear you've finish your turn on.  Those cards are all the same for a particular gear (all the 1 gear cards adds 50 seconds to your time, all the 2 cards adds 40 seconds, etc.).  At the end of the game you calculate your time and the player with the fastest time wins!

A really excellent racing game that is very different from any other racing game I've played. Instead of jockeying each other for position on the track, each player is attacking the track and racing against the clock. Aggressive moves can be rewarding, but also offer a fair amount of risk. The dice-rolling represents the risk, not necessarily the speed, which makes a huge difference.

I appreciate it when press-your-luck games make each toss of the dice (or pull of a tile, or draw of a card, or whatever) dependent on other factors, and Rallyman's necessity of planning future turns on the track does that beautifully.

Rallyman is a rally game that is reminiscent of Corné-style design. In other words, it's a really cool  game that uses older mechanics in fresh ways (e.g., roll-and-move here) and draws inspiration from its thematic setting. As with rally driving, you are provided with difficult decisions around playing it safely through the course (by rolling one dice at a time) or driving a bit more recklessly to cut precious seconds (rolling all dice at once, earning a precious second for each dice rolled). Each dice rolled moves you forward one space on the track -- and allows you to finish in a higher gear (meaning that your turn technically lasts a shorter stretch, represented with a time card that you add up at the end of the round). Despite the delayed starting times, cars can still run interference with one another. But most importantly, your car's chassis and tires are important "resources" to consider in light of how long a series of courses are and whether or not you have pitstops between them! Count this alongside Powerboats for new ways to use old mechanics in race games.

This was a play-to-win at Geekway to the West 2011. I haven't played much racing games, so there isn't much context to compare to. Nevertheless, this game was so boring that our group (our tastes are along the lines of Brass) called it quits after two rounds. There are some interesting ideas here, with gear selection, die-rolling, and traction, but the physics of racing is over simplified that I couldn't take it seriously. The downtime overstayed its welcome, with the staggered racing mechanic, where each racer drove by themselves, interspaced by some time interval. This became multi-player solitaire, where there was very little, if any, player interaction. This is acceptable in a game like Merchant of Venus, which is a design I enjoy, but not in a racing game, where I expect blocking, drafting, lane changing, and the like. Since the game is a rally, and not a race in the sense that I was expecting, the object is to get the best time. Thus, this didn't work for me or our group.

Update (06/05/12): Who am I kidding? I am never going to play this again. It's a '2'.

A revolution for the race games. For anyone used to play formula Dé or other race games it's absolutely counterintuitive, yet, the more you think about it, the more you feel that this is absolutely the right way to simulate a rally race. Really a very very good job, also well supported by tha author. I appreciate expecially the puzzle feeling of the Shakedown Rally...

Fun race game? Push your luck, therefore a good dose of luck therein of course.  One hour?

I thought that it's pretty obvious how to drive and the result might just be a matter of luck. But then I played a rally and compared my results to other people results and I realized, that mastering rallyman is not so simple and in fact it's quite a deep game.

RATING: 6.5
It felt fairly puzzly in a good way. It was mostly a really fun puzzle game but with this weird little randomness wrinkle that killed it for me. Basically if you get very unlucky your time might just increase by about a minute (where some of the shorter tracks will take less than 2 minutes). Basically it's a competitive puzzle but also every turn you roll some dice and on a very bad roll you automatically lose. Terrible mechanic in an otherwise solid game.

Very nice driving game which is different from most in that (like rallying) it's not a first-past-the-flag circuit race but who can get through the stage in the shortest time.

Uses dice-for-gears movement system a little like Formula De but with less luck. You roll one die for each gear you use, plus up to two wild dice, but the dice have hazard symbols on them - roll three hazards in one turn and you spin out which costs a load of time and can damage your car. The value of the last dice rolled determines how much time your turn cost you.

You can roll the dice in one go (riskier, but nets you a time bonus) or one by one (safer in that you can stop rolling after rolling two hazard symbols if you like, but no time bonus).

Only two solo plays so far to get the rules (but it works well solo) but is in danger of becoming my favourite motorsport game (sorry Speed Circuit!)

RATING: 8
A thoughtful race game that provides real options and decision points on your turns with ways to cut your time by taking bigger risks. Do you move slower on the track to maintain lower-time count cards or do you push through, often in lower gears, to collect higher times but less cards in total? The outcome of your decisions are hard to foresee, but it is clear that there is never one correct answer. You need to play this with all of the rules for this game to shine. And shine it does. 

After playing this, I was suddenly fine with getting rid of all those Formula De tracks which I held for so many years...

RATING: 7
Un juego de deportes que de verdad parece un juego de deportes. Las mecánicas y el tema realmente concuerdan en este juego.

Cuando se abre la caja por primera vez tan sólo se pueden encontrar buenos componentes. Los tableros y los marcadores son muy chulos y suficiéntemente gruesos. Los dados también son bastante bonitos aunque las cartas son un poco pequeñas. Éste no es un problema porque no se utilizan demasiado.

En relación a sus componentes tengo una queja, tan sólo una pero importante: el tamaño de los MRCs (Micro Rally Car). Había visto un montón de fotos pero no podía imaginarme que fueran tan pequeños. Deberían llamarse Nano Rally Cars ó Pico Rally Cars, en serio, me decepcionó su tamaño, tienen aproximadamete 5-8 mm de longitud.

Pero el juego está muy chulo. Es una especie de solitario pero incluyendo los tiempos de los otros jugadores para crear una experiencia multijugador. Su mecánica principal es el sistema "exprime tu suerte" pero añadiendo algunas reglas que le dan al juego sabor a rally.

Los tableros modulares y las diferentes condiciones climatológicas aseguran una altísima rejugabilidad.

A sport's game that really looks a sport's game. Mechanics and theme really match in this one.

When you open the box for the first time you find nothing but good components. Its boards and markers are cool and they are thick enought. Dice are also pretty nice but cards are a little bit small. That's not a problem because you don't use them a lot.

Regarding to its components I have a complain, just one but an important one: the size of the MRCs (Micro Rally Car). I have seen a lot of pictures but I couldn't imagine that those where such small as they are. They should be called Nano Rally Cars or Pico Rally Cars, seriously, I was bit disappointed due to their size, they around 5-8 mm long.

But the game is really nice. It's some kind of "solo" game but including other player's time to try to create a multiplayer experience. Its main mechanics is a "push your luck system" with some additional rules that give a rally flavour to the game.

Modular boards and different weather conditions ensure a high replayability to this game.[/color]

Rallyman is one of those rare games that succeed at being different. From the unique solution of a staggered start to the unusual notion of the first to arrive not necessarily being the fastest and the almost-no-randomness approach Rallyman is an unusual race game. It takes a few moves to get used to it and to overcome the initial doubt if this game can work. What follows is a brainy optimization exercise with an atmospheric risk-taking element when rolling the dice. Not for everyone but the game is so different that it managed to garner a small but dedicated tournament community.

OK.  Crazy good...

The only thing stopping this from being a 10 is the fact that some tracks, if played often enough by people who would want to do this sort of thing can be "solved".
Then the game could essentially boil down to luck of the die.

That aside...this game is a blast!  Great solo...great variety, great tension, great push-your-luck risk/reward ratio...great graphics, great "mechanics to theme" link.
Just superb and I am very happy to make a space for this game in my collection.  A keeper, for sure!

Poor graphic (it reminds me those promo games the local car seller gave me when I was 6) very childish! Those Micro Cars are....MICRO, a way too micro and the new metal ones are quite useless since there's no difference in game-terms between a Fiesta WRC and a Renault Alpine, but their shape! Bah!
Driving feeling...so poor! Every car has the same number and kind of dices to play, so it's just a matter of luck. It didn't give me the feeling like driving a rally car and moving one space at time it's BOOOOOOORING! Die-Move, Die-Move, Die-Card-Move-Card....
Good things: I like you receive damage on the base of what you hit...to bad you can just consume tires and lose dice (actually this is good for me: less dice to throw!)

This game it's another wasted chance to make a good rally simulation: if I can compare this game to a videogame, this is SEGA RALLY...useful if you are waiting for your turn to bowl.

I really like Rallyman.  It arrived in my collection in early January 2011, and was promptly put into service.  I now have 6 plays under my belt, and it has been interesting to see the differing reactions from various players.

Rallyman has generally had a good response from most folks, but the Formula De players were a bit cool to it.  I think it is a fun diversion, but I doubt I will ever bond with it as tightly as I have with other racing games.  I enjoy the positional spatial counting sort of games where I get to cut off my competitors.  Rallyman has the positional spatial stuff, but much less of the rubbing fenders with competitors.  This is not a rap on the game, just a fact.

But what seems great about this game is that it seems to appeal to folks who otherwise have not previously been too enticed by racing games - and this is a great thing!

UPDATE:  Shifted my rating up from 7 to 8.  The addition of DIRT has really enhanced the game.  The little control wheels, coupled with the new soft tires and dirt tires/courses has added some interesting decisions around how to build and conduct the stages.

Rallyman is pretty much a solo-game, which is thematic but not much fun for us who like player interatcion in games. The core racing mechanism of Rallyman is fairly clever, but it falls into the same trap many other racing games do: there are optimum moves that everybody should take unless they get unlucky with die rolls. Rallyman isn't quite as calculatable as Bolide for example, but it isn't far either.

This racing game has the most innovative mechanics in its genre. Unfortunately, every game feels a bit samey, although you can build a new track every time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
LIKE:

* This is not your typical race game.  This is much more focused on which gear you end your turn as you take a corresponding card.  Cards have a different time based on the gear.
* There is one die for each gear (1-5) and two white dice which are used to maintain your gear/speed.  Each die can only be used on your turn and you go one space on the race track for each die used so you can plan out your route easily using the dice.
* There is potential to take damage on each die and if you roll three damage symbols must take a damage card which may result in the inability to use a die or two.  Losing white dice can be catastrophic!
* The boards provided allow you to make tons of different types of track and you can even bring in choosing between using snow or regular tires!
* There is a highly recommended variant in which players can choose to figure out which dice they want to use and roll all of them at once instead of one at a time.  You deduct one second from your time for each die rolled in this manner but won't have as much opportunity to manage your risk.

DISLIKE:

* If you are third or fourth to go, there is a lot of dead time at the beginning of the game.  If you are first or second to go, there is a lot of dead time at the end of the race.  
* There may be a need to use a timer if players are taking too long to map out the optimal route and use of dice.

It felt like there weren't really many decisions to be made - to a large extent, your success or failure seemed to come down to raw dice rolling success.

[b][thing=60435][/thing][/b] was a pleasant surprise and restored a bit of my confidence that there are light to medium weight games out there that are actually worth playing.  The last few lighter games I've played have been disappointments and include one other dice-roller: [b][thing=171669][/thing][/b].  [b][thing=60435][/thing][/b] does mess a bit with one's sense of time and space.  Going farther on a turn doesn't necessarily equate with going faster.  Going five spaces, accelerating from 1st to 5th, for example, takes 10 seconds.  Going five spaces decelerating from 5th to 1st takes 50 seconds.  Physics suggests that because both cars travelled the same distance in one turn, that their average speeds should have been the same whether they were accelerating or decelerating.  But the turn for the one car was 10 seconds and the turn for the other car was 50.  So it's a bit counter-intuitive to discover that although your car has seemingly caught up to your opponent (who had a one turn "head start"), you are in fact 20 seconds behind at the end of the race.  And this should seem annoying, but I find the whole space-for-time thing mentally stimulating.

Love this game. I've always been more of a Rally fan than other types of racing, and this really captures the spirit. I love the modular board and you can decide to keep it simple and safe, or go for broke around the corners. 

Easy to learn, but lots of tactics involved each turn, but you also have to incorporate an overall strategy since each game is 3 separate races. Do you use winter or asphalt tires if parts of the track are snow? If you lose a tire now, do you repair it or try to make it to the end? Are you even allowed to repair after every stage? 

The best part is that all this can usually be done in under an hour, so you can do multiple games an evening. Great for setting up an entire season of racing.

reading the rules for this game I expected it to be great.  
Clever dice roll mechanics but overall I did not enjoy playing it with other people because of the lack of head to head racing.  
You can't tell if you are winning or not, and when you win you don't know why.  The game also takes a long time to play - tedious.

A racing game should never be about luck, even if dice rolling is involved. In Rallyman, it did so with amazing results, making this game suitable for gamers who like strategy and control in a racing game.

Gas, Gas, Gas! Very different type of racing game where only your time through the course matters. Well produced, push-your-luck game in which you need to plan ahead to optimise your turns. Modular board is nigh-infinitely variable. Downsides? Can play a bit long with newbies so can 'dry out' over the three stages.

Played 5-10 times. I think it´s paramount that you play with people who share the same attitude towards the game and that you don´t make the tracks too long. I´ve had the pleasure to enjoy it with players who play reasonably quick and who can laugh at the occasional crash that will occur. Three is probably a better number than four. The rules are clear and the game is quite simple to learn. There are no stupid rules like the Ave Caesar rule in that game. It has worked well with adults and with my 8-yo. I hesitate to give it an 8. It remains a 7 for now, but I would recommend fans of racing games to check it out.

Whilst I am a fan of all things Euro, I am a huge fan of racing games. This one is, frankly, the best I've played.

Having just received Edition 3, I must say I am impressed by Jean-Christophe Bouvier's attention to detail. This is a self-published game? The components are extremely good, the box sturdy in a way that reminds me of GMT Games (as an aside, I've never understood why the box is always the best component of a GMT game), an insert in which, like Tikal, there is a place for each component.

The gameplay is so simple, it's brilliant: roll dice to select a gear, using each gear only once on your turn; put the foot on the gas when appropriate. Whichever gear you end your turn on, take a card from its gear pile and put it in front of you. Stack cards as the turn progresses and, at the end of the stage, count up the time accumulated in your "chrono-pile". There are hazards on course, and a push-your-luck element to tackling these, coupled with penalities on some dice faces. This would make a great gateway and beer-and-pretzels game; a tournament or league game. I like Formula De (D), but it only really works with a crowded track (hence a lot of players). This works just as well solo, though I prefer to have opponents for the social aspect.

A neat game, then, and a fine independent production. I wish great success on it.

[u]23-Jan-2014[/u]:  This game is excellent fun.  It's a race game with a push-your-luck mechanism, but even after my single play session, there is so much more to it than just rolling dice and hoping you got what you wanted.

There are underlying strategies and tactics in this game that will present themselves after a few rounds of play.  Planning ahead on what gear you want to finish your run on is very important.  Deciding the best way to take the turns, using the shortcut or not, downshifting.  All of these are factors in gameplay beyond the roll of the nice, chuncky dice.

The replayability is high with double sided track boards, both asphalt and snow covered.  So many combinations and lengths of races can be created with just four track boards, it's great.

I'm looking forward to getting in several plays of this one throughout the coming year and beyond.

This was one of those read the rules, don't play, read the rules again, fail to play once more sort of games. Once I finally did play, I really enjoyed it. Discovering the on-line Road-Books made all the difference for me. Designing your own tracks is okay, but driving the same courses that others are racing is more gratifying, especially since it gives you a point of comparison time-wise. The times some people achieve are pretty amazing. [51 plays]

Rallyman is a racing game totally true to its theme of rally driving. The goal is the best time, not finishing position so that means each race is really a battle of wits between the drivers as they aim to navigate the course in the most efficient manner. 

The nature of the dice rolling mechanics are unique and offer up a great balance between risk and reward. The implementation of the time system is excellent and allows players to take calculated risks at key moments.

With modular boards, and 2 track types (asphelt and snow) the game can offer up a myriad of track configurations and challenges.

The key in race mechanic to consider are the corners and the need to cut corners or drift around them. The use of 2 white dice are key in maintaining a given speed but with every roll, hazards await that can see a loss of control and a hit to your time.

For the racing fan this game is a must to check out.

Easy, quick and surprisingly thematic play, but one which does not hit the table quite as often as I'd like.  I probably need to solo this one more often, but that's tough with the likes of LOTR: The Card Game in the collection.

The more one plays this the more the joy of the design becomes apparent - tyre choices and different surfaces, the trickiness of ending in the highest gear, shortcuts and their inherent risk or the safer route - and the intricacies of the game reveal themselves.

Although I have yet to play a proper competitive rally with all the trimmings, I know that it is something I could really enjoy, especially if I can get my other half into it.

Clever ideas in this game. The rules are accessible. We really feel as we are in a rally. It's more enjoyable if you realise multiple races and see who wins. You can easily modifie your course. Even playing solo is challenging. On the internet, you can find multiple championships and compare your score to other players. I recommend this game if you like rally or want a race game easy to play.

It's a very fun short game, with some simple strategic/tactic planing and an important "push your luck" element that provides most of the fun.

In each sector, the luck factor might decide the winner, but on the long run, over 3 sectors, things tend to be more balanced.

A problem I saw is that in each track, there's always a best way to drive it. At some point, somebody will be scared by bad results or will lose control of their cards, and do things differently from then on, but up to then, chances are that everybody will do the same. And also at some points later, when negotiating curves, etc.

There are several optional and advanced rules. I don't like all, but some others are great, and you can choose or change the ones you like it to personalize the experience the way you like it.

Another virtue: the board is ultra-modulabe, there's a huge ammount of different tracks available. 

I've only played once ftm, but overall, it was a very fun experience I would gladly repeat.

RATING: 6
A curious combination of right-on mechanics and utterly banal ones, and it has to be said that it really does feel like rallying, and the modular boards are a delight in creating nearly infinite combinations.

The big downer for me is that one bad slip-up, whether through bad luck or your own fault, will render you uncompetitive: while this accurately models a trial of life in real rallying, it's not something I really want to see around the games' table.

[-]I would like to play this again - I have not really formed a strong opinion.[/-] It is excellent that players have near total control of the amount of luck they allow to affect their turns.
Three plays later: Rallyman is less exciting each time. It becomes a rather thinky exercise in risk management, rather than an exciting race. As [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/sysyphus]sysyphus[/url] put it: "Less Top Gear and more University Challenge"
The components are good, although the board and the player pieces (tiny rally cars) could be a trifle larger (maybe an extra 25%).

Just a few plays so rating is tentative.  After playing so much Formula De it takes a bit of rethinking to get good scores.  Need to remember to stay in high gear and hit the gas.  Lower gears are really only for going through turns and bumps.  I like the idea of pushing your luck to gain extra seconds that can be spent later.

One interesting strategy is to stay right behind another car and just roll what he rolls but all at once to gain extra time.

Need to do 3 stages to even out on the time.  A single stage can have a large variance in the times of the players.

Able to store main game and expansion in the expansion box.

Superb rally racing game with an engaging mix of push your luck as well as planning ahead. It's amazing to me how such a simple ruleset manages to incorporate most, if not all, of the key features of rally racing - once you understand the basics, the turns whip by quite quickly.

My lone complaint is that downtime in a four player race is a little high, but that's a minor quibble. Even with that, this is easily one of my top 5 racing games. I've played 3 times and had a blast each time. If that trend continues, then this will be my #1 racing game, period.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A mathematical plan ahead game, where you're trying to complete each turn in as high a gear as possible (as the higher the gear, the less time points you get). Each space you proceed along the track must be allocated a different gear (shown by placing the dice marker for that gear) and you've got 2 "stay in that gear" markers. If you start in a high gear for instance, you can do a short turn that only covers 3 or 4 spaces, stay in a high gear and earn not much time. Or you can go lots of spaces using a lot of the gears, but because you can't repeat, you end up in a low gear with lots of time. Of course the course has lots of corner gear requirements that must be managed through which makes life trickier. The game is one of continual look-ahead and planning, re-planning, trying to get through all those spaces whilst incurring the least amount of time. There's risk in all you do. Each time you move, you roll the dice allocated to that gear and there's a chance of rolling a "risk". You crash on the third of these. If you're rolling the basic move, 1 at a time, you can manage it. If you roll the time attack, you roll all the dice you'd planned simultaneously and get reward (time taken off) or (if you roll 3 risks) crash and move off in first gear next turn. As such, until you have a few games under your play this is going to be anti-thematically slow, slow, slow and more like Leader 1 than Das Motorsportspiel. If you want that real rally feel, I'd suggest adding a timer to get the adrenalin going. There's some chrome-y stuff going on for crashes and shortcuts, but they only kick in now and then. This one's for plan-ahead lovers only.
- - - 
After 6 plays, the first few plays of the game are fine as players try different approaches and work out the tricks to a fast leg. Then, the game degenerated for us into a luck-fest. It may be groupthink, but here’s what happened. Each leg starts as a mathematical plan ahead game, spending as much time as you need to get your plan perfect. If there are several approaches that will achieve the same time, then the best one is that which has fewer turns using all 7 dice. This need for planning means there’s a sloooow start to each leg. If everyone is diligent, everyone will find the same optimum plan. If everyone is going to race to the same plan, then everyone needs to do time-attacks every turn in order to win. Those who don’t are betting that all the time-attackers will crash, because if there’s one time-attacker left who hasn’t crashed, and who is a bunch of time up on those who haven’t been time-attacking consistently, he can then play safe due to having time up his sleeve. If a time-attacking leader starts playing safe, the only way for those who haven’t been time-attacking to get to the lead now is to time-attack, and then the leader re-starts time-attacking ... anyway, everyone pretty much has to time-attack for a vast majority of the race to be in a position to win. All of which is risky and explains why legs fall to the luckiest after all that initial planning. Though I enjoyed learning and playing the game to begin with, and I can admire the design and appreciate that other people will enjoy it, the schizophrenic nature of the game (you must have worked out the optimal plan, but it will mean nothing if you don’t get the best luck) means I have little interest in playing anymore.

Fun!! Compete in Rallyman racing for the best times using dice in a press-your-luck-ish fashion instead roll-and-move fashion. Original. Multi-solitair-ish. Mostly tactical with some strategy. Bonus that this plays solitaire.

Challenging and fun when you play with full rules, and race in 3 special stages back-to-back with no assistance from pit crews. Games can get longer than the box says.

Family Game! Beer-N-Pretzels Game!

"Nice racing game, without a lot of the congestion typical in car race games. Definitely requires planning and risk assessment."

What I like:
- Clever (if slightly counter-intuitive) mechanisms
- Adorable little race cars
- Staggered start reduces congestion
- Very modular board allows short or long races

What I don't like:
- At 2 hours, was longer than I would prefer

There is a lot of randomness in the game, between the dice and the cards. But there is also a lot of thinking and planning, as well as decisions about how much risk to take on. Overall, it's a nice mix.

I would put the weight around 2.3, just a bit higher than BGG voters. The core rules are a bit hard to grasp at first, and there are several little fiddly rules to remember. But not bad overall.

As with real rally racing, players are not racing each other around the track....instead they are racing the clock. Players have staggered starts so they are not running at the same time, though with crashes you can catch up to each other. The dice and card mechanic is different than any racing game I have seen before and it seems to work well. The gear cards have time on them, so when you are in lower gears you are using more time. You can push your luck with the dice but you can damage your car if you are unlucky. The modular two-sided board (pavement and snow) is a great touch. I want to try the dirt expansion soon.

Very neat game. I used to play "Course Ultime" for years, but Rallyman is a fresh design for racing games that has that strategic depth that you wouldn't expect in that king of board game. Moreover, you can get free expansions on their website, which greater a larger variety of tracks, tires, and overall rules that further enhances the experience. I highly recommend it.

Another one of those race games. This one is a race to have the slowest time, thus it does not matter who finishes first, each player is basically on the track on their own and based on how you manage your gear changes, you get time cards. Lowest time wins. Thus you want to end your moves at higher gears, which results in less time taken and complete the track in the least amount of movements. Cute, but not really better then all the other games of the same genre and a bad roll or card and your basically out.

Rally racing game. It was hard for me to think "time" instead of "get ahead of everyone" while playing. Each player is racing the clock, and best time wins. Three stages make a race, and there are different maps and different conditions (sun, snow) to vary things up a bit.

This is really a great game.  The mechanics are very clever and really seem to capture alot of the stuff I've seen in watching Rally races on TV and the internet.

I guess the main drawback may be that because of the staggered starts to each race stage, there may be some down time for some players early on.

Most of the time there is only one way to go and then you just hope for the best with the dice/cards.

A fun rally racing game. Probably one of my favorite race games. The rules are a bit of a mess. They're not very precise, they mix up a few words, and needed some work.

Other than that, though, the game is a great way to play some solo racing. You collect cards that add up to your total time through the track, so you can play solo or multiplayer, but you're not racing to cross first.

Some push your luck elements and such will keep you entertained, and the dice mechanic is unique and fun to watch how it plays out.

I was all up for Rallyman as I do like a race game, but when the reviews/rules rundowns mentioned dice and push-your-luck I knew I'd be in trouble. Yes, you can take it slowly and roll die by die, backing off when on the edge: but you will not win that way. So, I rolled m'dice together and - for all but the last turn - was the only player to roll three crashes (twice), which made my time almost twice everyone else's. However, enough skill was shown by the other players to prove there's stuff to learn before getting good at the game. It did feel a tad strange setting off after others have had several turns, but that's rallying for you and, considering one player's excellent time was blocked by a slower car on the track, it could do with even more space between the cars.

Uno dei giochi di corse più innovativi degli ultimi anni! Ottima simulazione di Rally, l'ambientazione e le meccaniche rendono perfettamente l'idea di correre per ottenere il miglior tempo, con un interessante ed innovativo modo in cui si calcola il tempo di gara perché qui non conta arrivare primo, ma bisogna fare il percorso nel minor tempo possibile, decidendo quanto e quando rischiare. La gara è un pò indiretta per via della partenza stile Rally (a meno che qualcuno non perda tempo in qualche modo). L'alea è decisamente presente perché ci sono dadi e pesca di carte, ma la molta variabilità data dalla modularità dei percorsi (nessuno obbliga a metterli esattamente in un certo modo, basta che le strade tra un pezzo e l'altro combacino) permette di spostare l'ago della bilancia verso abilità e strategia. Per questo motivo, suggerisco anche di optare per un circuito misto in cui si aggiunge una buona dose di suspense, perché se correre solo su una tipologia di asfalto allora preparatevi ad una gara noiosa, tecnica ed in sostanza uguale per tutti i giocatori poiché le traiettorie e le strategie sono veramente poche. La durata è pianificabile componendo tracciati di varia lunghezza, ed inoltre è possibile giocare anche da soli. Chi ama i giochi di corse ne dovrà approfittare, è unico nel suo genere! Il gioco ha anche un espansione, Rallyman Dirt, per aggiungere mappe e modalità di corsa su terra.

Interesting racing game with a different feel than anything else out there... drivers compete for the best time, not necessarily the first to cross the finish line... your time depends on the gear you end your turn in... taking greater risk gives you bonus time, and you can spend that time to drive conservatively and avoid hazards when it matters most... best to run cars round-robin through multiple legs--that way each driver has to figure out the course without the benefit of watching his opponent complete the same stretch moments before... at the end of the race, the driver with the shortest overall time wins...

Juego que apetece mas sacar a mesa a mis compañeros que a mi, quizás porque me parece algo lineal si juegas con las reglas básicas, con las reglas opcionales hay mas toma de decisiones, la temática es atractiva, por eso creo que me proponen sacarlo a mesa. Aun asi no me parece mal juego.

Nota: Solo he jugado etapas sueltas, no rallies completos.

Jogo realmente diferente daquilo que se costuma ver num jogo de corridas, a simular ao pormenor os percursos de um rally. Apesar de ser um modular board (até algo insólito), creio que depende muito dos dados, o que lhe retira algum encanto…

Fun, thinky race game, although it's not really a race at all. It can be a bit hard to wrap your head around that you're not trying to pass each other or get across the track in the fewest turns. I would usually recommend Formula De/D over this, but if you only have 3 or 4 players, Rallyman is a nice change of pace. 

Update: I'm liking this less and less after more plays.  Apart from the occasional dirt in a turn or the much rarer blocking in a turn if you are passing a player, it just doesn't matter what your opponents do.  The epitomy of a multiplayer solitaire as a race game.

Rallyman is a great example of pure fun in a racing game. 

In this game you really get the feeling of pushing your car to the limit in a rally style race. That at any second you could make the move to win the race or lose control and crash.

That is accomplished with a very clever push your luck dice rolling mechanic to move your car. One die per gear. Roll one die and move forward one space. But each higher gear has a higher chance of losing control of your car and crashing. Push your luck, roll more dice and see how fast you can go......or crash.

The track is equally ingenious. The track are laid out with maximum allowable gears in certain locations, like turns and hills. Cars may not exceed these maximum allowable gears or they crash instantly. 

The game is essentially multi-player solitaire as there is no real player interaction. Each car is judged on time, or how quickly it went around the track. Players fight for the best, lowest, time without really coming in contact with one another. This mechanic lends itself well to this format as that is how actual rally races are conducted. This multi-player solitaire also makes players push their cars harder and leads to more exciting races.

A cool extra special and even harder push your luck strategy called Time Attack really livens up the game and brings in more risk and high gains. This is where the game truly begins to feel like rally racing.

However, the game is not as much fun playing solo. While playing solo your only opponent is a new faster time, not other racers. This makes the game dull for just one.

On the bad side, the rules are a little ambiguous in areas. The game would 
benefit from a better rule book.

Pros -
- Great mechanics
- A lot of fun
- Really brings the feel of pushing your luck to race faster

Cons -
- Ambiguous rules
- The high cost might turn some away

Egy leheletnyivel jobbnak érzem a Formula D-nél, amivel egyébként nem is helytálló az összehasonlítása, hiszen a mellett, hogy mindkettő kockára épít, és mindkettő autóversenyzős semmi közös nincs bennük :D
Tökéletesen adja vissza a rallyk hangulatát! Kockáztass, és ha van egy kis szerencséd óriási előnyhöz juthatsz. Csak azért nem nevezném tökéletes játéknak, mert a kockák "uralják" a versenyt. Ha még volna benne egy csipetnyivel több lehetőség a sorsunk befolyásolására, még jobb lehetne.
Megjegyzem a design, a játék és az alkatrészek minősége igen kiváló! A doboz megfelelő méretű, mindennek tökéletesen megvan benne a helye. Igen jól eltalált és kitalált az egész!

A time attack (vagyis padlógáz) szabály használata jelentőset emel az élményen! Szenzációs feelinget nyújt!

Variant: I tried simultaneous Rallyman racing and it was crazy fun. Sure it makes no sense - you still use the times to determine the winner - but all the cars sharing the same piece of track at the same time really spiced things up! Bid for starting positions with time. All players start from the same space. You can't end your turn where another car stops. The car in front always begins the round. Winner is still the least amount of time. Trying to overtake is very interesting and the players in front feel the constant pressure of those behind - knowing they have to make up the time they bid to start in front - defend their lead by blocking, but do so efficiently. This variant works really well for those who don't like the solo nature of Rallyman. Sure it's not realistic, but it's a lot more fun and interactive. It really brings out the best in a great game. I quite like playing this way.

Simple, thematic and fun. Like life, lots of practise will make you a better driver, at which point it becomes more of a push your luck and luck of the roll game, but still a bunch of fun. Even the best driver (who's figured out all the optimal moves), has to adapt to hazard symbols, dirt on the road, punctures and a driver up ahead who's going a little faster than you thought he would.

A really simple and clever use of dice for a racing game. Very unlike other dice racing games in the use of the dice - I'm surprised it hasn't been thought of before. A good trick for a visual representation of the car's course and for a smooth flowing game is to place the dice as you use them on the spaces.

It is what it is - a car rally racing game - and a good one at that. My favourite racing game is still Leader One (with hidden energy), but this one is different enough to play also.

Decided to get the Third edition as it seemed more streamlined for solo play!

I still find this an enjoyable experience, whether it is the monthly Challenges or playing a four Driver race using different styles of racing.
The push your luck factor is manageable and the tactics and problem solving is fascinating.
Discovering new and better ways to approach a track is half the fun.

One of the best racing games available!

RATING: 7.5
Clever push-your-luck dice game that simulates rally racing. Pick your course, pick your tyres and the gear dice you want to use. Roll them in a bunch to get time tokens which can be used to improve your results or guarantee subsequent die rolls.

There are hazard icons on the dice. Roll three in your turn and your cars goes off the road. The clever aspect of the game is determining the winner: you collect a card for the gear you end on. The higher the gear, the lower the time. The player with the lowest/smallest time wins. There are of course, other elements to spice up the fun. Car damage, taking short-cuts, spitting mud on the tracks to screw the other players etc.

System could easy be adapted to a cycling game!

RATING: 7.25
2/13: 7.25 - a curious little game that's captured my imagination. interestingly, learning to play this game well is a bit like learning how to drive stick-shift, a matter of getting the physical memory down. 

there's this weird level of abstraction that has to be reconciled. that the board isn't a true map. that the spaces on the board don't represent a physical area, but markers to record your car's ending speed for the turn.

the stack of time cards is the true representation of how you're doing in the game. 

its near-perfect visuals may give a wildly inaccurate portrayal of the actual race. i wouldn't say the game is "broken". it's just that the visuals don't work when a player applies traditional racing-game tactics.

so with all this, i'm not sure the tactical level here goes well with a motorsports game. ironically, when played well (ensuring turns end in high gears), the cars move along the track too slowly, too analytically. this is a game that invites thinking in future turns. 

granted, real rally driving is very technical, but there's a lot of imaginary vrooom and screeech that's lost in this game. (eg, ending a turn while drifting through a turn is so deflating.)

i still have fun with this. longer stages afford even more fun and drama. it seems the higher the stakes (via longer stages), the better it plays. 

i also like that it plays well solitaire; that there's little incentive for cars to copy the moves of the previous driver (if they want to win); that the possibility of shortcuts, flats, crashes, and time-attacks help ensure no two cars will take the same tact through a course. the caveat, however, is that the above depends on a well-designed track. 

if i'm being rough on the game's abstraction it's because the game's physical components are so fantastic. they look much better in person. the map art and colors pop and the cars are such small scale that their level of detail is right. (i pimped mine out by adding decals from a battleship model kit.)

everything in the box feels just right. it's quaint. the lite rules are near weightless. set-up & clean-up take a minute. it'd be a good game to take to the park on a warm day.

Just got Rallyman from Amazon today. I love racing games for anything except Nascar. F1 being my favorite, but love watching Rallye too. I have been hearing this game talked about for a while so when someone from sologamers on Facebook posted a reprint was available at Amazon, I jumped on it. I got the 18th copy of only 40 available. I am so glad I did. Beautiful design, good components, fast and lots of fun. Simple with some decisions and some good push your luck, much like real racing. I love it. If you like racing games, I strongly encourage you to try and get this one.

Ingenious race system - in fact time trials might be the perfect way of 'doing' motor sport games. I have only played one solitaire game but am really impressed with the production values and the game mechanics. I wonder if it will feeel like a solitaire exercise as you are setting off at different times - however that avoids the crazy do or die gear changes you see in One off Formula one races.

Now played 2 player and it is interactive in that you are aware of time pressure. Also a little blocking potential

The spin off mechanism is excellent - unlike Formula D i t is not fatal as you can get back up to 5th gear in one turn

I used to be a rally copilot back in my teenage years (my parents have to sign an special permission as I began with 17-yo), so I love the subject.
Back then I got the International Team game on Rallies, but it disappointed me. This almost made me believe a good thematic game was impossible.
It came as a surprise when JT (of Torras-game fame) brought Rallyman to the club, as it had skipped my radar completetly.
I enjoyed it so much I ordered my own copy the same weekend.
This game is a demostration that geme design (as a 9th art) is constantly improving (this could be apllied as well to Leader 1)-

The best and most strategic race game I've ever played, but also the closest to "multiplayer solitaire".

It doesn't reward casual play because in any given lap it's very easy for a player to get screwed by bad dice. Over long races or seasons it should balance out, but that's a time investment I don't think it's worth.

I feel that an update is needed on this one. Have played the game a lot more and it's going up up up on my personal charts. It's an easy game to pick up and play. Depending on your gaming group you can chose to decide a winner in one race, which gives 'no risk' drivers an edge, or to race a couple of time trials. Championships are an option, supported by the community! I love it and will bring it to more and more gaming groups to get a solid Dutch crew of rally racers.

Very nice game with different options. Short plays up to 30 minutes or championship plays up to many different evenings on a row. 
Time instead of the number of spaces moved determines the victory. Solitaire play is possible and a lot of fun.

A different kind of race game.  A push your luck dice game with a racing theme.  Going farther though (and rolling more dice) is not necessarily the best way to get around the track however, and most certainly might not be the quickest.

It's almost puzzle like in its feel, but the dice rolls mean that you can't quite get the 'best' solution to every track, as a couple lucky or unlucky throws could take your best solution down quickly.

Might be too much luck in the long run, but I'm having fun running through some of the online tracks solo and gauging my scores to see if I can improve upon them.

The rules could be a little clearer, but the examples helped to sort it out.  Quite fascinating. I've not seen another racing game like it.

It's actually fairly counter-intuitive at times. Sometimes, you don't want to go as far, so you remain in a higher gear, so you drive faster.  Wha?  I still like it a lot, mind you. But it's odd.

Update: After playing a couple more times, boosted to a 9 from an 8. It's still weird, but in a cool way. =)

Rallyman presents a fresh, Euro alternative to Formula D.  The small box contains modular, reusable maps and few fussy rules.  Player's time decks obscure the winner until they are counted.  The downside is a staggered start which makes turn order important and delays competitive play.  True to the spirit of rally racing, Rallyman is multiplayer solitaire, but that may be a benefit for some.

First Impression:
An excellent rally, combining skill and push your luck elements in a stunningly thematic package that feels like a real rally!

The theme and it's implementation hit spot on for me. I really love it the way this game plays and the way it feels both in a game and after a game. The whole driving concept is also brilliant. It really takes some skill to drive optimally and there are many approaches depending on how safe or reckless you want to drive. The system is so good that the same track when played on reverse is practically a whole new experience. The luck management aspect is also fantastic, with meaningfull decisions at every corner and an amazing push harder style interaction. It really feels like a rally.

So anything wrong with it? Since driving is open information, it's easy for the last players to follow the best moves of the first players, even copy them fully. Of course time assaulting is a personal thing, and crashes and flats will happen at different times to players, but still trying to read a course only to be blatandly copied by the following players where you did well feels wrong. This is somewhat mitigated by the dirt aspect that gives an edge to the leader, but that alone also creates a problem as a following player might drive better than the leader and still be delayed for no justified reason. The basic problem is that all cars drive the same, so although there are different approaches to the tracks, one player can blatandly copy another. The different sets of tires fix this somewhat, but still it's only two choices without the expansion that makes matters much better in this regard. Even then, a player can copy another even in the tire selection. What this game really lacks is variable rally cars.

Overall this is a great rally. If this had varyable rally cars, it would rank even higher for me.

I helps if you like Rally racing, that's for sure,  But even if you aren't a "Ralleyman," this is one really good game.

Out of the box, there are top notch components including a plastic tray that actually holds everything.  Ingenious time/distance mechanics make this a challenging race game that "feels" right.  There is a lot of dice rolling, but this actually minimizes the effect of any one good or bad roll and with it a lot of the luck factor, In the end it is the driver's choices during the race (and there are many) that will determine the outcome.

The English translation is excellent, and the eight page rulebook is clear, concise and easy to grasp.  The game plays intuitively, meaning that after you've run through a race ot two, you'll have the rules pretty well down and need to refer to them only when a rarely occuring event...occurs.

I have already played this game more in the past week than I have any other boardgame that I have purchased in recent memory.

It does an amazing job of simulating the risk and reward of real rallying, and the designer is very active on these boards which I feel adds a lot to the whole experience of owning a game.

A very pretty games that's easy to explain helps to draw players in, and a massive decision tree keeps them wanting more once the rally starts.

It amazes me how subtle this game can be with its choices sometimes, especially trying new strategies out on solo games. Rallyman has some magnificent mechanics underneath the theme to bring out a great rally racing game.

Thank you, Jean-Christophe and artists, for an elegant design (4th edition 2011)! Also, some bits are too small and easily lost or damaged (said damage markers should probably be [color=red]red[/color]). Sorry, I'm just better at criticizing (PTSD spill over from youth)... Fast, and Fun Fun Fun! Part of permanent collection; will never sell. This and [gameid=28458], are the best racing games I've ever played. Best with 2 or 3.

Dice driven racing game, where the winner is the person with the shortest time, rather than who crosses the line first. Each time you end your turn, you get an amount of time depending on what gear your car is in, 10 seconds for 5th gear, 20 seconds for 4th gear, 50 seconds for 1st gear etc. Each dice you throw is assigned to a specific gear, and can only be used once each turn. Thus, it's the way you use your dice that determines how fast you are.

For example, one player might go through a corner by using dice 5-4-3-2-1, ending in 1st gear for 50 seconds. Next turn he goes 1-2-3-4-5 for 10 more seconds, or 1 minute total for those two turns. A different player might go through using 5-x-x-4-3 for 30 seconds (x is coasting, you can do it twice per turn), then 2-3-4-5 on his next turn for 10 more seconds, and only 40 seconds total, 20 seconds faster than player 1. He hasn't travelled as far as player 1, but if he maintains ending turns in 5th gear etc, he'll be faster overall.

I like Rallyman a lot, it's not a pure luckfest, while there is a luck component to the game, it's pretty small. The winner is almost always the person who chose the "best line" through the course.

I bought Rallyman and have so far played it once and been unimpressed. My biggest issue was the multi-player solitaire feel of the game. In fact, Rallyman can more aptly be described as a competitive time trial rather than a race. That being said I don't feel I've given the game the couple tries it deserves. There's enough going on that it's certainly possible that I've simply not uncovered the interesting parts. It's pretty hard to see how I'll ultimately come to terms with the non-interactive part, though.

RATING: 8.45
I really like playing this solo; sort of a "Thinking Man's Golf" for rally racing.  It strikes a good balance between being too simple (which would devolve into roll-and-move) and too complicated, and has quite a bit of replayability in the base game.  I'd love to get the Dirt expansion.

Rally simulation. More of a tactical optimization, with die rolls providing controllable amount of uncertainty.

RATING: 8
I thought the idea of shifting up and down into gears while trying to stay within the correct range to hit the turns was interesting. Getting too many "!" symbols with die rolls and blowing a tire can be really costly, but sometimes it's worth the risk to get a faster finishing time card for your turn. All in all, I thought this was a pretty fun racing game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The card mechanic for timing each run feels absolutely right as it properly abstracts out a timed run for rally racing. Not sure I quite like the dice mechanic but... it's a small nitpick for a great racing game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.8
I give this game high marks for keeping in line with the concept of the Rally race as well as an innovative mechanism for shifting up and down which incorporates more of a risk rather than luck element.  I have the latest version (I think that's v3) which has excellent components and 4 very nice 2-sided boards from which you have a near inexhaustible choice of tracks.

This really is a puzzle game. You try to move your car through the track in the least amount of time. However, time is not turns but depends on the speed that you end your turn on. Plus all of this is dependent on the dice you roll.

One play with four, one play with two.  Cool game.  I crashed four time the first race!  Twice in the first three turns!  I still had a blast and I love that the game length is totally dependant on how long you wanna race.  Awesome game.

RATING: 9.5
Very cool racing game.   I love the modular boards that allow for nearly countless combinations of track layouts, but what I like best is how the dice are used.   You roll them to move, but you don't move based on what you roll.  It sounds non-intuitive to say it, but in practice it's a really slick system and it does a good job of portraying rally-style racing, which is far more about timing and planning ahead than just flat out speed.

[COLOR=#0000FF][b]Commentaires Personnel:[/b][/COLOR] Excellent petit jeu de course ou vous devrez faire la gestion de votre temps ainsi que prévoir vos prochain tour à l'avance. Personnellement, je préfère ce jeu en solitaire, bien qu'il se joue aisément à plusieurs, puisqu'il n'apporte pas, à mes yeux, beaucoup d'interaction. Je dois dire que j'ai majoritairement joué en solitaire à celui-ci pour évaluer correctement une partie multi-joueur.

The game gives very well the pressure that built during a Rally. You must play more than one special to really appreciate this game. It is my second best race games just behind Thunder Alley. Its advantages, a game will be shorter than one of Formula D, and you can play it alone.

La traduccion de las instrucciones en español que incluye la caja, casi hubiera sido mejor que se la ahorrasen. No sirven practicamente para nada de lo mal que estan traducidas. Las cosas, o se hacen bien o es preferible no hacerlas. Una pena, porque el juego no tiene absolutamente nada que ver con esta..."chapuza". Tema resuelto, ya tenemos disponible una traducción en condiciones del juego realizada por su propio autor, un BIEN por ello.

Easy game hiding a tactical challenge to beat the stop watch! It is designed for several individual players and could deploy its potential as a pbem or pbf game.
Its footprint is not that bad compared to other racing games but the quality of the component is on the weak side.
It relies on the rolls of dice to achieve success or failure, and the main management aspect is to limit the failure by taking - or not - further risks.
It is a nice light game easy to teach and to learn, it plays quickly and is a top scorer!

Rallyman is a push-your-luck race game, like the great Formula D, but they play very differently. Rallyman competes with Formula D as the best motor sport game I've played, I love it!

Please do yourself a favor though, and pick up a set of dice for each player, that way they can play out their turns in advance. The tactile nature of the dice helps immensely, and the gameplay goes so much quicker this way.

The game has quite a hump to get over when first learning it, it's not as simple as it looks by any means. However, simply explain the rules, and then let the most experienced player drive the lead car. This will allow the others to follow, and try to improve on each car ahead of it.

The 2010, or 3rd, edition of the game has better components when it comes to the damage and dirt tokens, and the amazing poker chips like time counters. However, the 2012, or 4th, edition has much nicer looking cards (although smaller) and much better looking dashboards on actual thick card stock rather than the playing cards in the previous edition. However, the Rallyman: Dirt expansion's dashboard puts both of the above mentioned editions' dashboards to shame.

Now that I mention it, I don't normally talk about expansions in my comments about a board game, but it has to be noted that Rallyman: Dirt really improves the base game a whole lot! Mainly in the fact that there are now 4 types of tires, and the dirt tracks feature things such as half-spaces which makes it much more likely that someone might come up with a better solution than the leading car.

Rallyman is another push-your-luck race game, like the great Formula D, but they play very differently. Rallyman competes with Formula D as the best motor sport game I've played, I really enjoy it!

The one drawback after a handful of games is that Rallyman feels quite slow moving. I definitely need to pick up at least one more set of dice, so that the next player in turn order can start planning out their turn, as the tactile nature of the dice helps with this.

My initial infatuation has also cooled down some by how the game's matrix doesn't feel hard to crack and seeing the absolute optimal move is quite simple, and then it just becomes a game of who has the best luck with the dice rolling - which of course isn't much fun.

Great theme. One can sense that this comes from a rally fan. Mechanically it's push your luck, although there is a bit of strategy and results are often tight. The only problem is it kinda wears out after several plays, despite the laudable variety that comes in the box. It shouldn't be played with Sisu cards because they take away the excitement - one is going to drive full throttle until he spends it.

RATING: 8
Played a couple of times now, and better than I first thought. From my viewpoint, it makes Formula Dé about obsolete. There is little reason to play Formula Dé if Rallyman is around. They scratch about the same itch, are about as simple, but Rallyman is more varied.

It's basically a "push your luck" mechanism; you roll one die at a time and the third time you roll a warning you crash. However, this is made extremely interesting by the fact that each time you finish, you take a "time" card depending on whis speed you had (the higher the speed, the lower the time on the card), and once everyone's finished, the player with the lowest time wins. Combined with that you can roll several dice at the same time in order to gain seconds, and that you can spend these seconds later to "guard" a die from failing makes for a really cool tactical risk-taking game.

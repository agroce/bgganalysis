Wildly ahistorical as fleet actions hardly took place not to mention the Germans can fight the Japanese!
Great card art with representations of actual ships of the era and a nice diversionary card battle game to play in between bigger games.

The game design has some major issues, e.g., the air strikes are too powerful and attack/defense opportunities are too random. Hence, the game lacks the strategic depth. However, the theme is interesting and the gameplay smooth. With some further development, Naval Battles could be a classic.

Decent take-that card game. The luck of the draw is significant (like in almost any take-that game), but if you can finish a game in the advertised 30 minutes then it's no problem. There's a large advantage to the starting player.

Vaguely entertaining for 30 minutes or so. A few minor decisions of import. Little reason not to play every card you draw every turn.
So I'd rather play something else but for a 'take that' kind of card game, not so bad.

RATING: 4.5
Simple naval game that only appeals to less serious gamers. It's unfortunate that I did not enjoy this game but felt that all those symbols took awhile for gamers to get use to. 

Other frustration includes the calibre to ship match before you can get that shot through. 

Overall, it was not as elegant as enemy in sight.

I bought it as seemed as a reedition of Naval War (an Avalon Hill filler which I really enjoyed long ago). But instead it takes the same mechanics and worsen them, with an art which doesn't help to make the game clearer.

Easy to learn card game of naval battle. Theme is very thin as there is no real connection with WWII naval combat. Still the mechanics works well together to create a quick, no holds barred sluggfest. There are just enough tactics to keep the game interesting. And being destroyed because you draw the wrong cards is not that bad as the game is so quick you just start another game.

Great game to play in a pub with friends, with a beer in the hand.  You can have a lott of fun, don't take the game to serious.  You have to have a lott of luck and if you play it with 5 or 6, it can be, if you are the last person to play, that you already have a lott of damaged ships and that you don't have any cards left to defend yourselve.  You can solve this by not filling your hand up to 7 cards at your turn but after every player has played.

Fun cross between the old Avalon Hill card game Naval War and the Cold War era naval card game Modern Naval Battles. The card art actually gets in the way of game play a bit: the backs are all the same, which makes it hard to distinguish Warship cards from Action cards. The cards themselves feature a lot of blue and white and, for glossy four-color cards, appear a bit too monochramatic and reflective and are thus kind of hard to read. Still, loads of light wargame/cardgame fun!

RATING: 6.7
Quick battle game with cards. It's a good filler game. The luck factor is still high due to dice and draw of cards. But there is some strategy involved in selecting fleets and cards to use. The problem is that there is just to less to it to keep it interesting.

RATING: 2
Few games make my 'never again' list. This one is firmly in that category.
1) Claims to be able to handle up to 6, but that means that the 6th player could easily be nearly eliminated by the time their first turn comes up.  Not very satisfying if you're the 6th player.
2) Lack of suggested starting fleets leaves new players with no clue what a 'good' arrangement of ships is.
3) Guns take different ammo cards... Fine.  But 4" and 5" are the same... why not just make ALL the 4/5" guns 4"?  Same for 6-8", or 9-12", or 14+". Absolutely no reason to complicate the cards in such a manner.
4) Little to no player interaction when it is not your turn.
5) Lack of defense cards when you're getting shot at means you just sit and take it. Once you don't defend once, everyone else feels free to dogpile on you. Ooo, that's fun.

It would be more fun to fold the cards up into little paper boats and throw pennies at them in the bathtub.

RATING: 6
Like this more than most stand-alones, the wargamey theme and terrific artwork make this one a real winner with me. Being a card-game, there is definitely a strong luck element, but it is also tactical with the fleet deployments and hand-management. It must be said, I like it better than most of the other gamers in my crew...sour grapes over being blasted to splinters, I suspect! LOL!

8 games played so far; as the speed of play picks up so does the enjoyment.  IMHO the action cards would benefit from short title texts, but I understand the desire to have a language-independent game.  I'm finding the Japanese fleet to be a pretty formidable opponent.

I much prefer this to Cold War Naval Battles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Once you learn how to decipher the language-independant card symbols, this is a fast-paced card game that scales well from 3 to 6 players.  All you need is just the cards and some dice, so it's very portable.  Just try not to take it too seriously.  NB trades some realism for gameplay/balance, but it does illustrate the relative strength of airpower over gunnery, a WWII innovation in naval strategy.  If you like Mag Blast, you will enjoy this.

RATING: 3
Early rating.  On my first six player game, my team drew only two defense cards between us and our opponents decided to concentrate fire on me so I basically was eliminated in the first turn of the game due to a bad hand and a HUGE first player advantage.  Part of the advantage was the player had drawn what seemed like every airstrike card in the game.  The mechanics seem solid, the rules are clean and elegant but in practice there are too many layers of the game dependant on having the right card at the right time.  Luck can be a fun and exciting element in a game, but not when a player is completely unable to mitigate it with creative tactics.  Bad hands can be completely crippling, leaving a player defenseless or unable to attack.  I am curious to play the 2 and 4 player game as I think the game might be a little smoother.  Terribly long (2 hours) for what it is, a basic take-that card game.  Not fun, not recommended.

Attempted to play this game once, but found it terribly boring because of the incessant randomness in the card draw. Draw cards, figure out if they are beneficial and whether they don't expose you too much, target ships, see what cards the opponents wish to play, score hit points, next turn. Sometimes you even sink a ship and thus VP, and so it goes until 25 VP-initum. Weee...

As the copy I owned was from Russian publisher Zvezda (long story) chances of selling it on were non-existent. I physically removed the game from my collection. Chalk it up to being another crappy old Phalanx title where the most important thing is the artwork of old ships which have all been sunk or dismantled by now anyway. Yay.

Fun "take that" card game, there's more than a little luck involved.  Draw the wrong cards and your ships are sunk.  Air raids can be decisive, if you get a lucky roll you can sink even the strongest ship.  Rulebook was a little hard to sort through, but the game is simple enough that it doesn't take more than one playing of the game to figure everything out

RATING: 4
Not yet a game.

Quite frankly this is a game where they haven't fixed the balance issues and left in some obvious design flaws. The cards use icon checklists to show which phases they can be used in and which rows they can attack, but use identical green or red silhouettes (dots or ships) to indicate yes or no. Nearly 10% of the male populace (a common gender for boardgamers) is red-green color blind. Why not just have the phase icons that do apply on the card and just leave off the phases that don't, NO COLOR INVOLVED! Does Phalanx Games not like their customers?

A really fun, light card game slugfest! Component quality is very good. Rules are initially daunting, but after five minutes of actually playing the game, it became crystal clear! Luck of the draw certainly makes it more game than historical simulation, but nothing wrong with that! Only downer - would be nice to have even more ships to choose from - if there is no expansion, I may work at creating my own ship cards. 

Also - for historical accuracy freaks (like myself!), the main battery guns sizes for some of the ships is off, but it doesn't impact game play.

Simple, fun game that may be a bit too luck dependent. If you liked Verssen's earlier games using this system, (Modern Naval Battles, Starforce: Terra), you'll like this. I wish they had labelled the action cards, or at least provided a reference card for them for each player. Also, at the price I would expect higher quality cards...these start to fray as soon as you start playing with them!

Nice little beer and pretzels game. Needs more ships, though I suppose I could photocopy proxies. Hard to fight battles historically with them, even in such a simple format. Some mechanics need work though--armor and maneuver should work for anything; I'm still thinking about reworking the aircraft attacks--are they too powerful?; would like to see an expansion for sea state (fog, storms, depth of sea) and convoys(freighters, tankers).

This is a game with a message, and the message is 'beware'. This is not a game for playing, this is a game for laying down and avoiding. 

Not an ounce of strategey involved - if you happen to have the right cards you win, if you haven't you lose. Enormous advantage for the starting player, if you have no defence cards in your starting hand you're blasted to pieces before you can take a turn, while the starting player has the chance to refresh bad cards. 

Typical play :

'I launch an air attack'
'I defend on 5+' - rolls dice - 4, "nope"
'I hit on 2+' - rolls dice - 3 - WOOT !
'any action cards ?'
'Nope'
'Okay I'll take your carrier then'

The only redeeming feature for this game is the fact that you can use the box for your collection of dead bugs and that it comes with 6 dice - you can play Liar's dice or Last chance with them.

RATING: 5
We played 4-6 games of this a year ago, and it was a blast. However, as I tried to teach this to new players over the following year, it became apparent that there is a high learning curve with understanding the symbols and functions of the various cards. We had played the air-strike rules incorrectly (allowing specific cards to negate hits, otherwise according to the rules, the only defense is the air-cover roll), but agreed a year later to keep playing it per our 'house' rule, as it was more fun that way. Teaching it to new players takes at least 15 minutes, since every card has to be explained, so this is not qualify as a quick 'filler' game. The play mechanic itself should be quick, but it isn't for newbies as they ponder the effects of specific cards. Once the rules and cards are learned, the game could go quickly. However, it does not scale well from 3-4, which seems toe be the sweet spot, up to 6, where a 30 minute game can drag out to 2 hours in team play. Nevertheless, the game is fun as players try to sink historically noteworthy ships like the battleship Yamato or the Iowa. Head-to-head seems broken, as the first player has tremendous advantage, literally blowing the enemy fleet out of the water on the very first turn. There are also some historical inaccuracies  regarding ships and their respective mounts. For example, the Mogami class heavy cruiser had 20 cm (8 in) guns, while the game card said it has 12 inch mounts.

Update (01/20/12): Initial rating was a '7'. It's been several years since this was played. I'm indifferent to this design now, given all the wonderful games that are currently available. Dropping to a '5'.

Update (12/29/12): 3rd recorded play. Played twice with the original group and it reminded me why this is a '5'. It is chaotic and unbalanced. Whomever starts the game has a huge advantage, sinking other players' screening ships, draining them of defense cards, and making them successively vulnerable to other players' attacks. It's "beer and pretzels" fun, like the older, rawer AH's Naval War, with some refinements.

RATING: 7
Strongly evocative of NAVAL WAR and ENEMY IN SIGHT by Avalon Hill (old Craig Taylor designs), as well as Verssen's own MODERN NAVAL BATTLES from 3W (though nowhere near as complex).  The only problem I have with this game is the truly awful ship art on the cards, which makes for a very amatuerish feel to the whole thing.  It wouldn't have taken a lot of research to get this right.

An updated version of the old Naval War.  The three columns of ships and all the defense cards that can be played really help make this game more fun than the old Naval War.  Some of the point values between similar ships seems questionable, but maybe this is balanced between the different nationalities.  Certain nationalities do seem better than others.  The cards are also a little hard to understand at first

Very fast game which can be very annoying. Beside the fact that the battles are fought very unhistorical (which I could ignore in just a card game...) the game is TOO much luck dependent. All games only focus on two things:

1. Who draws the land-based air-attack first (air attacks don´t do damage like all other attacks - they simply KILL the ship - regardless of its type! And while those carrier based have high success numbers to hit those land-based come in one, two, three waves after and WILL hit ^.^). Or - much more bad: Who has the luck and draws two or three air strikes with his staring hand (since these cards aren´t that rare that´s really an option!). Four or five land-based air strikes (by two cards on your starting hand) and only one possibility to defend (if you have a carrier) can really be frustrating...

2. If those land-based air strikes do not make the game at the beginning of the game - well, then most often this game results in the question: Who has left a submarine? Since depth charges are rare in the deck and the destroyers who can play this card will often be destroyed during the battles because they need to stay at the front line... no unit is left to initiate attacks on submarines. I have seen several games when the leading player (six ships with battleships, cruisers etc.) lost the game at the end just because he did not draw any depth charge card... and the submarine shoots and shoots and shoots... 

Simply annoying this game and isn´t it worth.

I've only played this once and my experience was not good.  We played with siz players and nearly all were new.  We wound up calling the game after almost two hours with one side tripling the point value of the other and nearly winning anyway.  Far too long for a game with so few meaningful decisions.  If it played in the time advertised, it would be a decent "take-that" card game with a cool theme.

Dan Verssen back to the high seas in WW2.  He is good at cards, he is good at naval game.  His Modern Naval Battles is quite a blast to me.  Not necessary realisitic.  But they convey how the naval war is conducted like the real thing.  That alone is fun and worth the price to pay and learn the rules.  Looking forward to this one by the Phalanx.

This game could be better. I thought that there were some things that were a bit more confusing than they should be. For example printing the type of card on the action deck cards would have saved a lot of time trying to figure out what it was you were holding. 

Game play itself was enjoyable enough, but there is a lot of luck and If you get a bunch of the air strikes you will win.

Very enjoyable as a light two player game. It gets the feel of a naval battle right, just don't take it as a simulation.

I would give this one a higher rating because the artwork is fantastic, but the symbols were a little tough to follow.  Especially for some of the folks in my gaming group that were a little on the color blind side.

I bought this one because of the nostalgia of Naval Wars.

We played with six players on teams.  For me, 6 players is usually too much and I think the same is true of this game.  I would probably be best with 3 or 4.  No real desire to play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My first card game. It's nice because it can be played with 6 people, all against all other. There are no alliances. The one that doesn't sinks, wins. You can choose as Italy, Germany, Great Britain, France, United States or Japan, all in WWII. Form your ships on the table, in one to three lines of combat plus your submarine, and sink the enemy! Some countries have advantages, like the US (carriers and aircrafts!). So be careful when choosing sides.
I said it's a nice game, but if you want an historical battle or situation, this is not your game. The game is very playable (20-30' a game), but definitively is not a simulation game.

It is an ok game good premise.  The game materials are very visually pleasing and it includes all the parts you need to play in a nice box.  However, the cards are not well constructed.  The laminate on the cards immedialty started to chip at the edges.  Regarding game play; it definately requires more than two people to enjoy.  The game was not as easy to learn or as much fun as the old Avalon Hill Naval War, http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/1674.  My biggest concern is that the rules are not very well organized or written, perhaps because the game was created by non-native English speakers.  There were a bunch of cases that came up in our first game the rules did not have a clear answer to.  Clearly this game has lots of potential but I did not find it to be as much fun to play as I had hoped.  I will have to play again with more folks and see if the pay improves.

Неплохие карточные битвы. Похож на Mag Blast, но гораздо серьёзнее. Очень большая доля случая от прихода карт (есть ещё и кубики), но малая длительность партий (минут 30) компенсирует этот недостаток. К достоинствам следует отнести то, что играть могут и двое, и сразу несколько человек. Понравилась меньше, чем Pocket Battles (тоже военный филлер), так как там нужно маневрировать, есть различные тактики и стратегии. Здесь же игроки производят гораздо меньше осмысленных действий.

Very light and basic wargame where luck decides 95% of the game. Most of the decisions are quite easy and somewhat pointless (except on defense), because extent of the effect really depends on air strikes rolls and defense cards played by your rival. Cards drawn and dice roll is what really matters.

The armies are quite different and they don't seem to be balanced.

I just played one game that lasted 3 hours. Maybe it could have been 1 hour shorter, if we knew how to play, but not more. This is noweher close to the 30 minutes that the game promises.

The game gives points for kills, and I would only recommend playing 1vs1 or 2vs2. Otherwise, I see everybody going for the damaged targets to scavenge points.

Definitly, it's not a game I'm interested on.

Tipikusan az a játék, amiben bőven több volt, mint amit végül kihoztak belőle. A II. világháború vízi csatáit próbálja meg szimulálni a játék, de sajnos nem sok sikerrel. A kockák és a felhúzott kártyák milyenségének szerepe nagy, az utánpótlás nehézkes. Jó viszont a több vonal lehetősége és hogy akár hatan is lehet játszani. Megérte volna ezen a játékon egy kicsit még dolgozni nagyon jó is kisülhetett volna belőle. Így viszont csak egy könnyed átvezető játék lett belőle.

RATING: 7
So, it is highly luck based.  Getting the right cards at the right time and getting good die rolls will win you the game, along with trying to stay under the radar and not getting ganged up on.  There is little to no control, and at best the most you can do to control your game is decide who to attack.  Really, this is nothing more than any of the other take that games, but, I like it.  I like the minor hand management. I like the silly battling.  I have a fun time playing this because it reminds me of playing with toys and blowing things up.

The only thing I don't like in this game is the distinct turn order advantage.  I guess there could be two solutions to this, you treat all battles as simultaneous in a round where you don't remove ships until everyone has taken their turn or you give the starting players less cards to begin with.

Still, it is a fun "take that" card game.  I do have to say that I wouldn't ever play this with more than four players.

Another WWII themed game, and this one is a card game featuring the major powers doing battle on the open sea. The artwork on the cards is nice, but the game felt a little unimaginative and uninspired. This game is also largely luck-driven since you can't just fire your guns every round at will. You need to be lucky enough to draw the proper cards to fire or try to defend your fleet. With that said, the game is still worthy of being a good filler to keep on stand-by.

Culled - First wave; Comics Place contribution

Why we culled it: I purchased this from a friend's store during a clearance event just before he closed up his shop. I'm a big fan of WW2 PTO history and games, so it was a thematic slam-dunk with some neat-looking components. But I had no plan for the game, and really just bought it as a favor for my friend. It sat for years unplayed, so when the cull came, it was one of the first to go, hopefully to a place in which it sees some use.

"Take-that" card game with player elimination, luck-of-the-draw supplemented by luck-of-the-dice.  Typical of the genre, the best chance of success is to attack the player who is being attacked a lot, and is therefore out of defence cards.  That said, we played it light-heartedly and had some fun, but (with 6 players, and deliberately avoiding eliminations) it went on far too long.  Bang! and Family Business are much better games of the type.

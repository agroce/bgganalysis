Realmente un juego que pertenece a una serie tan amplia y que incluso se ha reeditado, no puede ser malo, pero a mi me ha parecido aburridísimo.

Tras un escenario y una campaña abandonada a la mitad puedo asegurar que la gestión que conlleva, al menos en el caso de la Unión (por su mayor número de unidades) es insufrible. Pon fatiga, baja una tropa a la división de fulanito, pon exhausto a tanzanito,... grrrr Demasiada micro gestión. Y ya si utilizas la niebla de guerra, con los marcadores suministrados, es una odisea hasta saber donde está que general, y las tropas que tienes en tal o cual sitio... Desgraciadamente en este volumen, la única posibilidad de la unión es dicha niebla, ante la abrumadora calidad de las tropas y mandos sudistas. Así que lo más probable es acabar con dolor de cabeza tras varias horas de juego.

El movimiento de aproximación y la maniobra de los ejércitos es pesadísimo y anticlimático. Aunque la tirada de iniciativa puede ser interesante, el tirar un dado para mover con valores básicos de 1 hex a 6 de movimiento es prácticamente absurdo. Malas tiradas de forma continua implican una parálisis completa de tu ejército mientras te rodean.

Los combates son escasos y un poco aleatorios y la recuperación de las unidades es leeeenta lo cuál no facilita la diversión precisamente.

Hay eventos aleatorios en el modo campaña que son destructivos y que pueden dar al traste con las probabilidades de victoria de un bando (por ejemplo la lluvia acaba con el jugador atacante ya que hace muy difícil el cruce de rios y el movimiento en general durante varios turnos).

Partes de las reglas son horrorosamente farragosas y repetitivas. Tb. creo que el manual no está muy bien estructurado para consulta.

En su parte positiva, los componentes de la última edición son muy buenos, y el mapa es bastante bonito.

En cualquier caso, yo, sinceramente, solo quería que se acabara ya el sufrimiento. Mucha maniobra, mucha gestión y muy poca diversión.

Como digo siempre... será una simulación perfecta de la 2ª batalla de Bull Run, pero a mi me aburre a morir.

RATING: 8
Superb operational civil war game system. Well written rulebook (always a plus), fantastic maps, and player aids that are actually of use. Low counter density helps players concentrate on position and maneuver. An old review (in F&M, I think) dissed the game, claiming the scale was all wrong; they missed the design intent entirely, in my opinion. The game system only improved with the addition of the remaining volumes in the series.

Todo un descubrimiento, nunca me habia interesado la guerra civil a esta escala pero con estos juegos todo ha cambiado.

Si te gustan los wargames pero no en el sentido ajedrecistico sino en el de desarrollar una historia y ver que ocurre con ella esta serie son tus juegos. Eso si, tienen que brillar en la campaña donde las reglas de cansacio tienen mucho sentido.

Son todo lo que yo le pido un wargame, mi proposito es envejecer jugando a juegos como este ;)

You can't go too far wrong with any of the games in this series, and I love them all, but the later games (Grant Takes Command, On To Richmond) are more highly recommended as a starting place since they aren't so dominated by Jackson's obscene tactical ratings.

An excellent member of this outstanding series of games.  

Stonewall has almost super human powers, but it captures the spirit of these early engagements.  Several great scenarios of varying length.  All challenge the Union player, but attempting to "repeat history" is not as easy as the Confederate player might think.

update: while I still like this title, the release of BaC and frequent play of both RtG and SitV have dropped this title in our frequency of play.

A good title, and very good place to learn the system, but not one of the top four titles in the series.

I do look forward to the re-release.

Players take on the roll of Lee or Pope during the American Civil War, specifically the 2nd Manassas/Cedar Mountain period of 1862.  Wonderful beginning to the excellent Great Campaigns of the American Civil War series.  This is a stunning series of games, featuring low counter density (division) scaled on a 1 mile hexsides.  Units are moved via die roll, neatly simulating the frustration commanders encountered trying to get their troops into place.  The maps are beautiful and meticulously researched.  Excellent, intuitive rulebook, with a wonderful gazetteer of locations included.  And the series only got better from here.

RATING: 8
Balkoski might be my favourite wargame designer. He is certainly one of the most innovative. This game focuses in on fatigue management and manoeuvre. Every time a unit moves it gains fatigue and it can get disorganised. The real tension is knowing when to risk extended and forced marches and when to conserve energy. For the now, this is the only entry in the series I have played, I am impressed with the number and variation in the scenarios. Great game.

Brilliant game system that gives an almost exact feel of operational ACW. Its success can be seen in the subsequent six other games produced. 

BTW, learning to deal with Jackson can be incredibly challenging and also frustrating for the Union. :)

RATING: 5
Overhyped game system.

not impressed by the "roll 1d6-to-move mechanic". Thats ok for a game of ludo but not for a serious wargame. Ted Raicers Clash of Giants has roll-for-movement too but he has done it right by allowing only a limited difference.

not impressed by the rule that excessive fatigue dont reduce combat ability.

not impressed by the nearly limitless stacking ability per 1mile hex which is not historical

as a entertainment game sjw is nice, thats why it will get a 5 from me, but as a wargame its not usable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Still working my way through all of the one-mapper, basic scenarios but this is a system that I really enjoy.  Yes, it is definitely a bit clunk/fiddly when the number of units on the map gets >12/side, with the constant adjustments to strength, organization, and fatigue being made, but it really seems to force the players into interesting and accurate thinking about unit strength/fatigue that other systems don't.  Counter sleds don't work so well as the force markers, which I replace with numbered cubes and keep all of the stats on a separate off-map list or grid instead.  Some of the scenarios are obviously better than others, but all have clear replay value and even beyond this game the system offers lots of variety within the same broad set of core rules.  For traditional hex-and-counter games, this seems about as good as it gets, for me.

This game, like all of the GCAWC series is a good one.  I previously owned all the games in this series, but I sold them all on ebay because I played all of them so much, that I got burned out of them.  In my opinion, the worst part of the game is the quality of the counters.  They have a dull finish and before setting the game up, owners will have to clip the dog-ears off and file the rough sides.  A lot of them were off-centered.  Despite this, I would recommend this game.

I think the system really shines in this entry because the Second Manassas Campaign was one of maneuver. Still suffers from this system's cardinal problems: overly erratic movement system and a horrid CRT.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
SJW is a simple game, with rules that say what they mean, but the game is different enough from others of my experience that I found myself flipping through the rules a bit to make sure that, yes, the rules really did mean what they say. The game can be a bit of a marker farm, with units dragging around strength, fatigue, and demoralization markers with them, and if your idea of action is limited to the actual clash of arms, then this might not be the game for you.

If you like an operational look at Civil War campaigning, though, then you are in good hands with this series, which fits nicely in the niche between grand strategic games like The Civil War and battle-level games like Across 5 Aprils. Using maps justifiably famous for their beauty and accuracy, you'll find yourself worrying over which road, pike, or railway to take to close with the enemy, while balancing the need to get there "first and with the most" against the importance of having men fresh enough at the end of the march to fight and recover from a battle. With no hidden information and action made unpredictable by variable initiative and movement system this is also an excellent game for solitaire play with a history book open on the table.

Jackson's tactical rating dominates play to the point that a friend of mine called this game, "Stonewall Jackson Gets His Way" ... which is another reason why I regard this game as superior for solo play, and maybe not so much for face-to-face.

Yes, they all love it... but for me it felt really dry and no real atmosphere came up.
No clue why - I was just thinking whether the reason that a dr is used for movement calculation might have disturbed (as by buddy rolled worse then me, I could keep him from crossing the river)… but on the other hand, we had a blast with Lee vs Grant. Hm.

This 1992 first game in the GCACW Series by AH is a delight to play. The counters and maps are wonderful as is the easy to follow rules. Two army's maneuvering to strike one another makes this an exciting game from start to finish. A great game for learning history, or just having fun.

Great series with great production values!!  I gave this a 10 because this is the first game in the series and I played!  It is about simulating all the campaigns of the American Civil War (ACW) at operational level.  

The series has a beautiful and natural flowing game system with the right balance between playability and realism.  The rulebook is so informative and well written that every game mechanics is so logically explained that you hardly have to memorise them. The rulebook alone worth the whole game price.  A day by day historical account and insightful analysis of the campaign with hex numbers of the key battle location and cities/ towns is included.  Not even to mention the extraordinary historical game maps, useful summary of tables in the player aid cards, portrait of every major leaders participating in the campaign, lots of scenarios etc.  

Key features include: variable movement of battle force, leader initiatives, morale, force march, train movement, breastworks and fortifications, hidden force strength, logging of ammunition level, flank attack, supply and foraging, etc.  

This is the best operational level game from Joe Bolkoski's (later Ed Beach) on American Civil War.  The variable movement rate is a master of suspense and very authentic to the nature of the Civil War Operations. Many have quibbles about the cavalry use. But I don't find it much of any hassle. Fortification works and breastworks are classified into levels, the higher the more protection. Many game mechanics are simple but operate efficiently as a whole. I find the whole series very exciting and original to the ACW flavour. 

Plus, all the game maps in the series can be joined to recreate virtually the entire conflict in the eastern theatre!!  The best game series about the ACW so far in the history of wargame.  Hats off to the veteran wargame designer Joseph Bolkoski!!

Using the same system as Roads to Gettysburg with a few more strategic options. The Union players soon figured that they were not as good as the Confederates in combat despite their superior numbers. As a result they tended to leapfrog two lines of entrenched brigades so that they would not be caught with their flanks hanging. Also no Union player will ever believe (as McClellan did) that they are outnumbered by the Rebels, so no game will follow history.

RATING: 9
The Great Campaigns of the American Civil War series is solid gold in my book. I find the Civil War fascinating, but my main interest is European history. So it isn't just the period covered that makes it great for me. The games in the series are examples of wargames at their finest. The maps are very detailed and look fantastic, and the games are complex enough to give fine detail to the campaigns but not so much that they require huge amounts of time to play. They have a great mix of playability and meatiness. The historical simulation of the battles is excellent. All of these features combine to give players the needed substance to experience how these campaigns played out.

I was pleasantly surprised what an excellent game system Great Campaigns of the Civil War was after having SJW for years before playing it. I am late getting on the band wagon but I am there now. It may have been more realistic to have fog of war with the units but I am relived the designer didn't that way it makes it very playable solitaire. I have wargamed since the late 60s and GCotCW design is one of the best I have ever played.

I am waiting for the update for this game which adds First Manassas as well as shorter scenarios focused more intensely on Second Manassas.  As it stands, though, this is a very fine game.  I particularly like the Jackson's March scenario, which plays like a quick raid, ending with the Rebs holding on against a Federal tide.  Pope vs. Lee is fun as a solo play, but is quite one-sided and somehow seems to take a bit long to play, given the inevitable outcome.

The scenario that I really love is Rappahannock to Bull Run.  Just beautiful and crazy.  It's long, but not so long as to keep me from wanting to play it badly.

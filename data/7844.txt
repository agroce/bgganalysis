RATING: 9
Three mapper of the final German lunge at Moscow in 1941. Uses the "victory in the west" system with variable strenth chits. Supply rules make it very tough on the Germans as they can really only make a major push on one of the maps. The long game will be a complete whitewash for the Soviet counter offensive unless the variants designed by Tim Alahwhaite are used.Desert island game for me.

I wish I could tie all the credit for this game but I was forced to follow the feedback in the original design. Joe Balkowski had the clout at SPI to turn it into a good game.

Based on one 12 turn playthrough with a group.  I found the game excellent with the appropriate punishment for lack of focus on attack and with surprising tension given that Moscow is only about 16 hexes from the front line.  The system itself with untried units gives quite a bit of fog of war and allows for a good narrative development as for example a Soviet C1 (low morale, low quality) draws a high chit and turns out stronger than imagined.  

Highly recommended, especially with team play.

For years this was the only decent game on the Moscow Campaign, despite its limitations.  For a three-map monster, it does play fast.  But it's extremely challenging for the Germans to win unless the weather really cooperates (which it usually won't).  Even then, it's going to be a "technical" win--it's rare to see Germans in Red Square or surrounding the city in a ring of steel!

One of my earliest "monster" games.  If I recall due to space constraints only played the single map scenarios.
Rated it 4/5 in my teens ... probably a 7.0 nowadays, given arrival of Typhoon (GMT) which spawned the Barbarossa series.

In my opinion, a classic.  I have had 100's of hours of enjoyment playing the game.  My most exciting game was at WBC with Joe Balkowski sitting at the table, commenting.  Supply is everything in Opertaion Typhoon.  Play with the German getting a little extra.

This is a chit-pull system game.  Units are ranked by capability, and letter A-C if I remember correctly.  You pull combat factor chits and the corresponding number is the factor of the unit.  No two games ever play the same.  In my opinion, SPI at its best.  Not an overly complicated game, but it captures the essence of the battle.

You can find much better games on the market today, but I have a real soft spot for this item.    If you can pick one up, it would be a worthy addition to your collection.  For its day, it was a beauty.  In fact, I believe it still stands up today to other games being published.  Excellent looking map, classic box and nice, simple counters.

RATING: 8
Very good: WW II East Front - Operational - Medium

Plus:
-Very playable semi monster (3 maps, 800 counters, a true monster for me has 4 maps and at least 800-1000 counters)
-Great innovative design with untried units creating tension
-Great theme, Moscow works like a magnet but VERY hard to reach
-Great maps & counters: has this wonderful old school feel
-Perfect scale: each action, each unit seems to matter. I love the scale and detail, this as a 1 mapper would not work for me as I have the flexibility here; the 3 maps feel as 3 different games.
-Groundbreaking for it's time and even after 35 years this game is well regarded and talked about. For me a true classic.
-Apparantly the design and development faced big challenges as this game was based on a rough and unfinished design. From what I understand from the designer notes it has been incredible what Balkoski has achieved out of the ruins of an existing design. 

Minus:
-German progress is painstakenly low. Earlier start would have made this game perfect;
-No scenario's from the start of the operation
-German's depend too much on weather and this stalls the offensive. As a result, victory for the German's seem next to impossible. Maybe realistic but it creates a balance issue.
-The designer notes suggest this design was plagued by problems and in the same notes it was suggested why this game could not have been a design about the start of the campaign using the Panzergruppe Guderian system.
Maybe honest but why draw gamers into something they have no clue about? This raises more questions about a half cooked design that needed massive plastic surgery.
Well the surgeon in question was Balkoski and he made a beautiful princess out of a Frankenstein.
So all credit to Balkoski but honestly, who cares this game sufferdd so many challenges? This raises unnecessary questions and doubt about the whole project and could therefore ceate bias in judgeing the game to be a design on it's own right.   

-The designer notes are quite silly. You read the designer's frustration of having to tune a half designed Lada into a Ferrari. Beyond me that designer's notes go into background issues that are incomprehendible for outsiders and this raises a lot of questions. 
At some point the designer even states this game was better of as a design that started at the beginning of the campaign using the Panzergruppe Guderian. Well, why all the hassle of performing an impossible plastic surgery on Frankenstein if you could have done a game from the start using the PG Guderian system?
This is the question that the designer notes leave and it is not a good thing. Joe Balkoski apparently was this famous sergeon but we players never knew there was a Frankenstein on the table. i thought he done it from scratch.
Anyhow, whatever the situation was the designer notes is trying to describe, Joe Balkoski managed to make a great game and more than 35 years after it appeared, gamers still consider this a ground breaking game.

I was finally able to aquire one of my grail games by my favorite designer.
An amazing peace of work if you consider this game dates back to 1978. Great old school feel through typical map & counters, yet innovative system.
Not free of issues (balance, campaign start) but little comes close to this old school beauty.

RATING: 8
Excellent game, really enjoyable to play. The combat system is very Balkoski, with odds shifts for divisional integrity and combined arms, and a non-linear CRT. Of course there is also the unknown strength of all units, using drawn chits. These factors combined together take out the 'certainty' of tactical planning so you need to get the operational planning right. Tough on the Germans, but it gets the right feel for the history.

Initially the Germans look in good position, with their formations preparing to overrun the thin Russian lines. German strengths aren't high, but they get plenty of odd shifts so clever attacks can punch holes. The going can be slow, though, as mechanised units get held up by woods and mud and snow, but if you are lucky to get a freeze and clear weather, plus some roads, you can move along swiftly. Gradually, however, the Russian reinforcements start to filter into the line and German losses slowly mount, and it becomes increasingly difficult to punch holes. If the Germans are unable to exploit gaps then it turns into a battle of attrition, which favours the Russians. 

Tense and exciting, with a great feel for the historical situation.

An epic game, and in my experience the only 'monster' from the dinosaur era that actually works.  Moscow remains a mirage, but it's fun and instructive trying.

The long version is ... long, and a bad place to be for the Germans.  This is a good team game, with two or three players per side, but be sure to place the talent on the west side of the table.  Fully revised rules - version '3'.

The game uses a system that like very well: the well-known Chit pull system used in Sicily,Operation grenade,Patton's 3rd army etc..Playing the game on the German's side is like experimenting surf at the end of the tide.

This is a good game,Highly recommended, especially with team play.

RATING: 9
The perfect monster game. Big enough to give you a feeling of scope and strategy, yet clean and playable. With two players per side you can do a turn every hour.  Couple of caveats...I believe that the Campaign is unbalanced against the Germans, and the least fun section to play is the middle, where a German infanty army must grind it's way through heavy Soviet defenses, one hex at a time.

Simple  (but not simplestic) and basic system means you concentrate on game strategy, not rules interpetation.

Probably a unique SPI monster in that it's easy, quick and fun, yet retains design elements appropriate for the theater.  Our initial play with the original rules showed weaknesses, which are addressed with Tim Alanthwaite's houserules from web-grognards.  One-mapper scenarios take 6-8 hours, and the campaign was finished in a very long day by 4-6 players who had some experience with this excellent combat design, later termed the "Victory in the West" (VitW) system.  I regret waiting 27 years to play this, but other SPI monsters had made me skeptical.

Even if you don't have space for all three maps of the campaign scenario, the North and South pincer one map scenarii are tense and well-balanced games in themselves.

Well-abstracted supply system simulates the Germans' strategic resource allocation problems without getting in the way of the panzer pushing.

Highly recommended. (Wish I had a copy)

Absolutely great game on the 1941 German winter assault on Moscow. The citizens were digging anti-tank ditches in the streets and conscripts were thrown into battle with whatever they had. The Russian Guards and the cold weather stopped the attack within view of the Kremlin. Many hours of excitment from this 3 map/800 counter baby. I have 2 and will probably never sell them.

I really wanted to like this game but I came away disappointed. Although some have called the strength chips brilliant, I find that they add a lot of work and detract from the visual appeal as well. The maps were good though, especially for the period.

Very playable monster game.  Moscow appears on the map as a fortified donut!  The map could have been done in all white, glad they didn't though.  One of SPI's better monster games that has tense play and great historical feel.  Just to get a hex away from Moscow proper makes playing it worth it for the Germans.

RATING: 7.5
Comments based off one play of the northern front scenario using the original rules (see below) and the campaign game played with 6 & 7 players.

------------------------

Probably one of the most playable monster games out there.

The components, while nothing flashy, are solid and nothing to complain about.  The player charts contain most of the rules you'll need to reference throughout the game (weather, terrain, reinforcements, etc...) so flipping thru the rules is minimized.  As for the rules : they are pretty short, easy to understand (especially if you have previous experience with the VitW system), and easily referenced when looking for answers.

The system plays well : Fog of War is imparted thru the chit system, combat has few DRMs (being mainly dealt with by the CRT and terrain columns therein), and movement is just as simple.

Playbalance.  This initially depressed us as the German panzers battalions are quick to burn away especially if you attack at odds less than 4-1.  Regardless the Germans are still able to make good progress until snow, supplies, and Russian reinforcements (those damn ski brigades!) start to take their toll.  As such, I do not think either side has a significant advantage unless the strength chit drawing goes exceptionally bad for one side.

------------------------

A comment on the rules.  There is an updated / second version of the rules available that I highly recommend using.  In short they are the same with a few updates to correct minor issues : Russian supply lines are no longer unlimited, the Germans have more options to dig in as the tide changes during the battle, and the weather has a few added options covering mud and heavy snow / snow buildup to mention a few key ones.  Again - after playing without these rules, I can see where they came from and why they are needed.  Will make a great game better.

I bought this game shortly after it's release (from none other than John Hill, back when he owned a brick & mortar hobby store w/games!) opened the rule booklet and read through the Designer's Notes and credits, thinking I'd learn something about the game from the person who put the game concept and design to paper.

Imagine my immediate and extreme distress to quickly discover a game built around a poorly-worded, poorly-conceived S&T feedback question. A game where the designer concludes his notes to the buyer with the following, and I quote: 

"Just give Joe (Balkoski) a big hand for fixing up a poor situation, and hope that in the future either the feedback questions are better phrased or that the readers do a bit more thinking before they give every question a 9 or 1 just because Nazi or World War II is mentioned. I would have loved to do this game using the PgG system starting at the BEGINNING of the campaign INSTEAD of in the middle. Life would have been so much easier and much more enjoyable."

Of course the Design Credits also listed, count 'em, four playtesters for a three map, 800 counter monster.

I still own it -- why, I truly can't quite explain... as a software developer maybe it's something about finding a perfect example, from my very hobby no less, about getting the requirements right before plunging into (monster) development... 

To see the same viewers giving Typhoon "10's" bash The Gamers GB/GBII.  Thanks to Col. Glantz and others, Russian OB work has progressed by leaps and bounds compared to the Brezhnev era research when this game came out -- alas, it is true, your mileage may vary... but a classic??  Me thinks not...

Great system. One lingering question is whether the situation is the best for the system. Is it at all possible to take Moscow? I believe that eventually the Germans get bogged down in the forest and the game ends in a standstill.

Cute little tile laying game (with a box larger than needed). Art is stunning. Mechanics are simple, but allow for tactical choices. Actions are card driven, so unavoidably there's the luck of the draw involved. Though this is somewhat mitigated through a number of face up cards available for the draw.

While the advanced game spices up the game, I think the power cards are not well balanced to the rest of game play. Overall, an enjoyable game to bring out, once in a while. But the concerns, refrain it from becoming a staple filler game.

Basic rules are easy enough to draw people into the game, advanced rules are where the real game's at. Choices in advanced can seem a bit overwhelming at times, might change with time. One thing that won't change: it's just gorgeous. No matter if I'm losing, I get happy just looking at all the gorgeous tiles.

Played once with 5 players and basic rules. Game was rolling forward nicely, but then suddenly one player announced his victory while everyone else had just 1 or 2 meeples placed. Maybe more cards in hand would have made it better or something... No one wanted to try again with advanced rules.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Was not all that impressed with this one.  The game works, but was pretty bland (only played with 2 players so far).  Seems like with more people it would get pretty chaotic.  Some of the graphic design choices were poor.  The power cards give you a picture of "something" that relates to a power, however you then have to go to a reference card to see what that power does, when it could of easily been on the card.  Also on the tiles, no were does it have the symbol of the its type (on the front at least), so if you are color bind, good luck on keeping the tile type straight, unless you flip it over.  Probably not my cup of tea, and not looking like one i'll play again.

Just read the rules...

Basic gameplay is simple - on your turn, you get 2 actions - draw a card/play a card and can do either action twice or both once.

There are 2 (3 in the advanced game) types of cards - Nature and City (and Power) cards.  Nature cards let you play a tile (and put the nature card in front of you).  City cards (Animal/City) let you either play a animal tile (animal) or put a city tile on a nature tile (city).  Cities have requirements for what needs to be around them (animals and nature tiles).  When a city is "satisfied" players get to put meeples out.  Cities can become dis-satisfied by either nature tiles being covered up or animal tiles running out of animal tokens.  If cities are less satisfied, people lose meeples.  Power tiles add a little bit more to that, but not too much.

Players can also collect nature and power cards and discard them to put a meeple on a game end condition.  The game is over when someone runs out of meeples.  

I'm not sure what I think.  I don't think it's as straightforward as some people are thinking, but I'm also not convinced there's too much for clever play.  It makes me think of Carc - players can help each other, ignore each other, or piss each other off.  I suspect this will play out similarly.  

Don't need to import but will keep an eye out for a US release and other people's opinions.

Gaia is beautifully illustrated, but it is a short, simple race game that largely consists in hoping to draw cards that work well together. Left-right binding also plays a role (i.e., you want to sit to Kent's left). 

We played the introductory game over my strong objections (especially since I was told that the advanced variants are "nasty"). The whole thing took 10-15 minutes and no one seemed to care about it at all. One player described it as an excellent two-player game for two eight-year-olds.

If offered, I'd agree to play the nastiest variant possible. But I hope to not play the watered-down family game again.

We played the basic game. So as soon someone had only one Meeple left, we had to fight this person and therefore couldn't advance. But it was not possible. I think the basic game is broken. Maybe it's better with the additional rules.

Good game that will probably replace your Carcassonne in your shelves. It is much deeper and like it, has tons of replayability.

Try it out, it's worth it!

The basic game is short and lacks depth but that is okay since it is supposed to be played by 8 year old or older I think. Using ALL the rules makes the game quite tough to win but it's still easy to learn.

I have playtested the game once, and the version I tested was better than the commercial release... maybe it's just me too.

RATING: 5
I find the theme of collectively building a world and populating it with your followers, like in "Gods" and "Gheos", very appealing. I also enjoy the mechanics, preparing the ground to build cities via hand management and tile laying, but the game shows strong signs of a first-time designer. There is no apparent attempt at balancing. There are too many city cards with a joker terrain icon and they are intrinsically better than the ones that must be built on a specific terrain. This could have been balanced via the cities' needs, since requiring food, which must be replenished from time to time, is much worse than adjacent terrain types. But it's backwards: joker cities are the ones that don't require food.

The manual includes rules for a basic and an advanced game, but the former is lackluster and the latter, with the possibility of cities being stolen, very chaotic. Also, with only two actions per turn, it's not rare that you take several turns to prepare to build your city, just to see that perfect spot be taken by an opponent. The special power cards that directly destroy cities are sensibly optional (probably a publisher's decision), but even the one that exchanges two adjacent tiles can be devastating. Maybe the best way to play is using the advanced rules but removing the power cards completely.

The production is decent, but I would have welcomed less generic meeples, and it's a bit annoying that you can't choose your colors in two-player games (but at least one of the obligatory colors is yellow). The artwork is not my preferred style, but it's pleasantly colorful and has some charm. The box is not very big, but it could have easily been half the size.

A beautiful tile placement game in which you are trying to be the first to get rid of your meeples.  Your meeples can be spent on accomplishing missions (by laying combinations of tiles over the course of the game), or sent to cities that you can play onto the tiles.

The main problem is that there are some cards that are strictly better than other cards in the deck, and this ruins the experience for whoever happens to draw them.

Very original and very intriguing game.
The problem is the control and the number of players.

With basic rules you should play with 2-3 (4 tops, but it's probably too many).

Advanced rules (even without 2 the most devastating elementals - which are optional) introduce more randomness/chaos so 2-3 players is max in this case (I've played with 5 and the game is not only wildly chaotic then but also broken).

I'd love to check the game with 2-3 players (and with both sets of rules).  We'll see if I have an opportunity...

This game should NOT be advertised as the one accomodating up to 5 players...  This is a very cheap marketing trick.  '2-3 players' (or just '2 players') on the box and suddenly there is a lot more happy (and a lot less angry) people in the world.

What can I say, I'm a sucker for tile laying.  You need to know that there's no point in playing the basic game unless you are playing with kids under 8 (and even then some of them can handle the advanced game).   Don't judge this on it's basic game, you have to play the advanced version to really get a feel for the game.  Even then it's not a heavy game or a deep thinker. What it IS is a clever little tile laying game.

Qu’est-ce que Gaïa? Pour vous donner des référants ludiques, je dirais, Carcassonne (placement de tuile), Civilisation (construction, édulcoré!) avec un peu de gestion de cartes. De 2 à 5 dieux s’efforcent de prouver à l’autre sa capacité de créer un monde fonctionnel, dans lequel les besoins des peuples sont comblés avant même qu’ils n’y vivent. Ils doivent y implanter leur civilisation avant celles des autres! Dieux étant ce qu’ils sont, possèdent quelques éclairs, volcans et sécheresses dans leur sac pour nuire à leur divin voisin (un peu de Take That qui fait du bien!)

La mécanique de placement de tuile est faible. Il n’y aucune restriction à poser une tuile ici au lieu de là. L’aspect stratégique du placement réside en la capacité à se souvenir de la dernière pige de citée que son adversaire à fait dans l’optique de ne pas lui facilité l’implantation de sa civilisation. Ah ouin... y’a aussi l’aspect mémoire qui détient une certaine importance.

Les règles de base évitent la confrontation des Dieux en omettant le vol de citées, les missions de pouvoirs et certains désastres. Honnêtement, évitez cette version, passez directement aux règles avancées, ça ajoute un peu plus de substance à l’expérience.

The graphic design is very attractive, and the components are nice.

The game idea looks cool, but it doesn't work with 4-5 players. It has too much "take that", and it's impossible to get the 5 meeples placed because there's alawys going to be someone who will "take that" you, it is too easy to do that. Our games were a race to get a couple of bonus points (the ones that can't be stolen from you) and then it was a matter of saving good cards in hand in order to be able to get 2 more cities on a turn where you already had one on the map... This is not fun and I don't think it is what the designer had in mind.

It might work with non gamers who aren't constantly thinking about getting the best odds of winning, and probably the take that effect will be reduced with 3 (and even more with 2) players.

Nicely executed hype campaign but the gameplay content feels quite unengaging. There is some building up to the right moment to make a move but that's about it.

Lighter area control through tile laying and card drafting. Appealing art and theme (world building), Family rules a bit too bland but advanced rules promotes a little too much aggressive play (stealing/attacking) for us, from what appears to be a lighthearted family game. Longevity concerns.

A cute Populous spin-off that look gorgeous but plays a tad random, considering the luck of the draw and the chaos factor that is other players. I found it a tad frustrating that most of the time, players would win just by "stealing" one of your buildings by adding a necessary resource. In my two games I have played, someone would always win because another player put down a structure in the first place. Maybe it is just wrong strategy on my part but it just feels very counterintuitive to a building game. The disaster cards are fun (as usual in Sim games!).

Great game where you have to optimize card draw and card play.
Can't wait to try the power cards.

Gaia is an odd one; the basic version is too simple - a quick and easy rush to points. It's too gentle.

The advanced (or full?) game is too long for what it is with too much take-that and constant pegging back of players. This is possibly made worse with more players where you can 'accidentally' be set by another player being attacked and your pieces just happening to be in the vicinity.

I think this needed more development; with special attention paid to the bonus cards.

Je ne suis pas fan des jeux de pose de tuiles.. matériel correct. Il y a bien quelques idées plus intéressantes que les autres jeux de pose de tuiles, mais trop de chaos pour mon gout.

Plays like an abstract strategy where a lot of the game is setting up positions/card advantage, 'take that' and out thinking your opponent. Feels like a euro filler but is really a strategy game with a fair bit of depth.

Small world building game (in really unnecessary big box, let's be honest here) that in basic form is playable with everyone and is really family-friendly. With addition of action cards it can please experienced gamers and the game time is long just enough to keep everyone busy thinking about winning strategy and enjoying the play. Very neat game that can be shown to everyone and played anytime with a simple yet very nice art.

Naturplättchen legen und mit Städten und eigenen Meeples bevölkern. Sehr schönes Artwork und Design, gutes Spiel, leider sehr einfach gestaltet und daher schnelles, etwas enttäuschendes Ende. Erweiterungen und schwierigere Regeln werten das Ganze allerdings auf.

Lovely game with beautiful components and relaxing but interesting game play.  There is some take that-interaction between players when using the power cards, also strategic choices are more present when using the power cards.

[thing=163920][/thing] is a sort of racing game with tile placement, hand management and area influence. Each players has a number of meeples, and the goal is to put all of them in play. This is done either by fulfilling goals of cards used (terrains and/or actions) - the first to fulfill one puts a meeple on the goal card; or by placing or taking a city - most cities required specific places to be put and demand types of terrain around them (each have four demands, and the player must abide to at least two in order to place it, but a player that is able to fulfill more conditions can take the city) - if two or three demands are met, the player puts one meeple on the city; if all conditions are met, two are added. Yet, even when all 4 conditions are met, actions cards can make big changes and allowing even the safest of cities to be taken. The game ends as soon as a player puts all of her meeples in play.

[thing=163920][/thing] plays well, with a fast pace due to low downtime (players have two actions each turn: draw a card and/or play card - the same action can be done twice). It offers a nice set of decisions in its small playing time. 

Yet, much of the game can fall into luck or lack thereof. Though the mechanism provide ways to lessen this impact - cards can be drawn from one of the open ones, or from the draw deck - often the cards drawn blindly can decide a game, as the race towards fulfilling the goals doesn't allow much in term of lost actions.

Overall, [thing=163920][/thing] works well enough for what it purposes: a light filler with constant (albeit normally easy) choices to be made, a medium amount of take that with the action cards, some luck and interaction in the central area. Not brilliant, but pleasant enough for a 30 minute playing time.

Played the simple variant. Light tile laying game, you win if you are able to place all your meeples.

Nice little game. Plays faster than Carcassonne. There is a little player interaction with the advanced rules. Easy to learn and play, with a great art style. Light strategy, don't overthink your actions, just roll with it.

Fits well into the family category for those who like a bit of take that as well as strategy to their game. Even if you don't like take that games you can remove cards to eliminate this or add extra to make it have even more take that.

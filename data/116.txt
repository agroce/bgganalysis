A very light card game that is fast and easy to teach, even to non-gamers.  It is very luck dependent, and there is definitely some imbalance to the action cards.  But for a 20 minute card game about collecting severed heads, I can give it a free pass on depth of strategy.

This game is easily learned in a few minutes. The goal is simple: You are an executioner during the French revolution and you get points for lopping off the heads of the most notorious enemies of the people of France. Black humor rules the day for this game. Players get strategy cards to disrupt the opponents' chances at better victims. Re-order the line so you get Marie Antoinette and your opponent chopper gets the shame of taking the head of an innocent victim.

Guillotine plays quickly and is the sort of game where you say "just one more time" and keep playing.

Goofy little card game with a silly, humorous theme. :p It's fun and can accommodate many players at once. The more players, the merrier. The little guillotine is a nice touch. It's not good at all with 2 players, though; way too long for a game so random that has no sense of narrative.

Cute game to ease your pre-teen into "real" games, or to play if you're very tired and/or drunk.  Not bad, just not my cuppa when I want to do serious gaming.  Consider a good alternative to Clue or Yahtzee, as opposed to the typical fare on Boardgamegeek.

Fun filler.  Loads of player interaction.  I like the "ka-chop" when I pick up the heads.  Who knew the French Revolution was so much fun?  (Just kidding!)  Well worth playing, fun too.

Not rated higher because the screwage is paramount.  That is, there's so much screwage that the game becomes push-pull without any other mitigating factor.

Want a sweet, simple, seemingly brainless filler game? I tried Guillotine today with 3 players and it went surprisingly good for such a basic game! Will I get bored of it in the future? Hard to say, we shall see! For now, I can see myself racking up quite a few quickies in the near future. UPDATE: Another keeper! This is game I'd bring to a non-gamer household as  filler. Played this at the cottage with brother-in-law and sister-in-law. A hit with my sister-in-law.

This is the probably the simplest game to teach others. And every action card is very well illustrated and explained. With the right group with the right humor, this is a great game.

A nice card game that has a lot of luck but also a lot of fun! I believe it's better with when you play with 3 players. When we play 4 we include another round to minimize the luck factor a bit. Never played it with 5, I believe it won't be good enough.

Lighter and more random than I was expecting/hoping: the action cards are pretty varied but they don't allow any deep tactical moves beyond averting imminent disaster and screwing other players.

RATING: 8
This is a game that got me back into gaming after a long absence.  Yes I know I gave it a ten over such great games as Dominion and Ticket to Ride, but the reason for this is because of how much fun my family and I had playing this for the first time.  I don't think I have laughed that hard while playing the game.  Yes it suffers from some faults.  The palace guards have a point value that can ruin the game if somebody gets them all and some of the description on the guards about what the cards do needs more.  But beyond that, I have fun when I play this game.  There is one other thing I would change about this game.  The colors on the cards need to be changed.  I am color blind and I have a very difficult time seeing the colors on the cards in particular the military set and the government set.  I wish more game companies would take more time to think about those of us who can't see colors as well as others.  (Ticket to Ride gets an A+ in this regard by putting symbols on the cards and colors.)

Actually own two because I'm prone to giving this one away when I find that others enjoy playing it. Its easy to learn, and plays fast. The theme has been criticized as being 'tacked on' and I suppose you could make a case for that, but I just like the game. Its about cutting the heads off wealthy French people. Whats not to love?

Nice filler/party/gateway game. Easy to teach and choices have impact on the result. Still luck-based as you could expect this kind of game to be. Recommend at least two house rules:

2. When a new day begins, just continue play in turn order with next player.

UPDATE:  I've dropped from 8.5 to 8 because some of the novelty is wearing off, and let's face it, the game is mostly determined by chance.  However, it has been a great way to introduce some people to the world of gaming.

We often play that each player can name at the start of the game a unique noble for which he or she scores an extra point (e.g. I name the Piss Boy).

Not much depth here, but the game is enjoyable. It's mostly a tactical game, the line keeps changing so you're not really sure of how your action cards will interact with the line until your turn comes. Maybe it's better with just 2 or 3 players.

This game really ranks low with me. I still keep it at a '5' because it really seems to warm up non-gamers to the concept for some reason. The theme is really good, and that alone makes the game worth a look, but game play becomes really tedious after a few games. A few house rules can improve the game quite a bit, especially something to allow card play on opponent's turns. Overall, this game is usually successful for a group with both gamers and non-gamers, but you'll need to find something much more fun as the gamer ratio rises.

Guillotine is a decent filler: amusing, fun, and reasonably quick to play. The implementation of the theme is quite humorous, the art matches the lighthearted take on the French revolution, and the game is accessible to new players. It is highly dependent on chance, but for a game of this weight and play time I don't find this problematic. There are a few overly confusing cards (e.g., Master Spy), and despite the obvious competition for the highest value heads, there is often a feeling of helplessness resulting in a lack of tension and competition. Other short fillers provide this tension, and are preferred to Guillotine for this reason. Nevertheless, it is a decent game, suitable for some (relatively) mindless entertainment.

This is really fun.  Played it a couple times with my mom, sister, and grandma.  I want to play it with some people who are a little more competitive though.  But I really enjoyed the general idea of the game and it was an interesting play.

RATING: 7.9
Rated higher - there's not much to it but its great filler for any sized group. Fantastic to play before/after/in between "proper" games. Rules are super-easy and the cards are fun to play. No strategy to speak of but for what it is, it's great.

RATING: 6
The text on the cards is too various and too small for everybody to read and grok. This game would be better once you can just know what a card does on sight. But then with that kind of knowledge, you will still be subjected to a a lot of luck in other people's cards. This doesn't bother me, but it might bother others.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
*Update* dropped a point for the sheer randomness and how that one action card can freeze the line-up (and the game), especially with fewer players. Sucks the enjoyment right out of it.

A decent filler.  Would play if I was very tired and didn't feel like thinking too much.

RATING: 6
A nice little filler that doesn't outstay its welcome.  This is such a virtue among cheaper card games, as I'm discovering.  While the random element is a major part of the game, the way it plays out encourages enough planning and strategy that it doesn't feel like the game plays itself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Believe it or not, a light-hearted look at the job of an executioner.  The cards are diverse, and the artwork is very funny.  It's a strategic game that plays differently every time, as the characters and action cards are randomized.  I like the elements of manipulating the line and your opponents, it's a very fun game.

Pretty sure I've mastered this game as I am undefeated in all my plays of Guillotine.

I admit that my one play of this game was enjoyable, but I think it has more to do with who is playing than the game itself.  It certainly sets an atmosphere of light-hearted gaming for a few minutes and I can see doing that once in a while.  But, it's not a game I'll be looking to play.

Easy to learn for all ages and plays quite quickly. We omit the 'Callous Guards' card, as what is the point of not being able to change the order of the line, whole point of the game IMHO. Can get slow with more than 5, 3 or 4 seems to hit the spot for us.

This game is quick and fun - if it has any issues, it's that it's quite difficult to catch up with a runaway leader sometimes.  The luck factor is quite high, so a run of good cards can put a player unassailably ahead, whereas a poor hand is really difficult to recover from.  However, the game's very quick to play so, if you got hosed in the last game, there's always time for another!

This game held my attention for about 30 seconds.   And that's being nice.  Unfortunately this is just a game of "hope I get good cards".

Fun game, but there's NO possible long-term strategy, especially when there are more than 2 players. Each player can so radically change the lineup of nobles that you simply have to react to the situation when it's your turn, rather than plan for some greater goal. For what it is, it's a fun game. Good beer & pretzels fare, but no more.

For the amount of luck involved in this game, it's still pretty fun. The theme is great. It's easy to teach and has always been a winner with new gamers. If you play this game to win (ie seriously) you wont have any fun. It's intended as a light game for some laughs and it fits that genre well.

My fiancee and I played this two player and enjoyed it. The theme amused us, as did the relatively limited choices you have each turn. I remain firmly convinced that, due to your ignorance about your opponent's hand, you always have a single "best" choice every turn. Surprisingly, it's still fun to figure out and then make that choice, particularly when it foils the hopes of the opposing side.

UPDATE: This game is really random, but it does allow you to screw with the other player...a lot.

UPDATE: 5 -> 4. I have come to realize that, in my current game collection, I will almost always prefer another game to Guillotine. But I have fond memories of discovering this game still.

RATING: 2
I can't decide whether this is better or worse than [thing=770]Loot[/thing], but it's yet another chaotic, random mess of a game.  Why do people insist on making me play these things?  In [thing=116]Guillotine[/thing], a row of cards of varying VP values are dealt.  On your turn, you take the first card in the row.  Before you take said card, you can play an action card from your hand.  Action cards vary widely in ability and usefulness, but mostly just allow you to change the card at the front of the line.  So the entire game comes down to playing a card from your hand card that gets you the biggest VP payout this turn.  After about 20 minutes of this, someone wins, but, really, everyone loses.

I was initially taken rather aback by our theme. A direct ancestor of mine got guillotined by those bastard revolutionaries! But hey, no need to go out of my way and take offense at stuff in games (enough people already get all into a huffy about slaves and the like...). So, I chill and go with the theme's flow. :)

Sadly, I found the gameplay just ain't really there. We had our laughs, but nobody's clamouring for another session... One of those games I ought to one day drop off at a charity shop.

My first "new" card game. Bought it in London in 2007. I love it, my wife loves it and everybody else we'd played with loves it. In spite of it is nasty and full of negative interaction (or maybe that is the reason) everyone wants to play it again, so that instead of being filler, this game often ends as the main course of the game evening. Very simple, easy to learn for newgamers. Great theme, simple mechanics, hilarious graphics. The best range is 3-4 players.

Anniversary Purchase (5/6/10)

Rules read (5/13/10).  Seems like a fun little game.  Everyone should like it.  I wasn;t too worried about the theme when I bought it, but am worried now about some of the artwork and cards in the game.  Not sure about my nieces or in-laws getting a "Piss Boy" card or the spurting blood card....  Don;t know when it will be played because of this.

I'm down to play this with people that genuinely enjoy it. The theme is fun and it's brisk and light, but this is NOT a good game. It's literally all luck.

I dig the queue thematically, but the "decisions" aren't interesting - you always just want to try and grab the highest number, or avoid a negative. Parade is infinitely more satisfying for queue management.

This is a rather nice quick filler. Rules are very easy to understand and the bright colors and the art on the cards is funny to look at (who said “piss boy”?) which is a plus as this game is a game non-gamers understand. What makes the game interesting is the addition of the action cards which vary wildly and truly spice up the game! Each game is short so it’s actually one of my favorite non-heavy-thinking filler games.

I must of played this game over 50 times now. It fits so well as a filler type game for me. I like the decision making with what action card to play on a turn and which noble to go for while setting your opponent up. It's good to go into this game to have fun because there are doses of luck and randomness that can frustrate some. There still is a good amount of strategy in this light game as well. A few of the cards seem overly powerful I may take them out for a better game. This is a game I have definitely got its value out of and I am not finished.

I like this game despite its randomness and chaotic nature--plans can get disrupted with the sudden end of a day, a shuffling of the execution line, or forced hand-passing.  The game runs quickly, the cards are self-explanatory, and the game is short enough that the chaos will at least end quickly.  It's funny, quick amusement, and I'd get it if I wanted another short game to play with non-gamers.

Before you play this the first time, read through the text on the cards and establish some house rules, to avoid arguments over unclear text later.  The gameplay is meant to be lighthearted, so play it that way and you can have a good time.  Even if you don't mind the theme for your kids, you might still find some of the images inapropriate.  Works better for couples, once you work through the rules.

Wow! My original rating of 5 was based on a few months in the hobby. My second play after 4 years brought this thing down to a 2. I do not see a single redeeming feature.

Guillotine is, in some ways, the two-to-three player version of Family Business. Granted, you don't represent a mob, but it's a specialized card deck that revolves around killing people (in this case, French nobles during the French Revolution). Guillotine has more strategy, more variety of cards, more action than Family Business, but it becomes to random when four and five players are involved.

Remek játék, gyors és vicces.
Csak akkor érdemes játszani, ha nem sértődögetnek meg a játékosok, mert ez egy eléggé "a másikkal kitolós" játék.

Én csak németül tudtam beszerezni, de a neten le vannak fordítva az akciókártyák. A fordításokat kinyomtattam akkora méretben, amekkora hely van hozzá a kártyán, kivágtam minden kártyához a megfelelő fordítást, aztán ráhelyeztem a német nyelvű szövegre a magyar szöveget és végül ráragasztottam a kártyára a fordítást öntapadós átlátlszótapétával (a legtöbb írószerboltban kapható).

Mivel évek óta nem vesszük elő, eladásra ítéltem.

Light and fun!  Emphasis on the light.  There are decisions to make but are mostly obvious.  The benefits of the game come from a humorous cards and theme, and very quick teaching time ... which makes it a perfect gateway for someone looking for a card game that's a little more involved than say Uno.

Collecting heads of slaughtered monarchs for victory points.  Though light, there is a bit of tactics to be found.  Action cards allow one to manipulate the queue of characters awaiting slaughter, may provide victory points, or interfere with your opponent.  Quick fun.

RATING: 10
One of my favorites for game night.  Works okay (but not great) with only two players.  Play an action card, Take the next card in line, take a new card.  Strategy increases as player count decreases, because there's a better chance that things won't change much before your next turn.  EXTREMELY fun game with plenty of screwage.  5 players is way too many = too chaotic.  4 players is fun, but still a bit random. 3 players is the sweet spot for me!  

My set started to show MAJOR wear, so I sleeved the cards using Mayday premium sleeves.  It stiffened them right up again!

RATING: 7.5
Excellent game. It's a light game with some luck. But you still need to think about what you're doing, and you feel like you have more control than in, say, Ticket to Ride. A perfect job of implementing a theme, in a lighthearted way. I'm not a fan of dark humor so the theme is slightly appalling. However, the gameplay doesn't really feel darkand it's hard to take it too seriously. 
I would give it a higher rating if there were more cards, to give more variety, and less screwage.
Overall, excellent game.

RATING: 7.5
One of the easiest and most fun light games. Definitely a beer & pretzels game. You can play this with all first-timers and are guaranteed to have a lot of fun - as long as it's a fun group.

It says for 2-5 players, but it worked fine with 6 players.

Just enough "Screw your neighbor" options to add some dark twists to the game. It;s a very light-hearted look at the French Revolution. No gore or harsh images. The artwork is quite good, and the cards are very funny, from Marie Antoinette to the Piss boy. Tons of replay-ability, as there are many action cards in the game.

Finally, the price is right, at somewhere between $10-$12. For about what one person spends to go to the movies, a small group can have hours of fun. Tremendous value.

RATING: 6.5
A fast, simple game with a little more strategy than I expected (still not much - I expected pretty much nil). It's fun if you're in the right mood - more of a social event or filler than a contender for "let's all sit down and play a game". It helps that it's cheap.

Guillotine is a cardgame with fun, if rather macabre humour. It is a fairly simple game to play: it just involves you moving cards to the front of a row and bagging them. The fun comes in from the numerous cards you can annoy other players with, and, very important, the people you play it with. I didn't like the effect of some cards though: they locked up the game completely.

Another game that feels a bit too chaotic and random to me. However,  I have never played it with just 2 people - I suspect it might play better with only two, as then there&#039;d be a lot more control - and thus the game wouldn&#039;t feel quite as random as it does when played with five people.

RATING: 7
Card order controls a lot of your fate, if you win or lose.  Playing with new players gives you an advantage but playing with seasoned players it is fairly obvious how play will go.  Who wins is a mystery as the luck of the draw can beat a solid strategy. With that said the cards are fun and its a nice quick game to play.

I like that this scales well for 2 players or more, and has enough variety in the cards to keep things interesting.  This is a reliable standby for us.  The game involves making the best use of the many action cards to grab the best score you can in the moment.  There is a bit of attacking, so this game isn't suited for those that just like to "play nice."

RATING: N/A
The theme bothers me and I don't find it humorous. The gameplay is small. The game is effective. I don't need it in my life, and I am more talking about just it as a game and not the thematic content. 

I definitely don't need this thematic content in my life. I don't like sanguine people that do not know how to live in a respectful manner. I don't even care that you can logic your way into thinking that how you are, makes sense, as evidenced by. As evidenced by what? Go be you somewhere else. I have a reverent world to attend to that I care about. Your kind of world offends me. And it is loud also. So don't pretend that it is just me with a problem. You wouldn't like my kind of world at the same volume either. I guarantee it. And believe me. I have turned up the volume a bit before and could do it again.

Beer and pretzels? Throw popcorn all over your body and roll down the table. Crunch, crunch. Bang. Table breaks. Win. 

How risque you daring person you. Playing that game that everyone wouldn't always. Depends on who they were and how the material was presented.

Get them to lick the crunched popcorn off of the table now. Similar.

RATING: 7
Components: Great caricatures of the various nobles, both historic and imagined. The action cards are particularly well-done, given the general mediocrity of action cards: each has a unique, superfluous illustration, and some have easy-to-follow diagrams to help with comprehension.

Experience: The clever part of the game, that of manipulating the order on death row, is enjoyable. The use of action cards to achieve the manipulation isn't particularly creative (though perhaps it was more so at its time of publication), and the game can be rather chaotic, with noone's collection of nobles being safe from tampering. Still, I enjoy it, and it was one of the first card games I ever played that exposed me to the world of non-standardized decks.

With only two players the chaos is at a minimum and it really shines. There is opportunity for strategy and budgeting my hand of action cards as players mine the line of nobles for the valuable ones first, then eventually find clever ways to foist the gray nobles on each other.

With more players, the game is too short, and players have too little control over their fates. At the same time, there is less incentive to target other players.

Pretty fun, light game. I revised a few of the cards to make the game more fun. ( Added some MTG themes...discard at random, "counter" a card, etc). Good 2 player game though, if you dont want a long game and something easy to learn. Takes under 5 mins to learn and game is maybe 20 mins to play.

RATING: 7
A light fun filler, but after a few games I feel that it kind of plays itself.  The decision around which card from your hand to play is usually fairly obvious and the game interaction between players is minimal.  If the game allowed you to play cards out of turn, I think the fun would ratchet up a bit for me.

Comparing [i]Guillotine[/i] to [i]Family Business[/i]  I think I prefer the latter because of the added chaos and "take that" elements found in [i]Family Business[/i].

EDIT (Jan 2014) - I do enjoy playing Guillotine quite a lot despite what my comments above may imply.

It feels like it wants to be a fast, random-ish game but folk were just taking too long to take their turn. 

I blame the large variety of cards combined with the potentially large size of hand and lack of informational graphic design - if there were fewer to read OR they were better presented to highlight the relevant numbers and keywords (maybe with a couple of icons) then checking through cards would be a lot faster.

It's my girlfriend's sister's favorite game, so whenever she visits (once or twice per year, since we leave abroad) Guillotine hits the table more than once. The theme is not that disgusting if you take it lightly, as it's intended, and the gameplay is simple but fun. Not the deepest of games, but some times you just need that relaxing and laugh filled half an hour.

The Scarlet Pimpernel is one of my favorite stories ever, so I really expected to like this game.  I found it fun, nothing really bad I could say about it, but it didn't exite me either.  I'd play it every once in awhile but I wouldn't buy it or suggest it at a gaming session.

This is a fun light game of line manipulation. Twelve nobles are laid out in a line and on your turn you take the Noble who is in the front of the line. Nobles range in worth from five to a few negative numbers. There is a deck of special cards that lets you do all sorts of mischievous such as rearranging the line or raiding other players hands or scored nobles.

One unfinished play.  We were playing it while waiting for a late-arrival to show up.  We quit once he arrived.  Even though we didn't finish, I got the jist of it.  Very light, quick fare here.  The player relies a lot on the luck of the action-card-draw in order to maximize points.  It's fine for filler.  Probably too many chaotic "take that" cards for me to rate any higher.

I have only played this twice so far, so this rating is based on first impressions.  This is not a game I would normally buy, but it was requested by some of my friends who are into politics, because of the theme.  I was really pleased with the card artwork. The gameplay was simplistic and random, as I expected, but it seemed to have more fun potential than I thought it would.  I need additional plays to decide what I think of the gameplay.

First game I played in a long time. Attended a gaming night with a friend, and ended up playing hours of this before discovering we were playing it a little wrong.  We still keep the variant we created, and play it often.  Varient: during each player's turn, every player has the option to play at most one action card.  adds to the complexity and slows the game a bit, but makes up for it in the colaboration; everyone's closer in score, cause everyone's shuffling the line.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fast pace card game, having as theme the beheading during the French Revolution. The cards have fine art, rules are easy and game play is smooth. Players are dealt the action cards and a row of sentenced persons (8 cards) is ready to be executed. Each person has a prestige number. The higher the social status the person had in that era, the greater his prestige number. Each player is trying to behead the most ‘radiant’ persons acquiring the most points. The other persons are left for your adversaries. Action cards will decide which person has priority on the guillotine over the others. Some persons might also give you negative results if beheaded (not everyone sentenced was really guilty). After each row of sentenced personalities is executed one game turn has elapsed. After 3 game turns the winner is the one with the most points acquired. A fun game with unexpected results till the final death sentence!

Fun, simple, & quick game that most gamers and non gamers enjoy. I see it a lot though, and get burnt out from playing it.  But I think if the game had little lego guys (or dolls with velcro, whatever) where the heads actually came off and you could collect them in front of you, well then it would probably jump up to a 10 in my book. It would go to 11 if you could have a working guillotine that actually takes the heads off.

This is an excellent game.

It is very random, strategy whiners need not apply.
It is in poor taste, easily offended people should steer clear.
The mechanics are incredibly simple, a 3 year old can play if you explain the cards.
It has a surprising level of depth, with all of the cards available, and a limit of only playing one per turn, it becomes excruciating to make decisions at times.

This is one of my favorite "little" games.  Most "little" games are awful.

Light little card game. Not very deep but lots of laughs and screwage.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
For a game with a fun, slapstick theme, the game is rather boring.  Gameplay is pretty straight forward and uninteresting.  You always want to grab the most points while attempting to screw other players, and 90% of the time, your choice of what card to play in order to do this is pretty obvious.  Thus, the game just comes down to who was dealt the better cards for their turn order.  Furthermore, gameplay and perhaps certain cards can make it so that not everyone gets the same number of turns.  In the end, the game is more theme than game and the uninteresting gameplay ends up making you wish you were in the guillotine line instead.

This is an interesting card game of 'Off With Their Heads!!'.  I really enjoy the artwork of this game and it also plays fairly quickly.  The biggest thing that keeps this from being a really good game is that you have very little control in the game at all.  Not only is there a lot of luck in the seating order, the arrangement of the nobles, what action cards you have in your hand but also what cards people draw and use to screw you up.  There are other multi-player cards I would rather play, but there are definitely worse options out there.

It's a fast, simple take that card game. Its most welcoming virtue is its length - it manages to get in, be humorous, and get out before your attention span is lost. In a world of viscious rabbits and supposedly funny small characters from the Wizard of Oz, this game is a gem.

This is a fun game. There isn't any deep strategy and there are some "take that" elements. Rules are simple, easy to learn and teach and the game plays quick. The over the top, dark humor theme of beheading nobles during the French revolution appeals to me.

A very simple random game. You have cards to shuffle your intended target to your target point but getting your target is simply dependent on getting the right cards. Has some nostalgic value for me (my rating reflects that) but it cannot stand up to competition offered by games like High Society and For Sale nowadays.

[2 plays] Fun little game with amusingly grisly theme.  So far I've found this moderately enjoyable.  Not sure if further plays will tilt it toward "I want a copy" or toward "I don't care if I never see this again."

This was on of my personal gateway games into the hobby. I had a blast playing this game the first dozen times with a fun group of people. Great artwork and great "execution" of a peculiar theme. However, repeat plays quickly reveal how utterly random the game is. Even the cleverest hand management is no match for the variety of action cards in the game. The best play is usually obvious and there is almost no way to plan "ahead" (snicker). So in the end it's a game without strategy or tactics. But it's still fun.

(As of [b]?[/b] plays) An entertaining light card game with a short learning curve and a cheerful theme revolving around the brutal decapitation of the French aristocracy.

Apart from Loot, Guillotine has to be the most-played filler card game in our gaming group--and for good reason. Its theme is hilarious (nobles lining up to be guillotined) and there's a lot more strategy involved than you might expect. It plays well with anywhere from 2-5 players and it rarely stretches beyond its half-hour recommended time. Guillotine is always good for a laugh, and serves as a perfect mental cleanser in-between heavier games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I purchased this on a whim because the theme was historical and quirky, both of which appeal to me.

Guillotine is a light game for up to five players that holds to its play time. Your actions are limited by the cards in your hand, and there are enough cards that some hands can be ineffective.

Make sure that the concept of taking heads doesn't bother you before you buy it. It's tongue-in-cheek, but not deliberately offensive.

I don't often select this game to play any more, but neither do I reject it when someone else requests it. Still fun, and welcome in all but the most serious of groups.

RATING: 7
Fun filler card game, if you can handle the slightly gory theme.  Each turn you play an action card that does things like alter the arrangement of a line of nobles, and take the noble at the front of the line for points.  Some of the cards are a bit macabre, but if need be you can always remove the few cards that you find offensive or less than desirable.  The gameplay itself is quite good.

I love this game. It's simple and fun.
Played it 20+ times.

I mostly play it 2 player, just me and my wife.
With more players it's still very fun UNLESS you play with someone who just doesn't care and wants to give the win to someone because they feel like it. That can ruin it (but that comes with any multiplayer competitive game). 

The game is quick to set up. Quick to teach. Quick to play. Turns are fast and fun.
It's fun to play action cards, avoid the negative cards, and try to snipe the best cards. 

Great game! Buy it. GREAT value.

This is one of the first games I picked up for my wife (who happens to be a French teacher).  Started our love of gaming.  Nice quick game, but action cards are not effective enough to make the game any less random.  Definitely could use something to make hand management a bigger deal (maybe a draft, maybe just a way to swap cards out), or maybe just more cards that allow you to interrupt your opponents play (although that might slow the game down too much)?

RATING: 4.742
Bit of fun, athough there is one card in the pack (Callous Guards) which seems to upset the balance of the game (or actually the intention of the fun of the game - - but then I guess, with the card, there will be one person having fun).  An initially amusing (descriptions of people "in-line" are worth a little chuckle) filler but not expected to be a long term return (14/12/08). Update: Yep - really doesn't do it for me (4/4/11).  UPDATE: Rating dropped to 4 (and game dropped as well). UPDATE 3SF 4.742 Jan 17.

RATING: 6
Ha! This is a rather fun card game with a cheeky theme. I'm not too sure how much skill plays into it, as the action cards are so random that really a player with a strong hand will trump a player with a weak hand every time. However, there's enough variety in the cards that you have to choose which will be the best to pull out, and there's some strategic moves to make when rearranging the noble cards. This is light fun, and a definite improvement over some the more random card games, like Fluxx, which can screw you to the point where you have no control. Guillotine at least makes you feel like you are in control and can hold onto it for a bit.

Chaotic to the point that it destroys any strategic and tactical play. Barely a game and lacking any fun factor: a random take-that game for those lacking frontal lobes. Avoid!

Fast and fun game about chopping the nobles' heads off. Quirky humor in the action cards and cartoony graphics make it one of my favorite fillers. Yes it's luck-based, but it makes people laugh so no-one complains about that. Lots of creative ways to mess with your opponents is a big bonus in my book ;-)

fun and funny filler which at times can lead to clever plays. Nothing groundbreaking, or brain melting here just a solid fast title that can easily be introduced to nongamers, and enjoyed by gamers.

A great game, but most of the cards have text that is crucial for playing the game.  

This seemingly obvious and trivial fact was something that didn't dawn on me until I started to pull out the game to play with my fiancee's family, none of whom are native English speakers.  

We ended up playing Carcassonne and Coloretto instead.

Update: Not a bad game, but not one likely to be hitting the table anytime soon.

A fun game for 2 to 5.  It has a light feel and plays quickly, the cards are amusing.  The only drawback is once you memorize all the cards which only takes about 4 or 5 plays it's much easier for people to analyze the best move and play can slow down.

Rating based on one game.  Seems pretty chaotic, but there's fun there.  I found a copy in a Salvation Army thrift store that seems to be missing a single action card.  Wizards of the Coast replaced the missing card so my hat's off to them!  

Gave my copy to a friend.  Found another thrift copy and sold it to a member of the SAG.

RATING: 6.5
You play cards from your hand to alter the line of cards before the guillotine and then take the first one in line. You keep doing this to try and build up combos of cards that will get you the most points at game end.

Good game for non gamers, to start the night off with or a filler in between long games. Light but fun.

Many thanks to my friend John who introduced this game to me.

Simple play, great filler game for the whole family. One set of cards (laid out in a line) represents the French Nobility awaiting their turn on the chopping block - and each Noble is worth points. A second set of cards is actions that enable you to manipulate the order of the Nobility cards - play one action card and then take the Noble at the front of the line - simple - but of course some Nobles are better than others and some actually have negative effects so getting the right one is the objective. Card art is cartoonish and fits the game, cards are good quality.

Played 20+ Played 2,3,4&5 player, no particular preference. It is light, it is funny and it plays in 20 minutes even allowing for the inevitable and desirable table banter. The only glimmer of "clever play" might be to hold back on playing your more juicy cards until the last day of executions. We play with your points openly displayed, this does mean the leader gets bashed but the prospect of mentally tracking others scores seems out of keeping with such a light fun game. Feb 04

A simple game with no strategy.  Fun because of the theme and light-heartedness.  Historical distance is what allows this horrifying subject to be light-hearted.

I think Guillotine is enjoyable enough, but there's very little depth. It's difficult to plan for even your next move, so mostly you just take the action that helps you out the best right now (and then do the same the next time, and the next time,...).

This game is loads of fun... It plays really quickly, and has plenty of 'screwage'. Very popular in my lunchtime gaming group, and has taken over from Give me the Brain as their game of choice.

Very light and fun game. Theme is funny enough for 3 games in a row (but no more).

I really really really want an expansion. Just a few cards to add for variety.

Very light in strategy, perfect for a pick up when people are tired or kids. A little bit of competition but all very light-hearted. An expansion would make it an 8.

Serious gamers: stay away. It is very much in the Munchkin category.

Before Fairy Tale, this was the game that me and my wife took everywhere with us. Easy and fast fun, with some limited and mostly obvious strategy, but sometimes the cards give you too many tempting options and the game gets really interesting. With many players this becomes too chaotic to really enjoy, so it's best with 2-3.

Do take the time to read the action cards.  If the players get into the game, it can be quite funny.

I've only played this game a handful of times, but I've liked the plays I've had.  For a fairly grisly theme, the illustrations, card titles, and light play make it a pretty funny game to me.  If fact, I don’t think it would be near as much fun if it was a line of dream dates waiting on your doorstep, for example.  I don't like it nearly as much as several of the other light games that I own, which brings it's rating down a bit as well as keeps it from seeing the table that much.

This irreverent game has theme in spades (Ugg) but is a simple trick-taking card game.  I liked the names, the descriptions, and even got past the dark theme of beheading.  However, the game feels too light for my taste, and I would prefer a better trick taking game such as Spades or Oh Hell!.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fun card game with an humoristic theme: decapitating nobles during the French revolution.

I think it acts as a good filler and I believe that despite the randomness of card shuffling, it works out with tactics.

Played with 5-players.

Amusing concept and design but with 5-players it felt entirely random. There was very little you could do to control winning and losing.

A decent enough filler. Its problem is that the world is full of 15-20 filler card games and it didn't stand out for me. Games like Battle Line offer more strategy. It's one big benefit as filler is that it claims to handle 5-players. Based on my experience I wouldn't recommend that, though.

Easy to learn and easy to enjoy. Though the rules may be simple, there's plenty of strategy in this fun little card game. Great for just two players or a group. For you drinking game players out there, Guillotine is loaded with potential! All in all, an instant card game favorite of mine.

First played this on April 2nd, 2007.  This is a easy game to learn and is a quick play.  We played it with 3 people and I can see this being more fun with additional people.  It has a bit of a take that in it which typically goes over well for our lunch time group.  I'd recommend giving this a game play or two, however you probably will find other games that would be in your normal circle of games to play on a regular basis.

A game about the guillotine that's somehow adorable and charming, in no small part because of the colourful and humorous artwork. Fairly simple to learn, came in second on my first play and felt like I actually knew what I was doing for once.

RATING: 8
Players take turns playing action cards on various people in line to be beheaded at the guillotine, these cards alter the order in which the people will be beheaded. The person at the front of the line each turn is beheaded & the player whos turn it is gets the points for that person. The next person in line then moves to the front. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

When I got this game some years ago I played it a lot with my mother. It's great with 2 players and looses it's addiction with more players because it gets more chaotic. Still it has great art, a nice macabre theme and some harsh cards to annoy the other player(s).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I've only played this two player and it seems to be the type of game that only shines with a full compliment.  With that said, I think the game is pretty straightfoward and light with a tiny injection of fun.  Some of the cards are way better than others (especially the 'all grey cards are worth one point' card).  I'd usually only give a game like this a five, but the theme is really hilarious in a dark, morbid sort of way.  Some of the card art just cracks me up ('Where's the head?' is my favorite).

Update:  Other games have taken this idea a lot farther and so Guillotine takes the hit for its shallowness.

RATING: 7
Cute game and graphics from the creator of Smash Up, easy for all ages. Printing is a little small. Good filler with a "take that" approach. It's a shame the box is so poorly designed for the contents though. Sleeved and put into deck box. Could use a few more "negative point" cards maybe. Buy a second set and customize your own decks?

The best part of this game is the humor and art on the cards, which makes it fun for  new players.  I feel pretty "meh" about the game now that I know what I'm doing, though.  It's cute and fun, but seems to involve more luck than strategy, and my analysis-paralysis challenged friends really take the fun out of what should be a fast and silly game.

Sep08: Alright, I've played this one.  I've joined all the masses that still play this game.  Was it a hidden gem?  Well sort of.

It was very humorous.  I loved the pictures on the action cards.  It also played fairly quickly.

Were there interesting decisions?  Well, sort of.  If you had a fist full of action cards, picking the best one sometimes took some thought.  The decisions were pretty light though.

For the most part, I'll keep it around as just a light "take that" filler for the family.

Another great game for the non gamer. It is easy to teach and quick to learn. The only problem I see is that the way the rules go for who starts the next day will skip people in a 4  player game. We fixed that by just keeping the turn order the same so who was next to go in the clockwise order takes their turn.

The theme of this game is great fun, with the artwork being particularly good. French royalists or those of a very sensitive disposition could take offence, but everyone else should be able to appreciate its hilarious Blackadder-style approach to history (and besides, those French aristocrats really did deserve all they got). Beneath the theme is a card game of very basic principles (it can be taught in a couple of minutes), with a fair degree of variety introduced by the cards. With 2 players the game offers some scope for  tactical play, but with 4 or 5 it is essentially a game of luck (which is rather a shame as this means it doesn't get played very often).

Initial Rating: 5.0 (October 2011)

I have never liked this game, it is way too random for my taste. The game theme is pretty cool but not enough to attract me to the game. I also admit the art and components are ok, the guillotine is a neat feature too.

As I said before, the cards are too random, you have no meaningful decisions and it carries the “bash the leader” mechanic a bit too far. Basically, the luckiest player will be the one all the other players try to take down (and probably succeed). I don’t enjoy games when you mindlessly throw destructive cards at the current leader. 

I will oppose further games of this, at least it plays (somewhat) quickly.

so far, a good amount of fun for me. Nothing brilliant in terms of depth and in this case that's fantastic! It's played very well and is quite enjoyable. The cards are illustrated well and have a sense of humor, the game is pretty quick and easily picked up, and the wild shifting of the line is a lot of fun. The special effects of playing cards is a good time.

Remember to always move the spy to the back of the line (hard guy to snatch, him) and let the fun fly. I have a good time playing this as a filler and am glad to have it back in print.

Why do games with no control or decision making get called &quot;filler?&quot;  Wouldn&#039;t you rather fill time with a _game_, not just mindless card drawing?

Try Web of Power or Through the Desert and leave this one in the rubbish bin where it belongs.

RATING: 5.5
This is a light game that I think is okay.  Always seems to end too early when I'm behind, or continue too long when I'm ahead but I think that is more due to the luck of the draw than anything.  The biggest drawback is how many turns you get to take depending on how many players there are (as there are only 3 days total). More plays shows I have less and less interest in this game, went from 6 to 5. (Update: went to a 5.5 as it is a good way to get newbies to play games)

RATING: 4
Mindless fun. Enjoyable if not taken too seriously. Adults and kids can play equally. No skill involved other than how to use your action cards. But the sheer variety of cards, with plenty of "screwage" and lots humorous characters make it a surprisingly fun ride. Critics say it's too much luck; they're correct, but this game is almost more entertainment than "game".  Most certainly would get boring if played too often. Update: With time I've found better substitutes like Cartegena.

Rearrange the procession of victims in order to get the heads of the most valuable. This is a decent starter game with some minor strategy involved, but it's not one I'd pull out regularly… there are better ones out there. (Rumble In The House, for example)

MINUS: bores fairly quickly

Not at the top of my list, but my friends all enjoy it. I think with just 2 or 3 players you'd be able to play with a lot more strategy (which I would prefer), but I usually play with 4 or 5, so you're just making the most obvious tactical choice on your turn. Still, quick and enjoyable. Take a moment to enjoy the names of the action cards and the ridiculous art.

RATING: 7.3
Guillotine is a good game.  My biggest complaint with games of this type is that actions are interpreted completely differently by multiple people.  My group though, we play to keep it simple, keep it fun, and if it sounds right, go with it.  I just put the notice out there as interpretation may cause others to become upset.  As well, with most other "take that" games, YMMV with enjoyability.  Good game though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Funny game, the first few plays.  That mostly wears off, and it seems like interesting decisions are few and far between (although by no means nonexistent).  It feels like there should be a way to tweak this one to improve it, but frankly there are too many other good games asking for our attention.

This is a very simple, very fun card game in which players collect "heads" of state amongst others.  Great fun & can be played multiple times in an hour.  It was one of the first strategy card games I got my wife to play & she enjoyed it a lot.  It was from this game I managed to get her to play others.  It's also a great family game & fits well into the "beer & pretzels" genre.

In direct comparison with its predecessor in theme Family Business, Guillotine is a dumbed down faster version which actually is a good thing for this kind of mindless fun game. Why should I bother with strategy or clever card play when all that counts in the end, is getting picked on less. This game has recognized that. Still not a good game but at least 5/10.

My wife and I have played many, many games of Guillatine (2 player).

It is the kind of game that you can play on the coffee table while feeding a 3 week old & watching AFV on TV.

Very light, cute theme, Guillotine is the lightest filler game in my collection.

We've played with more players and it is ok.  It seems to be more chaotic with many players, more tactical with 2.

Played many more times, not a bad warm up game.

The only reason I don't rate this lower is because of the unusual theme and the speed of play.  Basically the game is completely random.  The choice of which card to play is always pretty obvious and you only need to add up someone's points to figure out who to go after.  I'm not sure why anyone would want to play this unless they're not familiar with better games.

I'm not anti-luck, but if a game is going to have luck I only prefer to have one mechanic be luck based. In this game, you have the luck of the draw and the luck of the order of the cards vs. your turn order. Combined it makes this game less fun for me than say For Sale.

Card game replete with "take that" elements, switcheroos and nice Quinton Hoover art. Random and with few difficult decisions, but would be inoffensive if there weren't cards like Callous Guards and Scarlet Pimpernel that completely shut down all attempts to catch up. Thankfully I haven't had to put up with the cardboard guillotine.

Guillotine is one of my favorite card games. I&#039;ve worn out four sets. It&#039;s probably the best filler game I own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun for 2 or 3, but choices are usually obvious. I think the theme helps it a lot. Sometimes you have to balance grabbing cards that are good for you against preventing your opponents from getting cards that are good for them. Most of the time, though, you all want the same cards, so grabbing and preventing are the same thing -- luck plays a greater factor than tactics.

For games in the 'light medium' category, Guillotine is one of my favorites.  It's a game that appeals to gamers and non-gamers alike because it's easy to teach but requires some strategy to win.  With the exception of looking up initial hand size, once you know the game, you never have to review the rules again, even if it's been a year since your last play.  I like that in lighter games.

Enjoyable card game that is featured around the French Revolution. The game pits rival headsman attempting to lop off the heads of the most influential nobles. On their turn players may choose to play an action card from their hand. After they must execute the first noble in line of the guillotine. Each executed noble scores the number of indicated points on their card. Actions vary from arranging the order of execution to hating on players. Highest points after three days is the winner. Absolutely love the theme and the addition of the guillotine in the game. Quick enough that I'd consider playing it almost anytime.

RATING: 4
Guillotine is a perfect example of dark humour: if not for this one, I'd say that's impossible that a game that's about beheading people could be humorous. Personally, I find it funny, but I can see why makes some people feel uneasy.

The gameplay is so simple that can be easily explained in a minute. Indeed, I'll explain you how it works: the game consists of three days. Every day, 12 nobles are put in a row. Each turn, a player might play a card, "collect" the first noble of the line and draw a card; then the turn proceeds clockwise. When all the nobles are collected, a new day begins and 12 other nobles are prepared. At the end of the third day, the player with the most points it's the winner. That's all. 

The simplicity of the game joined with a bit of "take that" mechanisms and a fixed ending makes this one a very good filler, which leads us to it's main drawback: the strategies are almost nonexistent, and the tactical decisions are just moving a noble or two through the line.

If you want a simple filler and the theme doesn't scare you, it's possible that you find it funny and enjoyable. The game is cheap and the components not only have good illustrations, but also are very functional, so you aren't throwing your money away.

This is a weird game. Ask me to play it and I'll probably say I'd rather not. Get me to play it, however, and I'll probably enjoy it. But once the game is over I'll go back to not liking it. I think that must be due to it being so random.

If this game didn't have such cool art, I'm sure I'd rate it lower. At 20 bucks or so, I definitely think we overpaid considering how much fun we've had with games we've found much cheaper at thrift stores.

Guillotine is fun and relatively quick, so it's hard to play long enough to really dislike it.  There is a large amount of chance involved, so it's not for everyone, but the occasional game is usually fine.  There are often rounds with special cards flying, until someone finally runs out.  If you're lucky, you'll get to see the occasional clever play as well, though often more because of opportunity than skill.

[2007.Apr.09] A light, fast filler game that is definitely not meant to be taken seriously. When it's your turn to be the headsman, try to collect [if you can] the most hated... er, valuable nobles' heads.

[2007.May.24] Probably best played with less than 5-players. With five (or more) players, the cards are simply picked up too quickly.

Played 3 times.  My first play must've been a fluke, or I was in a very forgiving mood.  This game sucks - it is the newest addition to my "Never Play It Again" list.  Creating a plan and getting it going was a waste of time - in other words, I felt that I would've done better, and perhaps had more fun, if I had gotten up and walked away between turns, returning and examining my options quickly before essentially randomly choosing a card from my hand.  Doesn't rate lower only because it's reasonably quick.

The theme and the mechanics are great. It play pretty well and it is playable by anybody. The first time I played, we could play any amount of cards from our hand. It made the game pretty chaotic but it was still fun. The second game I played, we could only play 1 card per round. This feel somewhat limited. It was also hard to play a permanent cards that gives you points because the cards can only be played if you have a good character to kill. So instead, I would propose playing 2 cards to increase the amount of possible combinations without making the game too much chaotic.

This is a nice light and quick game where you don't have to strategize too far ahead, often you'll choose your action as your turns come up.  It works quite well when you want a laugh or need to fill in some time.  The games 'story' is perfect and works very well with the mechanics.  Always a laugh.  Lots of great artwork and card names.  Will probably be buying when i next see it for sale.

As much as I like dancing til I'm dead, I prefer decapitating fictional French stereotypes even more. This is a point/set collection game where you are basically executioners trying to collect the heads of nobles that are worth the most points. Another great filler game, and we have at least 3 copies in my larger game group, so it gets played a fair amount.

Card game with hilarious premise.  Players are in charge of guillotining many prisoners that are awaiting death "in line".  Prisoners' positions in line can be altered by the players as scoring is based on innocents being saved and the guilty being beheaded.

Pretty good game. Played this a lot at PAX East 2014.  It does involve a lot of luck but the cards in your hand usually help mitigate some of the bad luck you may encounter.  There is usually one or two obvious choices to make during your turn.  The real fun is when someone busts out a combo of actions and completely surprise everyone and throws the entire game for a loop.  Suddenly you're faced with a bunch of bad cards and need to do your best to make the best of a bad situation.

Also, I really like the artwork and the thematic nature of this game.  The humor is great too.

I bought this in hopes that it would fill a niche for quick, light card game with some capacity for clever card play and screwage.  It is neither of these things.

RATING: 5
A simple card game where you have a line of French nobles that you are trying to execute.  You want to execute the highest value nobles.  Most cards have special abilities and you can use those abilities to adjust the order of the line or eliminate certain nobles.  

It is a light, filler game, that I have found fun.  I have played it a couple of times but there are other games which are better.

Simple game, purchased with the aim of playing in pubs/restaurants etc.  Looks like it will be suitable for that apart from the long layout line. 

Quite a lot of card reading and sometime you struggle to figure out which is the best thing to do especially if your opponents have not played action cards and you picked a few up then they can be sat there waiting for you but they didn't seem to mind.

Winner used nice diversion tactic of telling everyone someone else was the leader and let everyone pick on them instead. Maybe a little difficult to tell who the leader actually is, if you were worried about that sort of thing of course.

Trival points: box design is ridiculous for what it is and stand up guillotine discarded after first play. A tuck box will suffice. Its currently residing in a ziplock bag!

My daughter bought this game on a whim. We just couldn't pass up a game with the subtitle "The revolutionary card game where you win by getting a head."

If you are willing to have some fun with the theme, the game is fun to play. There are lots of special cards to mix things up - the skill is in playing these to your best advantage. The play is lighthearted and the strategy is pretty shallow, but fun nonetheless.

Overall, not a great challenge but a fun, quick play. Assuming, that is, that you can immerse yourself into the macabre theme.

Theme attracts most people. Drawings on the box and on the cards are really nice and playful. They make you forget that you are actually chopping the heads of people in this game. Is a nice game for a few times, but once you know it, becomes rather boring. Too much luck , too little control over what happens, too much reading of the cards.

2-5p, 30m, age 12+. People say they've worn out decks, so it must be fun.  I picked this up when it came back into re-print October 2005.  It is quite light, and it meant to be played lightly, but still has interesting card interactions.  A few of the scoring modifiers remind me of San Juan (Palace Guard points per card = # of Palace Guard cards = {1,4,9,16} = I win!)
But in the end it is not to my taste, being both too light, as well as too fiddly.

Traded away in August 2007 for SimCity TCG (which ended up being unplayably dull...)

Wonderful theme, really well put together, but it is very luck driven and doesn't offer too many real decisions. The optimal play is pretty much usually based on who's near the front of the line and what cards you have to get the best one to the front.

Still, it's fast and really fun, so I'm almost always happy to play it as it's flaws are far outweighed.

This is really a below average game that benefits big time from the perversely amusing theme.  With any other theme this would be a 3 or 4 at best, but the cartoonish art, the cardboard guillotine, the historical context and the whimsical execution of the theme just tickles me.  The player who draws the better cards will most likely win, but that doesn't matter that much.  It is just very fun to play (but not too often).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Will rate when have played more, but so far this is a good, lightweight game that makes us laugh.  It's boxed up small enough to take to the pub, though you'd need a fairly large table to line up all those nobles who (to paraquote Queenie from Blackadder) are just desperate to have their heads SNEAKED off.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

EDIT 12/18/2013: I played this game quite a bit when I first got it.  However, it's really a 'play a couple times with each group, and then never play again' type of game.  The humor's funny and clever, but it's best not to beat a dead horse.  This is the problem with humor-theme games.

RATING: 9
Plays 2-5. Great game. There are a few cards that we remove to make the two-player game more enjoyable - Scarlet Pimpernel and Robspierre. The game has some interesting strategies with two players.  

Rating based on strength of 2-player game. Doesn't scale well. When played with the upper player limit the game shortens, individual choices diminish and the impact of long-term line manipulation diminishes. 

Recommended house rule: Callous Guards last until end of day or until owner chooses to discard it. 

4-9-08 2-p Loss 30-31 to Karen
4-29-08 2-player win 52-34 vs. Karen

RATING: 6
This is really fun with two but I think it would be better with more people.  An unfortunate side effect of the action cards is that some people have to re-read them on each turn so they can play optimally.  Maybe a sand timer would be a good addition for these players.

This game involves varying the order of a line of cards which represent the nobles lined up to have their heads lopped off.  Each turn the head of the noble at the front of the line ends up in your score pile.

Enjoyable, fast, light filler. A large amount of luck with the cards that are available.  Quick to teach, although the rules could be clearer (eg re # action cards that can be played on a turn).

Fun, quick card game with great artwork.

Best lite card game in my collection. I can play this with gamers or non gamers and everyone loves it. Easiest game to find players for!

I haven't played this since I changed companies but I'm sure it will come out again at the next family reunion.

Update- still my favorite light party/family game but it just doesn't make it to the gaming table any more so I can't justify it as a 10.

Coup and Love Letter have replaced this game...

RATING: 7
Fun enough filler. Really luck of the draw and no real decisions, but you can't go wrong with the beheading theme! Fun "end of the night" card game. No real depth except as a reason to laugh and hang out with friends. Edit: The more I play this game, the more I like it. I think because it is not a filler pretending to be a "big" game. It is simply a great filler. It is silly, easy to teach, lots of moments to screw with your friends, and funny artwork.

1st played this at a friends and I just had to have it!
I have already "burnt" though 1 deck and will sleeve my new set
we play both by the rules or house rule
house rule is playing 2 action cards, taking only one noble
(unless double feature or like cards are played)
drawing 2 if 4 cards in your hand and 1 card if 5 or more in hand
2-3 players work GREAT, feels like there is more to do and doesnt seem to "break" the game

Another fun, filler game.  Incredibly easy to teach to new players, and everyone has fun beheading people.  There's definitely some imbalance to it, but everyone enjoys the goofy drawings on the cards and really gets into the game.  Not any deep strategy to it, but there's enough diversity among the cards such that no game feels the same.  Great game for introducing new players to the gaming world.

The game plays out with a line of cards (the people to be beheaded) and cards in the players hand to change the order of the line.  Each turn the player can play or draw a card, and then takes the person to be beheaded at the start of the line.

Game in a Nutshell: Line up and execute nobles and other dignitaries. Players score points according to how prestigious the people are that they behead so messing with the line-up is key to ensuring you kill only the most important characters.

Played as: 4,7 player

Pros: A great fun theme that thankfully the designer didn't rely on solely to get people to bring it to the table. Has some good, simple card play and decisions on how to improve the line for yourself and stick other players with a dud. The artwork fits the game perfect and points for the little stand-up guillotine gimmick.

Cons: With so many people tweaking the line-up, it gets to feeling pretty chaotic. On top of that, you generally don't have a huge selection of cards to work with so don't rely on having a strong sense of control. Too bad the beheading part isn't more then just picking up the card at the front of the line.

Other: Here's a fine example of a game that shines it's best when taken with a grain of salt. It's a fun idea with some decent card play mixed in to keep it from relying completely on theme alone. But make no mistake, you need to play it in the light nature it's intended if you expect to appreciate at its fullest. If you want a tighter game experience, there's plenty of other fine fillers out there.

Best Use: A 'beer and pretzels' type game for four-ish people.

I've played with 2 and it's really not very interesting.  I think it might be a bit better with more...or with kids.  Really I think the action cards aren't very interesting.  On your turn you move a high point noble to the front of the line so you can collect it.  That's pretty much all you ever do unless you're out of those cards and stuck playing something else.  Is this really that much better than something like UNO? TRADED

A quick game with a low learning curve -- it touches on some interesting elements but ultimately doesn't really expound on those -- hand management could be more interesting, for one.

RATING: 6.5
Fast, simple and fun! This card game falls squarely on the "beer & pretzels" category. A good filler game which has a morbid theme of re-arranging the line of nobles and other personalities who are about to be beheaded on the guillotine. Players vie for the highest scoring personality while trying to force low ranked ones onto other players.

In Guillotine, players take turns executing French nobility, trying to execute the highest status nobles in order to score the most points.

It's pretty fun, and there's lots of great interactions between players. You can easily sell this game based on the theme.

I traded for this and we have enjoyed it thus far. It's excellent for what it is, I'd say. A nice, light game that has some thinking but not too much, is easy to teach and not too serious. A lot of fun.

A light card game built around gallows humor.  It uses a very simple "tweak the system with cards" mechanic that often creates choices between messing with opponents and improving your own position.  Although this is definitely luck heavy, the game is quick enough and enjoyable enough that the luck of the draw is more fun than frustrating.

Oh man... I made the mistake of bringing this game to the bar I work at... now, my boss is hooked... no, not hooked, addicted.  We had a particulalry slow night last week, so we played for maybe an hour and a half until customers showed up... then while I handled customers he asked to see the box for the game... and proceeded to go out in the hallway and play it for another 3 or 4 hours!!!  I think that removing the game from the bar is terms for extermination at this point...  good thing I love the game!

A funny little filler, which hooks you on first sight. After the hilarious cards and simple mechanics become familiar, it unfortunately boils down to luck.

This is yet another one of those games where luck of the draw, more than careful play will likely determine the winner. This can frustrate those who like to win or lose on their own merit.

Guillotine is a decent game with some funny cards and a funny theme.  It's not a bad filler game to use as a warm up or wind down game for a game session.  It doesn't have any problems, but the fact is that there's nothing really special about it.  There are better fillers with more strategy and more decision making.  This game is pretty straightforward and unintersting strategically.  It's not bad, but I can't see ever playing it when I have better options.

This is simple little game and I would need to play some more to get a proper feel for it.

Good fun group game. Not particularly hard or strategic. Easy to learn. A couple of the cards are a bit annoying and are worth being removed IMHO (Scarlet Pimpernel and Callous Guards) since they shut down the game.

RATING: 8
Short game for 3-5 where you get points for beheading nobles during the French revolution.  It's a great between-games game or a short game for the end of the night when you don't have time for another longer game.  It's been in my group for a while and it's always a fun time.

This is a great filler game.  The rules are simple, it plays quickly, and it is silly (you are scoring points for chopping nobles' heads off).  

There is a lot of text to read on all of the cards, and sometimes it is a bit too random (especially if you are playing with more than 3), but it succeeds very well as a great filler.

RATING: 5
Got this as a gift a long time ago. Good for playing a couple times a year, as part of a card game night. Bonus points for being a card game that can also play to the theme in a physical/literal sense by having the cards lined up in front of the guillotine, so you can actually see these people getting closer and closer to their doom. A nice touch in a genre that is typically very abstract.

Note: I have only played this with my wife. The game might have added entertainment value with 3 or 4 players. As a 2 player game, it's average.

Filler in the vein of Fluxx.  Very luck driven with some interesting card interactions.  Maybe I'd give them another half point if there was an official tie breaker rule since most games are very close in points.

RATING: 5
You have to know what the special abilities are on the cards to really have a grasp on any strategy in this game. I'd say there isn't much since you're mostly just making the best of whatever hand you're dealt, and that is usually fairly evident.

A pretty good "light" game; quick to teach and strangely good as a party game.  We often play this after a heavier strategy game, or while waiting for players to show up.  However, I've played it way too many times -- it's just not deep enough to hold my interest anymore.  There are only so many possible Piss Boy jokes.

Filler.  In principle, I'm not a big fan of anything that glorifies the moral, cultural, and intellectual disaster that was the French Revolution... and it's kind of disturbing that you get points for the most/best heads that you have cut off...  But from a pure game perspective, it is a mildly entertaining specimen with enjoyable artwork.

One night my wife and I were over at another couple's house.  We brought the games.  We busted this one out thinking it was going to be a quick filler game, but our hosts insisted on playing ANOTHER FIVE TIMES after the initial game.  I was ready to burn the game.

After a couple of years, I think I'm now ready to play it again.  Every once in a while... long, long, long while.

RATING: 6
Much of one's enjoyment depends on what one brings to the table with this one, as in itself it's an okay design that's at least easy to teach and play. But if players get into the spirit of the theme--and make appropriate guillotine decapitation noises--then it can be pretty fun. 

I like the opportunity to add extra cards to the 'line' and thereby increase the score. There is some screwage factor, and players must be clever in how they reposition victims' cards in their order in line in order to score. 

It's not exactly titillating to play, but on the whole I like it. Too bad that the cardboard 'guillotine' that comes with the game isn't wide enough for cards to slide through it--would have been a nice touch. Another plus is that it doesn't take too much time to play for what it is. Definitely better with more than 2 persons, although as of October 2010 I'm not sure what the sweet spot is. It's more fun the more players get into the spirit of things. 

Acquired in trade, March 2010.

The point of the game is to actually read the cards, laugh at the pictures, play a little strategy maybe, and have fun--not to take your points and run cutthroat-style.  So we take out the Robespierre and Scarlet Pimpernel cards because they're not interesting, strategic endings like Ticket to Ride, just cards that make the game shorter and unsatisfying.  Losing this game is no big deal.  The Bad Nun and the Heretic are my two favorite cards.

One of my areas of specialty is French Revolutionary History. I was looking for a quick play game as a fill in (we play a lot of Atlantic Storm, Naval War, Mamma Mia etc if the main game of the evening finishes early).

I saw the reviews of Guillotine and picked a copy up.

A great game - easy to play and lots of player interaction. It has proved a strong favourite and we have been using it a lot as an introductory game for non-gamers. I'm surprised how often they ask for a game next time they are around. 

Plays well with 2-6 players.

Use special action cards to manipulate the draft so you can maximise points with your pickup, but in such a way so that players aren't tempted to play their special actions whacking you. There's lots of luck in what value cards are accessible to you on your turn, and with the action cards you get, and if you get hit by an action card, but the game is fun for the length, there's a nice little decision to make each turn with what action card to play, and it suits its intended filler genre nicely.

I still like it, but my husband and I got tired of 2 player. It's too easy for me to predict what he's going to do, and I always beat him, which isn't fun for either of us. Too dull. I like playing with more people because it's harder to predict how things will go.

Like the game.  Hate the (virtually unusable) box. Annoyed to find that the earlier version came in a proper box. Curious to find some folk repelled at the theme - forgetting that about 50% of all games simulate some form of killing. If you are turned off by the theme, then try Opus Dei, which is a virtually identical game, albeit themed around philosophy and religion rather than the French Terror.

This is one of the first games I was introduced to and 10 years later I decided to get myself a copy. I played it a couple times and my non-gamer friends seem to love it. I've grown very bored of it though now that I've been exposed to more games. It's an OK quick filler but nothing amazing.

This was a pretty decent little filler. A very quick game with pretty simple rules. I wouldn't mind playing this one again if I was looking for something fast.

RATING: 7
Fun card game, the guillotine that's included is a bit silly (but it doesn't have any influence on gameplay, it just indicates the front of the line). 

We bought the German version at Essen '09 and that has a less silly guillotine, which doesn't take up half the box.

(01/18)

Guillotine is such a simple game, you play a card and take a card, what you did determines what card you get. THAT'S IT.

It can be cuttroath or it can be nice, it depends on the people you play with.

it is fun, quick, you might to think ahead but some cards can change the cards at play and mess up with your plan.

Who can play?  Family game for 2-5 players.

A classic for the whole family, if the "Off with their heads!" thing doesn't bother you.  I've played the game so many times, I know what the cards do by the titles, and that makes the games much quicker.

I got to play this at my local meetup today. It was very unbalanced to my liking and too much take-that in my opinion. It relies on the players to balance each other out. Action card draws can make or break a player so the luck of the draw is too much for me as well. Will probably not play again.

I don't know what it is about this game, but I love it.  I will play this anytime.  It is a quick game with fun cards, and it involves opportunities for cutthroat actions towards your opponents (pun intended) to steal their heads.  A fun one to pull out when you need to kill a bit of time.

This is the most under-rated card game I've played.  The ideal "non-gamer" game, EVERYONE falls in love and gets hooked!  The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was 1) When playing with experienced players there is a good bit of luck involved 2) They need to add another dimmension to this game, I'd love to see some expansions for this!

A gift from my brother, I did not expect this game to be as fun as it was. A good opener but won't show people how great the hobby can be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun, quick, and easy.  Made in poor taste though, so not for the sensitive type. You know, if you have friends who would be disgusted with the concept of 'collecting severed heads' or with 'making a mockery of the French revolution' then this truly isn't for them - and fair enough.  For the rest of us, this is a great little filler game and is quite fun, albeit extremely light  with a fairly straightforward strategy.

When do I play this?:
This game is another one that can easily fit in a bag or suitcase, so it gets played on trips with family and friends.  Again, its a quick one, and this helps to make it accessible to people I may meet.

Hillarious theme, and I like the little guillotine stand at the front of the line.

Light card game. Beautiful artwork, and a cute theme which makes it stand out from other light card games.

A new game for me, seems similar when reading the rules to something else whose name i cant remember but looking forward to trying it out. 
Now having played it realised that it is a modern version of Family Business, another excellent game not played in a while, different setting but good game.
Although listed on the side of the box as a 2 - 5, played as a 6 player and it works very well, even more evil.

This is a mechanically cute game where you are putting French nobles to death as a part of the revolution. Each player gets points for the guys they successfully manage to execute, and there are action cards you can play to manipulate the order of cards. If you aren't careful, you can accidentally execute a peasant, which will bring you negative points. The art for this game is too cartoony for my taste. I know why they made it look as silly as they did, as the theme is really macabre. I would love this game if they re-purposed classical paintings, or did it in the style of the period. That's just my sense of humor I suppose.

This game is really random.  I think you have to play the variant where you can draw a card only if you don't play a card that round, and one where you can play up to two cards a round, the second one after you take a noble.  Otherwise you have far too many cards and no matter what you can avoid the guillotining the wrong guy, unless it's the final round of the day.

RATING: 8
This is a tough rating to decide - on the one hand (with 4 or 5 players), it's a frustrating luck-fest, on the other hand with 2 or 3 players it is an enjoyable light cardgame with entertaining gameplay. (online play)
I do enjoy playing it online, and regularly play it more than any other on gametableonline.com
Having played it now in-person, it is much fiddlier having to deal all the cards out, and manage the line, but 4 and 5 player games become much less strategic and more fun with social, table-top gaming.

Given as a gift by friend who found it at Goodwill! :)

Easily one of the worst and most pointless games I have ever played. At it's heart is a card drafting mechanism so uninspired, and lacking in any real possibility for decision making, it makes Ticket to Ride look like East Front II.  Either you play a card that will give you a better choice than the card that is currently up, or you take what's there because it's good, or because you can't do anything to make it better. Sometimes you just have to take whatever crap is there and do something pointless like knock a random card out of somebody's hand.  The only redeeming quality this game has is it's theme, and it is completely wasted here.

Really fun to play. Despite the grim theme, the game has a cartoony feel (which I like) and the action cards make the gameplay seem rather chaotic (which is ok, if I'm in the mood). The game feels very luck-driven and there is only so much you can do to mitigate that luck. With the right group, at the right time, this would be a surefire hit.

This is a lot of fun especially if everyone gets in character. From the maker of Great Dalmuti (& Robo Rally & Magic as well). Only problem is the King Maker problem is worse here than in other games, but truthfully we don't play this game as competitivly as other games anyway.

Card game of chopping off heads! 
Try to get the best (most hated) nobles to the front of the line on your turn to score good points. 
Avoid the martyrs or People's Hero etc as they will give minuses. 
Use action cards to change the line-up, or affect yours or other players scores.
Not an awful game, but just not very interesting or exciting.

Guillotine is a card game that revolves around ordering and reordering nobles of varying point value as they head to the chopping block.  Each turn one noble is scored by removing the noble closest to the guillotine.  Players may play action cards to have various effects like reordering the cards, scoring bonus points for certain card types, or playing negative effect cards on opposing players.  

I have found this to be a solid game.  Its quick and doesn't overstay its welcome.  There is a decent amount of luck in the game, but you can modify it somewhat through clever card play.  I do find some action cards to be quite powerful compared to others, and it can be frustrating if your opponent is getting the lion's share via the draw - but hey, its a quick game, you can play again and the draw will likely even out ;).  It can be a played with two, but I have found it to be more fun with three or four players.

I know it's a bit random, but it's also a lot of fun. It's really hard for any one person to run away with the lead. The theme is a little dark, but it's presented in a cartoonish way. It's a silly, ireverant game that is great for people very new to games.

Chaotic game of trying to execute the most valuable noble.  It's fine for a light filler, but the wild swings of the action cards make planning very difficult.  Several turns worth of maneuvering can often be undone with the play of one card.  Okay game as it plays quickly.

I found out about Guillotine through reading Jackson Pope's blog "Creation and Play". He would frequently write about his gaming sessions, where Guillotine was always a smash hit. 

Guillotine is very similar to a game called 'Shooting Duck Gallery' (both games revolve around manipulating a line of cards through the use of action cards). I like Shooting Duck Gallery more for one simple reason, I really want to shoot my opponent's ducks (THEY ARE THE ENEMY!), while in Guillotine, I have no personal quarry with any of those on the chopping block.

If for example at the start of the game you were given a mission objective (say behead as many military figures [red nobles] as possible whilst saving prominent Church figures [blue nobles]) then I'd have enjoyed Guillotine much much more. 

Despite the theme lacking a little (for me at least) and having little strategy involved (it doesn't a player too long to find the optimal play, and 95% of the time there is always one choice that is better than all others), Guillotine is still good for a laugh. The fantastic cartoon illustrations help take the edge off what could otherwise be a very controversial theme (beheading people from the french revolution).

All in all, Guillotine is a good little filler game, perfect for taking the edge off after a serious game session.

RATING: 6
A simple game which is quite enjoyable in a less competitive environment. Over three days 36 nobles (12 each day) are lined up for execution at the eponymous device. Each turn a player plays a card to re-organise the line and then claims the head of the noble at the front. Score points for senior nobles, lose them for executing the innocent and heroic. The illustrations are fun, the cards are suitably chaotic but leave some room for thought.

I love the artwork on the cards, which is hilarious and unapologetically risqué.  Guillotine is easy to learn, and the game goes quite fast.  The only nit I have is that the game can be cut short or even abruptly end with the play of a card.  I like my games to last a bit longer, and the sudden end of the game makes me feel sort of cheated out of the fun of playing -- even if I'm the one ending the game to my advantage.

Nice whimsical art and a macabre theme of collecting heads of executed nobles.  A silly enjoyable game with luck and tactics.  Fast simple rules; you pick up a lot of info from text on the cards themselves.

I used to play this a lot in Austin, and then 2008-01-10 in Poland I finally played again, with a German set, and a terrible translation aid that showed the German cards in random order with their Polish names, then you had to look on a second sheet to find the Polish names (again in random order) and the Polish descriptions.  This made the game slower!

2008-11-30: played at Pionek with German cards with Polish descriptions pasted on them.  This did not help me the American nor the 2 Czechs in the group. :)

06-09-2014. Rated after 2 plays. Very simple game, with a morbid theme (I like). Basically, each turn you decapitate 1 noble, with the option of playing 1 action card before decapitation to try to decapitate the noble that give you the most points or most interesting special abilities and giving your opponent a worser one. Fun, good game but extremely light.

My kids really love it, but I find it pretty random and decisions are automatic - you either have the right card or not - and some cards are much stronger than others (like the one that doesn't allow players to alter the line and the one where all grey cards are worth a point).

This game might actually be good with two, but I've only played it with 4 and 5 (and once 7, man that was a terrible idea). With 4 or 5 players it is just a random-fest, I suppose the theme is neat, but its not strong enough to break through the bland game.

Good quick card game.  Do what's best for you or do your best to put the leader in a tough spot.  A couple cards are very strong (but not broken), and one card is no fun at all (i just altered it), but a good light and accessible game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Decent card game, but feels overly long given the lack of strategic depth. Feels like there's very little long-term control you can have, just turn-to-turn tactical moves. Would be better at 20 minutes, feels like a bit of a slog at 45.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
A "row manipulation" game similar to [b]Parade[/b], [b]Tiki Topple[/b], [b]Family Business[/b], and [b]Shooting Ducks Gallery[/b].

I was somewhat disappointed by this game - it is the highest rated of all the ones I just mentioned but it is also one of the most random and chaotic, surpassed only by [b]Sitting Ducks Gallery[/b] in its luck factor. 

[b]Tiki Topple[/b] is extremely similar in terms of gameplay but actually does a better job mitigating the luck factor by having all players have equal access to the same set of cards - you even know which ones they can't play which gives you more information in your decision-making.

Here in [b]Guillotine[/b], you are basically just reacting to the line-up when it gets to your turn with the cards you just so happen to draw. Also, hand sizes can get freakishly huge, especially if you keep on drawing the action cards that allow you to draw 3 more actions cards. Seems somewhat wonky - even more so than [b]Family Business[/b] and [b]Sitting Ducks Gallery[/b], which kept it simple with a restricted hand size.

The best of the bunch is easily [b]Parade[/b] as it has the most strategy. It is the one I would recommend if you were to only get one of this type of game.

Again, I am disappointed that this is the highest rank of the lot because it plays like it's the weakest - well, maybe better than [b]Sitting Ducks Gallery[/b].

Picked this up as an easy, smallish footprint, travel game.  Random but fun, my wife and I played this more often than I thought we would on our trip to Alaska.

Guillotine is cute, fun, and simple. It's a very easy game to introduce people to. Light and fast fare. It has a notable flaw in the Callous Guards card, but this is easily fixed by a house rule forcing the card to be discarded at the end of the day (instead of the end of the game).

A wonderful, quick little game to play with friends who aren't as obsessed with board games as we are. The cards you get determine your paper-thin strategy, but obviously I wouldn't play Guillotine if I'm wanting to stimulate my brain. Like The Downfall of Pompeii, the theme is questionable on moral grounds when you really think about it. But then again, it is just a game. Or is it? I give this one 6 and a half rolling heads.

Another game which feels like you've got more control over the outcome than you do.  Setting someone else up for some rotten Nobles is nigh impossible, really, and your turn generally boils down to "what will give me the most points?"  Still, any game involving beheadings gets an automatic extra point or two, and the game remains very fun.

Highly random card game with a highly irreverent theme.  You have to be in the right mood - if you care if you win or not, you are in the wrong mood.  But if you are playing casually with good friends and the correct lubrication this can work out quite well.  It is also a big hit if playing with young children around - such game sessions are invariably interrupted by said youngsters and a game that requires almost no prolonged concentration to play is very valuable in that regard.

18 éves játék, de még csak most sikerült kipróbálnom, pedig nagyon sokat hallottam már róla. Hihetetlen egyszerű, 1 perces szabálya van. Morbid a sztori, hisz a játékosok kivégzendő emberek skalpjait gyűjtik. Mikor ránk kerül a sor végrehajtunk egy akciót, utána pedig a nyaktiló lesújt és a sorban következő feje hozzánk kerül. Az egyes fejvesztők különböző pontot érnek, ezért célunk az akciókártyákkal minél nagyobb értékű delikvenst megszerezni. A játék rendkívül gyors és az akciókártyák rendesen kiszúrósak. Nem kell túl komolyan venni, de bármikor elővehető és könnyed szórakozást ad. Abszolút tetszett.

Played once with 5 players, felt pretty pointless... one action per turn (no card combos?) and 4 players going inbetween you meant there was absolutely no room to plan in this type of game. Seems like some of the issues would be alleviated with 3 or 2 players,, but...

Don't really like playing games that feel pointless or like they're made to just brainlessly "pass time"... for that I'd lounge on the beach. When I play a game I want to be stimulated and engaged, even with a filler!

Maybe too grim for the lightness of the game.  Not my favourite, thematically.  Quite luck based, so it rides on the mini narratives, which become a tad banal after a few plays.  The same as Kittens in a Blender, as far as I hear.

Strangely quiet for such a light and whimsical game.  It plays quick enough, but remains rather random.

Terrific fFun, as long as I don't think to much about all the dead people.  The wonderfully amusing art makes the game entirely enjoyable.  Half the fFun is making goofy fFaces. And, yeah, it's just a little bit educational.

This is one of those games that knowing the cards definitely helps, but you can certainly play w/o knowing and just execute nobles for fun. It's so quick that it doesn't matter to me that some action cards are so obviously better than others. And besides, you're chopping off heads!

RATING: 4
This game feels prescriptive - make plays to optimize the odds that you're get high-valued cards and dodge low-valued cards.  The problem I see is the variation in plays is low, and the fact that all opponents can make largely the same plays makes this game seem random.

Nice, quick card game. Lovely theme, beheading royalty during the French revolution. But, more importantly, it plays really well. In a turn you try to manipulate the line of victims, to score the most points yourself and maybe give your opponents some negative points in the process. A bit similar to Sitting Ducks, manipulating the order of a line of cards, but that game is way more agressive since it involves player elimination and lends itself for negotiation, bribing and backstabbing. I can easily see owning both, as they are both great fillers. This is the game to play with 2-3 players. With more I'd rather play Sitting Ducks instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good filler, and probably one of my favorite card-only games out there.  It's simple fun, as you're just killing off nobles and collecting points for them.  Being able to rearrange the order to get the nobles that you want is the key element of this game that makes it enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Lots of fun.  Involves more luck and/or politics than most of the games I like best, but the repeated reversals of fortune really work with the theme and lead to some fun scheming.  Not a mindless game by any stretch, but the best laid plans often go awry.

Non-gamers on both sides of my extended family really enjoy this.  Kids would probably have to be 7-8 or older and decent/fairly quick readers to play.

Pros
- Hilarious card art and theme
- Can learn how to play in 2 minutes or less

Cons
- Very little replayability or strategy

While this is a fun game and easy to teach, there was a huge missed opportunity in card design. Most of the actions you take do little more than move a card in line forward or back a few spaces. If there was more variability and complexity in the cards, it would allow for more strategy and thinking ahead, but as it stands, there's no point in thinking beyond what you can do to maximize your points on the current turn.

This is a super simple, quick game.  Each "day" of the game there is a line of noble cards with different values set out.  Each player also has a hand of action cards.  On a player's turn they can play one action card (which most often affects the order of the line of nobles but can do other things as well) then that player takes the first noble in line which will contribute points to that player at game end.  This goes on until all the nobles are gone and the player with the most points wins.

This is a fine, pretty mindless game.  You can teach almost anybody how to play and the whole experience goes pretty quick.  There's not a ton of strategy, you can have a lot of options of action cards to play but usually the one to play is pretty obvious (whichever one gives you the most points).

One thing that bugs me is this game plays up to 5 but each "day" of the game the line consists of 12 nobles.  There are action cards that add or remove nobles from this line but by playing straight this works out perfectly for each player to get an even number of turns with 2, 3, or 4 players.  It's not a big deal at all and it's not worth worrying about for such a simple, brainless game but...my neurosis just won't let me drop it.

Very luck dependent it still offers the possibility to screw with your opponent which is always welcome in fun fillers.

Here is one of a few games that we have used with pretty good success to lure non-gamers into the magical world of gaming.  And it's simple enough that kids enjoy it too.  I personally find the game rather boring, but I'm definitely in the minority on that one, as far as people I know who have played it are concerned.  To be fair, it IS a very well-produced game, with great cartoonish artwork and a hilarious "gallows" humour that is liberally sprinkled throughout.  But again, card-based games and I just don't often see eye-to-eye, possibly because they don't often engage me enough mentally, as this one certainly does not.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 1.5/5  Total: 5.5/10

Ugh.  This game was fun at first but repetition has surely soured it.  Also, it seems like it would be good for non-gamers but they quickly become overloaded by all the abilities on their action cards.  After the novelty of killing rich people wears off this game became very boring.  Most fun with two as then you can actually create some strategy.  With five to much happens during one full turn to plan ahead.

This game is one dumb joke away from being a Steve Jackson game.

This is a great filler game, and I think it would be especially good for introducing people to something beyond mass-market card games (provided they aren't squicky about the subject matter).

Another fun filler-type card game.  The rules are very simple and there is a lot of luck, but the theme is kind of funny (despite being a little morbid) and non-gamers seem to like this game too.  The only problem with this game is it can get rather repetetive after several plays.  Also you can end up having a lot of action cards to wade through when making decisions.  It's not terrible, but it can lead to low-level AP in non-gamers.  I think this game does best if you only play it occasionally.  If you are looking for a card game that you will want to go back to again and again, I don't think this one is a good choice.

[Wizards of the Coast 1998 Edition] {France, Beer&Pretzels; set collection; optimal 4-5p} Guillotine is a fine beer & pretzels game. It's a chaotic game and is totally luck-dependent. (However, it is not as chaotic as Fluxx.) Strategies? No. Tactics? Not many. All one needs to do are to collect the most valuable cards or set other players up. It's still a game that I could play occasionally due to its low 'take-that' element.

The illustration is funny but the theme (head-cutting of nobles) is not healthy. I would prefer a plastic Guillotine.

A fun little filler with some depth, but not so much that it's inaccessible for non-gamers; you can only really look ahead possibly one or two turns, so there's not much room for over-analyzing.  Has a high luck component, but I think it's a fun "Take that" sort of game.  

Okay, I lied, there's pretty much no depth to it.  But it's still a good take-that filler.

As executioners pandering to the masses, the players are trying to behead the least popular nobles. Each day the nobles are lined up and players take turns killing the ones at the front of the line until all the nobles are gone. However, players are given cards which will manipulate the line order right before 'harvesting,' which is what makes the game interesting. After three days worth of chopping, the highest total carries the day.

Vicces partijáték, de max 3 havonta és akkor is egy este max 2 parti. Ennyi untig elég. Ennyire hamar talán még egy játékra sem unnak rá az emberek. Többnek néz ki, mint ami. De a Guillotine csak egy 100%-os szerencsejáték, unalmas mechanikával, viszont nagyon vicces, jól megkreált kerettörténettel.

Slightly more of a game than Fluxx,  but not by much.

Short, fast-paced and fun card game with simple rules. Due to the macabre theme, I would suggest this as a filler for adults, rather than for family/kids. Anyone who can read can learn to play this game easily.

It's a card game, so yes, there is luck. But you do get to play your action cards wisely and tease your fellow gamers with take that cards, so it isn't just mindless "flip a card" type of game.

Shiny cards with funny cartoon art.

Quick card game and lots of fun, the theme is done lightheartedly and suprisingly works, and while it can be quite random and there isn't a heck of a lot of choice, I still like it.

I feel this game could benefit greatly from an expansion though with more variation in the cards.

An impulse buy that turned out to be a decent card filler addition to my collection. I actually find the theme to be quite clever. The cartoonish quality negates the squeamish feeling one might ordinarily experience in face of such a theme; still, I understand that this is not everyone's cup of tea. A HUGE problem I have with this game is the box, which is simply atrocious. I know it seems like a small thing, but it's just awful trying to fish out two separate decks of cards out of this flimsy, unmanageable thing. Once you get past that, though, I happen to like it a great deal; it's fun, quick, and has enough the right amount of strategy required in a filler--enough to satisfy without being overwhelming.

Guillotine is humorous and would be improved if it were: (a) more or less racy, and (b) more or less complicated.  It's an unsatisfying and repetitive 40-60 minutes but would be perfect 20 minute filler.  But come on:  do we really need a noble card titled "Piss Boy"??

Guillotine is a fast, fun filler game that can be played in 20-30 minutes tops.  You are an executioner during the French Revolution and are trying to take the heads of as many high aristocrats as you can.  Despite the ghoulish premise, Guillotine is fun and the cards for it are hilariously illustrated.  There is a line of 12 aristocrats (starting) that represents a "day" of executions.  After 3 days, players total up their scores and the highest wins.  Each player has 5 action cards that can effect the order of the line and have other effects as well.  Timing, strategy, and luck are key, but Guillotine is not a brain burner by any means.  The game plays best with 4 or 5 players.

A filler type card game,  this one is fast and fun with a fine balance of luck and decisions throughout.

There are many different ways to score and the artwork is superb.  But where this game really shines,  is in the use of the action cards.  They are the reason this game  transcends so many others of it's ilk.  There are many different card abilities,  which allow you to manipulate the queue in your favor and let your opponents eat cake. 

I really feel that this one is far better with three players than any other player count.  With other than three,  drop the rating a point or two.

Light filler card game that was quick and inoffensive, yet ultimately not particularly memorable. I don't really see any reason to play this over the likes of Coloretto or No Thanks, unless you've really gotten sick of those classic filler card games; even then I'd go next to things like Bull in a China Shop and Fairy Tale.

[thing=116][/thing] is a high interaction game in which the goal is to behead nobles in the French Revolution. Well, you can give the designer props for steel balls, since this couldn't be easy to pitch to publishers.

It is a fun game, but my play of it was lackluster, with some powerful cards that seems almost broken (I can't remember which, though, but it is just one card, if I'm not mistaken, so it won't change the game to leave it out).

Overall, almost the definition of an OK game.

This game works great as filler. It is light and quick and easily accessible. You pretty much use cards with abilities to manipulate the positions of the nobles in line so that you get to behead the nobles worth more points. The theme and art could be offensive to some people. The mechanic is not too complex and not too simple. It's just fun and simple.

RATING: 10
The French Revolution is famous in part for the use of the guillotine to put nobles to death, and this is the macabre subject of this light card game. As executioners pandering to the masses, the players are trying to behead the least popular nobles. Each day the nobles are lined up and players take turns killing the ones at the front of the line until all the nobles are gone. However, players are given cards which will manipulate the line order right before 'harvesting,' which is what makes the game interesting. After three days worth of chopping, the highest total carries the day.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Apparently, executing the French makes this game appealing to some.
The game is a bit too obvious with 2 & a bit too chaotic with 4. 3-player may be the sweet spot.

But, I Like the twists and turns the game takes sometimes by other players playing cards that can change the line making themselves pick up a good point value person or by making someone pick up a negative point value person.

The basic idea is fun and it is very simple to learn and teach. I don't like how some of the action cards work, however (e.g. change your hand with the opponent - come on!), but that is a minor issue I think.

Rated and commented after (at least) six games. Easy to teach, easy to play, tricky to win.

Each player plays an action card, resolves it and takes the first (freshly decapitated) noble from the line and draws a new card. Repeat couple of rounds and three days.

The nobles have different values and some of them have special features, which affect the game play.

Action cards naturally effect on the order of the victims, who will be decapitated and so on, so it is possible to get those victims you like most. There are other action cards as well which affect other players (bad) and you (good).

12 plays now, nice and easy to game to play in an half an hour.

One more play, it didn't feel that good this time, but I don't make hasty adjustments to the rating. We used the Callous Guards this time, couple of last plays we have removed that card. It was played, but I don't know if that was that dramatic.

Another play, a bit mixed feeling... This used to be fun, but may be the humor value is not big enough any more?

Fun game to bring out every now and then.  The artwork on the cards adds a little comedic relief as well as keeping the atmosphere of the game from being too dark considering the plot.

Jogo bem leve, só de cartas. A moral é conseguir mais ponto decapitando nobres. Alguns desses nobres tem ações, outros tiram pontos. Existem cartas de ação que adicionam nobres, ou dão bônus ou mudam a ordem da fila, entre outras coisas. É um jogo bem interessante pra iniciantes.

This irreverent and humorous card game takes place during the French Revolution. Players represent rival guillotine operators vying for the best collection of noble heads over three rounds.
\13\\13\
Each round, twelve nobles are lined up for the guillotine. The nobles are worth varying points, depending on their notoriety. During your turn, you play action cards to change the order of the line so you can collect the best nobles. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!
\13\\13\
Will you be skillful enough to bribe the guards and collect Marie Antoinette? Or will you lose points for beheading the hero of the People?
\13\\13\
Heads are going to roll!

A simple game that is carried by a great theme. It's pretty much a giant luck fest and all of the tactical decision making consists of fairly obvious choices, but the cards are funny and everyone loves trying to stick someone with the piss boy.

I'm a little ambivalent when it comes to Guillotine.  In a "gaming vacuum", it's a decent little filler.  Easy to teach, easy to play, interesting tactical decisions each turn, etc.  Unfortunately, Guillotine doesn't exist in a gaming vacuum -- it's competing against such titles as "For Sale", "Coup", etc, which are, arguably, better games and quicker to play.  Or, to put it another way: Guillotine is a great filler provided you don't own superior fillers.

Okay, I was wrong.  The theme is entirely compatible with kids.  I enjoy playing with the kids and they enjoy its straightforward strategy of collecting nobles of high value.  Terror of the French Revolution as a family game, who woulda thunk it?  Rather obscene, no?

2012-12-15:  Pretty cutesy art for a rather grim theme.  Game play is very simple and not particularly strategic.  Game complexity would make it appropriate to play with kids, but the theme stops me from doing so.

Great theme -- line up the nobles and execute! A lot of laughs and joking.

Some of the cards have a lot of text, so it requires a few plays to get a complete sense of the game. Also, there is definitely luck involved, since you don't know what actions your opponents will play. However, there are definitely strategic aspects of the game, as you try to balance playing certain action cards versus not playing any at all.

This one gets pretty good rotation with my wife and I - most of the time we manage to play without any feelings getting hurt, but we often play multiple rounds because one or the other of us wants the chance to redeem ourselves from a crippling defeat. 

The artwork and theme are mildly gristly (beheadings are the name of the game) but are hilarious. Lots and lots of chances to turn the tide of the game (i.e. screw your neighbor),  but the mechanics of the game are simple enough to pick up quickly. 

We've definitely gotten our money's worth and then some out of this game. Well worth it, especially if you spend a lot of time as a two-player duo.

This is a great card game which you cannot play with a standard deck.  The theme (chopping off noble heads for the french revolution) is kind of upbeat.  The game is fun.

This is an okay little filler game with pleasant art and a bit of "screw you".  Very much a maximize your move with special cards game without too much long term planning available.

1 play - Very very cool theme.  Its a pretty fast game, tad on the random side, but doesn't overstay its welcome.

The action cards are fun, I wouldn't mind more variety of them (though a couple seem more broken than others).  The ending felt somewhat unfulfilling, since it often seem to finish when the game was just getting interesting.

A fun little card game. Simple mechanics, funny art, and overall, a pretty damn cool gem that takes only about 20 or so minutes to play. I would really recommend it for a light filler game.

Very fun light card game. You can have it going in minutes and everyone I have introduced it to likes it. I think it would benefit from nicer components a bit, but it is well designed and plays in the perfect amount of time.

A fun, cutthroat game with broad appeal. I have yet to meet someone who doesn't like this game. I wish their was an expansion to it, but regardless, it's fun, it's darkly humorous, it's light, and it's guaranteed to bring out the bad french accents in everyone.

Viszonylag gyors, szórakoztató, de némileg kiszúrós kártyajáték, vicces rajzokkal és szöveggel. 2 fővel is jó, de 3-4-5-en is tökéletes játék, valamint az idő se nő meg túlságosan. Fillernek simán jó, 2-3 is lemehet egymás után.

Bought a German language version (not sure if there is other ones as well). I find it an 'OK' card game, but do not play (as have no one with a German knowledge - even though it requires only just the basic understanding).

Okay card/head collecting game, where you play cards to alter the order of the queue, & boost your points.

A few contradictory card issues lower my rating somewhat.

Simple, quick, and fun. I've played with one other person and also a couple games with 3 others. The game gets a little less tactical with more people because you can't really predict what will happen by the time it's your turn again. But, I like that and it keeps it interesting.

I love the theme of beheading french nobles, and I love the take that game play. It is just silly fun and you can't really plan for your turns, so it's not a very strategic game, but it is still a good. Especially after watching Les Miserables.

Fast playing card game with a gruesome theme.  Plays in 15 minutes.  It's an ok filler, but is basically a luck-fest.  It's fine to pull out from time to time, but I prefer even short games to have a large amount of thinking involved.

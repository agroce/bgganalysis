GAME: A Study in Emerald (second edition)
RANK: 1006
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The original is terribly convoluted, amazingly fragile and brittle, but the second edition is almost over polished. Even having read the original story, nothing made me go "holy cow, this is amazing." For the hidden role effect to work (and by far the most interesting aspect to me), players have to intentionally play toward an unforced sub-optimal position and you're not really rewarded for it. In this instance, the resources/actions needed to carry out assassinations would work if it took less effort, but as it stands, I found it more productive to work toward my objective if my identity wasn't a concern... That seems really at odds with the rest of the deck building/movement aspects. I'd like to give it another shot, but I suspect my group would pass on it.

I havent's played 1st edition (I'd love to) but from the videos and pictures I saw the old one was looking better. It would be great if they just clean a little old board (f.e. by removing some cities) for the europe map to be visible better, but apart from it leave it as it was. The new board doesn't look that climatic. It's just some boxes.

RATING: N/A
1st play: It's almost not fair to rate this game after one play. Normally deckbuilders crash and burn for me, but this one was actually interesting. The "hidden" role element is neat, tho it's not very hard to figure out who is on which side. I definitely need to play again to form a better opinion, because the first game was pretty confusing. The rulebook leaves quite a bit to be desired, but there might just be a game in here.

No 2nd play: It's been too long since the first time I played it and I don't really feel eager to play again. It barely made sense the first time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The 1st edition was too fiddly and could drag for a bit too long, but I find that the second edition can be a bit too short and doesn't offer enough opportunities to bluff about your team identity. My ideal edition would be 1.5, a mix between the 1st and the 2nd. Great art.

Very strange. Was the rulebook purposefully byzantine because of the Cthulhu theme? I don't think there's ever been a game where the scoring broke my brain as much. Overall, this is a deckbuilder.... but you can only buy cards if you have the area majority. It's weird and I don't think it's for me.

RATING: 9
Really interesting theme and mechanics. 
I can see a lot of replayability with this one.
Not for everyone, due to the theme, but a true master of game designs (Mr. Wallace) has done it again. Hane NOT owned or played first edition. This one seems very balanced.

Even when a Loyalist reveals and has up to three more agents (for free) to place on the board, it makes sense, since the Restorationsts have not been revealed, if there is any. I hate constant shuffling and reshuffling of deckbuilding, yet in Study in Emerald I like it.

A gem of deckbuilding, area control, deduction, aggressive game. 

Death to all of the polite Euros out there!

A lovely amalgamation of worker placement, deck building and hidden roles! I love the dark art style and it's based on a fantastic short story, I don't think I've played any game quite like this one, plus its pretty cheap to buy too!. I don't understand people struggling with the scoring system or rules, It all seemed pretty clear right away to us. The rulebook is pretty good!. Note - I have never played the first edition.

RATING: 8.5
The original Study in Emerald came out just before I had started collecting designer board games, so I missed out on it and had considered it somewhat of a 'grail game' ever since (being a huge fan of the short story). I have not played that and have no grounds for comparison, but this is a really elegant little hybrid of deck building, area control for card drafting and a simplistic hidden role mechanism which can affect scoring or even end the game early. It's slightly abstracted from the theme, but it sticks enough to make a difference, and I just love the multiple uses for cards, making each hand engaging for its possibilities. Art works fine for me, it's dingy and retro, and this is among my favorite Wallace titles.

Toda una sorpresa y realmente agradable.
Reglas sencillas de explicar, super inmersivo (increible hablando de un juego de roles ocultos basado en los principios del s.XIX donde Cthulhu lleva dominando la tierra siglos y anarquistas golpean el poder para tratar de revertir el sistema)-

Mecánicas muy simples de creación de mazos, roles ocultos con fines muy distintos que no se han de revelar, distintas posibilidades de saltar el final de la partida, asesinatos de agentes, inmersión en la historia, varios caminos para ganar puntos que hacen que no sea aburrido jugar y por último 5 jugadores pasándolo bien en tono desenfado, sin entreturnos, jugando ágilmente.

De verdad, ¿alguien da más?
Probaré hacerme con la primera Edición del juego y ver si tanto ha perdido como dicen los que lo han probado pero éste Estudio en Esmeralda Segunda Edición me parece un juegazo. (NOS parece un juegazo, mejor dicho)

RATING: 5
I'm a big fan of Wallace's games, and the first edition of A Study in Emerald is my favorite, surpassing even the brilliant Brass.  ASiE is an elegant game, brilliant in fact, and it would be far better served by simply republishing it unscathed instead of carving it up into disparate pieces and repackaging it as a "second edition," which it is not.  The changes make it a completely different game.  Sadly, those being introduced to the game through the remake will probably never get the chance to experience the original. 

After reading full rules: Now convinced this is just a prop to use Gaiman's name as a sales grab.

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: With only one play, I'm not sure how I feel about this game. The components and mechanisms, although good quality, didn't convey the theme to me. This is a deduction game where you are trying to determine who is on your team. However, I didn't feel that the deckbuilding/area control mechanisms contributed at all to the deduction portion of your objectives. The game really felt too short to be able to analyze other players' motivations. I wonder whether it's a viable strategy for all players to simply not bother with the deduction aspect and focus solely on getting the highest possible score. I suspect that I'll need a few more exploratory sessions in order to see if this game clicks with me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It has deck-building, player alliances, area majority/auctions, assassinations and zombies. It is all those and, yet, none of those. Some sessions can play very differently due to limited number of cards that come up to claim and the variation among the card powers. The actions are varied, provide different benefits and cause different competitions among the players. Further, the final scoring penalty to the faction that has the lowest scoring adds a very interesting consideration to when to end the game. There's lots of craziness that can occur in a particular session, due to the hidden roles and the variation in card effects. 

The skill does not seem to be in your ability to build a good deck. Instead, the skill seems to reside more in your ability to delay the reveal of your player faction as long as possible and in your ability to follow the game state (and that game state can be all over the place). Probably more the latter -- as it is difficult to hide your allegiance. 

This definitely plays better at higher player counts. This is a great semi-cooperative game.

Since the first edition is one of my favorite games, I kickstarted the second edition without hesitation. However, the things I love in the original were modified or removed here, A big concern seems to be the impossibility to catch up with any player who wins a couple of cities early on. It is too easy to then manipulate the tracks and trigger the game's end. I also prefer the original's pace; the new edition is just too fast for my liking. 

In the end, I sold the game because having both editions seemed redundant. Most of my gaming buddies share my opinion about this edition: if given the choice, we would always choose to play the first edition.

Man, this game kind of let me down.  It checks so many boxes: hidden factions, great theme, deck building sub-mechanic, area control.  But it doesn't seem to do any of them well or in a novel way.  

My main complaint is that it feels like a great deal of work just to have meaningful impact.  After you buy a single card (which goes to your discard and won't pop up more than maybe two more times all game), you lose all your cubes to limbo.  You need to spend actions to pull these out, actions to re-deploy them, and then an action to buy a new card (if you have a majority).  That process can be messed with by other players which can be frustrating.  

I'm normally all about conflict but the Euro elements in this game feel too tight.  I'm eminently curious if I would prefer 1st edition, as someone suggested.

Considerably improved. The first edition was an interesting but under-cooked project that despite many plays with the same group was ultimately softer and less interesting than it promised.  The second edition, in contrast, is both more streamlined and also more brutal.  A lot of the chrome has been boiled off and players are left with the unadulterated mind-game that only sometimes really took off in the first edition.  

I'm sure this will be one of those games were people cling to their 1e and try to blow this game off, but make no mistake this isn't a "Steam"-style simplification.  Its simply a better, harder, and more interesting game that happens to have less rules.  Sometimes that happens.

Update:
Six plays in it's still better and more interesting.  Could become my favorite deckbuilder.

Having not played the first edition, I can tackle this with a degree of objectivity. There's a lot to like here, the card play is somewhat reminiscent of AFAoS, without the notable problems, the siege mechanic is replaced with a bidding mechanic. The board play really adds to the game, and I appreciate the way that Martin has continued to use the multiple different symbols on cards to create flexibility.

I need more plays to see what strategies are best, if there is a major advantage to being on a team of 3 in a 5 player game, and if one side is stronger than the other. 

In the game I played, I was on the Loyalists side (3 vs. 2), and we cleaned up. With the other guys having a game under their belt, it will be fun to try again and see if the balance will shift.

Took out some of the wonkiness of the first one, but I enjoy both.  I find the biggest change is that you can win even if you have the lowest scoring player on your team.  That is a neat mechanic from version 1 but I dont find that aspect very fun, so happy to see it leave this edition.

Notes:

I haven't played the first edition version of A Study of Emerald and have no grounds for compare the two, but this is an elegantly designed hybrid deck builder, area control for card drafting and a hidden role mechanic. Of which can affect scoring or even end the game early. I favour the multiple uses of the cards, giving you variability. The trick with this one is to figure out early who is on your side and stack your deck accordingly. I like the art work, but prefer the look of the first edition board.

The first time I played this game (with 4 players) it felt like I had meaningful choices, I was after specific cards to improve my deck, and there was competition between the players for the good cards, on a second play (with 3 players) there was little competition for cards and it felt like none of the cards on offer were useful, a very unsatisfying experience.

(Novembre 2015)
Rating after 3 games.
Nice combination of Area Control + Secret Identities spiced with non-aggressive deck-building mechanics.
Better with 4-5 people. Ok with 3. I don't feel like playing 1vs1, though I've never tried.
Free-for-all competitive game disguised as a semi-coop game. Indeed, you are playing against the members on your team, and at the same time you have to make the other team lose. But the main focus of attention must be your colleagues. You need to identify them and score more than them.
The game is pretty simple to play, but explanation to newcomers is unavoidably too long considering the short-length of the game and its simplicity in mechanics. That puts me off from willing to teach this game to everyone. Explanation is long: all different actions with their particularities and exceptions. Simple to understand but many many details to explain and assimilate and remember if you are teaching the game to people with whom you won't play again. So not a game to play it occasionally with newcomers, since explanation may last 20 minutes.

I still like this game's uniqueness, but it's one of those hidden identity games where the hidden identity doesn't seem to last very long, and it doesn't give you a lot of benefit to bluff.

[February 2016 - 7.5]
While I really wish the board was an actual map of Europe, this game's theme really shines through otherwise, with a lot of disorientation in tracking scores, when the game will end and who is one what side. That might drive some people mad, but hey that's the theme here! Can you win before you lose your sanity. There's a wonderful mechanic that you lose points if one of your teammates (although it's every man for himeself) comes in last. So there is some team play, but you ultimately want to to win alone. Plays nice and fast and lots of interaction.

I'm a big fan of the 1st (original) edition, but this is a good game as well and for me definitely worth owning both. This may well be the better 'game' but the original for me is a richer more fun (but longer) experience.

The main changes between editions are - 

- No named Agents on the board, although they still exist via the cards. Also no double-agent mechanics.

- Claiming cards requires the appropriate cards to conduct the action and multiple cards can be claimed as one action if you have enough cards and majorities.

- There is no separate city space and card space to compete for.

- The player in last place no longer loses the game for all players of the same alignment - they all simply lose 5 pts.

- The game ratchets towards the end-game conditions there is no back-and-forth.

- No blocking disks.

So - shorter, more accessible, less rules wrinkles and easier to play, whilst still retain the majority of the thematic elements but not quite as rich or 'epic'.

 The first two times I played the original edition I did not like it. Mainly because there was a player that has no idea of what he was doing and both times he was in my team, :-(

 Then I forgot it for a period an played again with a different group, It was so an awesome match that I get immediately smitten by it. we played 2 or three times more and the more we played the more everybody liked it.

 I tried to get a copy but it was almost impossible, then I heard about the new edition an waited.

 And again, I played it once (4p) for a very confusing experience (I think we did something wrong) although I was disappointed I decided to give it another try, got the game and played 2p with my wife just to fall in love again (with the game I mean, hahaha) after a really fun  and tense game.

 I have played it 10 times since then. Three with 4p and 7 with 2p and absolutely every game was fun and interesting. 

 Yesterday we played three great matches in a row, so good that I decided it was time to give this game the rate it deserves, because I have seen that most of the bad ratings are given just after one try, and I think that is the big problem of this game, that it is very dependent of the knowlege and predisposition of the players involved. When every player knows the game and everyone is playing competitively amazing mathces arise.

 I am not sure what version I like the best, this one is shorter and goes directly to de main core? plot? matter? (don't know how to say it) 

 For me the best advantage is that it can be played really good by 2p. Also I think I am kind of appreciating more it's simplicity and clearness.

(As always sorry for my English if I made many mistakes)

RATING: 7.5
A Study In Emerald 2nd edition is a stripped down version of the original. Although there is a board, really Asie is now a card game since all the spatial elements of the original have gone.

If you don't know the original then this is a great game in and of itself. Hidden identities, deck building, area majorities, assassinations...it is all still here. 

If you do know the original then how does it compare? It lacks the spatial element of the original and also area majorities once claimed cannot be lost, so there is less tension in that area. It is not nearly as immersive as the original, but the upside is that it plays in an hour and the rules are tighter and more intuitive than the rambling and difficult original. Hence it will be much easier to get to the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm torn on which edition I like best.  On the plus side, 2nd edition is very streamlined and moves quicker as a result.  I don't feel that it's dumbed down, but it's a lot less fiddly and the entire movement functionality has been stripped down to "go where you want".

However, the streamlining takes a lot of the tension away and de-emphasizes which secret role you're holding onto.  It doesn't negate it, of course, because the faction you're on ultimately determines your final score, but something that I really loved about the 1st edition seems to be missing in this one.

Still, the game is a solid one.  If I had to describe it, I'd call it Study in Emerald Express.  I'm pretty sure both could exist side-by-side on your shelf, but which one you pull out for the night depends on your gaming goals.  I can see this edition hitting tables much more often if only because of the speed advantage.

And there is still no rhinocerous.

An outstanding multiplayer deck-building game in which players are randomly assigned to one of two factions:  Loyalist or Restorationist.  The catch is that they are unaware of everyone else's affiliations until game's end.  Can one deduce his/her allies from opponents from their gameplay?  Did you just assassinate an friend or a foe?  

This edition is reportedly a streamlined edition of the original, and it's perfect for our group.  Best played with 4 or 5 players.

RATING: 4
Rating based on one play. A clunky game in which you need multiple turns to accomplish pretty much anything... provided that you drew the right cards. The deckbuilding mechanic is flawed by the lack of any mean to get rid of your starting cards and to cycle your deck with a decent speed, meaning that you will rarely see some of your cards. Overall, a pretty mediocre game.

This is a really good, solid game based on a story by top-notch author, Neil Gaiman. But we were a bit disappointed with it. It really needs to be a bit more complex for what it is. It appears that the first edition might be better, but it is difficult to get a hold of now.

RATING: 8
You need to read the rules; and understand how the tracker works; and be able to guess who is your "friend" and who is your "enemy". Especially when you play it with 4 players (and the chances to find yourself alone against 3 opponents belonging to the opposite faction are very high). Then it's easy and fun to play :)

RATING: 4.5
The b/f was excited about getting this played but my eyes glazed over the moment I realised this was purely and simply a deck builder. 
I don't particularly like deckbuilders and I am not very good at them. I tend to just putter around and pick up whatever cards I can afford. 

I also really disliked that there were uneven teams in this game (and not just because it played all three against me alone) Why not twoVtwo? why does it shuffle all 6 loyalties and see what happens. Not a fan.

I also found the iconography on the cards really quite small and the cards that let you adjust the victory point track seemed heavily skewed against one faction in favour of the other. 

A further complaint about the card design is the fact that on three separate occasions we mistook a monster card for the great old one card and thus removed then from the stack of cards you could buy into a separate combat pile when they are intended to slow you down as you have to face them to be allowed access to the cards underneath. 

I also found no flavour whatsoever in the game and the theme does not come across at all, I mean its cool that have a card called Sherlock Holmes, but just as many card names were so obscure non of us really knew who they were despite being familiar with both Lovecraft's works and Conan Doyles works.

Never played the first edition, so I can't judge the weight compared to this version. I bought this at the Essen fair after hearing about the first edition. Played this some time ago and it just plays smoothly and is quite fun. Though it seems the traitor mechanic is not really working as it's quite clear from the get-go who is a loyalist and who isn't.

Love the art, love the way the scenario is presented, and the simplifications go a long way towards smoothing out the game, but they also seem to have effectively removed much of the story arc there was in the original. Like the original, it seems comparatively easier to just not bother being confrontational for the first few rounds; but after that, it seems there are fewer opportunities to bring down the opposition. I am still not sure whether I prefer this or the original version; I need to play more; for now it get a 7.

There is always going to be a problem in a game like this - if just one player doesn't 'get' it, and sits languishing at the rear of the pack (for their actual score), then you're likely to watch your lead disappear as soon as the game ends.

Disappointed that there are 6 zombie tokens, but only one card to initiate zombies going on the board - and as only a proportion of the cards are used the zombies might never come out.  Seems a waste of zombies!!!! Otherwise after 1 solo play I am reasonably happy. Theme is great. A bit of frustration that it's difficult to get additional agents on the board but not as frustrating as some euros can be with regard to not being able to do anything at all before the game ends!!! (OK mainly thinking Agricola here - how does anyone do anything in that game?!!!)

Less cluttered board than the design of the original (board). The streamlining in this edition makes it more accessible but less thematic. The hidden identity mechanic doesn’t work for very long, which is a shame, since it’s a nice idea. The theme comes through pretty well, & the icons are easy to pick up on, but a bit annoying. Scoring is strange and not intuitive - hard to teach that part to folks new to the game, thus making it more difficult to getting to the table.

Good game. Did not get an 8 (as yet) because I am uncertain that the changes of winning are evenly distributed in a 2v2 player game. We play the game with variable end-conditions. I'd rate the game a 4 if we didn't, for then I think the game is flawed. If you don't everyone goes for the neutral points first and there is little time to search for accomplices and opponents when a player gets ahead of the others.

Hum, one play really doesn't seem to make me understand how this game is played. My uncertainty made me play in well... an uncertain way. 

I want to play this more to make up my mind. As for now I have a big question mark in my head about this game and "7" is a very provisional rating. 

UPDATE
Played once again and it somehow clicked, still it is certainly a hard game to play well: the deckbuilding elements are tight and it is easy to get your hand clogged up if you are not careful. Still I need to understand the reason for bluffing... after some time it is clear who's who. Last game there was definitely a lot of tension in the final turns. 

Bringing its rating up a notch, but as for now I have no desire to own this game.

UPDATE
Playing this some lately. Some elements of the game, namely: propaganda, are starting to click and make their significance apparent. 

I'm somewhat always happy to play this, even if I wouldn't suggest it. Again I have no need for this game in my collection, but making its rating go up a notch.

RATING: 6
Incredibly cool game that takes its inspiration in an interesting direction. Now I know that the second edition loses a lot of its quirks and charms (e.g., fighting off zombies and vampires?), but I've also heard that it is also a glorious hot mess (the question being if it is a brillian hot mess or just a hot mess). I haven't played it so I can't say much on the subject.

However, the second edition creates this great paranoia as restorationists and loyalists dance around each other on the board attempting to claim points for both themselves *and* their team without disclosing who they are (as to invite getting murdered by opposing agents!) -- this double(d) winning criteria is important as you want to get the most points but if you win and your teammate is in last, the whole team loses five points (often enough to be the difference between winning and losing). The deck building creates interesting and emerging choices as your deck evolves (but you need to have majority in an area to get new cards!) -- and the neutral points become a hot commodity that every fights over (points for you, as an individual, that don't reveal your team). However, one must eventually make actions that reveal your leaning: whether fending of Ancient Ones (as restorationists) or Restorationists (as loyalists). Like with the mythos, there are also sanity checks to make if you play with fire. 

Incredibly playable take on deck-building, deduction, and hidden roles. I can't think of anything quite like it.

RATING: 8.5
First two plays we played some essential rules wrong (adjusting the player's scores on Loyalist/Rest. track movement; we gave ourselves the city VP for assassinating agents – due to the VP symbol on the city slot) which let the games end too quickly. The rulebook is not very good at explaining these essential rules.

The game however is fun, quick, and probably pretty tense – once you play the rules correctly.... I definitely want to explore it more!! On the edge of buying it actually. I just like the mechanism mix: light deckbuilding; majorities; direct player interaction; plus the 60m play time with 2-5 players. Just seems fantastic.

Update: it's tough to get this to the table. My main criticism now would be the strange end game scoring which makes it a bit anti-climatic. For me it's still a great fun though.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I'm probably over rating this because of the theme and mood of the game. The gameplay is raher mediocre. The secret identities doesn't seem to work well because bluffing often hurts you and your partners. Also, the game always follow the same sequence: the firts half, you take cards; the second half, you use those cards, luckily in the right order. Feels slighty predictable.

A Study in Emerald(2nd) reimplements the Lovecraft/Doyle Mashup deck builder under the Treefrog label, with a redesign from Chez Wallace.
I was able to finish a 3 player 1st play in about 2 hrs, so the redesign was not in vain- this is simpler to play than the original.
I loved the thin-deck deck-building aspects of the game, making players weigh how they best use icons to move cards, or hoard icons for future turns.
This is an immediate 7.5 for me, with the possibility of moving up with more plays.
A terrific game!

However, it lacks the original's sense of contemplation and escalation. Everything is more of a mad dash with far bolder moves yet fewer surprises. Plus, there are still lots of fiddly little rules.

I rate the first edition a 9.5. After two plays of the second edition, my sense is that it streamlines a *lot* of things, mostly (but not all) to the good, but the game is still a long teach and has a one-game learning curve. The second edition is only a little easier to teach, and it's at the cost of getting rid of a few things I like (notably double agents, blocking discs, and paying coins for travel). 

The good news is that they're both great games. Both versions have the same core feel, and I like the art and components in both. 

Here's my comment for the first edition, most of which applies to the second:

"The Cthulhu theme is what jumps out at you . . . and the Sherlock Holmes . . . and I love them both! But IMO this game is a masterpiece because of how well it conveys the feel of espionage/being a secret agent. When playing, you don’t trust anyone, and you don’t want even those on “your side” (if you could even be sure they really were on your side) to figure out what you’re going to do next. I hope that more games use this game's novel base premise: that players are on teams, but only sort of, and only player can win. 

I *love* this game and think it is one of the most interesting games to come out in years -- but I rate it slightly less than 10 because it's a bear to teach and usually takes folks more than one play to really appreciate it. (Only by our third game did we manage to get all the rules right.) But in this case the complicated/fiddly rules are very much worth the effort. Reviewer Rahdo called it "sloppy, messy, and gorgeous," and I think that is a great description."

RATING: 8
One 4p and one solo play (to get the rules) only so far, and I have to say I'm impressed. I'd call it SiE condensed - the changes slim mechanisms (but not flavour), and cut play time.

That there are far fewer plays that can knock points off others helps with the reduced play time. City cards being permanently acquired in particular shortens things, as in SiE 1 they could bounce between players a lot which didn't advance the overall game state. Similarly I didn't spot any way of reducing the Loyalist / Restorationist faction points, which could result in points bouncing back and forth in the original. This one feels more like a race.

I'm glad I've got a copy of both versions. I suspect this will be easier to get to the table, but for anyone wanting a longer, more involved experience SiE 1 will hit the mark. Take your pick, and enjoy.

Second play: The game is dependent on the group. It needs experienced players who know what they do and don't shun away from a conflict. In such a group, it's a good game.
---
A Study in Emerald is a deckbuilder with a board and secret identities in a Holmesian Cthulhu setting. 

The deckbuilding part is limited as a good number of cards is one-use and during the game players only draft less than 10 cards each. The secret identity game was a no-brainer in my first game. It might get more important with experienced players. But scores are so close that it probably doesn't pay off to score VPs of the opposite faction to keep the own identity a secret. 

Some action cards with opposite VPs might be interesting due to the action but I doubt it. Getting zombies as a Restorationist was a waste of actions and costed me the game when the VPs were deducted. Getting agent cards initially and grabbing cities with neutral VPs are obvious choices.

Not sure about this game. The rating might drop if it turns out that an approach of only aiming for cards with high VPs and neglecting the identity game is a winning strategy.

People ownning the first edition , encourage me to buy it ,  but they never have played this second edition . I have played twice and the game seems that has not been playtested . The game finish in three or four turns , and you can not developed nothing . If this game pretends to be a filler , it is a really bad one , the setup should not take the same amount of time than the playing . And I dont have any fun because the game ends before I can plan anything . It is a shame that the art is very good but the mecanchics of the game are so poor. I am gonna make a complete research of the next game of Martin Wallace before  buy it blindly, I will not be cheated again

A bizarre blending of many things. To start with, the theme is HP Lovecraft meets Sherlock Holmes, which works better than one would expect. Highly recommended to read Neil Gaiman's story of the same name (free on his website) before playing. The game itself steals mechanisms from every type of game one can think of. Area Control, Worker Placement, Deckbuilding, player vs player combat, player vs board combat, hand management, hidden roles and deduction. They work decently together, although it seems a tad clunky at times and seems like it might benefit from some streamlining.

2015-11-29 - 6 - It's an ok area control-like game with deckbuilding in it. Nothing awesome to me after the first game, but I would like to play again, especially it took less than hour and quite a lot was going on during the game. I think it should be better with more players than three and also with more experience.

2015-12-05 - 6->6,5 - OK game, which I am willing to play quite often as it's pretty quick. The theme is not very strong in this one and it bothers me a little as it really tries to matter. It's just a fine game.

I had read A Study in Emerald a long time ago and a guy in my group got the first edition game, which we've played a few times. I really liked it and kind of always wanted to have it. I love the world and concept invented here. Obviously first edition is out of of print. 

I bought this mostly because I'm a big fan of Ian O'Toole. But I've played it a few times with my girlfriend and we both like it a lot. For 2 player, I'm implementing a few house rules: 1) we just mix up 2 opposing rules and then choose blindly. the roles are face up. Removes the guessing but makes it more confrontational. 2) putting city cards at the bottom of each stack. They award too many points in a 2 player game. 3) Secretly select starting cities by writing them down then revealing. These 3 ideas pushes the conflict instead of people leaving each other alone just trying to get points.

A mix of deck building and euro influence spreading, with an affiliation twist like shadow over camelot or Resistance that takes place in a post apocalyptic lovecraft theme. Apparently the theme is not as strong as in the 1st edition of the game, but the rules have been much more streamlined in this game.

The scoring system is but weird, but I could make sense once played. Else, it probably does not play well with low amount of players since game with affiliation normally requires at least 3 or 4 players.

This is a streamlined version of the 1st edition.  I actually like both versions for different reasons.  It's a richly thematic type of game with Cthluthu fun in the Sherlock Holmes era using hidden teams/roles.  

The 1st edition is deeper and longer (more quirky rules to be aware of).  The 2nd edition has more compounded rules and certain aspects/rules have been designed to make this more compact but still pack the same quality of fun - it ends quicker than 1st Edition since you don't necessarily suffer as many losses of agents or surrender cards you've acquired (associated with said agents).  This 2nd Edition is much more accessible to mass-market or lightweight gamers.

RATING: 7
Interesting combination of deck building, area control and hidden roles.  I like the 19th century Lovecraft meets Sherlock Holmes setting (I should probably read the short story sometime).  I never played the first edition so I cannot comment on the changes but this is a very good game in its own right.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game appreciation is highly thematic, and I love the theme of combining secret rules with cthulhu. even if it is stressed in the rules to try keeping your role secret, it is not difficult to have an idea of who is on your side or not, which i find nice because it doesn't spoil the game for me and it helps you with strategy. I played at all player counts, and have to say that with 5 people is best, at 4 it still works, but for 2 and 3 people it just doesn't work because the secret identities probability are not evened and quite frankly taken out from the game before starting. before I said that discover secret identities earlier doesn't spoil the game, but that is because in my opinion it is a part of the game that is necessary but not the core of plays.
what this game does very well is the deckbuilding part and the balance, since I never felt that a faction was more powerful than the other, and every play is a bit randomized in the cards dealt so there is enough variety.
it is a pity that the rulebook is obscure and many plays and scavenging though forums are needed to understand and properly play the game. reading the rulebook makes somehow the rules counter-intuitive in respect to what would feel natural after many plays: for example, it should be stated clearly that you can only acquire victory points during the game, and the calculations after the game end triggers are only points each player gets subtracted from his/hers
one issue I encountered while changing the players is that people tend to be discouraged if they don't understand the rules properly and then play randomly, as an advice I would play this game only with people that are invested in the theme.
if the new publisher solves the rulebook issue the game becomes even more accessible :)

The first thing that needs to be said about this game is that it's way, way more fun to play if you've already read the brilliant Neil Gaiman story. Without the suspenseful ending of that tale to get you into the mood, the game's vast plethora of fiddly mechanics will probably drown out any thematic flavor. 

There's something undeniably impressive about the way Wallace mashes up ideas from Dominion, hidden ID games, and traditional Euro resource management games into a unholy brew here, But do be prepared for it to try your patience, as well as to screw up the rules on a first playthrough if you're not very sober and extremely careful. This only feature that I think is truly irredeemable, though, is the horrible mishmash of calculations you have to go through with VP at the end of the game to figure out who actually won.

Only played it once. Didn't enjoy it overly much. It seems that for a game that's based around secret identities, there's very little you can ascertain from the early game, and once somebody does something "incriminating", it's usually pretty obvious which side they're on. Also, it's a "lose as a team, win solo" kind of game which makes the whole concept of players playing two teams sort of moot? Meh.

After 4 games lowered to 7. There's something odd ... almost Lovecraftian ... going on with that scoring system. You think you're in a good position, but you're not. You want to end the game, but you can't. You don't want to end the game yet, but you must. 
And suddenly somebody wins.         Who?

a game with a interesting theme that works but the game doesn't seem long enough to enjoy the theme of it all.
Good mechanics that were complex to a new player but easy to keep track of. 
The hidden roles is a interesting hindrance, and was the deciding factor of the game I played....I would have preferred it to have less of an impact but that may have been the person who won knew the game so much better.

Id recommend this game to people looking for the tense feeling that the teams adds.

Off course the original first edition was much more intriguing, but this one also has enough to get your mind tossing and turning to figure out what to do to win and not give away your identity to soon. Needs more than one play to understand what a good strategy could be, for both roles (different for each role).

I like the idea of two hidden factions but it plays out boringly here where you don't care too much to act differently because of it. And then you just randomly lose points because your ally sucked. Also don't care as much for Ctulhu stuff. I do like the area majority and deckbuilding mix

Buen juego, y bastante interesante tanto sus mecánicas como la sensación y el fondo que deja tras jugarlo. pero tiene una pega , a mi parecer, y es las puntuaciones finales...era necesario complicarlo tanto??...
No sé, me gusta pero todavía no dominamos esa parte.
Si llego a entender lo de la puntuación final seguro que subiría la nota a un 8.

OK game - I like a lot of aspects in this game. the deckbuilding, the majority control etc. but there are also some things I like less like the hidden team mechanic which is something I don't like in general i.e. Dead of Winter, Room 25 etc It's a good game but not one that I seek to play.

Has Martin Wallace made factions work since Byzantium? If anything, I think this game would be improved with a Byzantium-like mechanic where, rather than being loyalists or revolutionaries, our characters are looking to come out ahead by backing the right horses, regardless of the affiliation of those horses.

Better than 1st edition, but still not really "balanced".

This was pretty awful. It reminded me a lot of Ankh-Morpork, without what little fun there is to have within. The game didn't flow that well, and the actions you take from round to round are boring and mundane. The hidden loyalties aren't really enough to build a game around.

Truth in advertisement: Don't get suckered-in by the giant NEIL GAIMAN!!! in the box and the idea of battling Cthulhu along the likes of Sherlock Holmes This game is essentially your usual Euro-cubefest with a few spins. And the theme doesn't go beyond the usual slaped-in tropes like "now you get to lose sanity instead of health!". To be fair the game actually works and provides for a compelling experience. But take a loong hard look at this before you decide if its something you want to try out.

PS: There's no overstating how needlessly complicated and fiddly the scoring system is. It's surely the most inelegant element of an otherwise solid worker-placement implementation.

Cthulhu I can take or leave at this point. I certainly didn't buy the game for the theme. It could literally be any other theme that has two sides fighting for supremacy, but it still gives you a bit of a tingle when you kill Nyarlathotep with a couple of bombs.

Really good game from Wallace.

Very interesting game, something different. Not too complicated, but still a lot of options and variety. Need to play more.

RATING: 7
After having played the first edition years ago, I was indifferent to the announcement of the second edition. But after having read news that this version would fix and balance issues with the first edition, I was willing to change my opinion. For the first edition, the rules are hard to follow and unnecessarily complicated. Also, my impression of the game, after being a fan of Mr. Wallace's work, was a disappointment; it felt more like a jumble of game mechanics that didn't really match the game's rich thematic material. Sure, there were hidden roles to match the chaos and intrigue of the short story's energy, but it felt unskillfully applied. With the second edition, there was nowhere to go but up. The rules and some of the mechanics, including assassinating and travelling, has been streamlined and made simpler. There was a cute standoff with certain cards in cities which was fun to witness but I never had "fun" playing. And maybe that was because we overestimated the social deduction/hidden teams element of the game, all of us being seasoned Werewolf players; none of us were willing to perform any bold actions that would give away our loyalty. So we just bought and drafted cards. We never even adjusted our scores at the end for points that weren't our team's. If this sounds needlessly complicated, it is. Still, I liked that the game's design had improved. Overall, I'll play the game again and this time, I won't be worried about performing actions (assassinations) that will give away my loyalty.

Not sure how to rate this as this still feels like an incoherent mess. I like a lot of what this game does, but it still seems like it fires in all different directions and never really bothers to join any of the elements properly.

Just got it and hope to get it to the table this weekend if game night is not too heavy and I can squeeze it in, as it will be new for all of us, and only a couple of us had played the first edition, so the majority will be learning a fairly complex game and playing it for the first time.

Very unique game with extravagant theme. Not so complex as it first seems. Mixes elements from "Shadows over camelot" (traitor) and Dominion (deck building) with area control. All this works pretty well. Many ways to victory. So much fun to figure out what faction the other players belong to and secretly plan your next moves against them, always watching out for second and last (because he/she may cost you victory points if it turns out he/she belongs the same faction as you).
Good learning curve makes you want to play it again. With five it is a little more chaotic so I would suggst to play it with four players first. I would suggest to start with this edition and later try the first edition (which is hard to get). Both editions look and play differently.

A Study In Emerald first edition is currently my favorite game. After reading about the changed they made to second edition, I had avoided it up until now, but this week I was given the opportunity to actually try it so I thought I should.

In the game, players use a deck-building mechanism to place cubes into the various spots on the board. if at the start of your turn, you have the most components in that spot, you can take the top card of the pile and add it to your deck. I absolutely love this mechanism. Players also have a secret alignment, although they still win the game alone. If at the end of the game, you wind up on the same team as the player with the fewest points, there is a penalty. I do love being able to be out for myself but also being required to look at my opponent's moves to predict what team they might be on. All of this is true in both the first and second edition of the games.

Speaking to the second edition specifically, I have some problems. In both games, there is a mechanism where players can hire agents. These are markers on the board that you can move from city to city, which are a requirement for certain actions, but more specifically they add claim to any space where you have cubes down to bid for a card. In first edition, you pay to walk these agents around the map, and the card icons you use to move them are the same that you use to buy new claim cubes, so there's a semi-predictable flow to when someone is getting ready to move. In addition, they also break ties when it comes to situations where two players have equal claim on a card. In second edition, the agents can teleport anywhere by spending a card icon that is used exclusively for teleporting agents. In addition, while they still count for claim they no longer break ties. The result of this in our game was that cards on top of piles got caught into unbreakable stale mates more easily, which hurt the players involved substantially as the game length was reduced.

Another issue I ran into was that points are uncomfortably rare. In first edition, players vie for control of city cards, handing them back and forth, gaining or losing points while fighting for whatever points they can gather from permanent sources. These city cards are always available in addition to whatever is on the top of the card piles. In second edition, the cards worth points don't get handed back and forth, they are simply claimed by whomever gets it and that's it. Not only that, they are not always available, as they just get shuffled into the piles and come up when they come up. This makes for a boom-and-bust feeling as some rounds there are lots of points to fight for and other rounds it feels like there's nothing to fight for.

The third big problem I have is that the endgame penalty is different. In the first edition, if you were on the same team as the player in last you automatically are disqualified from winning. In second edition, the players on the same team merely lose 5 points. This means that in second edition, you don't really have to care who your teammates are before initiating the end of the game. Again, the game time is so reduced that spending actions bluffing your faction seems senseless.

All in all, I wouldn't go so far as to say second edition is a bad game in the spectrum of board games that exist, but much of what I love about first edition is absent or changed, and I can't imagine recommending someone get this as opposed to hunting down a first edition copy.

The original Study in Emerald is a collector's novelty deck-builder with some overwrought mechanics, but an amazing endgame. 

Out of any game I know, this is probably the one that would absolutely benefit the most from some streamlining and a re-release. Unfortunately, what I played was a textbook chop up of the original content. 

The new board is visually unappealing, and the semi-cooperative endgame that defined the first edition has been neutered into a traditional victory point race. 
This second edition isn't actively bad, it's just bland.

This has become my default "uh-oh the eurogamers are here" game.  The area control is ok and the deck building is fine, and the card play is just novel enough to keep me playing.  I wish there was a little more to the loyalty track and hidden affiliations, but it is enough to make the opening game interesting.  

Raised to a B- for an enjoyable theme and solid art.  I would grab a copy of the first edition if ever I see one with a reasonable ticket.

Hits a lot of right notes for me. Area control. Factions and hidden information. All sorts of special abilities and traits. Bluffing, intimidation, and backstabbing. A great theme that is more than just window-dressing. And has a strong 'let's play again' factor. I rarely sleeve my games, but I'll definitely be sleeving this sucker because it's going to hit the table a lot.

I haven't played the first edition, but now I'm curious. I want more. However, given Wallace's history, I have no doubt that this second edition is the more coherent and playable design.

RATING: 6
traded away - simultaneously too slow to get combos going and too quick for the game to end; the hidden role mechanic is neat but there's no real way to help out your partner, nor is there super strong incentive to do so; since the restorationists are all drawing from a limited pool of victory points (the nobles) and loyalists are all drawing from a limited pool of victory points (the restorationists), it's better to simply maximize your points so you end up in a winning position even if you lose 5 points for your teammate's loss.

Das Spiel des Designers M. Wallace beruht auf der gleichnamigen Erzählung von N. Gayman, in der das Cthulhu-Universum von H.P. Lovecraft mit der Welt des Sherlock Holmes verbunden wird; es ist die zweite, überarbeitete Auflage des 2013 in den USA veröffentlichten Spiels „A Study in Emerald“ (Treefrog Games), das zwar wegen seines Themas begeisterte Anhänger, wegen seines inkonsistenten wie überladenen Regelwerks aber auch viele Kritiker auf den Plan rief. Die neue Fassung wartet nun mit einer freundlicheren Grafik, vor allem aber mit nachvollziehbaren, vereinfachten Regeln auf. Die Handlung des Spiels datiert in das Jahr 1882 – und die „Großen Alten“, gottgleiche Wesen aus fernen Galaxien mit übermenschlichen Kräften, beherrschen seit Jahrhunderten eine Welt, in der sich nun „Loyalisten“ (welche die Herrschaft der Alten bewahren wollen) und „Restaurationisten“ (Revolutionäre mit dem Ziel einer Wiedererrichtung menschlicher Herrschaft) gegenüberstehen. Jedem der bis zu fünf Spieler wird zu Beginn geheim eine „loyalistische“ oder „restaurationistische“ Rolle zugeteilt, die bestimmt, unter welchen Bedingungen er Siegpunkte für sich verbuchen kann. Im Kern ist das Spiel ein „Deck Building“-Game: Verfügen anfangs alle Spieler über ein identisches Deck von zehn Karten, so bemüht sich im weiteren Verlauf jeder durch Mehrheitenbildung mit Hilfe von Einfluss-Klötzchen und Agenten, in einer der auf dem Spielplan dargestellten neun Städte dort ausliegende Karten zu ergattern, die ihm eine wachsende Aktionsvielfalt eröffnen. In den Städten kann er zugleich gegnerische Agenten oder gegnerischen Einfluss beseitigen und hin und wieder – ist er denn Restaurationist bzw. will vorgeben, einer zu sein – einen „Alten“ töten. Einige dieser Aktionen verlangen einen sogenannten „Stabilitätscheck“ (mit einem sechsseitigen Würfel). Hierbei wird die mentale Stabilität des Spielers überprüft. Zu Beginn hat jeder drei Stabilitätsmarker auf seiner Rollenkarte; verliert der Spieler durch einen solchen Stabilitätscheck den letzten Marker, wird er wahnsinnig und muss seine Identität preisgeben. Entpuppt er sich als Restaurationist, ist das Spiel beendet und es folgt die Abschlusswertung, bei der z.B. Punkte, die ein Loyalist durch Ermorden eines „Alten“ oder eines loyalistischen Agenten gewann, wieder abgezogen werden. Wird der Spieler hingegen als Loyalist entlarvt, wird die Partie fortgesetzt, bis (verkürzt formuliert) entweder die Restaurationisten oder die Loyalisten eine von der Spieleranzahl abhängige Siegpunktanzahl erreicht haben.

A much improved and cleaned up version of the game, but still not for me.  There was a lot of luck in the order the cards came out, and the hidden allegiance thing doesn't really work -- the dual allegiances are fine, but the deductive element falls flat as there is little reason to bluff or every deceive.  All in all a functional but forgettable game.

Feels far too much short to develop, it ends when it seems to start to have fun.
 
The mechanic of hidden roles does not work for us. 
Not enough turns to make a bluff and then change to your real objective.
The restaurationist going mad has ruined a couple of plays
with the card "nightmares", I do reccomend to consider limiting it or not finishing the game in that condition.

We tried a game with 2 players, but I was totally out of the game after my colleague killed two agents with a card. Very unbalanced without chance to recover. I think minimun 3 players unless some rule is adapted (see other comments).

I would appreciate some rules adaptation for making it develop a little towards 100-120min of play.

Makes you think, this could be nice, but just finished...

Impressions of A Study in Emerald, 2nd Edition 

Artwork
The 2nd Edition artwork appears cartoonish compared with the 1st Edition artistic style that had the feel of the late nineteenth century. The 2nd Edition artwork isn't terrible, it's just not as interesting. 

The Game Board
The board is no longer a map of Europe. It has been simplified to just a grouping of city names. Lost is the feel of distance relationships between cities. In the 2nd Edition there is no difference between traveling from London to Paris or London to Cairo. It's a lot easier to move around in the 2nd Edition, and this might be an improvement because many people found it tedious to travel in the 1st Edition. In the 2nd Edition, each move icon (train track symbol on a card) can move an agent anywhere on the board; e.g., if a card had three move icons, you could play it to move three agents anywhere on the board. This is significantly easier than the 1st Edition’s requirement of purchasing transportation between connected cities, with the price increasing with distance and the number of cities passed through. In the 1st Edition, the airships were very powerful because they, essentially, allowed you to move per the 2nd Edition movement rules. In the 2nd Edition, the airship cards merely provide additional move symbols. Also, the 2nd Edition map no longer contains Washington DC, and the background image of a map of Europe is gone. I preferred the 1st Edition map but the simplified movement rules do speed up the game. 

Conflict
Assassinations and Hide Royalty are also simplified, for the better, I think. It’s now much less of a challenge to pull off a successful assassination but there is a diminished sense of accomplishment as well. The logistics of planning and executing an assassination in the 1st Edition were significant, and there was always the threat of the attempt being foiled by a double agent. This threat is essentially gone in the 2nd Edition. Assassinations are now almost routine affairs by comparison. Unfortunately, the entire double agent mechanism appears to have been removed from the game, to the game’s detriment. The double agent battles were a lot of fun. Perhaps there is some remnant of the double agent threat left that didn't come into play during the game I participated in, but in the 1st Edition, double agents were an ever present threat that added greatly to the atmosphere of a shadow war with humanity's destiny hanging in the balance. I miss this element.

Global Effects 
Another loss is the deck of twelve Permanent Effect cards that could globally alter the game world. These provided a great deal of added storytelling to the game, and it’s another example of a fun element being sacrificed for the sake streamlined gameplay. 

Hope for an Expansion?
Perhaps there will be a 2nd Edition expansion that brings back the 1st Edition features removed from the 2nd Edition. We can hope.

On Balance
My reaction to the 2nd Edition is mixed. The changes speed up the game, remove some of the tedium, like positioning your agents, and make end game scoring easier. I had fun playing the game, but afterwards I was much less satisfied with my experience. After a game of 1st Edition, I felt like I had participated in a rather challenging adventure, and overcome some intellectually engaging puzzles. After my game of 2nd Edition I didn't feel anything special. I was entertained but the game didn't pull me into the story. If the 1st Edition of A Study in Emerald was a flawed masterpiece, the 2nd Edition is a mediocre reproduction. The simplified 2nd edition may have a broader audience but I prefer the weightier complexity of the 1st edition.

Inspired by the Neil Gaiman Sherlock Holmes vs Cthulhu story of the same name, this is a tough game to wrap your head around.  It's technically a deck-building game, but like other Martin Wallace deckbuilders, plays highly unlike typical deck-building games.  Like A Few Acres of Snow, Mythotopia, and A Handful of Stars, you have two actions per turn, each of which consists of playing cards for their icons to take one of the many possible actions that build up your board position or expend it to claim a new card, of which you will get comparatively few over the course of the game, and then you draw back up to your hand size without discarding unused cards.  It plays much less like a deck-builder and more like an area control game where your ability to take actions is randomized somewhat by your deck.  On top of this, you're secretly divided into Restorationists, who want to kill the Great Old Ones and get points for doing so, and Loyalists, who want to support the Great Old Ones and get points for killing Restorationists.  You're still trying to win individually, but having the lowest-scoring player on your faction will drag you down.  Over the game, you total up your points for various sources somewhat confusingly, then take out the inapplicable victory points once someone's hypothetical score reaches the threshold and triggers the game end.  There's a lot to absorb, and the quick-reference is kinda crummy, as it could more clearly delineate exactly which kinds of pieces you need to trigger different actions and which ones go where as a result, but once you figure out what's going on about halfway through your first game, it flows pretty quickly.

So... this was re-jigged to keep the Kickstarter exclusive, or what? I'm torn - it's more straightforward, more playable for a numbe rof reasons (easier to explain, easier to decide what to do) - but I think that it's less compelling as a result, though not as disappointing as I feared. Does that make sense?

Card driven game in which players try to get points in different victorian locations dominated by Cthulhu and other Ancient Ones. At the end, only the points compatible with your faction (Loyalists and the Resistence) will score, and the loser's faction will be punished.

A Study in Emerald second edition managed to fix all of my problems with the original. All of the annoying fiddly bits have been streamlined, and the game no longer bogs down as players squabble over city cards. You no longer need to individually track the agents on the board, since the double agent tokens have been removed, which makes the game much more playable, and less random. 

You no longer automatically lose if your team has the player with the lowest score; Instead you lose 5 points. With scores being as low as they are in this game, that is a significant impediment, but it means that you still have a chance even if someone on your team is doing very badly. The city cards are now shuffled in with the cards on a city space, and once earned cannot be taken away, which allows the game to come to a conclusion more quickly and cleanly. In addition, the blocking markers were removed, which was another reason the game bogged down later on. Because the new edition plays faster, hiding your identity feels more meaningful.

So far only 2 plays, so tentative. The 2 player game didn't go so well, not surprisingly. Four player was great. Cool atmosphere, smooth mechanics, and we got to play with the zombies! It's a very easy game to play and goes by fast. I'm a bit concerned that skill may be less important than just the random luck of players happening to leave you alone so you can grab what you need. However, the game goes fast so I don't see that as a major problem. Half the fun for me is the theme, which is well integrated into gameplay.

Wallace has put together a great mix of mechanisms here: role deduction, area control, and deck building.  Theme is nicely implemented and art in the second addition is good if not great.  I really like the hidden teams element; you really have to study what the other players are doing.  All this less than 90 minutes!

1 play, 4er

Whereas I rate the original edition a 9, for me this one is, at best, a 7. This is sort of like the transformation from Heads of State to Royals, but even more so. Same theme, but GREATLY streamlined. I'd still play it if requested, but for me too much -- a lot the cool (thematic/interesting/weird/hard-to-teach) stuff -- has been taken away.

The game is much leaner and quicker now, with almost no back-and-forth (except for the war/revolution tracks, the fiddliest part of this new version). The pace of play has been sped up by removing:
- the extra off-board cards (some version now added to deck)
- the fight over city control (cards are now in the deck and never change control)
- blocking discs (gone)
- double-agents (essentially gone)
- separation of city and card spaces (combined now)
- "known to the authorities" (gone)
- virtual points; now, basically everyone scores all points (and only loses them at the end, if appropriate)
There are also some speed-enhancing additions:
- may now claim many cards at once
- simplified sanity tracking (loss based on die roll)

Other changes:
- Old Ones are now in the cards, but only come up randomly
- No more automatic loss for last-place team (team just loses 5VP now)
- specific agents are gone (generic tokens now)
- awesome vampires have been greatly weakened

It's much faster, but also much less thematic.

There's a lot to love about this game - deck-building, area control, auctions - but the best aspect are the hidden teams. You want to be the best player on the winning team, which is a great idea that I haven't seen in any other game. Compared to the first edition, this is prettier, faster, simpler and better balanced. It loses a bit of the drama of the original, though. I can get this edition to the table more often, but if I'm playing with experienced players, I'll bring out the first edition.

Clever and kind of interesting, but ultimately extremely chaotic.  It seems like the high point city cards are pretty ridiculously strong, and there are some ridiculously swingy cards that just bother me design-wise.  The competitive teamwork didn't really gel in our play, because with only one winner, it seems like being the guy who helps your team is unlikely to be truly helping you.  I'd play again, but only because it is so different from everything else.

I just didn't get it.  Might need another game to give a thorough thought to.  Social deduction isn;t my favorite type of game and comboed with the deckbuilding it didn't work for me.   Might be that it doesn't work well with 3, seeing as I was simply outnumbered 2 to 1.  The scoring tracks and losing points at the end for having opposing team colored points didn't feel 'right' for me.  Maybe it wasn't long or large enough for the social deduction aspect for me.  Some cards for your deck building felt like they could never be used.  Since only sample of cards are chosen, you may end up with a card that specifically counters a card that will not be in the game you are currently playing.  Regardless, I didn't overly enjoy the game, but the mechanisms in and of themselves had no real issues.

What a strange game.  It's a Cthulhu mystery game where some people are helping the monsters and some are fighting them, but you don't know who is on which team.  Great start.  It's a deckbuilding that does some cool card play where you only have 2 actions, but can combine cards to improve the actions.  Also, you can't discard cards unless you play them.  Also cool.

Then it gets weird.  Cards generally only give you points if you are on a certain team.  So, it becomes apparent fairly soon who is on which team?  Then there is a tracker you can increase that gives points to everyone on that team.  So, you want to do that, but then you are helping out the other players?  It's a weird form of semi-coop.  You play until someone has ~20 points, but there are these city cards that are worth ~5 points that you can get just as easily as any other card.  And whichever player has the lowest score, everyone on that team loses 5 points.  So you kind of want to help the people on your team, but not really.  Such a weird game.

One aspect I like is that in our 4 player game, there are 3 cards for each team so it could either be 2v2 or 3v1.  Ours ended up being 3v1 (I was the 1 and won the game), so the 3 kind of have an advantage.  But at the same time, they are almost guaranteed to have the lowest scoring player, so everyone will lose 5 points.

I don't know what to make of this game.  It's very unique and I can barely wrap my head around it.  I felt like I didn't know what was going on for most of the game.  I wouldn't mind trying it again now that I see how it plays a little better, but wouldn't seek it out.

Good game, terrible rulebook.  Bit of complicated setup, and the rules do a poor job of explaining a lot of things in a good order, but once you get playing the rules start to gel.  It's definitely a little more European-leaning with an Ameritrash skin.  The Cthulhu mythos is woven into the cards very well, but yet never really felt through the game.  It's more a political thriller against a Cthulhu backdrop than an actual Cthulhu-themed game.  A bit dry, but I enjoyed it.

Emerald for Idiots

I own the first edition and it is on my top 10 all time list of games.  After playing this game it is clear that all there is here is a point race game with a disconnected theme pathetically tacked on.  If you really want to highlight the difference between 1st and 2nd edition just look at the box covers.  The 1st has the flavor of the literature while the 2nd is taken from Godzilla destroying Tokyo.  

Wallace needs to stop trying to Ameritrash his games and go back to his roots as a designer.  This is the lowest rating I have ever given a Martin Wallace designed game by at least 4 points.

Second Edition Note (from back of box): If you have never come across this game before then please ignore the following. This is the second edition of 'A Study in Emerald'. This version of the game is significantly different to the first edition. If you were seeking the original version of this game then you had best put this one back on the shelf. However, as the first edition will never be printed again and is very hard to obtain you might want to take a punt on this version.

Still sussing out my thoughts on this one in relation to the first edition (one of my absolute favorite games).  There is definitely some streamlining that is welcome to cut out fiddly bits of the original, but some of the dynamics I really miss.  There are less ways to drag a player down, felt a bit more restricted like there is no way to stop a player once he gets an obvious lead.  I feel like this was more cryptic in the first edition, but also you had many creative ways to come up with elaborate plans to get ahead.

Really need/want to get more plays in to decide where this game will land.

Absolutely brilliant game!

Highly thematic and rich game play, combining elements of deck building, hidden roles, area control, semi co-operation together.

There are many paths to victory and styles of play, and random setup adds a tonne of variety across multiple play through's. 

Love the fact that the game allows players use their creativity to pull of epic moves and surprise the other players.

The component quality is good, though I’m not a massive fan of the art style, in particular I find the pale green color on the board a bit off putting.

Overall this has quickly become a favorite in my gaming group.

I agree about the notion of the 'Study in Emerald' not quite creating that Lovecraftian feel, apart from when Jim Boardgames and myself were contesting assets in Madrid, and were promptly squashed by the Great Old One; Cthulhu, himself. As a cultist - I don't like the terms loyalist and restorationists - I found the experience exhilarating although Jim Boardgames, being on the other side of the Euclidean triangle (?), almost certainly did not! It will play more thematically as players get to know the cards, and since the basis of the game was not taken from the 1920's but only used Lovecraft's mythos, this is maybe here it doesn't quite seem to play as you might expect. I'd happily play again as long as that Mark Evans doesn't arrange for another Old One to make my day, and his, as the eventual individual winner. The greater good!

Main mechanic was a bit confusing: why would any player waste resources on denying other players cards, if you could also spend them on getting cards yourself?

RATING: 3
Wow, what a hideous amalgamation of atrocious components, banal decisions, and haphazard instructions. 

On the surface, it's "Competitive Hanabi meets Mastermind"

Beneath the surface, it's a gimmicky guessing game hamstrung with hideous pieces or omitted pieces (seriously? A pad, but no pencils, for the same price as Dominion?)

The only redeeming value is the "range" bars for narrowing in on a proper guess of what cards you hold that are hidden from you. Even those are bested by the average restaurant's toothpick holders in terms of quality.

Think str8! is a numeric deduction game where players are deducing hidden information in front of them. This is done through rolling three dice that correspond to the different colored decks (6 decks with values ranging from 0 to 7) and selecting a range (0-21). Thus, if you roll green-yellow-red, your opponent(s) must tell you if the sum of those cards fit within the range that you selected. In doing so, the game has a push-your-luck element as you attempt to narrow your range to score VP. But guessing right isn't always the optimal outcome as wrong guesses can create useful information. Furthermore, when a player selects a wrong range, they discard one of their cards face up and replace it with a new card. Thus, by discarding a card and noting its value, players may be able to deduce the values of other cards.

This numeric deduction game expands upon the genre by adding a betting/push-your-luck element to it. And like many good numeric deduction games, the game gives players some control over what information is created (players are able to change 1-dice roll per turn). The overall effect is a brain-burning game that feels a bit more forgiving than most, as winning conditions aren't all-or-nothing. Overall, I like the mechanics quite a lot. My only strong criticism is that the loosing-player rolls the dice each time and thus influences what colors are chosen. This catch-up-mechanic creates a situation where the other players may feel like spectators. For that reason, I simply have people pass the dice around in a clock-wise fashion.

But as innovating/unique/fun as this game may be, the production quality of this game is horrendous. Most notably are the cards, which are made out of thin card stock, need to be punched out, have sharp corners, and don't conform to any standard card-size. As this is a game of hidden information, if any of the cards were to get marked up, the game would be ruined. To be blunt, I've seen prototypes with better components than this game. It is beyond disappointing, as this game is quite good. Hopefully the rights of the game will get released and the designer can find a publisher that will give this game the treatment it deserves.

Deduction games are always fun and Leo Colovini has come up with a really original concept.  It is such a pity that the publisher has produced a game of the poor sort of physical quality that I was convinced we had said "Goodbye" to many years ago.

No frills deduction at its best. The logic feels similar to a Sudoku puzzle, as you suss out what your number cannot be, hoping to narrow it down to only one choice. Combined with betting and using others' bets to find your own number, this is the best deduction game I have played. Only downside is with its drab presentation, it is a hard "sell" to get to the table. If it make it, however, everyone I've played with wants to play again.

Don't be fooled by the box. This isn't a short colorful filler like Finito. This is a serious deduction game. Besides the deduction element, there is a layer of strategy when deciding whether you want to collect bigger points during the game by guessing correctly, or whether you want to collect more information by finding out if you've guessed too high or low.

If you've enjoyed games like Deduce or Die, and you've been disappointed by the lightweight nature of other deduction games, then this is a must buy.

Everyone has said this already, but the components are the worst I've seen in a published game.

I thought the game was a neat logic puzzle where you're trying to figure out your numbers before the game ends. However, I don't think my gaming partner cared for it because while this would fall in the deduction category, it isn't "serious" deduction. Especially early on, you don't have much to go on so you are guessing ranges. I would like to give this game a few more plays before rendering a final verdict, but I have a hunch it will be hard to bring it back to the table.

A fascinating deduction exercise that is setup similarly to Hanabi, but competitive instead of cooperative. The game may be a tad too long and the end game scoring has been designed a bit lazily.

Light-weight deduction game, which offers interesting mix of deduction and gambling. Sounded good to me AND what's best - it works very well. Components are one of the weakest ever (and I've played over 1500 different games), but after you've used some sleeves for the cards, then it's ok. One of the best Colovinis' designs and something you should at least try if you are deduction lover. Hidden little gem.

Odd deduction game (based on guessing ranges and using dice as an occasionally limiting factor).

Great pure deduction game! Rules are simple but deep!
Between this and Alchemists, the latter is definitely the better game. Yet, both games deserve a spot in my collection.
I'll always play with the gray color, as we found that the deduction-element really amps up.

Components SUCK though. It is hard to fathom how badly produced this game is. Making your own copy of this game is likely to result in better components. The board could literally (in a figurative sense) be replaced by a napkin without lowering the quality.
Cards are sleeved.

EDIT: After 10 plays, the game does begin to show a few flaws. Based on the numbers shown on opponents' card rows, certain numbers are simply easier to figure out than others (if 5 and 6 of a given colour is visible and you yourself have a 7 of said colour, deducing this becomes much easier than 0-4).
.. also, only deduction sheets for 2-3 more plays.

OMG the board is such crap, so thin.  It rests on the insert and gets bent.  The layout of the score card makes it hard to see the numbers you wrote so that is crap too.  BTW fun game.  But oh the crap components.

Surprisingly thinky deduction game with lots to offer by way of deduction and play styles.  This game would be near perfect with a better production.  I normally pass on a game if i think they aren't high quality component AND game play wise, but this game was too interesting to pass up.

A lot has been said about the awful components so I'll just pile on: the components are unforgivable. This game is from an established board game publisher so I don't see how they considered a flimsy cardstock board and cardstock "cards" with sharp corners to be acceptable. If this game ever gets a real edition then I could see it being a hit.

With that said, the gameplay is really good. Pure deduction with some risk taking involved in the form of betting on which numbers you think you have.

I normally rate games on gameplay alone, in which case this would be about an 8, but in this special case I have to take off points for the cheap components because they actually detract from the gameplay experience.

An incredibly though brain burner: you'll have smoke coming out of your ears during this and your head will nearly explode.
It's a very well constructed deduction game but i fear it has a very low replayability as it will soon seem to be the same game over and over again. Another defect is that it is probably good only for a limited number of people that do not mind to squeeze their brains a bit.
Mathphobics keep away from this.

Worst components of any game I've ever seen.  Ever.  Will most likely pass on future games from this publisher.

It's a lot of fun to shoot at each other, I was really surprised at how hard the cannonballs shot out too... which makes it even better.

We love this very simple but extremely fun game.  Mission cards, advanced rules, ha!  Just let me aim my cannon and blast away! Arrrrrgh!  We even have pirate hats that we wear while we play and I decorate the map with extra plastic pirates and cannons...just for fun.******** I have many more plays than what is recorded here.  I have only recently begun being good about recording plays.  All in all, I must have a few dozen plays in on this game with kids and adults and it is universally loved by anyone that has played it.

Rated for kids.  Wow -- fantastic components!  What kid (or adult for that matter) wouldn't enjoy sailing around blowing stuff up?  Fun game, high quality production -- although it should come packaged with safety glasses.  No wonder all those pirates wear eye patches!
[b] Note:  This game is best played with "The Pirates of the Caribbean" soundtrack playing in the background![/b]

The game is almost nothing, but the incredible dart cannons and wonderful bits make this a real winner.  I only wish it could accept more than two players and that it wasn't strictly a luck fest for play.

You roll out a giant mat and blast the other player's ship and the stone tower with spring-loaded cannons. You draw cards that indicate which targets you have to hit with the cannons in order to win, and spin a dial to see how many movements and shots you can take on your turn.

For some reason, you can move the tower between three different islands. I guess it's a mobile tower. When you hit the sides of the tower, there are hatches that release a huge treasure chest. 

Anyway this game is amazing. If you turn your nose up at it, I'm afraid you'll be labeled a Joyless Adult. 

Unfortunately the cannons seem to be made with a particular type of gold plastic that becomes brittle over time. I doubt they will last much longer than 10-20 years.

I was a little underwhelmed with the game play here at first, but the components are awesome, big ships and real cannons that can destroy parts of your opponent's ship.  The last time we played we added the advanced objective rules, however, and there is a really fun, accessible game here.  A couple more plays could see this amongst the best kids games we own.

This game takes a huge amount of space but kids & adults both love it.  I purchased it at an extreme discount.  I don't know if I could have mustered the $80 it was supposed to be priced at.  The box is huge & tricky to find a place to store it at.   Alas, it doesn't get the play time because it is stored away from other games & gets forgotten.  But...when it comes out it is fun.  We make teams so we can have any number of players rather than the 2 stated on the box.

The comments by others are spot on: it's 1/2 game, 1/2 toy... but all fun. Imagine playing Attacktix with big pirate ships and you've got a rough idea about what you're in for.

Nice shooting game that is perfect for my son's age.
Solid components and a large carpet like playing area that mostly will be used on the floor due to its size.

(I have to add an editorial comment to the smell rating.  The neutral non-smell rating should almost be viewed as a plus in this game.  It's huge plastic pieces, yet didn't have the toxic plastic smell of many other games with plastic pieces.  [it is hard plastic])

A cool concept, with nice production values.  After having played back to back with Star Wars Attacktix, it feels more complicated than it needs to be, as it requires more skill and will last longer.  Still, if the kids enjoy playing, it's definitely worthwhile - it's just not my first choice in dexterity/shooting games.

This game is very close to a toy, but the rules, the components and mechanics kind of give you the feel of pirates skirmish. The components break easily: the cannons are known to break at the jonction with the base and the front figure on the blue boat broke when I hit it.

What a beautiful looking game! It's fun to play, but has a little bit too much luck, so don't take it too seriously. And when the price was only 25 euros (discount price), it was clear that I wanted my own copy.

RATING: 7
Pure fun as you maneuver your very large ship around the huge table sized mat (some may need to play on the floor) seeking to actually shoot a spring loaded cannon at different targets to meet your secret objective and then race back to port.  Our second play, we made a couple changes in that both of us took two secret objective cards which had to be completed before racing back to harbor AND a variation where if the sail was shot down, movement for the player of that ship would lose one movement point the next turn.  This game has large sized components and a huge box - larger than even the Fantasy Flight coffin boxes!

My buddy's kid had just got this and we played it.  Pretty awesome game!  Reminds me of the old Crossbows & Catapults which was one of my favorites as a kid.  Highly recommend if you can past the price.

A unique game that's guaranteed to bring out the kid in anyone!  The bits are wonderful.  There is no real strategy to speak of.  Just aim your cannon at your opponent, fire, and watch their ship go kablooie! Definitely worth the money.

Great dexterity game (with kids or if you are in the right mood). Needs a bit rule tweaking, if you want to play it competitively (usually it is just plain and somewhat silly fun).
Gorgeous and amazingly sturdy components (except for the cannon's pivot pegs, which seem to break easily - if one half of the pegs is still intact, the cannons do still work as intended, but if a complete peg breaks, correct aiming would not be possible - without a complicated repair job).

RATING: 7
Game in a Nutshell: Move around a giant map, shooting some heavy hitting toy cannons to accomplish a short list of secret missions.

Played as: Two-player only.

Pros: Come on, need I say anymore then you actually get to shoot at each other? The components are probably my favorite of any game I own (that includes Space Hulk). Moving a big pirate ship around the giant fold out map is another huge selling point

Cons: Wow, that's a big box! I figure with a little more effort, half the box size could have worked fine. The cannons are can be a bit difficult to get the hang of aiming, holding steady, and firing.  I imagine people with bigger hands would find this game a bit frustrating. There's a number of rules that could have been clarified a little more and others that just need a little tweaking. As is, there's only a slight amount of strategy and could leave people hungering for something a bit more mentally engaging. 

Other: A could write a list of home-rules we've made to clarify some vagarious situations in the rule book. I may list those here in the future. For what it's worth, I'd be terrified to subject this kid's game to the destructive nature of children.

Best Use: A sea battle game at it's purest for the kid in all of us.

This reminded me of a more strategic version of Crossbows & Catapults.  It's certainly built to the same scale.  Quick, silly fun for those who like playing with toys.

Kids game where you navigate your ship around and shoot at the opposing player's ship or a neutral tower. You are trying to achieve certain victory conditions dictated by your mission card.

Big and expensive, but probably fun.

Fun 'crossbows and catapults' variant.  You get a mission card at the beginning of the game and then need to collect the appropriate targets which include shooting various parts of your opponents ship or the fort and collecting stuff from one of two islands.  After you collect your targets, you need to sail back to port.

RATING: 7
As far as kid's action games goes this is one of the best.  My daughter loves it and takes it out all the time.  The shooting cannons work very well and require skill to position the gun and then aim and shoot.  We like the random objectives version or just the head to head ship destruction version.

Big ships = Big fun! This is one fun 2 player pirate game! The game is simple, take a mission card, spin the spinner, move the ship, and shoot the canons! This game will bring out the kid in you...who can resist the simple pleasure of targeting your opponent's pirate ship and shooting a canon through it's mast!?! The powerful canons are great fun for aiming and work very well at shooting off pieces of a ships hull or tower!

The components are overall very well made and thought out...except...the canons! When placing the canon into it's base for the first time, a piece of the connector broke off from every canon...and that was with a very light touch! Still able to play the game, but one canon is very loose and difficult to aim! Ravensburger will not replace parts as the game is OOP!

While I never thought anything would displace Torpedo Run in this aim-shoot genre; this most certainly does.  I think it is the fact you get to move around.  The doors on the castle tower seem a bit finicky (i.e. don't come off sometimes even with a direct hit), but otherwise this game really outshines Torpedo Run.  The ships are very, very cool and not as fragile.

Got a second cheap copy on ebay just for combining two in one big game.

Fun fact: when we built our own dining table, we made sure the play mat for this game would fit on it so we would never have to play on the floor again. (That's just torture)

YES!  Sail around! Shoot stuff!  It's just about the perfect pirate game and certainly outstanding for what it is.  On top of that there is actually something of a game here.

It should be noted that you could actually lose an eye playing this game ... but then you'd get to wear a patch!

Keep your eyes out for the human meat in a bag disguised as treasure.

A bit toy, a bit game, this is a sumptuous feast of fun for the kid - and the pirate - in all of us. The play map is a floor-sprawling affair with plenty of high-seas charm, and the ships not only fire cannon shot at their targets but also have have a half-dozen strike zones built into them, including sails that buckle when hit, flags that can be shot off and a treasure compartment in the stern that snaps open when hit. Add in a tower that has its own built-in targets and cannon, and Pirates on the High Seas comes loaded with enough goodies to justify its price. The turn spinner doles out very unequal options and actions randomly to the players, but then this is a very light dextertity game with minimal strategy, and the  uneven nature of the turns seems to enhance rather than detract from the chaotic, rollicking fun. This one is almost certain to charm adults as well as the kiddies. Recommended!

As a kids game this rates around a 10.  Big ships, big-board mat, and cannons that shoot against each other.  I saw this played at Essen 06 and it just looked cool.  I picked up a copy to keep in shrink for my collection.  Maybe in a hundred years it will fetch thousands on eBay.  Or maybe I'll just give it to my grandkids if that time ever comes.  For a 6-8year old this would be one of the big boxes under the tree loaded with hours of fun.

The action game with lots of navigation, working cannons, and a gigantic cloth game mat! Are you ready to take to the high seas as courageous pirates fighting against one another? Then hoist the sails, raise the anchors, and take off to adventure! Who will best steer his ship with skill over the seas? Who will aim, shoot and score with flair? And who at the end will with a little luck bring the most valuable treasures back to the harbor? In this game, you can show who's the real king of the sea.

Oversized, cannon-shooting fun that takes up a mammoth spread of table space.

RATING: 5
Based on half a solitaire game, this game has a moderate amount of cards to be sure, but the amount of text on each one is a bit too much to handle.  The problem in only compounded by the fact that there is no short hand, such as, "ok these locations provide this resource and this one and this one have special abilities that I have to track."  Instead every single location seems to have a different special ability that activates during a different phase..etc.  Middle Earth is supposed to be a heavy card game, but I had less trouble with it than GoT:LCG.  It might just be the learning curve, but those location cards are tough to track once you get three or four combined with a couple plot cards, some characters, and an attachment or two.  Eh, maybe I was just tired or something.  Strangely, it felt like a combination of Scarab Lords and Camelot Legends.

RATING: 7
Definetely an interesting and well done card game.  The game is an easy one to learn with some interesting play style and easily customizable.  However, the special abilities are rather confining and only has one real attack component.  I would have enjoyed just a bit more complexity.

Bought a few cards to see how it works after reading the books but never played properly so take the rating with a pinch of salt.  Strikes me as an interesting game if you have the characters, places and incidents from the books but that is expensive to aquire - a bit pedestrian otherwise.

Probably not really interested in the CCG now that the LCG is out...
Was looking for offers of full USPS fixed-price (flat rate) shipping boxes of cards.  This would be approximately 2,800 - 3,000 cards.  Offered lots need to include at least 185 Rares.   
Only interested in cards from the following sets:  Iron Throne Block (Iron Throne Edition, A House of Thorns, Iron Throne Edition Legacy Pack, A House of Talons) and Five Kings Block (Five Kings Edition, A Clash of Arms, A Time for Ravens).  

Can be combined with cards from other titles in which I am interested to get a full shipping box (but should still have an appropriate number of Rare cards).  

Not really interested in this one until the starter & booster boxes/cases make their way to the bottom of the clearance bins (but wanted to go ahead and add it to my list so that I do not forget) and I can obtain in bulk.  

Probably not even worth discussing unless nobody in your area plays any more and you are just looking to dump your collection and at least get something rather than nothing (i.e. throwing the cards in the dumpster to make room for new stuff).

Got a bunch of used cards, easily enough to build multiple decks.  Probably just going to build three decks that are balanced against each other.  The game had enough interesting decisions that playing static decks still makes for an interesting game (moreso than Magic, for sure).

I like this game a lot, but come on, George.  Where the heck is A Feast For Crows?!?  We need another new book!
(3/10/06) OK, we have a new book, but FFG has made some changes to some of the rules and continues to give us new versions of the main characters.... I was hoping for something more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The first version (CCG) deserved a 10 until they changed the rules making more difficult to eliminate the main characters (which is NOT in GRR Martin's style: Lord Tywin Lannister was killed while sitting in the bathroom...). AGOT is a ruthless world and ruthless should have been the card game also. Still worth playing with likeminded friends. "Hear me roar"!

This has quickly become my favorite CCG.  The game mechanics are excellent.  The overall game is less of a rare chase than most CCGs I have played.  And it is based on one of my favorite series of books.  It also helps that my wife loves it as well, especially since she has been less than enthused by other CCGs I have had her try and she is not really much of a gamer to begin with.

This is easily the best collectible card game I have ever played, the rules are highly streamlined and intuitive.  This allows players to think about actual game/card strategy and not whether or not a move is legal or how to pull a move off.  Card types are compacted (as compared to Magic and other games), so there aren't a lot of card types with different nit-picky rules on how they work.  For example, instead of Enchantments and Equipment, A Game of Thrones has only Attachments, some which have themes of weapons and armor, others with magic or titles.  There's no need to muddy the waters when one card type with universal rules but different themes serves the same purpose and function but with less headaches, the designers realized this.  Anyone who thinks Magic's concept of "The Stack" is an easy and intuitive mechanic should definitely give this game a try, I think they'll find the grass much greener on this side of the hill.

RATING: 7
This is my favorite CCG and LCG for that matter, and I feel no shame in saying it's partially due to the liscensed theme. If only there were people to play it with locally =( If I were to actually compare it to Magic or The Spoils in terms of 'fun factor' it would probably have a rating of 9 as well but finally we get a completely different CCG than Magic. The Spoils and WoW have refined Magic's play style and fixed it's resource management but AGoT is it's own game with so many different mechanisms that seperate it from other CCG's, and for that I give it the extra point. 

So what makes it *so* different?  The basics of Game of Thrones is the combat system, game phases, the plot deck, and resources.  Combat is broken down into 3 types of challenges: Power, Military and Intrigue.  Not all characters can participate in all types of challenges.  If you win a military challenge the loser must kill one of their creatures.  If you win an Intrigue challenge, the loser must discard a card.  You win by attaining 15 power but start off with zero.  If you win a power challenge, you steal one power from your opponent. As for the phases, in Magic, the Spoils and WoW each player takes turns going through all of their phases.  In AGoT all players go through each individual phase together (think Arkham Horror).  Example:  Players select plots in the plot phase, players draw two cards in the draw phase, each player plays cards during the marshaling phase, etc.  The plot deck indicates 4 things: how much gold (resources to play cards) you have.  That's not the only way to get gold however.  Plots also determines who gets initiative, the person who wins initiative decides who goes first in each phase if the actions are not done simultaneously.  The third thing is claim, which indicates is the severity of the challenges.  If I have a 2 claim plot and win a military challenge, my opponent  would have to choose 2 of his characters/creatures to kill.  The plot card also has either a special ability, limitation, or something that effects both players.  

This game also has a setup in which each play uses 5 resources to put cards into the game before you actually start playing.  There's also a dead pile and discard pile which have differences.  There is more than one resource as well.  Gold is typically used for playing cards and then there is the influence resource which typically pays for card abilities and events.  In terms of ability/card resolution, it's typically first ability played is the first ability resolved with the exception of cancel effects, where as other CCG's typically have first effect in is the last effect out.  This is a great game.

Recently this became an LCG which takes a lot (but not all) of the expensive collecting edge out of the game.

[1/2 an I&F premium starter, a couple of boosters' worth of donated Greyjoy cards] CCG based on George Martin's A Song of Ice & Fire fantasy novels. Got into this because a friend was getting tired of waiting for A Feast of Crows. It's ok, nothing amazing. The artwrok is very nice, as might be expected from FFG. My main beef is with the pace of the game. The description I'd use is "plodding". This becomes especially bad when in a three-player game. Still need to play a bit more using my now-tuned squidhead deck, which is a bit comboish. Don't quite know how that ties into the Ironborn credo... Theme to mechanics is very CCGish. Still, not a bad little game, but I'm stopping the investment with my Greyjoy Armada. Now, where can I get Euron Crow's Eye?

Didn't like it at all. Too much luck involved: you get money-generating locations at the beginning you win, otherwise good luck. Also events do not cost anything to play, you can hose your opponent if you have a lucky draw. I would say it's broken unless you consider that "coin toss" isn't a broken game. (My review has nothing to do with the theme, I loved the books.)

Picked up two starters 03/02/07


Pretty fun little game.  Plays not-too-hot out of the starters, which is a BIG knock for me these days on a CCG.

I think this would've been better served as a series of Blue Moon style fixed decks.  I think the strategy here is pretty much on par with one of those style games...choosing with whom and when to attack, and when to defend, how to protect yourself and minimize losses while still doing damage to your foe...

Does seem to run a bit long--we ended at 1 hr with the score 10-7.


Will give this further plays, perhaps pick up some extra cards so the decks are a bit more playable.


--EDIT:  Traded away.  Just not a remarkable game.

The only CCG I've managed to get into. Good gameplay, friendly designers. Local players are welcoming (though maybe I'm just lucky). And the source material (ie the novels) are well worth reading.

A very good game. Timing of the game play is a bit obscure, but the FAQ helps immensely. If you've played other CCG's, it'll be easy to pick up. Definitely worth playing.

Another very heavily magic influenced CCG that I played a good bit of in the early 2000s.  Fun little game and was actually fairly balanced with a few minor exceptions, but most of the games felt very samey.

This is the game that really killed CCGs for me.  I started collecting the cards not long after the game was first introduced (well before the TV show) because I loved the book series.  I really liked the military/intrigue/power balance between the 3 houses and thought they did a great job with the gameplay.  
That was before they started launching new expansions every 3 months.  I liked the addition of the Greyjoys and the Targaryens.  By the time House Martell came along though, it felt like the game was getting bloated.  Too many new rules, too many new houses and alliances and new card types.  And with literally thousands of new cards being added every year, it became increasingly depressing to look at a pile of 2,000 cards and realize that you will ever only use a handful of them when you play.  There were plenty of cool cards, but at the end of the day, you are only going to put so many into your deck.  Expansions really killed this game for me.  I got rid of nearly all of my cards.  I still have a couple of decks that I can pull out if the mood strikes, but that is unfortunately very rare.  What a shame, because, again, I thought it was a great game when it first came out.

I&#039;m a huge fan of CCG&#039;s, which is why I don&#039;t get involved in them anymore.  I end up spending way too much on every CCG I try.  But if you have to get hooked on one, this is a very good choice.  ESPECIALLY if you are a fan.  A game plays a LOT like the stories feel.  But I&#039;m very glad I drew the line at $80 some dollars or I&#039;d be broke.

How did this become my most played game in just a few months?  Maybe I should rate it higher (moved rating to 8).
The game benefits from a nice background/license, and a very friendly player base.
Best in multi-player (melee), but takes much longer per game (60-90 minutes).

Unfortunately, as with many collectible games, the plethora of new rule mechanics and special rules tends to bog the game down for me.  I understand that some people feel that these additions keep the game fresh, and top rated tournament players like them (they also keep casual players from being too competitive). If I want to have to study a game and the minutiae of the rules to that extent, I will start playing ASL again. (rating lowered to 7)

A CCG which you can count on an expansion set to be released regularly (one can't say the same for the novels--damn you Martin!).  It's a very streamlined game with the the traits of the Houses (Stark, Lannister, Greyjoy, etc.) coming out in the cards & in the gameplay.  Not my favorite but I give the score based on solid game design & mechanics.  I probably would like it a lot more if I played it more often.

Ive played countless CCG's...most are standard, very few are GREAT>  This is a true great one.  Especially with the expansions  the game has very simple and elegant mechanics.  Very clear and concise...very fun and strategic.Only problem is the game really SHINES if you have read or are reading the novels...Martin is an absolute genius.  The game really catches the flavor of his spectacular tale.

---------------------------------------------------

So now the Core Set of the LCG is in my hands...I shall have to try it very soon.  I am eager to see if this tightens things up a bit and puts everyone on a more even playing field.
My wife will be the first victim...
JB and Emil were the next to fall...
I think the new format will serve players like me real well.  I can keep each deck/House at a reasonably competitive level (if not tournament competitive) whilst growing together at a reasonable pace.
The game *may* have just gotten better...

Did I say Dreamblade would be my only foray into "live" collectible games? Well, Dreamblade is dead and I'm now playing AGoT CCG. I was pulled in by its interesting game play, move to the LCG format ("Living Card Game"), theme (big fan of the books), and highly regarded community of players. If you're going to try a CCG, this one is a worthy candidate.

UPDATE (Aug '08): Since I started playing this game eight months ago, it has dominated my game playing time. It. Is. Awesome. The group of players that meet up regularly in NYC is a friendly, mature bunch and makes a fun game a real treat to play.

Comments entered on 13 Dec 2010:

A Game of Thrones CCG/LCG is a card game where you attempt to play out the military, political, and power struggles of the characters from the A Game of Thrones universe. The two versions of the game vary greatly in their distribution methods and slightly in their gameplay, with the LCG offering more emphasis on the multiplayer aspect of the game.

I purchased the starter decks to the original release of the CCG version of the game. I had a chance to play the game a couple of times initially but because of the collectible nature of the game, was unable to really delve into it. There was also the issue of having opponents to play against. After working at FFG I was able to play quite a bit more during the Winter Edition block.

My kids have played all three of the LCG games currently available (Warhammer Invasion and Call of Cthulhu) and both seem to really enjoy playing this game. Especially as a 3-player multiplayer game.

With the introduction of the LCG model, I have purchased at least one of every card product offered and in the case of the core set, I purchased three of those.

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a deck is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

(25+ plays) George RR Martin's monstrous fantasy series "A Song of Ice and Fire" drew me in.  I have enjoyed this one.  It has the usual CCG rules problems.  It has the usual CCG marketing scheme.  The thing I like best about the mechanics is that it is actually bad to beat one player down.  Often, in any type of 3 player game, one player gets abused, another is doing OK but frustrated, the other wins.  In this game, it is bad to abuse one player.  The game really shines as a 3 player game.

Excellent stuff, but made even more interesting if you&#039;ve read the books.  The &quot;Gold Coins&quot; redemption program is cool, but man, is it a pain cutting those things off of the booster packs.  FF should follow WarCry&#039;s example and make the coins inserts in the booster packs...Score DOES lose a point for it being so damn difficult to find someone to play with...  :)

RATING: 8
There's a lot of really great aspects to this game.  I love the fact that both players go through the phases of the round together, instead of one person taking his turn and then the other.  I also love the plot deck, and its balancing and strategy.  I also really love the interplay of the challenges.  How you can force your opponent into defending one challenge in order to gain an advantage in another.

The one thing i don't really like is how little creativity I feel there is in the deckbuilding.  I have to include a certain number of characters, locations, etc.  Combos are almost non-existant, and the large number of character resets means that rush doesn't really function well either.  So its basically one strategy of control vs. another.

Huge fan of the novels, but have only played with the starter sets. I don't know anyone else who plays this, so the deck building doesn't come to me. I would like to be able to play it more and learn it better, but for now it will just be a minor collectable for me.

I admit to having a deep bias against all of FFG's CCG products, despite whatever quality may or may not be therein.  Played this one at tournament level from its release until its second cycle of sets, dropping before the third cycle. Again FFG makes a game that captures the flavor of the theme, but overpowers some game mechanics of a CCG.

For a CCG, the older cards hold no investment value because the game makers abandon older sets at the tournament level when a new set cycle is released, keeping only the recentmost two complete cycles.

Probably not really interested in the CCG now that the LCG is out...

Was looking for offers of full USPS fixed-price (flat rate) shipping boxes of cards.  This would be approximately 2,800 - 3,000 cards.  Offered lots need to include at least 185 Rares.   

Only interested in cards from the following sets:  Iron Throne Block (Iron Throne Edition, A House of Thorns, Iron Throne Edition Legacy Pack, A House of Talons) and Five Kings Block (Five Kings Edition, A Clash of Arms, A Time for Ravens).  

Looking to pay about ""nn"" cents per unplayed (or played but mint) booster (a bit more for starters) [or offer ""nn"" cents per/booster in trade value if trading].  

nn = 11.  

Will bulk trade my MtG cards at 1:5 (1 of my MtG cards for 5 of your cards).

Offers to trade these cards can be combined with cards from other titles in which I am interested to get a full shipping box (but should still have an appropriate mix of Rare cards).  

Probably not even worth discussing unless nobody in your area plays any more and you are just looking to dump your collection and at least get something rather than nothing (i.e. throwing the cards in the dumpster to make room for new stuff).

RATING: 8
One of my favourite ccgs... excellent theme and plays in a sensible amount of time. You need a few cards to get the best of it.. my advice is to stick to the Westeros edition and build yourselves 3 decks (Lanister, Stark, Baratheon) and don't worry about any of the later expansions. That way you can have great fun playing but remain financially solvent!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
That's a very good CCG, with an interesting background. Made for Martin characters fans. The mechanics of the challenges in this game are nice. I found that 2 players games are good but maybe too predictable; in 4 players, games last for too long; maybe the right number is 3 where you get enough interactions while  keeping the duration within decency.The only negative point it's the collectible part, but that's all.
Note: reading Call of Cthulhu rules (the other Fantasy Flight CCG) it seems that the challenge mechanic has been incorporated again, making the two games very similar. (With very different inspiration, of course).

[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] One of my favorite CCGs. Probably helps that I love the books. FFG does a great job with the ongoing development of this game.

Update: I haven't played this in probably two years now, mainly because I just don't do CCGs any more. I'm leaving my rating as is, though, because the game (on its own merits) is solid.

Only half understand it after one play, so I won't rate it.  I doubt it would rate highly, though, because it's too fiddly with the rules and all the special powers, attachments, cancellations, etc. and takes too long to play for this type of game.  A stark contrast to a great game like Dominion that is easy to grasp, plays quickly, yet still features countless interesting combinations so that no two games are exactly alike.

It's not that I don't like this game.  George R.R. Martin's books are excellent, and the franchise milking is less annoying because of it.  Furthermore, this is a well designed CCG.  Unfortunately, the very [i]concept[/i] of a CCG is offensive to me now after I've paid far too much money for AGOT and M:TG cards.  For a while, I thought AGOT might be different--but go to a couple of tournaments and you'll soon see suitcase gamers.

I used to really like this game - but over expansion and introducing too many fiddly rules has really soured me on this game.  Rating moved from 9 to a 5.  Old review below.

(I've played a lot of CCGs and I must say that I like this one quite a bit.  First, I think that it appeals to a more mature card-playing audience.  If you've read GRRMs novels, you know what I mean.  If not, his fantasy writing is not geared to kids.  Second, I like the variety of ways that a player can attack an opponent (i.e. the usual military challenges, but also intrigue or political power challenges).  A VERY strong point in terms of CCGs is the fact that a player does not need to have countless rare cards in their deck to be able to perform well.  Common issue cards can be quite effective in play and are needed in most decks.  Finally, I like the idea of the plot card mechanic: each player plays a new plot card each round.  This plot card determines initiative and essentially acts as a story line as the game progresses.  The game is worth the purchase of a starter deck and a couple of trial plays.)

The mechanics (simple and elegant) and the environment, it is very successful. It mixes the intrigue and the combat of the books.

One of my favorite CCG's of all time. Its state as a CCG had both the flavor and mechanics to make it a successful contender in the collectible card game market. However, due to it being published by a company with considerably less resources than its competitors it was relegated to a smaller market share with only a handful of dedicated followers playing it world wide. The game has possibly the best mechanics for both a two-player and multi-player game compared to other CCG's of its era. The game has since been turned to an LCG and has seen a resurgence in popularity due to the Fire and Ice TV series on HBO.

This is the definition of a CCG for me. Clear and straight forward combat with three different categories of battles to participate in. Innovative scoring that reflects the theme of the game. On top of that, multi-player mode is probably one of the best in the CCG market and doesn't change the overall feel of the game at all.

UPDATE - Played this as a three-player with the new Core set. Very satisfying. I think it will easily make appearances at our game night. I've decided for now to only use cards from the Core set and Chapter Packs to limit the field. Hopefully that will work well.

We started doing a three-player sealed draft tournament with this, and it went on for 5+ months before one of the participants moved away, so it certainly got its mileage. Most of my games as a result have been three player, though I think the game works better with only two. The mechanics are decent, but as with many CCGs, more of the fun is in the deck building. The gameplay does have a bit more decisions than some in its genre. 

I wish there were more resources still out there for the CCG version of this game.  The rulebooks we got with our sets are incomplete, and it's very frustrating to find rules answers, particularly rulings for specific cards.  Ah, the difficulties of a dead CCG.

A wonderful card game. Moving to the LCG format was a great move, as it's now easier to remain competitive in the field. Very fun for casual 2-player games, and supports one of the better multiplayer game formats I've seen in a CCG. Lots of clever moving parts, and I enjoy the deck-building strategies for AGoT far more than I ever did for M:tG... but the single best part is the integration of the Plot cards and a Plot phase, where you set your immediate short-term goals and guarantee yourself some level of resources. This and other design decisions helps reduce the "mana screw" effect of other CCGs. I'm always up for a game or three. Gets played a LOT at work.

Ah the other really interesting CCG that you don't have to kill your opponent to win.  This game is a lot of fun with multiple players, but a little weaker than the Cthulhu CCG in two player games.

I love how there are multiple ways of gaining power and winning.  Plus it's a wonderful game if you are a fan of the books.

One of my current favorite CCGs.  I like that the actions you take are not always about killing your opponent's men.  The plot deck creates great strategies and interesting decisions from turn to turn.  Factions are well designed and true to the flavor of the books.

I love this game and the setting. Great with two players, great with more!

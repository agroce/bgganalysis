Well, the short, filler/opener type game that is on a board and has little to do with cards is in a very small field.  Frankly, we could do with more games like that - Clans, Tsuro, Patrician, King Of Siam, are all pretty welcome!  This one is up there with the best.  

It's got a few things going for it:
it's very quick playing (forget the hour quoted, this is more like 30-40 mins for four players)
It's got a fair bit of depth for a quick game
There's about the right amount of variation in luck terms - gives it extra replayability. 
It's VERY attractive - yes that is a plus in getting it to the table!
It's simple to learn and play
You have various methods of making progress - you won't play all of your peices and cards, so what you do with them is up to you.
The action cards are elegantly done and add a huge amount of suspense for such a short game.
The event cards add replayability and fun.
It works well as a two player and four player (and probably as a 3, though I haven't tried that yet)

The only weakness is that the game is still a little bit abstract - even with the superb pieces and elegance.  Personally, I'll forgive it that, as there's so many good things about it.

Very interesting area control game.  The Mongol invasions and special powers (i.e., "sticks") help balance out the positive earnings.  I enjoyed it, though I feel like I have a decent grasp (or start) on options and strategies after only one play.  I'd like to play this again.

4/01/09  Played it again one year later.  Still felt like I understood what was going on.  Won a second time.  Leaving it at a 7 because production quality is good (yay tower pieces) and it plays relatively quick, even with 4 players (1 hour or less).

RATING: 6.5
This is a nice game that probably should be seen as a super filler.  You can play the game quickly enough to drive the game to category.  As a full on strategy game - it'll likely fall a bit short.  It is in essence an area control game with a bit of bluff.  It is key to get your wall sections in place on the right part of the wall in positions that are strong.  Missing the mark can be costly because not only do you have negative consequences, you took a turn to get yourself there.  the game requires you to predict to some degree what your fellow players are doing and what they know.  Playing blind will certainly not work to your advantage.

There is a lot more to this game then meets the eye. While it seems very simple on the surface, the interaction between the players can have drastic consequences on the outcome and I'd go so far as to say that this is definitely one game where it's "not over till it's over!"

A good (but not great) area control game where you are laying blocks of the Great Wall of China. There is a lot of interaction with the special cards and I like the 2nd part of the game where the invaders attack. However, I think the interaction is too "in your face". My GF actually got very upset with me when twice in the same game I switched out her piece to another area giving me the majority by using my special cards. If you enjoy "take that" kind of play, you would like this game. As a plus, it does have wonderful components.

Score points by building the great wall of china.

Each turn choose one action:
place 2 walls
place a card and a wall
place 2 cards
place tower
place double wall

When walls are complete in a province, score province. Majority wall builder (or tied) in province wins. At end of game, majority wall builder on mongol side will subtract points for each province they are "defending".

Winner is the one left with the most points.

Area majority game with a smart twist, that you collect the majority in positve VP-areas and simultan in areas with negative VP. Manage both sides of the china wall and use your five special tokens effective and you have a great time. Theme fits quite nicely and game length of 45 - 60 min. is fine for this kind of game.

Pretty straight forward area control, plus placement of "take that" cards that affect the scoring of the region.

Only 1 play so far. We played with the variant where the mongols strength is shown as soon as any wall is built that borders them. Maybe that waters down the excitement, I don't know. But it just seemed a little random to be fighting for something with unknown VP (yes, I know about the double wall and tower let you look, but that tells you only 2 mongols out of 16 (4p game). Also didn't play with any of the variant cards, but none of them seemed super compelling. The game seems to lack any sort of flow. You do the same thing at the beginning, middle, and end, which no change in thought. I think there was one interesting play in the whole game. Makes me want to go play El Grande.

I'm glad I have this in China, but it's really the Chinese theme that makes it a keeper for me.

My first acquaintance with this title was at a Dutch game fair many years ago. At the time I played with just two, and probably got a few rules mixed up, so the game went on my want to play again-list. It took a while, but I eventually got to play it with more players. It's a lightweight majority game married to some luck and reverse psychology wrapped in a nice packaging with cute wall pieces. I think that if you don't look too closely the game works well as a family title with bite: although fairly straightforwards there's quite a bit of placement rules to digest. The problem I have is precisely the rather involved nature of the game given its random and somewhat chaotic nature. Provinces can for example be worth quite a bit extra; and that amount is a surprise for all involved. It makes targetted wall placement rather pointless. And on top of that come the jabs of the action tiles which might or might not cause some problems. So Chang Cheng turns out to be a game which is too uncertain for the seasoned gamer, but it is bordering on the boundaries of accessibility for the less demanding gamer. Not an easy spot to position a game in. I'll probably play the game a few more times over the coming years, but only if asked.

Area majority. Theme is paste-on and doesn't give players the feelings of Mongols attacking. On the pro side, the game is very easy to learn, and the "card" thing feels like Pick Picknic or Key Largo. Could be a gateway game to "area majority" type of games, such as Tikal, Secret of Monte Cristo, Skyline 3000, etc. More plays might make the rating higher. 2 vs 2 team play might be worth looking at.

A smooth playing area majority game that's free of complexity but full of uncertainty because of the face down counters and cards. The components are great and the rules are solid. This is one of the few area majority games that is simple enough to explain in about 5 minutes. I like how the game grows as boards are added, and the final attack counters at the endgame are important because they influence your wall placement throughout. Overall, a good game with a good theme that's simple and strategic.

Absolutely simple area control game. The action cards keep it more interesting. Very nice pieces and artwork - really appreciated the Chinese theme, especially since we lived in China. Otherwise, nothing particularly gripping about the gameplay itself. Feels more like it should be a filler than an actual game. 

Gateway gaming friends have been more excited about other games, but it's a simple introduction to area control. (I'll admit, we don't pull this one out much, though)

Top notch production from Tenki Games, once again.  The wall pieces are fantastic and the artwork is very nice.

April 2008, ConVic 7 - first play.  Despite poor rules, I can see this could be quite a good game.  With 4 first-timers it still played really quick and I think it could be played in 30 mins.  Almost filler material and a game with some nifty mechanics (scoring for walls, then losing, possibly more points to Mongols!) makes the victory path obscure and intriguing, with plenty of room for subterfuge.
Giving this a 8/10 as I'd love to play it again.  Unfortunately overproduced for a 30 min 'filler' at AU$90 I'll likely never get it.

A pretty cool game with medium weight, a good amount of competition, player interaction, and strategy with a sprinkling of luck.

The theme sold me on this one; I mean what could NOT be cool about building the Great Wall? The look and feel of this game really stand out, with the shape of the board, cards and chits, along with the very appropriate artwork all conjuring images and feelings of ancient China.

Unlike other heavy theme games, the gameplay itself is woven quite tightly into the theme, thus providing a very enjoyable experience of a concrete time and place as the game wears on. It's an area control game, where the players are nobles trying to complete sections of the Great Wall with their wall pieces, or action cards. Some luck figures into the end of the game, but this can be mitigated with two unique wall pieces, thus making it a mostly strategic area capture game.

It's easy to learn, and would be excellent with three or four players. It plays all right with two players, and the 60 minute gameplay time make it a good choice for those with limited gaming time. Not quite a gateway game, but not a gamer's game, sitting somewhere in-between.

The gamer in me wants to know how this would play competitively among experienced players. I suspect it would work well as an online game or against AI.

Slightly screwed up the first game (it turns out that the 'optional' rules for 2 players actually means 'this is the rules for 2 players') by running out of pieces before the wall was complete but we improvised. It seemed interesting but probably better with more than 2.

Played again with 3 and it was more interesting. I think with 4 it would be even better.

RATING: 6.5
Could be an option if you're looking for a quite simple and not too long majority game.

Has no flaws (except the unnecessary memory aspect of the invaders tiles -actually solved by a variant proposed in the box) but it probably lacks the little "thrill".

Interesting placement game with some nice twists.  Deciding when and where to use your special cards can be tough.  The placement of walls can have an impact upon provinces and the inevitable Mongol invasions.  Good game.

Like the Chinese / Mongol theme.

The components (board & peices) are attractive.

The game is quick, the rules are easy but the game play has some depth.

The only downside is that some folks I have played with haven't really got to grips with the tactics (which can seem a bit abstract)

This is possibly as 'blind' as blind action games get. Majority will never be my favourite game mechanism and here you're aiming for majorities in the wall sections, but rewards, mongol threat and cards played are all unseen meaning that you don't really know the value of what you're trying to win.

First played May 15th, 2008. Taught in 5min, played in 30min with 4 players. Good luck/strategy ratio. The board starts out with three pieces. Each piece has a China side(plus VPs) and a Mongol side(minus VPs) worth VPs if you have the majority. Each player has one tower(doesn't allow wall adjacment wall placement until you place next to it and cancels the negative VPs for the Mongol territory it is placed in, one double wall(counts as two single walls and can't be destroyed), a stack of single walls, and 6 special cards with pix on them(1-6). Speical ties are: 1 destroy one wall segment, 2 count as one extra wall, 3 count as plus/minus 2(ower decides), 4 plus 2 or one extra will, 5 counts as two extra walls, 6 swap two wall segments. On your turn(first player can only place one wall segment), you can place the tower, a double wall, two single walls in two different China territories or one wall and a special card(hidden) in one territory. You must play a partical turn if you can. Once a China territory is filled it is scored immediatly and then a second action is taken if avaiable. The special tiles are revealed and executed during scoring. If two or more of the same tile are played they are all thrown out. 1 Pix is started first and move on up. If three territories are scores, another wall board segment is placed(different for # of players). Territories have a base VP value and a random chosen yet visible value. The player with the most wall segements gets the VPs. If there is a tie, each get the VPs. Also when you place a wall, you get to peek a hidden Mongol tiles. The Mongol tiles are scored at the end of the game. The player with the most walls in a Mongol territory gets the minus VPs. Ties each get the VPs. The player with the most VPs at the end of the game is the winner. Since this is a short game it could be more of a filler. I recommend giving this a try especially if you can borrow it.

After first 2 plays I was positively puzzled.  The third game changed everything: it was boring, without any excitement and with zero control from any player.  Rating going rapidly down...

Great components won't make up for mechanics..

Note: 2-player mode is the worst.  Besides, it seems it's mandatory to use 'optional' rule with 3rd fictional player's pieces.  Otherwise it's impossible to finish the game properly (too few pieces to fill all the spaces for wall)...

Put down wall pieces to get the majority in various regions. At the end there is additional scoring based on cards that are hidden until then. This seems like it can add some randomness to the final outcome, but maybe it is necessary to focus more on avoiding the majority on the Mongolian side.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Definitely a "so what" sort of game.  Essentially you're playing pieces into varying areas for creating majorities.  Each area can take only so many pieces.  Very straightforward.  The original element here is that each piece played is part of a majority both for scoring points and losing points.  The regions for each aren't quite aligned, so it is possible with judicious play to score the positive bonus and yet avoid the corresponding penalty.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pretty simple yet clever and original area majority game. There are two sides to the wall and you have to get the most sections built in each region on the Chinese side to score points, but you have to avoid building the most sections in the Mongol regions on the other side of the wall. It plays pretty fast, the only downside so far is that I can't win, and it costs too much but I grabbed it on sale ;)

A fun quick game especially for four.  I really like the wall pieces that try to keep the naughty Mongols at bay.  I also like the end of game scoring where all the Mongols attack and those that have the majority for each section are set back.  This is something I didn't take into account due to not understanding how it worked.  I'm looking forward to the next game.

An interesting Knizia-like game. This game was actually a lot lighter than I thought it would be. A game can be completed in 15 minutes easy. For its size and the number of components, it felt like a bit of a waste.

As it stands, its a nice filler with excellent bits and gameplay reminiscent of Web of Power or China. Players place pieces and try to achieve majority for the positive points while staying away from the negative points. A good non-gamer game, but probably too light for regular gamers.

I was always drawn to the linear nature of this game, with the wall and all and provinces along it that you geared up towards winning points in. So, I finally got it really ridiculously cheap and am not disappointed! It's a little dry, just placing things, and not really difficult decisions, with points that don't come slowly but in leaps and bounds. I like the variety of the 6! boards and artwork/pieces.

This game seems to play shorter than the 60 minute guideline.
Chang Cheng is visually appealling and has streamlined rules.  I didn't find any glaring problems with the game, but I also didn't find anything outstanding or special about the game. If you like area majority games, try it, but I think there are other area majority games that are more tense and fun.

RATING: 5
This game suffers from all of the provinces being too close in value to each other.  With the swings of the Mongols and the card play (which is pretty random since you are just guessing what others have played), all the provinces become roughly equal.  This makes where you place walls or cards pretty meaningless.

Where to play your double wall and your tower have been little to no-brainers for us and there were never any "Nice move!" moments.

Overall just a dull game.

Quick playing area majority game with a twist.  Play walls to take majority (with six special action cards that can be played once each and effect the game in different ways) and earn points.  Mongols attach walls but are divided along the wall in different boundaries.  Whoever has the most walls in those boundaries lose a number of points that gets shown at the end of the game.  

Ultimately, if I want area majority I want to play El Grande, not this game.  Sold off in the Lydia charity auction.

Interesting highly abstract two-edged game of area control wherein you seek majorities in certain areas and try to avoid them in others.  The nature of the placement mechanics though make it difficult to accomplish both at once.  Special circumstances allow for tricky plays through cards and special tokens.

The rules are fairly straightforward and there's a nice dynamic between trying to score province points in the beginning and losing points to the Mongol attack at the end.  Although most area majority games tend to fail with just two players, [GAMEID=29903] has two official variants for two players.  The version that's included in the game uses dummy third player wall pieces.  This was somewhat similar to [GAMEID=6249]---however, in [GAMEID=6249], the dummy player felt like it gave you more control.  In contrast, in the dummy player in [GAMEID=29903] made the game feel unnecessarily complicated with [i]less[/i] control (since many provinces only have four or five wall pieces to complete, using the dummy pieces made the game spin out of control).  

However, the designer posted another variant here:  [url]http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/220696[/url]  In this case, each player plays with two different colors.  The key is that instead of playing each color alternatingly, a player can play either color with the best total score winning the game.  This gave the player more control over the game (since you are still limited in how many pieces you can play per province) and introduces some intriguing "team play" strategy.  We definitely prefer this variant.

We enjoyed this game more than [GAMEID=18745] since it felt like you had much more control over the game (we disliked the bluffing mechanism in [GAMEID=18745]).  We also felt it worked for two players much better than [GAMEID=22198].  Still, she mentioned, "Why do all of these Chinese games all feel the same?  They all use the Great Wall and they all use area majority?"  I agree---I think there's definitely room for improvement in this area.

All in all, [GAMEID=29903] is a nice area majority filler.  It probably plays much better with more, but it's decent with two.  The wall pieces are pretty nice and the Great Wall at the end looks very attractive.

This game is actually deceptively strategic, yet it still has a light air about it. It plays in a very short amount of time, and looks cool while you play.

Update: After the lore of the chrome has worn off, it's easy to see that this is not all that great of a game. It's in the same boat of many rock paper scissors games, and while it is thankfully short, it doesn't feel all that satisfying; thus it is beginning to gather dust.

RATING: 4.5
Disegni e materiali sono molto belli. Le meccaniche invece non conquistano: ripetitive e statiche. Il gioco è abbastanza ingenioso e l'estrazione delle carte speciali dovrebbero dare un po' di longevità ad un gioco che al contrario, dopo un paio di partite, mi ha stancato e indotto a venderlo. Ingiocabile in due giocatori.

Only 1 play but it was fairly enjoyable.  While gaining a majority in a section of the Great Wall in a province is all well and good, be aware you must defend it from the Mongols and the negative points this will mean to you.

Nice family game, but seems as if the development cycle was cut short a tad.  Two-player rules marked as optional seem mandatory due to number of pieces.  Each player seems to have one extra wall block in the mix compared to rules.  Another example is the remnant China card.  Four player aids might also have been usefully included.  Math traded.

Based on one play: Place your walls in order to get the majority when each section scores (which occurs when the area is filled), but also, these wall segments mix with other segments which can cost you points at the end. You also get cards to alter the scoring and move pieces around and two special wall segments that either take up two segments or protect you from the attack and cannot be moved. Good mix of early scoring and end of game penalty.

Chang Cheng is an area majority game with a twist: each placement counts on two sides of the board, one positive and one negative. But that is not enough to raise this game above average for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I played Chang Cheng twice in Essen. Graphics is good even if the boards could have been better in my opinion. On the other end, the game is really good. The best thing is that the rules are simple, the turns pass very quickly and the game is always interesting. I particularly enjoyed the multiple scoring of the provinces and final scoring of negative points (Mongols): it creates a lot of suspance and until the very end you do not know who will be the winner (in our games the discance from a player to another in the scoring board was never more than 4 points). Great components. I think I will play it often.

RATING: 6
Unlike Knizia's Great Wall card game and Teuber's Settler's variant, my first play gave a good feeling of building the Great Wall. As we had a few "tongue depressors" left over and game end, I think we played sub optimally, so worth another go. I doubt it will raise in ratings for me for despite the variability of the boards placed, it doesn't change the static linear look of the wall (so as to keep the Mongols out) but instead just changes the numerical values, so it has no real visual replay value such as the variable set up in Settlers etc.

An area majority that plays in about 30 minutes - with some unknowns thrown in. Unfortunately the scoring is so close that the luck of turning over a -2 Mongol attack instead of a -4 Mongol attack can be the difference between winning and losing. Still, it's quick and kinda gets you thinking.

RATING: 5
A dull (but mercifully short) area majorities 'tile' placement game. Toss in the usually array of 'special action' cards and the chaos of unknown VP-affecting tiles and you get this overpriced beast. Players place wall pieces (tiles) and/or action cards each turn. Areas are scored when all spaces are occupied by wall pieces. Mongol tiles with -ve scores are flipped over and this is the mechanism which could be special but in reality is just a way to claw the leaders back.

The components are nice but it's very overproduced and I'd rather pay half the price for something in a smaller format. Also, the rules needs an overall edit for consistency.

Majority Scoring. Interesting light-middleweight game. Players compete for majorities in each region with only the leader scoring; at game end, however, the leader in each area loses points for the Mongol attacks. Good lunch game; look forward to more plays.

It's an OK area majority game.  The pieces are nice and there are some decisions to be made based on both what scoring areas you want to win combined with losing the majority in the Mongol areas.  Very clever system, and it is tight enough that you don't feel any lag; you constantly feel pressed.  But, that said, it doesn't feel particularly fresh in any way, and while the theme certainly works well conceptually, I just can't get past how purely abstract this feels.

this game looks great, plays in well under an hour, and has some depth to it.  Lots of variety in the boards, points, and penalty scoring so each game is different.  You only get to play each action card once, so it's tricky to know when is the best time to play them (which is a nice touch).  There a missing rule: "Every time a player puts A SINGLE WALL, a double wall or a tower he is entitled to look the Threat Counter on the territory in front of the pieces".  The game also includes a variant wherein players can attempt to achieve the requirements listed on two event tiles, thereby earning more reputation points.  Alternatives rules for the two players game: each player takes the complete sets of 2 colors and plays from either color on his turn according with standard rules (four boards). At the end of the game every player must to add his two scores.

Very good area control game.

Beautiful components 
Scales well from 2-4
Loads of replayability due to rearangement of boards and number of variants
Deep play in 45 minutes
Fun

I do understand that there is nothing revolutionary going on, but if you like area control I think it is worth having for all the reasons above.  I don't see a lot of difference between this and the more popular Mykerinos; which I also really like. 

The pricetag is probably the biggest drawback.  The low BGG rating scared me off until I got it fairly cheaply on Tanga, but I think it is worth the regular price. 

My rating may well go up with further plays. 

Update:  Yes my rating has gone up.  Everything I said above still goes for me.

Update:  Rating is the same. I originally compared this to Mykerinos and that is really not valid.  They are both pure area control, but Chang Cheng puts more limitations on choices and does have a bluffing element to it. Still, I stand by the fact that it is as good as Mykerinos and plays in the same amount of time.  It is not as heavy, however.  Which can be good or bad depending on your mood.

The components are why I play this more than Mykerinos.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3

More than 2500 years ago, the emperor of the Qin dynasty decided to protect his prolific provinces of northern China from the frequent barbaric invasions, building and joining several fortified fortresses. So he nominated his most faithful imperial officers to oversee the construction, promising riches and honours to the first who would have completed what now represents one of the most remarkable works produced by men: Chang Cheng™, the Great Chinese Wall.

Take on the role of one of the 4 officers of the emperor and try to increase your reputation to his eyes. Build parts of the Great Wall to defend the Chinese provinces and compete with the other players to gain the reputation that comes from protecting the most important ones. But beware of the threat of the Mongols that hangs near the border. . .

Chang Cheng is a good middleweight area control game - something that really isn't as prevalent in the market - which makes this a good choice for many collections. Replayability seems good with an ever-changing board, and the lack of luck will please many who want to enjoy tactical placement of walls. I'd want the game based on the components alone, but I'm glad that there is a good game behind them, making Chang Cheng the best product Tenki Games has produced thus far.

In addition, I like the fact that you do not get to place all your pieces in a single 4-player game.
It is a pity that the game is really only suitable for 3 or 4 players.

In this game of clever placement, players take turns adding pieces to the Great Wall. On one side of the wall lay the Chinese provinces, each with its own point value. On the other side are the provinces of the Mongol invaders, each with a randomly-assigned negative point value. Since provinces on either side do not directly correspond to each other, the goal is to place your pieces so that you can attain a majority on the Chinese side (for positive points) while avoiding having a majority on the Mongolian side (for negative points). Players also have a set of cards (tiles actually) which give them a few special privileges to help themselves or interfere with other players.

The game also comes with optional cards that may be used to provide other methods of scoring points.

A good Euro placement game that falls in the middle weight category.  Seems to play better with a full compliment of four players.  The box is way too big for what's in it but the wall pieces are nice and the bits are sturdy.

This game has the advantage that it is easy to teach to new comers while still having a little depth.

It looks really good, but there is definitely something missing from this one.  The decisions aren't really that interesting and overall, the game is just not that compelling.  There are much better area control games out there

It works... but some spice is missing. And the rules are anything but clear.

Played once (with 4 players). A decent majority game with a few twists - mainly the positive and negative scoring. It works rather well, but does not have anything really special. Also, the components are quite good.

Plays fairly quickly and is not especially complicated.  It is fairly fun though.  You try to allocate your resources to balance between scoring point on one hand and defend against point loss on the other.  It is an interesting tension.

A nice, quick game that actually does seem to take the amount of time stated on the box: shocking!

5.5 after 1 play.

Components are nice but rules are poorly written, with some rules hidden inside examples. The mongol attack part of end game scoring could be improved or redesigned. The placement of additional boards does not seem to matter, but the rules make it sound like it does. 

There is a niggling feeling that the development of this game is rushed; some parts could have been playtested more and redesigned.

Beautiful production, but I was not impressed with the gameplay.  Coupled with a badly written rule set, we were very underwhelmed by our 2-player experience.  The action cards seemed to be underutilized and in many cases ineffective.  May be better and more strategic with additional participants, but it'll probably take a lot of convincing for me to try this again.

The offset Mongol and Chinese borders provides some unusual considerations when placing your buildings.  Although the mechanisms are quite different, and the dynamics differ, the feel of this game most reminds me of [thing=22198]The Great Wall of China[/thing], in that the players are jockeying for dominance in segments.  The action tiles in the style of traditional Chinese cards are a very nice production touch.
If you play this 2p, use the neutral blocks, or only play two boards.  Otherwise the wall will not finish.

After 1 Play: This one is really light.  I didn't find anything to dislike, but I'm not anxious to try it again either.  The production values are great, but that's probably the only thing elevating it above mediocrity.

The board seemed a little small and it seemed like there was a fair amount left to chance (mongol hordes at the end).  But I enjoyed nonetheless, and we didn't follow rules exactly so it may be better next time.  

Played again, still enjoyed.  Not super "fun", but interesting mechanics.  Relatively fast, which I appreciate.

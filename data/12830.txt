The game was interesting, but took us a bit to long to make it worthwhile. I would rather be playing Reiner Knizi'a Money! if possible. I do appreciate the incremental bidding instead of a blind bid... maybe I should make a variant for Money! that is inspired by this game.

RATING: 4
{1 play • 5 players} I wanted to like it, as I like the "bid trade" mechanic (also seen in Money), and I like the pyramid building, and I like the bonus point for a mix triplet, as it gives the "smaller" cards some extra value... but - and maybe this is less of a problem when played with fewer players - the cascading "force" swap (as opposed to letting the players choose) was no fun at all.  Because you only have a hand of, at most, 6 cards, it was often hard to set up the "trade" you wanted - even if you were really trying and willing to sacrifice a card or two.  The alternative was to drop early, but more often than not, that yielded unpredictable results.  The player who should have won bypassed this and just drew a card from the deck each time, a seemingly winning strategy, though most of us were new to the game, so perhaps more experience would help.   Oh, the reason he didn't win, by the way, was that another player "brilliantly" froze out a third player with his bid, then didn't see it... and added another card to his bid, as he wanted a different set for himself.  He ended up scoring the exact same for his new set, but his "old" set was worth almost 20 points to the now unfrozen player, thus handing him the game.  This is another problem for me, as I tend to dislike games that require all playes to really pay attention... but there's definitely a game here, and I'd like to try it again - especially with fewer players - just to see if my experience was atypical... but I'm not hopeful

[initial rating: 5] And indeed, after a 3-player game, my opinion of this drops.  The bidding is just too lopsided, especially with fewer players... and we missed a rule the first time: apparently if you finish your full wine "pyramid" you are allowed to just start a second one.  This really hurst the 3-player game, as it's not that hard for one player to get the middle 4-card set a few times, which would be okay if "building management" was an issue, but since all bottles score regardless, getting more than the others make the bonuses moot.  Boo Hiss.

RATING: 7
On the surface, its a simple set collection card game.  But that description is a bit misleading.  At the heart is a slick auctioning game with a tactical  layout element.  Its not just a matter of collecting the right cards, but also of displaying them to maximum effect.  This latter element raises the game play and creates a unique tension in the auctions.

RATING: 7
I wasn't really expecting much here... but this is a deceptively simple yet intriguing auction game. In the auction, players are bidding with wine-cards and the winner takes the wine-bottles in the center and replaces them with his bid. That bid is then taken by the player in 2nd, who places his wine-cards in the center... etc. Thus, you don't necessarily want to "win" the auction... often you want to come in 2nd or 3rd to get the right cards. But on top of that, the wine-cards can be placed in your cellar to score (set-collection), which creates an interesting hand management puzzle (Do you hold onto them for bidding or do you score with them).

For people who enjoy auction games... there is a lot to like about this design.

Positives: Unique bidding mechanic, good artwork and fun wine bottle components. 

Negatives: Tricky scoring system, if you get behind in number of cards, its hard to catch up. Felt longer than it should be, but it was our first play. My sense is that your enjoyment of this game will depend largely on the group you play with. 

You frequently need to calculate the totals of cards (up to 50  points)played by each player, so younger players are not going to enjoy this. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A light and decent game marred by tricky scoring.  Finding all the "triplet scores" is actually more challenging than the game itself.  

I did enjoy the auction mechanism (jockeying in the auction to win another players hand rather than the main lot), but the scoring mechanism really overshadows its novelty, which really bums me out about a rather enjoyable game.  I would rate it a '7' or an '8' if there was a way to simplify scoring.

This game is a simple bidding and set collection game that has enough strategy to make it interesting but is easy enough to learn that it can be used as a (longish) filler.  The game isn't only about winning a given lot of goods--it's also about bidding to *not* win, because the second-highest bidder recieves the auction winner's bid, the third-highest receives the second-highest bid, and so forth.

RATING: 5
A simple bidding game with some elements of Santiago clearly recognisable. Players bid on a set of open randomly drawn cards with which two kinds of toplogical sets can be formed; the player who bid the highest amount gets the open cards, the player with the next highest bid wins the cards bid by the highest bidder, and so forth. The game qualifies as a filler and appears to be lacking major strategic avenues to explore. This is, in my opinion, both a good and a bad thing—but perhaps I shouldn't be too harsh on the little game and just put out Santiago instead if I want something more encompassing. It is, after all, just a simple card game.

Players do not have hands of equal bidding power, and what is in their hands is not always 'suitable' for what is on offer. A hand full of valuable cards is a clear disadvantage when cheap wine cards are laid open; yet someone who has cards to match will not gain much by acquiring them. The question then becomes whether or not to go for second or third best. This can create nice bidding contention from time to time, although I suspect for it to work properly you need to have the full compliment of players. With 3, it's a tad boring. All in all I liked the game better than I thought I would, and as a starter or closer of a session it isn't all bad.

Deceptively deep bidding game with a dose of hand management. I like the triple use of cards for bid money points and set collecting. Laying out the cards in a pyramid seems a bit "tacked on", but is a nice puzzle. I didn't feel I had a lot of control in the bidding though since once you pass, you're out. I guess that's the power of the smaller cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Players are dealing in bottles of wine, each with a dollar value and a collection value.  Players use the dollar value to bid on an "auction lot" of wine, and use the point value to score for it when a bottle enters the cellar pyramid.  Points are also scored for grouping similar coloured/types of wine together.  The auction mechanic where players take the next player's cards has been seen before (Knizia's Money springs instantly to mind), but the scoring of the cellar is interesting and does require some thinking.  Raising the bid is not mandatory during the auction, which does tend to bog things down as players consider their increased options.  Nice light-deep game, if that makes sense!

Incredibly easy to learn (4, tiny pages of rules) and great to play with a group of non-gamers. Comes in a tiny box with a deck of half sized cards and a few tokens, this is my ultimate go to game when camping or traveling. It's also a great game to play with older people who are used to more traditional card games, which makes this perfect for family gatherings.

Set collection with a minor spatial element (placing cards into a pyramid structure).  The auction mechanism is a bit more trouble than it is worth, and gets a bit stale pretty quickly....  and that's pretty much the whole game.

Looked like it would be a nice quick game - but to play to win you had to make calculations - complicated calculations because you need to remember what everyone hand and figure out all the variable... and that took time - so a nice quick game lasted 90 minutes. Sigh...

A nice little clever game. Maybe a bit too long to be a filler, but certainly fun enough that we've pulled it out a few times. The scoring system intimidates a few people but everyone gets the basic idea of having identical bottles on lines or triangles pretty quickly.
The whole auction thing is the best part imo: Trying to remember what cards the other players are holding and figuring out how much to push each bet in order to optimize your own outcome is quite clever.

RATING: 5
Die Weinhändler is a set collection bidding game in which players try to stack the most valuable wines in their cellars.

Players bid for a tableau of wine bottles on the table using bottles of wine from their hand. The highest bidder gets the bottles from the table, second highest gets the winning bid, and so on. Players then place bottles in their cellars for points.

Whether you'll want to go for first, second, or even last in the auction is mostly decided by what kind of wine or bottle you're after. To some extent it is also dictated by the cards in your hand because sometimes you just don't have the values you would need to slip in between two other players. Unfortunately, the auction results can also feel a bit arbitrary because once you pass you can no longer add to your bid, but if you don't pass you have to even if you would rather not. This severely restricts your ability to somewhat reliably work towards a certain outcome.

This felt a bit like Money (the Knizia card game) due to the mechanic of using the items you collect to bid for more items.  But rather than blind-bidding, the auction is a more typical go-around-until-everyone-passes style.  I love Money, so it's no surprise that this one also felt like a winner.

RATING: 7
Very reminiscent of Knizia's Money and nearly as good, although slower.  Bids are played in turn rather than blindly, and can be increased the next time around the table.  There is no choice about what cards to take; you take the bid immediately higher than yours, and the winner takes the cards in the center of the table.  Interesting dilemmas of timing and psychology arise naturally from the bidding system, which sometimes feels more like betting than bidding.  I'm a bit worried that a strong initial hand might be too hard to stop.  Perhaps the game would benefit from some way to improve the balance of power in the opening deal?

Seemed quite similar to Money in many ways, but a little bit more exciting thanks to the interesting scoring method and way that auctions are handled.  It's another game where the cards that score you points are also your currency, so you have to balance between keeping and spending to get more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very interesting game. You're building your own wine cellar but in order to do so, you have to trade with your bottles of wine to get better ones that suit you. That means, that you need to use cards for bidding that you might want to use as the ones to put into your cellar. So which ones do you use to bid?? And which ones do you leave for yourself?? 

What's more interesting, you don't always have to be the highest bidder. The highest bidder gets the bottles on the offer on the table. But second highest, gets the bottles offer of the highest bidder! And third highest gets bottles of the second bidder, and so on, with the lowest bid going to the table. Now this puts a whole new paint job on things, as you can UNDER-bid, instead of just trying to OVER-bid everyone. It all depends on which bottles you are interested in getting. Quite the conundrum, as the bids of other players will most likely have less bottles to offer than the table. But they may be the exact bottles that you want. Can you win them? Do you need to over bid or under bid? Will you lose the bottles you wanted to keep in the mean time? How will you structure your cellar, considering that building triplets of bottles of the same kind will earn you additional points!

Like I said, very interesting game with a twist on bidding and careful management of bottles in your hand as well as your cellar. Can you be a great Weinhandler?? Find out for yourself, it's a game to try.

First played April 1st, 2009. Taught in 10 min(if you know how to play) and played in 45 minutes with 4 players. This game seems to have more luck than strategy however it has it's unique blend as most games have. The deck as 4 color cards with 9 cards of each. Each has three cards of three different numbers. Finally there are 5 empty bottle cards. Everyone is dealt 5 cards as a starting hand and there is an auction set of four cards to bid on. The starting player bids one card to take the auction set of cards (calls out the value of their bid) and then everyone follows bidding one card or passes. Bid can't tie anyone, however can be lower. An empty bottle is worth .2. Once you pass you are out. If you pass on your first turn without bidding a card, you take two cards from the draw deck, return the highest card to the bottom of the draw deck and take the lower number card into your hand. The highest bid takes the set of 4 cards and then the 2nd place takes the winning bidders cards. 3rd takes the 2nd, 4th takes the 3rd and then the 4th places their cards as the start of the new set of cards. Starting with the player with the winning bid, he may place cards into his cellar (doesn't have to unless you have more than 6 cards). These cards are placed in a pyramid order and can have no more than 5 cards in the base (4 on the next row, etc). You gets points for each star on the card (1-3) and then can get a bonus point if three cards in a triange or in a row are together. If they are of the same color, you get one bonus point, if they are the same, you get 4 bonus points. You can fill up your cellar and start a new one as well. cards can't be played in the pyramid where you have a top most card that doesn't have two underneath it. After everyone places in their cellar the bid winner bids first on the next set (after it is replenished two 4 cards). The game ends when the draw deck can't be replinished and you finish the round. Winner has the most points.

RATING: 5
[1 playing] A trading system like "Money" but much more fiddly.  Instead of having players just choose the set they want to take, there is a structured bid of card points, which forces players into adding up card values that run to 25, and calculate all the totals around the table.  The result is a headachy game in what should be a light and breezy system.

The actual scoring, mostly just based on collecting stars, but also involving bonuses for placing sets in a pyramid, was not inspiring.

a lot of people liken this to Knizia's Money.

One said it was like Oasis.

The length of the game may likely have it overstay its welcome. One reviewer said: "I have several issues with this game. The bidding is needlessly slow and complex, requiring constant adding and re-adding of double digit numbers, making it a tedious math exercise just to finish each bidding round. The exchange process is fairly difficult to predict, and seems far more random than the system in “Money”. Die Weinhandler feels soulless, mechanical and overly constrained in the way it plays. The overly long play time (1-3 hours), fiddly scoring, kingmaker situations and low bonus points didn’t help matters. Die Weinhandler feels like a mishmash of concepts ripped from games like Money, Oh Pharaoh and Katzenjammer Blues, and unfortunately it is much inferior to those titles. If you want a good pyramid game with similar concepts, go pick up a copy of Oh Pharaoh instead of this one. Given all of its problems and lack of fun, I cannot recommend this game. "

Okay game for filler, I guess.  Kind of like Money, but I wish I could select a lower bid from a player when I have a higher bid...  That would lend itself to more interesting, an strategic, decision making.

I've only played this once & I have real mixed feelings.  First of all I love the two basic mechanisms: how the bidding works in that players bid wine cards until everyone has passed; highest bidder takes the tableaux, second highest bidder gets what the highest bidder auctioned, etc., wine cards from lowest bid go into the tableaux where more cards will be added until the tableaux is replenished to 3-cards.  Secondly wine cards are played into each players cellar.  The cellar is in the form of a pyramid and points are rewarded for combos (3 of same type together, etc).  The problem is that the game seemed much longer than necessary (90 minute game?) which made it feel like an endless recycling of wines.  Maybe it was our strategies, I personally may have been holding out too long for particular vintages.  There's also the possible problem that the rich continually get richer, I suppose they should be scoring their good cards eventually, but this didn't happen enough in my game.  Quirky, clever mechanics do not make a fun game so the verdict is still out on this one.

It takes a while to wrap one's head around, for sure, but I think there might be a pretty good bidding game hidden in here. Continuous aggregate scoring is a good time-saver, and the geometric and grouping aspects add a new dimension without being mind-blowing for those who hate that sort of thing. I'm not convinced of the validity of the bottles' values when compared with the gain/loss ratio in bidding with more than one bottle - in other words, there's nothing to be gained by adding bottles to one's bid over the long run, and this might be a fundamental flaw. Happy to be proved wrong, though.

This didn't appeal. Lots of calculating for each set of tiles who would advantage most, slowing the game down, and it's a lottery when you pull out on whether it's a good withdrawal or to minimal advantage. So I haven't spent any more time exploring this one.

Simple, yet the mechanic of winning the next largest bid makes the auction very interesting since you don't always just bid for the center auction. Although mainly aiming for your own benefit, you can screw others over (often by accident). Fun and not too long. A nice filler (although maybe a little long  to be called a filer) that has a fair amount of thought involved.

Neat set collection game with a little timing component. The auction part makes it also pretty interesting due to the mechanic of you bidding with the same cards you use to score. A critical point is not to score too early. Being without a good hand for bidding can shut you out of the game.

Clever kinda, but sucky.  Reminds me of Knizia's Katzenjammer Blues.

RATING: 5
First dummy play of 3 players in which hand cards are tabled to bid for a placing in taking face up cards as in Knizia's Money i.e a pool of centre cards are taken by the highest bidder, the second highest exchanges his bid for the cards used by the another bidder etc. Now if I remember correctly the difference in the bidding in Money vs Weinhandler is that in the former the bidding was simultaeous and the bidders had a choice of which pool to take whereas in Weinhandler this is resolved around the table and the pools of cards taken in order. Already I can see why Knizia chose this design path as the proceedings in Weinhandler can bog down in the bidding as you try to work out what the bids are worth to others. Anyway, once purchased players can place their hand cards face up into their cellar much like the buckets in Bucket King in reverse. Now the interesting problems in building is that you score bonus points for clusters or lines of the same wine value or the 3 different; so this causes a spatial puzzle. I think this is the only standout aspect in the design, as the other issue I have is the unequal wear and tear as some (non-random)cards are taken out depending on the number of players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Die Weinhändler has some similarities with Reiner Knizia's Money, but it's not as good. The simultaneous bids for order of choosing lots in Money works much better than the sequential bids here. And the scoring seems to reward specialising entirely in one colour, which is a bit dull. Traded 6/10 (for Money, funnily enough)

RATING: 8
Wow, much better than I expected!

The charm of this game is that you are not only bidding for cards in the middle of the table, but also the cards other players are using to bid.

So it's more entertaining than your typical only-auctions game in which you have to decide whether to try to win the auction or pass. Here, it's worthwhile to bid on almost every auction since you're bound to get something.

What makes this nasty is that you are bidding with cars with fixed values, not money, so trying to bid just under another opponent to take his cards is quite tough.

A much improved form of the game Money. There's plenty to think about in this little card game. There's a memory element, a bluff element, a blocking element and a few potential strategies to adopt. It runs a little long for what it is, and the scoring can get very fiddly - especially at the end - but there's some painful decisions to be made along the way and some fun too. Engrossing. (Due to the scoring confusion at the end of the last round I'd like to try a game limiting each player to one special scoring per round. I think this would push players even further to collecting the four bonus point sets.)

Played for the first time last night and suffered from that 'first auction game not knowing the correct value to bid'. I won quite easily as I was bidding to win 2nd or 3 rd place but everyone was going cheap so I won at least 3 rounds i shouldn't have and ended up being forced to play bottles on a few occasions. Whilst this could be bad as I didn't make many sets and didn't get many bonus points, the shear volume made me a clear winner. It'll play much better next time and then we'll see if my strategy works.

Ugh.  I really wanted to like this game, as Santiago was remains one of my favorite games, but I just couldn't bring myself to enjoy it.  

I have to say that while I think that there is the foundation for a good game here, there is no fun built into it.  Most of the game is mechanical number crunching.  The bonuses on the set collecting are so nominal that they just didn't seem worth tying up your hand.  

Most of the time the choices seemed obvious, dumping cards you don't need in hopes that after you pass you retain the position you need, or that you have the right card combinations to sneak into the slot you want to get into.  

Most of the game play is waiting to get the right cards, or randomly stacking minor combination or high point cards to eek out some points.  In the meantime, you just look to incrementaly improve your hand.  

Overall, whatever planning you might do ended up feeling totally arbitrary.  It seemed that the people that were at the top of the pack stayed at the top of the pack.  Someone mentioned trickle down economics while we played, but I guess it proves that the rich remain rich in this system.  

This game just drags.  Slow and ponderous.  Counting and recounting.  We used playing cards to show each other's places; without them the game was taking even longer. I'm not sure how this game was said to be played in 45 min.  Really with 5 players it would play in about 3 hours.  This should be a 20 min card game at best. Perhaps with less than five players it chugs along faster and has more control.  I'm not sure I'll get the chance to find out.

A pretty sophisticated and solid game of Gin Rummy.  Or if you prefer set collection.  Either way it offers enough to this about for a game of it's length (60 minutes).  I enjoyed the game and can see this as a filler or nightcap type game for my group. I see Morgan's comment about 3 hour game play,  but my notoriously SLOW group played 4 games in about 5 hours.  (that included learning)  Rating a five because it's a filler ype game and is basically gin rummy.  UPDATED Raised this to a seven,  after several more plays, there is a lot too this game,  the auctions are interesting,  and the game is pretty fun.  Just the right amount of thinking for agame of this length.  Calling it Rummy was a pretty harsh statement,  it is a good game.

Updated after total of five games (I still have four victories, just to mention), but the game is not that good. If there is thinker-heavy players, the game is slow and boring and the content of the game is just not good enough for a game over an hour.

The game is reminiscent of Money, since you bid for cards using cards in your hand, but it lacks a certain amount of control in that you don't get to choose what you can pick, but have to modify your bid to get what you want.  I like the tension of picking what you want, and the added bonuses of getting sets of cards in a certain arrangement add a little something extra to the game.  I'm interested in playing again.

Played twice (with 3 and 4 players). Although the game has some nice ideas and a few clever mechanisms (such as the value of late offers increasing because of the way high cards have been put back below the draw pile), I found it was too long for what it is. Too much time seems to be spent checking the values of bids and who would get what and what consequences it would have. Also, the pyramid building did not seem to add much to the game - maybe because we tended to specialize in one or two colors during our games.

Weird bidding game that I just can't seem to get a handle on. You bid on bottles of wine, but each turn when you add to the bid, you can add anything: you don't have to beat the highest bid. So you are not bidding on the bottles up for offer, but also on other players' bids.

這是一個以搜集洋酒為主題的卡牌遊戲。玩家的目標是建立起最有價值、最整齊的名酒收藏。所有搜集的洋酒必須整齊擺放到酒窖中，方會突顯其價值。

遊戲中共有7種不同顏色的酒。每種酒皆有9 張卡牌，3張窄身瓶(印有1顆星)、3張中瓶(印有2顆星)及3張大瓶(印有3顆星)。卡牌上星的數目代表該卡牌的分數。在卡牌角落上所印的數字為該卡牌的價值，該數字在競價過程中極為重要。 
空瓶子是沒有分數並只有0.2的價值。其作用是讓玩家在其酒窖中可預留空間，其他洋酒牌可於稍後蓋在空瓶子上。

遊戲進行期間，玩家在競價中取得卡牌後，必須將卡牌排列成金字塔狀。這個稱作酒窖的卡牌列陣，最低層最多可有5張卡牌，每層遞減1張卡牌。一整個酒窖可排列共15張卡牌。卡牌必須先從底層接連排列。如同當真疊酒瓶一般，接連排列2張卡牌的上方可放置另一卡牌，即作「品」字形排列。已排列的卡牌即不可再更改其位置，洋酒牌不可互相覆蓋，但卻可蓋在空瓶子上。 
若玩家的酒窖中已被15張卡牌佔滿，而當中並無空瓶子，玩家可再排列另一酒窖。

遊戲開局時，依玩家人數可能需摒棄部份卡牌。3人遊戲需摒棄紫、黃色的洋酒牌。4人遊戲需摒棄橙色的洋酒牌。連同3張空瓶子，將所有卡牌覆轉洗混。每位玩家獲發5張卡牌作手牌，餘下的卡牌即為牌疊。從牌疊頂翻開4張卡牌放到桌面中央後，由一名玩家開始遊戲。

遊戲以回合進行。每回合中玩家依次執行以下4個步驟。

競價： 
由起始玩家開始，玩家依順時針方向輪流出牌或棄權。當所有玩家皆放棄出牌而棄權後，這步驟方會結束。玩家可從其手牌中一口氣打出1張或以上的卡牌，以牌面向上地放到自己的面前，並點算其打出卡牌的價值總和。玩家打出卡牌的價值總和，不可和他人相同，但可以較他人多，亦可較他人少。尚未棄權的玩家，可繼續輪流出牌，以增加其打出卡牌的價值。玩家不可收回已打出的卡牌。卡牌的價值與其種類無關，玩家可打出不同種類的卡牌。 
棄權的玩家則不可再打出卡牌。若玩家並無打出卡牌然後即選棄權，將不會參予下一步驟，只可從牌疊抽取2張卡牌，並從中保留價值較小的一張卡牌，較大的一張卡牌則覆轉放回牌疊下方。若抽取2張卡牌的價值相等，則由玩家自行挑選其一。

交收： 
打出卡牌的價值總和最高者，拿取桌面中央翻開的所有卡牌。打出卡牌的價值總和次高者，則拿取價值總和最高者打出的卡牌。打出卡牌的價值總和第三高者，則拿取價值總和次高者打出的卡牌。如此類推。玩家將取得的卡牌加到自己的手牌之中。價值總和最小的卡牌，則放到桌面中央。

收藏： 
由打出卡牌價值總和最高者開始，玩家依順時針方向輪流決定是否擺放卡牌到其酒窖中。若玩家手牌數目多於6張卡牌，玩家即必須從手牌中擺放卡牌到其酒窖中。玩家可自行決定卡牌的數目和擺放次序。一旦玩家的手牌數目下降至6張或以下，玩家即可決定不再擺放卡牌。玩家決定不再擺放卡牌後，即輪至下一玩家。 
玩家每擺放1張卡牌到其酒窖時，即可能取得分數。玩家擺放空瓶子並不會取得分數。依玩家擺放到其酒窖的卡牌牌面，玩家可取得1到3分(星的數目)。 
玩家除了可取得卡牌的分數外，若剛擺放的卡牌能與其他卡牌構成同色的三角形(3張牌拼成「品」字形)或直線(連續斜上或橫放的3張牌)，即得到獎分。若這3張牌是相同的卡牌，玩家多獲4分。若這3張只是同色的卡牌，玩家多獲1分。 
玩家擺放1張卡牌時，是可能同時構成多於1個同色的三角形或直線(特别是以洋酒牌蓋在空瓶子上時)，玩家即可如數取得更多獎分。 
玩家的得分以分數標記代表。玩家持有的分數標記，可在遊戲中以較小面額的分數標記進行找換。

檢視放到桌面中央的卡牌(即競價中價值總和最小者)，若卡牌數目少於4張，則從牌疊翻開足夠的卡牌以補充至4張。若牌疊中卡牌不足，則桌面中央的卡牌數目將少於4張。競價中打出卡牌的價值總和最大者，成為下回合的起始玩家，並開始下一個回合。

遊戲將持續至牌疊耗盡。當需要翻開卡牌以補充桌面中央的卡牌，若牌疊耗盡，則完成下一回合後遊戲便即完結。在這最後的回合中，玩家可在收藏步驟中，將手牌全數放到酒窖中以換取分數。遊戲結束時，取得最多分數者勝出遊戲。

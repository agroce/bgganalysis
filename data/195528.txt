It'a fine enough game, but it lasts too long for what it is. No siesta rather faithfully re-implements La Granja; however, I'd rather put aside a little more time to play the big boy.

Fun dice drafting game where the games are always very close. The theme is nice, but this is a very light game and your farm is always fully stocked by the end. 

I haven't played La Granja, so I don't know how well it boils it down. 

It also has a decent solo variant.

La Granja: No Siesta was my game of choice for a roll and write to add to my collection.  I enjoy it, although some of the iconography on the "write" sheets is a little too subtle for many newcomers to the game.  It seems to be difficult for many people to determine which areas must be filled in left to right vs. which areas can be filled in randomly.

Game designers:  Please design your icons to be friendly to aging eyes!  Even after blowing up the "write" sheets and laminating them, several folks in my group refuse to play this game because the iconography is too small/hard to interpret.

RATING: 7
La Granja: No Siesta is a standalone dice game with a similar theme of La Granja the board game.  In this game you will use dice and select resources, then mark off your player sheet and accumulate victory points. Helpers and roof tiles add extra bonuses throughout the game to help build up and even causes chain reactions of point build up.

Played and bought at Essen 2016.

I had to chance to have the game explained by the author. Rules are simple but this game is really strategic. Had a long chat with him that it is possible to play a whole round without re-rolling the dice which can make it much more tactical.  This was also great because you can change the whole game by a simple house rule, depending on what you prefer more. But even in its original form one must optimize his selections to achieve victory. The best part of the game is that all of the different ways of scoring points are perfectly balanced so there is no 'one best path' to victory. Anyone has equal chances of winning if they optimize their dice selection. Due to this, this game has for its type achieved all that it can. Easy to understand, difficult to master, can be played by both people looking for some quick fun and tactic lovers alike. Also for 15 euro it is really a bargain. I give it a 9/10 and would never refuse someone asking me to play with them.

For me, this game fulfills two main functions in my collection: 1) It's my preeminent roll-and-write game; and 2) It's also my preeminent solo game. A big shout-out to the designer who clearly put a lot of care and thought into developing a perfect and very replayable solo challenge. As a small-box game, this is also one I look forward to taking away with me when travelling. I never get tired of farming games, and this one is a unique member of that illustrious family.

RATING: 7
It's neat that it has a small box and it's easy to carry with you. Also, it resembles a slightly lighter version of Castles of Burgundy. Unfortunately, it gets a little repetitive near the end of the game and that makes it look like it overstays its welcome. Solo game is a bit tighter, but I still get an "accountant" vibe from the game.

A pretty typical dice game implementation, where you use dice to tick off boxes in various scoring areas, trying to score the most points. The one unique aspect here is that the dice are drafted, with the current player getting the first choice of dice, rather than the "roll three times" system is seems most dice games use.

There are also some upgrades that can be unlocked to specialize yourself at certain things, which helps drive your strategy.

Overall, it was alright, but I didn't feel it did anything very special either, which is how I end up feeling about pretty much every dice/card game implementation of a popular board game.

Secret Santa 2016

I am actually surprised at how good this is.  There's a lot of interesting choices to be made in the early rounds - start on the market barrows, work on helpers for special powers, or go barn roofs for bonuses?  Then you have to think about what scoring bonus you want from the market board.  It's a fun, strategic race against the other players.

The main potential problem that I see is that you're going to eventually fill in everything, so it's not clear if the interesting choices mention above actually matter.  There's a bit of a race to see who gets there first, but I'm afraid that may be it.  I'm worried that it may be like Scythe - which I didn't like - because it was interesting at the beginning, but then you end up doing the rest of the things just for the sake of doing them.

This is exacerbated by the potential for very few hats to be rolled, which makes the game drag on once everyone has finished their main goals.  Then you end up just throwing donkeys in the trash because there's no where for them to go.

Finally (!) it seems that certain faces are just better than others: Hats are the best, then coins, then pigs/donkeys, then grapes and the rest of the harvest goods.  Sure, sometimes you need specifics, but especially near the end you never want to pass up a hat.

Ok one more thing: it's a little weird that it is called "No Siesta!" while Siesta-ing is a key part of the game.  Don't you tell me not to Siesta!

Usually in these dice allocation games, choosing one path means not being able to pay much attention to the other paths. Here, though, at least with two players, you'll be able to complete or nearly complete multiple areas, so there's not a lot of tension in the choices you make with the dice.

First play comment:Roll dice, tick off the icons on your sheet and try and collect the listed sets of icons. Thatâs the game in a nutshell. The icons link to the original game, that is about the only real link back. What makes it more interesting is that you get helpers and rooftiles along the way which give you various benefits and help you in your tasks. 

The decisions along the way are really down to which set of icons you go for, and that decision is directed by which helper you manage to get hold of.

The downside is that the end game points are all rather similar as everyone has time to collect most of the sets so there didnât seem to be a lot of strategy involved.


UPDATE: Hmmm.  Not sure about this one. The end game is tough to rush and so everyone does almost everything in every game and the differences at the end are minimal. Each game ends up as the last game even though the decisions throughout have been different. So you feel you are making interesting decisions through the game but they end up having been rather meaningless.

Farming Qwixx :) A dice drafting game based on the farming multi-use card game [thing=146886][/thing] where you use dice to gather resources and fill in your results from left to right in most areas (unless you have a helper that lets you do otherwise). My first surprise was how heavy this little box is. It is chock full of content from the thick double sided sets of scoresheets to even the tiniest detail of pencils included. Both the box and contents are of great quality. The game was easy to learn and play and it's fun to see how your scores compare after going up different tracks and pursuing different strategies. Multiple strategies have led to wins in this game so far, and it has an addictive replayable quality. We have played both with a personal pool of helpers and drafting from a common pool, and they both give a different feel as your priorities change from concentrating on your own little area and trying to get items to market early with less priority on helpers, versus shooting for helpers straight off the bat as if you wait too long the most desirable ones will be snapped up. We have yet to play the 'Original La Granja' that has you using the same dice as the initial roll instead of re-rolling after every draft, but we're saving that for a future time to see what extra layer of strategy that adds to the game.

Having never played La Granja I can't say if this feels anything like it, nor can I tell if anything feels like it's missing when you compare the two games. What I [i]can[/i] say is that this game stands on its own as a fun, fast dice game that still has meaty decisions to be made. I would love to see expansion content for this game that mostly would consist of an additional set of scoresheets where you can use your raw resources to upgrade your goods for more points. This would definitely expand the decision space of the game and make your choices even tougher. A few more interesting helpers would be a nice bonus also. An excellent purchase!

One of the best "roll and mark off" games there is.

Enough bits and aesthetically pleasing enough to give the feel of a fuller game.  The competitive helpers and the solo mode are bonuses in the box.


Variant:

Hats count for two unless you received one the previous turn. 
(Thematically, if you didn't have an afternoon nap yesterday, take a double long one today.)

This keeps the game from dragging and the play time quicker.  You can do longer strategies but the game should end before your board fills and you do all you want to.

RATING: 7
Played twice so far. Scores ranged in the 50s for the winner, 30s for the weakest player. I say that because both games took a little long and we had the feeling that everybody could cover the majority of their sheets. So while this feels may be true, the scores tell a different story. It does matter how well you follow your strategy and for some tracks there is the interactive "race to the finish line" aspect. Overall I wish player interaction would be higher, though.

My favorite part may be the boxes (wildcards) and the deliveries where the central market with end scoring bonuses and the finish-first-score-most comes into play.

I wonder how fast you can make the game by always choosing the sombreros. Combined with the additional action markers you get and the following urgency for the players to stop me from running away I could see how this tactic could "snowball" itself onto a quicker game.

About the dice re-rolling, which is different from La Granja in that you re-roll all the remaining dice once the players have chosen their first die. I find this less strategic, but according to the designer this was done to make the game quicker esp. with 4 players where non-re-rolling may lead to hate-drafting, i.e. trying to take things away from people and thus the necessity to check all of the other sheets over and over again. He recommends the "traditional" La Granja draft for a 2-player game for a fun and tense duel situation.

[b]Update after 2 solo plays[/b]:
The solo game is really neat. Now it takes almost as long as La Granja solo, but "controlling" the dummy player and the dice choice feels more strategic than in a multiplayer game. Looking even more forward now to a 2-player game with the no-reroll variant rule.

All the dice are rolled by the active player; then dice are drafted once around the table. The remaining dice are re-rolled and are drafted a second time. Whichever die is leftover is available to all players.

You use the resources to mark off spaces on your player sheet or advance your marker on the hat track which is points/end game timer/unlocks additional markers. You can lose markers when you send off a donkey cart, as you may select some type of end-game point bonus (because it is marked with one of your markers).

Player interaction is mostly dice drafting and completing donkey carts (whoever completes a cart type first will receive a few bonus points). I think 45 is a bit long for what it is, but I'd imagine it would play faster on subsequent plays.

Roll and write game with the familiar feeling of La Granja. This game always follows this pattern: everyone starts out with different strategies, if the game ended in a reasonable amount of time then we'll see diversity in scoring areas. But if the game gets protracted due to the lack of siesta rolls than everyone will start to look the same in the end since almost every spot is ticked off. Feels like it wasn't really tested well in this aspect. I enjoyed it in my first few plays but due to the forementioned problem I've downgraded No Siesta's ratings.

Easy dice-drafting recipe filling game. Maybe a little longer than it should be, but the timer on the game is somewhat in control of the players. I have heard some criticisms on the availability of "hats" which act as the timer, but that might have been just poor player choices and some mitigation is already built in (crates for hats). Though, apparently some players can put themselves into a bigger grind than it needs to be, so that is a strike to the design.

RATING: 8
This is an excellent little dice game. It bears very little resemblance to its namesake [thing=146886][/thing]. The dice drafting is there, and they both have thematic overlap, but that's about it. If you don't care for La Granja don't let that dissuade you from trying No Siesta!.

I played a 2p game with the advanced rules so we were competing over which helpers to hire. I think that's a pretty critical variant in order to introduce some more player interaction and add some variety to the helpers.

What really impressed me about this game is the engine building possibilities the helper tiles provide. Not many light dice games have this element. It's reminiscent of the developments in [thing=37380][/thing], except here you can deny them from your opponents and there are different ones each game. This gives the game some fun depth and different strategies to try out. Players also have control over the end of the game which adds another cool layer to the strategy space.

At its core it's a pretty straightforward tick off the boxes dice thrower. If you don't care for that genre you probably won't find anything here to love. If you are a fan of those games in general then definitely check this one out. 

I'm curious if the 3 or 4 player experience will affect my rating, but for now it's 8.

A fairly solid dice roller. Easy to explain but plenty of paths to follow. Our first game lasted a little too long because we didn't get any hats for ten turns in a row, but that's the nature of the beast.

Really like this one solo. Love the chunky dice. Have enlarged and laminated the scoring sheets, so this one is ready for some serious solo play.

An 8 as a solo game (and considering the bias of someone who loves pen and paper games).  I do feel like it runs a few turns too long (and is therefore too easy, with my entire sheet of paper frequently almost completely filled) but there's a simple fix:  fewer turns!

Bought mostly for solitaire and it's a very enjoyable dice-drafting game. Beat-your-high-score play will probably get boring, but multiplayer is great as long as at least one player pushes for the endgame.

This adapts the dice drafting from the main game, keeping a lot of the flavour. You are still drafting dice, though depending on the player amount you might be re-rolling dice between each pick. When you draft a die you mark the good(s) you receive with discs and when you have received everything you choose how to spend them by crossing them off on your sheet. You may focus on helpers to unlock special powers, roof tiles to get bonus items, shipping to get crates, markets to grab potential bonuses or simply storage to gather sets and score points. The game has a basic mode where all players have the same basic helpers to choose from or the advanced game where players are choosing between basic and unique helpers from a common pool.

Unlike the main game, where I adored the solo game just as much as the competitive game, here I felt the solo game was too different to really enjoy, but I really enjoy this as a competitive game.

Nach Discoveries endlich mal wieder eine gelungene Umsetzung eines bekannten Spiels in eine neue Version. Die WÃ¼rfelversion von La Granja hat uns allen sehr gut gefallen. Einziger Kritikpunkt mÃ¶gen die etwas klein gehaltenen BlÃ¶cke zum Eintragen sein. Wir haben allerdings in Ratingen auch noch nicht mit dem endgÃ¼ltigen Material gespielt. Nach RÃ¼ckmeldung des Autors soll hier in der endgÃ¼ltigen zur Spiel 2016 in Essen erscheinenden Version noch nachgebessert werden.

SpielgefÃ¼hl und Erlebnis erinnern an La Granja, sind aber "anders" genug und bringen neue Ideen mit. Der Spielablauf ist schÃ¶n fluffig mit wenig Down-time. Auch scheint das Spiel recht ausgewogen, da mit den verschiedensten Strategien Ã¤hnliche Ergebnisse erzielt wurden.

Fazit: Eine klare Kaufempfehlung fÃ¼r Leute die La Granja noch nicht haben oder denen La Granja zu lange dauert bzw. zu kompliziert ist. Wir werden es zusÃ¤tzlich zu La Granja kaufen und beides zu unterschiedlichen Gelegenheiten gern auf den Tisch bringen.

[u]22-Nov-2017[/u]:  This is a RnW game based on the original, La Granja, which I have not played.  In this game, you roll dice to obtain various resources into your inventory.  You then apply that inventory to different sections of your farm to build a roof, hire workers, etc.  Mostly, you're looking to score VPs.  But the fun of the game is setting up combos through the use of bonus actions to accomplish multiple things each turn.

There is an AI for the solo player, whom I have named Maryann.  She is there to take points away from the player rather score points herself.  The AI system is easy to implement and works well.  It also means this game is a high score affair, of which I have no issues.  Most RnW games are anyway.  It's fun and challenging...the highest VP rank feels impossibly out of reach upon my first few plays, but it does make me want to work harder and keep trying.

Overall, a nice, quick playing, dice chucker with some good decisions for the player.

Great dice game of a very good board game. It plays really good with two players and you have to think about your plans. It is more strategic than you think first. We like it a lot! We cannot understand at all the back critics on the sticker. Definitely a game which is worth playing or even better buying :)

I like the dice rolling aspect, and how you are building up a series of items.  Reminds me a bit of Roll Through the Ages, although the mechanics are very different.  My main concern is that I'm not sure there is sufficient diversity in strategies.  However, I've only played once and with the standard "helpers".  It might be very different with the advanced helper game.  Need to play a couple more times before a final conclusion.

A significant step-up on my childhood.
When I was growing up, it wasn't uncommon to bring Yahtzee to the table.
But to put such a pleasant theme on a very smooth dice mechanic, I must say, I'm very pleased. This is a solitaire game that really works well solo, and I am eager to play again.

Complex, as dice games go, and it at least gives the illusion of decisions to be made. It seems that most of the time most of your playing board will be completed by the game's end, but figuring out an optimal order seems to matter a lot. It strips the area control and mutli-use cards out of its big brother, focusing on dice drafting, and I think even that mechanism is less interesting here than it was there (here, everyone gets the last die at random instead of it being left behind after the others were taken), yet I have enjoyed my plays of the game to date. Time will tell if there's enough variety to sustain interest, but it does come with advanced tiles in the box, which bodes well.

[b]La Granja: The Dice Game - No Siesta![/b] was traded away 1/15/17. (Received One Deck Dungeon)

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]I was very excited to play this since La Granja has become one of my favorites, but I ended up being extremely disappointed. No Siesta fell completely flat and the conclusion felt like it was already determined minus rolling some dice for 30 minutes. Decisions are at a minimum and I can't imagine playing this more than a few times since the strategies are so transparent and really not varied at all. I really enjoy playing dice games so this has been one of my biggest disappointments of the year.[/i]

Meaty, but shorter Euro game that involves dice. Not a Yahtzee variant. Very pleasant gameplay. Feels meatier than Octo-Dice (which is also a very good game). Replayable, with multiple strategies. I really really like the unique mechanism with the Olive/Wheat combo dice face. I have no idea how this game is similar to La Granja, at this time, though I'm dying to find out.

Gateway Game! Church Group Game! Casual Game! Family Game!

Slight learning curve, and a longer rulebook than expected. Dice come unstickered. The graphical icons are tiny and difficult to see.

Light-to-medium dice drafting game. As with most drafting games, it looks like hate-drafting is pretty important (especially 2p).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Based on one play: A cute dice roller where you draft from a set of dice in order to complete different sets on your player board which bring you points and special powers during the game. Sure the dice cause luck and randomness but the powers allow you to minimize this and the game plays in about 40 minutes so the luck factor does not remove the fun from the game mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Mediocre "roll dice to fill in your sheet" game.  The dice drafting is fun.  But I think there are a few things holding this game back.  For one, once a player finds a strategy that generates a load of points, I am not sure the game offers quite enough randomness to force a player to try a path that is all that different from his preferred strategy.  Hence, I think replay value is a bit limited even with the advance variant.  A player CAN force divergence a little bit by speeding up the game, but if hats are not being rolled this won't happen.  Also, the scoring system needs a little more oomph. It's a point or 2 or 3 for this, a point or 2 or 3 for that.   There are a few power moves like completing a cart, but most of the scoring is a bit dull.  I also think the game tends to run a little long for what it is.  It feels like a game that should be over in 30 minutes or less, but it tends to run 45 to 60 minutes.  And it is entirely possible for all player sheets to be full or nearly full and everyone is still rolling trying to get hats to end the game which turns into an extremely dull 10 or 15 minutes.

A top game for me to buy, so I did. Just played the game with 2 players and it works very well. Dice drafting, with variations that would sync to those found in the board game. Set collections and a lot of overlap with the board game. I think it is a very nice game. I worry about not rolling Siesta hats enough might drag on the game play too much. Also with more players I wonder if the game play would just be too long. But, I will definitely find out. For now it is solid and very enjoyable!

This is a nice somewhat meaty dice-drafting roll-and-write filler game. In essence, the staring player rolls all the dice, then takes one. Each player going clockwise then drafts one of the dice until only one remains. Then players use wooden disks to mark what they got from the dice, with everyone getting whatever was on that last die automatically. Once this is done, players use pencils to fill in boxes on their farm sheet assigning the resources to the different paths. When a path is completely full, they unlock either points or a special bonus depending on what route they took.

The game has two central boards, one of which customizes your endgame victory point conditions, the other of which acts as the game timer with the game ending when one player takes enough hat results on the dice to reach the end of the track.

Probably the bet roll-and-write game I've played, but it just felt like it was missing some key magic for me to bring this past 5 plays.

Nice little dice-chucker and dice drafting game. Plays quick, but not rolling any siesta hats can cause the game to drag on. Not sure what the replayability is like, but it seems like the special advanced helpers may help. Set in the same universe and vaguely resembles its big brother La Granja.

Good as both a multiplayer or a solo game, however players seem to neglect the siesta track and drag the game out until people have scored just about everything on their sheets. I'd love to find a quicker variant.

2 to 4 players.  Very little player interaction.  Lots of  strategies available to score your points, but in the end, it doesn't seem to matter much because by the time the game ends the players have pretty much exhausted all of the strategies and thus the point scoring is fairly tight.  There doesn't seem to be a lot of excitement in that you really don't have any opportunity to score really big. 
The game is OK, but it doesn't leave me with the desire to play it again.  I think I'd much rather play 'Roll Through the Ages: The Late Bronze Age' with is much more exciting.

This game starts off great, but [i]really[/i] bogs down about 75% the way through.  The last 8 rounds or so we were just rolling to get hats to end the game.

If there were more end-game conditions, this would be a very fun and quick game.  As it is, just drags out too long.

We considered a simple house rule that might fix this problem.  Simply add an end-game condition that once 4 areas of any person's tableau are completed the game ends.  We haven't tried this, but expect it might improve the experience.

I really enjoyed this game. The dice drafting of La Granja was always one of my favorite parts of that game. This games gives you that fun experience. There is interaction with the dice drafting, the race for finishing the barrows, and claiming bonuses in the market. However, it does seem to still feel like it plays a little "solitare". I also feel like there could have been a little more incentive for progressing up the siesta track to keep the game moving and make sure it doesn't overstay its welcome. The siesta hats being needed to complete some of the market barrows technically even slowed the game down a bit. All in all it is a fun "Roll and mark something off" game.

Only played solo on Tabletopia.  Solo I'd rate it a 5 - there are some different options, but the way hats work with the neutral player is not that interesting.  But I am interested in trying it with more players and wouldn't pass it up. A pretty interesting medium weight roll and write with a good amount of choice where to allocate revenue (dice) and which helper (special abilities) to go for, and a little bit of competition over which end game scoring choices to go for.  With roll and writes, I tend to prefer those where all players use the same dice, rather than turn-by-turn drafting, which is why I can't quite give it a 7.  I'm not going to really seek it out.

No Siesta condenses an average Euro to a roll-and-write format. You get special abilities, endgame objectives and the like as you check off the (really tiny) boxes on your player sheet. There are elements of La Granja in there, but you sort of have to strain to see them.

What drags the kind-of-average game down is that a lack of hat icons â which serve as the countdown timer â will protract the game end. It seems likely that the hat icons will be snapped up quickly anyway, and so players will be fairly even on the siesta track. That's a problem, because initially divergent strategies will converge as the game drags on, killing a lot of the tension in the game.

With hats being taken evenly by both players, the game went on for way too long. We had filled in nearly every space on our boards, and still there were several more rounds to play. In the end, everything was crossed out, except a few long-distance trades. It's a laid-back dice roller, crossing out stuff on a piece of paper. I generally like those games. But here, it was too laid-back. No tension, very few interesting decisions. Which helper do you take? Well, don't worry - you'll have all of them a quarter through the game.

I'll give this another shot with the expert rules one day.

tl;dr: great stuff

How do you convert a heavy and rather complex game like [thing=146886][/thing] into a dice game? Well, by taking parts of it and remixing them. But Ode did a very good job retaining some of the feel of La Granja. But in the process the did manage to make a great roll-dice-mark-stuff-on-a-sheet game. It's way more complex than [thing=131260][/thing] of course, and the rule book is quite long, but in the end the rules are straight forward. But there are multiple strategies to pursue and adapting to the luck of the dice spices things up.
Great stuff

Was very ok for the first part of the game, but then it dragged on and on with no end in sight. Both players completed most of their tally sheets and the tension dropped. Left the game feeling just, well, disappointed.

First play impression: The gameplay itself is great. As someone who didn't like La Granja at all this was a relief. It's of the "roll dice and cross off boxes from your sheet" variety, but this one offers more choices and different paths to victory.

However, the game went on way too long. There is only one way that the game ends, with players moving up the siesta track, and it depends on a certain thing getting rolled on the dice. If I play this in the future, even though I'm usually against house rules, I would be inclined to start everybody two or three spaces onto the siesta track just to keep the game at a reasonable timeframe.

Besides the game feeling like it took too long, everybody was able to do pretty much everything and the last few turns were boring because you just use the dice in whatever way is available to you, whereas you have tons of choices in the early game.

After reading on the forums it seems that this is a common problem with this game. People have suggested racing up the siesta track to end the game, but that presents a couple more problems: if you automatically take dice that let you move up the track it removes decisions from the game. Also, if everybody plays this way, it won't shorten the game because the start player rotates from round to round so the players will be moving up the siesta track at an even rate.

It feels like there should just be an alternate way that the game can end. Maybe if someone has completed their third cart or someone has completed all of the distant deliveries. In my game, one player was able to complete all three carts way before anybody was able to move far enough up the siesta track.

Overall the game is almost excellent with just that one glaring flaw. If they come up with an official variant that adequately addresses the game length then I'll probably get my own copy, but as it stands I'll just play my friend's copy if asked.

Complex, convoluted and contrived. Why call it a "dice game" when it's not embracing any of the innate mechanics of dice? It's just a generic randomization tool.
Also, towards the end of the two-player game, most our tally boards were full - it turned into a hat race to end the game as fast at possible.

Fun game that doesn't take up a lot of space.  With 3 players it can take up to an hour+ depending on how often people pick up the hats.  I think I prefer it solo, but it's a great game to pull out when I want a slightly longer game that isn't too heavy.  Only complaint in our group was that the icons on the score sheet are small and hard for older eyes to read - so we'll probably make some enlarged copies and laminate them to use with dry erase markers.  Personally, I like the compact size because it's easy enough to set up on a TV tray or desk.

So cool to turn your milk into cheese or freeze them into ice cream. Fun push your luck game!

RATING: 8
Because this is a quick, cute little game that has a small footprint I'm basically always willing to play it, hence the 8, but in terms of a quality its more like a 6 or 7. It's a very simple push your luck game, that plays well with 2 (my only count at multiple plays) but would probably be more interesting at 3 and 4 as there are more backorder tokens, making it easier to get to the big 40-pt tiles and more of the push your luck element.

Such a pleasant mostly mindless push-your-luck.

RATING: 4
I always like to give a try to push your luck games, but this one didn't seem as interesting as I had hoped.  The turns are fast, which was cool, but the decisions you make with the dice just didn't seem all that interesting.  Also, the push your luck wasn't as nail biting as I had hoped.  Want to try again, but not looking good so far.

Our new, take-along filler!
The mechanism around the negative tokens enhances play.
Nice PYL which benefits from a bit of thought.

ps Have stopped marking plays because we've been playing it so much.
Mindless (or is it...) fun.

Unlike BIOTIX, even though this game is all about dice and rolling, the press your luck mechanic works well here and I truly believe that the "best player" will win this game most of the time. I kept pressing my luck and it's no surprise I lost miserably. This is a good filler that I would gladly play again.

Easy-going roll-a-ton-of-dice game, where lady luck goes somebody's way.
I'm "OK" with the game, but will probably bore out of it at some point. Note to self: start refusing to play the game 3 times in a row. ;)

Enough elements and things going on. Quite fun as a lighthearted game /filler.

RATING: 5
I was looking forward to this game, but after several plays I feel like it is a much lesser version of Pickomino.  The -5 point deduction for the backorder tokens is practically a non-factor, since you tend to get them and give them back often enough that it likely doesn't matter if you have them.  Games have not been decided by so few points as to make 5, 10, or even 15 point deductions a factor.  

Seriously, if you don't already have Pickomino (and it's expansion) then just get that.  The rules to this game are also unclear as there seem to be unresolved inconsistencies between translations that I don't feel Tasty Minstrel has done a good job of clearing up.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I've worked on a dairy farm. I wish it was as easy as rolling dice to get the milk. There was no connect to the theme and my real life experience...:-) As a push your luck dice game its fine but nothing I need to own or ask to play. At least it isn't roll three times and work with what you have.

Adorable push your luck game from [person=64330][/person] the designer of [thing=168679][/thing]. I have to say I like this game a bit more than Flip City since I love rolling dice. You are pushing your luck to try and roll combos of 10 and try to get the milk and turn it to ice cream and cheese! Very easy and fast little game. Happy to play it. Fits in well with the TMG small boxed games. Happy!

As a typical dice roller, I can only justify in keeping it for the moment as it is a tense, engaging maths practice for my 5yo to rehearse adding to 10 and counting in 10s.

But if there is one takeaway lesson it is a clearer ruleset, even for such a seemingly simple game to explain, there is some differing interpretations because of inadequate choice of words and phrasing. First off is the use of the word 'reroll' to mean two different situations.

Art is clean and easily understood.  Dice are serviceable but not top quality.  Push your luck mechanic and simple theme would relegate this to the younger crowd in my house (under 12).

RATING: 4
The game seems simple and plays fast but it lasts way too long for a 2 player game.  Also, the game can get stuck if all three available tiles are the 40 point ones.  The only decision you have to make is if you want to be play safe or push your luck.  After that, just hope you roll 10s!

Fun little push your luck dice game with some special powers that you can unlock to manipulate the dice rolls. Pretty simple but its a fun and good filler. And the components are really good! BUT the rules from the TMG version are NOT good, there are many things that they have removed from the original version that was released by Homosapien Labs. I dont understand how TMG could do this and make the rulebook so much worse. So i recommend that you get the original rule book that you can find here on the files section on BGG.

Looks like a fun, quick push your luck dice chucker with a bit of a dice manipulation engine. It would probably make a great restaurant game.

RATING: 7
Small dice games often end in disappointment for me - either because there are no interesting decisions to be made or there is too much downtime in between turns. That's why I like Dairyman! I only played it with two so far, but turns go quickly, every turn offers an interesting push your luck decision, and you always have a feeling of progression, even if you roll badly. On top of that, the package (I own the japanese version) is really small and very, very cute. A great travel game.

a simple dice rolling Yahtzee game about selling milk and cheese and ice cream. It has a unique implementation of the Yahtzee dice grouping unlike any other games.

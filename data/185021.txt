RATING: 6
Spiel vom 30.01.2016: Diesen Ausgang (70:29:29) muss man nicht kommentieren. Hat KH gut gemacht. Spiel ist ok (KH: "schönes Spiel"), aber bei mir will der Funke nicht so richtig überspringen. Ich gebe dem Spiel bei BGG 6/10 möglichen Punkten=ok, mehr aber auch nicht. Das Thema ist schon etwas schwach: Man schippert die ligurische Küste entlang, um Farben zu besorgen, die zum Ausmalen einer Kathedrale benötigt werden. Das ist sozusagen das „Vorspiel“ zu dem Spiel „Fresko“, in dem es um das Ausmalen der Kathedrale geht. Die Spielmechaniken in Liguria sind doch eher abstrakt, eine Geschichte erzählt das Spiel nicht. Da mir das fehlt, spiele ich auch nicht ausreichend motiviert. Fresko (hat von mir 7/10 möglichen Punkten=gut) ist um einiges besser als Liguria, aber auch deutlich anspruchsvoller.

RATING: 7.8
Schade also, dass der Spielregel und der Aufmachung nicht mehr Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt wurde. Abgesehen von diesen Kritikpunkten gefällt mir Liguria jedoch sehr gut und ich kann es jedem empfehlen, der Spiele mag, in denen alle Möglichkeiten stark ineinander greifen und gut überdacht werden wollen, bei denen aber auch das Glück eine kleine Rolle spielen darf.

Very Interesting Pick up and Deliver Game. Has a different Movement Phase than most games. Building your tableau is also very novel. This one might go up as it is so different. No way to tell Scoring til end. Lots of moving pieces in this one. Right now keeper. Might be a bit hincky in rules. But it was first game. Should go smoother.

I like the fact that instead of a classical board you get a more "outlandish" setup, and the way to select turn order and available actions was also quite interesting. The artwork leaves a lot to be desired though.

Movement in this game is a little like in Luna, where you sail around in a circle and can do various things at the destinations.

I thought it was pretty good, but it had a few issues.  For one, it seemed like there simply weren't enough goods on the board, and the goods you got were a function of where you were rather than what you wanted.   So, it was never really possible to plan to fill contracts.  You'd instead get the goods, and then try to find contracts that fit those goods.   Not sure that was intended.

Also, the scroll mechanic seems a little too powerful.  When it's easier to earn points from the work of other players than from what you do yourself there may be something a little off.

Definitely not my cup of tea. Very simple game that sounds like a pick up and deliver but in which I felt the pick up and deliver part did not matter that much. Too many points to be had through upgrades, island area control, and diplomats. I also felt the game ended too fast, before achieving anything worth of mention.

After only one play I'm not sure.

Few interesting mechanics, but some of them seems to be overkill - some players never used it or there is more trouble with it than it's worth. But maybe it's just a newbie issues.

Boring set collection/cube optimization game. The idea behind the central selection mechanism is fairly neat but in its current form doesn't really create situations for hard choices or interesting trade-offs often enough to make the game worth playing.

The look of this game is pretty bland (despite decent components build-wise), but the gameplay is surprisingly great given the poor packaging. There are lots of interesting trade-offs as players maneuver to get the tiles they want and pick up cubes around the board. I enjoyed this quite a bit.

RATING: 7
This game is supposedly tied to Fresco thematically and I can see how they're related through the pigment collection. Mechanically its a pick up and deliver with some "area control" game. The game also requires you to to balance some sort of good vs bad karma so that players are more inclined to pick up weaker cards in order to earn good karma. 

Very tight and mean game where other players are constantly in your face stealing the goods you wanted.. I wish the game was a little more deep and developed since it had good mechanics in it. Felt like the game is too short. Very underrated game and I'm glad to pick this one up for cheap.

After 1.5 plays.

I suppose there is great tension in choosing which box to take, but I find it extremely frustrating to be the 1st player to choose. Unless you choose the 1 (whereupon your opponents will jump to the back and take 5), it seems like they will just keep you in last place by placing just in front of you.

I really don't like the mechanism of placing on the islands.  Even if you place a huge amount of knights, someone can come by and top yours and you get no defense or compensation.

The tile purchase mechanism is clever: all the ones you take must be adjacent or you must pay a coin for each tile skipped over.  The bidding mechanism for acquiring tiles reminds me of Pergamon.  The plus/minus card penalty for negative scores at game's end seems too high.  It's an interesting decision process to take the cards though.  Sailing from island to island feels repetitive and derivative of other games; it's the weakest part of the game.  Buildings should do something other than solely give victory points.  They seem out of place since possessing islands reached via ship doesn't mesh with the idea of constructing brick buildings.

Well its playable. Nothing spectacular but a good solid game. The only thing I don´t like is optimizing at game end cubes vs. chits. And Queen Games come on: there are soldiers and not knights killing the natives on the islands to get goods.

This game is a "prequel" to Fresco (different designer).  And it stands alone on its own as a great game!  All of the choices you have to make have great synergy and require some good thought.  Choosing turn order, which tiles to take, which card to take, and which location to sail to all make for great choices and fun each of the nine rounds.  Improving your "technology" tracks with the tiles is a fun component.  Also sending out your Diplomats is a clever way to get points in this game.  Upgrading your "tech" tiles for points (and losing their ability), also requires some thinking.  And the green/red points system on the cards is a game within the game that I really enjoyed!  This is an underrated and underplayed great game!

Jogo agradável de jogar, sem ser a coisa mais entusiasmante do mundo, embora até tenha a sua originalidade. Cheira ao "Bombay", da Ystari, com travo de "Caravelas", da MesaBoardgames, numa mistura ligeiramente melhor conseguida, talvez pela variedade de escolhas e pelo magnifico mecanismo de definição de ordem de jogo...

Liguria is an apparent prequel to [thing=66188][/thing], and features a similar turn order track as well as the theme of fulfilling contracts for paints. I suppose Fresco’s mood track is also echoed in Liguria’s vaguely named “positive points” (known henceforth as “karma”), but that’s where the similarities end. Liguria includes a pick-up-and-deliver component and a bit of area control, among others. While Fresco is a family game with a focused scoring system, Liguria is a point salad with a touch more complexity.

Liguria doesn’t push the envelope of game design in any way; it simply blends the familiar into a just-barely-different-yet-pleasing Euro concoction. What stands out the most for me is how the constant struggle to balance out karma is interwoven into many decisions made throughout the game. A solid but not amazing design, which nonetheless might have received more positive attention if it wasn’t published by Queen Games.

tl;dr: good but unremarkable

Move around, gather some resources, use those resources to get points. Where have we seen that before? The answer of course is: so many times we don't ever remember all of them.
Not every game has to bring something new to the table, and this game doesn't. That's fine though. But it doesn't do it in an exceptional way either. It's just one of those games that works well and won't offend anyone, but I fear it will also fail to find a good core audience as it is just a bit too middle of the road on the beaten path.
But if you get the chance to try it, why not? It's not a bad game at all!

Another Queen Kickstarter where people can pay full price before realizing that the game isn't any good. I expect this to follow the trend of most of their other projects and to go on sale for under $20 shortly after it comes out (the standard online will be about $28).

Update: Now that the game has been released, just want to say that the above comment was correct except the game can now easily be found for closer to $10 instead of $20.

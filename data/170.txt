Quite unexpectedly, this has our family and friends laughing harder than any game we've ever played. If you look past the theme, this is a fantastic "take that" card game that doesn't take itself too seriously -- and neither do we when we play.

The laugh-meter says this is an eight. ;)

Always a fun time.  And to make it a bit more interesting, I always secretly pick a mobster or two that I decide to care about.  Send any of my mobsters to the wall other than the ones I care about and I won't do much back... but pick one of them and you're my new target for the rest of the game.

RATING: 7
What a fun game!  Very thematic, very evocative, entirely random and entirely fun!  Very prone to king-making, I'm sure, but hopefully the group tries to keep things relatively even rather than ganging up on someone or always killing off the weakest person.

At first I disliked how the turn order jumps around, but it's an interesting mechanic that enables a larger group of players to achieve results.  In other words, it works better than I thought it would.

Very reminiscent of [GAMEID=116].  Quick, fun filler.

RATING: 6
It is a fun game with a good theme. Fast to play and not very deep. But sometimes you get pissed off because you have the right card to do things in your hand but cannot do anything because someone else uses a blue card before you and your characters continues to die and you cannot do anything.

Interesting presentation marred by the fact that one has to constantly refer to reference sheets to know how the cards work. (The current edition doesn't have that problem.) It's too long for a game that consists of players just attacking each other.

In Family Business the cards pretty much play themselves; the best one in any situation is  usually blindingly obvious.  Haven't drawn it?  Your mob just got smaller.  A ton of cheerful executions don't really compensate for leaving my brain in neutral.

The artwork hit a nadir with the melting faces against seventies wallpaper of the Mayfair '89 edition.  Other editions I have seen improved on that to varying degrees.

A good laugh but usually suffers from the "gang up on who is winning" syndrome, or sometimes when everyone picks on one player the latter is a problem and can put players off. It is quick, there is a small amount of skill involved as it depends more on the luck of the draw. A violent concept putting contracts on mobsters and shooting them but even so should not be taken seriously.

I'm the last person to turn down a game of "backstabbing, revenge, and general bloodthirstiness"... but this one left me bored to tears. Maybe I missed out on something important, but it seemed random and dry to me, plus the ganging-up action ended up seriously unbalancing the game. 

Maybe I played it with the wrong group, but I don't think I want to find out enough to try again. There are countless other games waiting to be played... this one just didn't do it for me.

RATING: 2
rating is for the new mayfair edition.  whatever semblance of fun this game might have had was probably eradicated by the inexplicable lack of text on the cards.  everyone was consulting and re-consulting the rules in order to determine what their hands might do, and the underlying game wasn't even fun.  and this is coming from a guy that digs mag-blast!  i'm certainly not against light, stupid take-that games.  i would rather play just about anything over this, including fluxx.

In a sense, this is like 'reverse'-Guillotine, where you are loosing people rather than gaining them. The version I've played the most often doesn't really have much explanation for the card powers (not even any symbols!). Thus I think Guillotine is the better of the two.

A 'no' for 2 players, it really shines in a 4+ player sitting with killing contracts flying everywhich way and huge turnarounds being right around the corner.'Take-that' and 'Screw-over' could as well be written with big, bold letters on the box, since that's what this game is all about. Potentially fun depending on the company and roleplaying it.

First play. A random card game with all the lottery aspects you'd expect. Perhaps the game is supposed to fuel gangster banter and bad film quotes, perhaps, but there was little in our 6 player game. 

The uncertainty of whether someone will reverse your contract, scoop all of your guys into the firing line dependant upon which secret cards they hold just makes the game a random lottery. Sure there are optimum moves based on your hand, but if you don't have the right blue defence cards you are pretty screwed.

I just had an overwhelming sense of the game playing me, especially when the successfully countered contract results in you missing a turn, over and over and over again.

Not an game to be taken at all seriously, definitely a game to be played only after an extremely  heavy night of drinking to be in astate of mind to consider this worth playing in the first place. Really rather poor.

Plays fun with at least 4. This game reminds me a of Bang! a little. You don't have roles, instead you have a family of mobsters. You want to be the last one standing by putting contracts on the heads of the other players' mobsters. I highly reccomend downloading the player aid sheets from BGG so each player can reference the power of each card. They are not all self explanatory.

A very light, in your face "take that" game with a mobster theme. Things I liked; art on cards was very nice and they included real mobsters. Things I didn't like; pretty much every aspect of the gameplay. Play a card to try to get other player's mobsters on the "hit list" (which is a line of mobsters in the middle of the table) or play counter cards to stop your mobsters from getting added. A nice twist is that if you play a counteraction, you take the next turn, breaking the clockwise around the table turn order. We played 4 player. I was ganged up on early and really didn't have a way to stop it. I had 4 of the 6 mobsters on the hit list when a Mob War started. A Mob War starts when there are 6 mobsters on the hit list, 6 or less mobsters left in the game between all players or when certain cards are played. When it is active, the front mobster (or maybe the first 2) get removed at the beginning of each players turn. So, this would be fun for a light crowd who doesn't mind take that gameplay. But for serious gamers, I couldn't recommend it. Just too random with your card draws and way too tactical. However, I will hold onto it for family and/or friend game nights, which we do rather frequently. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Can be fun with the right group of people, i.e. people who will use the blocking cards when other families are being attacked and not just helping themselves.  Otherwise continuing to play a red card at every opportunity will just slow the game down too much, plus make everyone want to gang up on you for stealing control.

Humorous card game of 20's mob turf wars. Players target one another's underlings and put 'em "up against the wall." When the wall reaches critical mass, the fun begins. Some diplomcay as you try to weasel other players into targeting one another instead of you! Very much like Guillotine-- and just as fun.

Good "take that" card game. I think it relies a little too much on stockpiling defensive cards, but in general offense is enough better than defense that the game moves along quickly. I prefered my older edition: the graphics weren't as good, but the cards at least had a quickie explanation on them. The latest version does look pretty, but teaching the game takes longer because everyone has to borrow the rulebook every time they draw a new type of card.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
IMHO it is essential to play with the following house rules:

1. All players must play 'in character" with accents being compulsary at all times.

2. When playing a contract a justification must be given as to why you are putting a contract on that player. Traditional reasons include: because (s)he just took it on the lam; (s)he forgot to pick up, and is therefore too stupid to be allowed to live; The player before you forgot to pick up, and is therefore too stupid to be allowed to live, and you failed to put a contraqct on them! etc.

Great fun game in character with the maximum number of players and a few drinks.

Only played twice. Simple but vicious game where you are trying to kill off your opponent's mobsters and be the last mob standing. Feels quite old school, but entertaining enough as long as you're playing with people who don't take it personally when you pick on them.

Our lunchtime group at work played this game every day for over a year.  It got to the point where we could play 4 games in an hour.  They loved the idea of putting their co-workers up against a wall and playing the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.  I would still rather play this than Bang! or even Werewolf (which has a similar "attack whomever you wish" feel to it.

It's probably amusing if you haven't played Guillotine, which is a much better game.  The 2006 version I played was marred by poor card design: 90% of the card is illustration - they should have put text on the cards to describe their function instead of forcing you to look them up in the instruction sheet.  Looks like Mayfair might have corrected that in the 2008 printing.  Regardless, the game play is similar to Guillotine without the ridiculously wild swings of luck that make that game fun -- which means Family Business drags on longer than I'd like.

Straight up high luck screw-your-neighbour.  Player elimination is a bit of a problem, but the main target is usually the player in the lead, so all players tend to be eliminated pretty closely together.  Huge meta-gaming revenge factor.

A take that game where all but one card either move the game towards the end, or have it stay still, and where judging who is in the lead is extremely simplistic.

Decent little game for a bloodthirsty group. I really don't understand why Mayfair didn't put what the cards do on each card, though. There aren't too many cards so it's not a huge issue, but the player aids on BGG will make teaching it to a new group a lot easier, otherwise there's just going to be too much rules-referencing for it to be any fun. This WOULD be a 6, but I just don't see any point in pulling this one out... it's an okay game, but why play this when there's things like Bang!, Oriente, and Kutschfahrt?

Fun little game.  Not exactly the most elegant design.  Game has a filler feel, but games can take longer than what I consider filler time.  Feels alot like Bang, but this one is much better, because every card in the deck is helpful, and there is no shortage of attacking cards.

RATING: 4.5
Some of my friends really like this one, and yeah, it’s an okay game, but I think it’s too long for what it is. Also, a player can be eliminated way too fast if other people gang up on him, and it’s not particularly funny to watch the rest of the 30-40 minutes it takes for this game to end... Also, there is a pretty big "gang up on the leader" problem which I don't really like. 

All in all, there are some cool cards and the game has a nice theme and all that, but ultimately, I don’t like the elimination aspect and therefore I’m giving a rather low grade. I've played it several times in the past, but only a few times since I joined BGG.

Fun game with the right crowd.  I have the new Mayfair edition.  The cards are nice, but they could really use some kind of text or symbology on them to indicate their function and interactions with other cards.  Or at least cheat sheets should have been included so everybody could look at them for reminders rather than having to pass the instructions around for the first three or four games.

I played this with six people and it ended up going faster than expected.  

Note that it would help if they printed some minor explanation of what the cards could do on the cards themselves (we had to keep passing the rule book around so that players knew what their cards did).  I guess the older version of the game has the info on the cards.

My main problem about this game (or at least the printing I played) is that there's absolutely no explanatory text on the cards.

It's a shame this classic isn't more well known.  The only real flaw in this gangster shootem' up is that irregular turn order; if someone does something to you, you go next.  The desire to go clockwise is so ingrained in people that this system takes some getting used to.  And of course, it's a card game, so there is non-trivial luck to it.  But there's a lot of satisfaction in pushing another player's gangsters up against the wall.

Play it with a bunch of folks who hyperanalyze the corn strategy in Puerto Rico and you'll have an awful time...play it with a bunch of rowdy, bad-mouthed gamers who value fun over "elegance" and you'll have a blast!  This is a super-simple, virtually strategy-less take that game that exceeds in presenting a completley cutthroat, vindictive environment where success is measured solely on your ability to efficiently knock off other players' gangsters.  A great theme and some fun mechanics make for one of the better games in this genre.  Thumbs down to the new Mayfair edition- no card text and ugly art counter the virtue of its smaller box.  Better than Guillotine!

This is a good, fun, specialized card game. If you like messing with other players (in this case, killing the other guy's mobsters), then this is the game for you. However, the game is really only playable with four-to six players, and do NOT buy any of the versions except the 1982 version or the 2008 version. Specialized card games work best when the instructions on what the card does are on the actual card. That wasn't the case on some of their other editions.

I played it again for the first time in at least 10 years. It is amusing when played with the right people, but tends to drag at times, especially when the interupts cause you to lose several turns in a row.

You should tend to play contracts to your right, as the interupts the person may play will cause your turn to come around quicker.

I found the rescue cards to be frustrating, in that if the guy to your left has a bunch you never get a turn ... but other than that I found it to be simple and fun in a Guillotine sort of way.  Maybe it's the newness but I kind of enjoyed this more than I've enjoyed Guillotine lately.  Looking at the pictures on the geek I MUCH prefer the newer cards to my brother's 80's Mayfair edition (which I thought were plain ugly ... no offense Rich) ... but ultimately that's not a huge deal for me.

A mob-themed, take that style card game that is best with 4+ players.  Original rules involve player elimination which can be tough if someone gets killed off early, like I did in my first game.  

Tweaking the rules slightly, we now play with the end game being triggered when a player is eliminated.  This also helps to avoid any runaway leaders without hampering game play.  The winner has the most gangsters left on the table.  Some fun.

Epitomizes what I don't like in a game. Lots of cards that do random stuff with no explanation (as bad as Bang!), but mostly the sole balancing element being that when attacking, you can choose any player you want, so the "normal" thing to do is attack the leader. Which means games usually end close, which I suppose many people would consider a good thing, but it also means the 1st 3/4 of the game is nearly entirely pointless. And of course it also has cards that are wildly more powerful than others, so it pretty much comes down to who gets the right cards at the end.

But alas, my kids like it (until they get eliminated), so I play it for them. I'm hoping it will be a passing phase.

Revised comments after several plays: The quintessence of "screw-your-neighbor" goofiness combined with just enough depth and strategic possibility to place it a rung above mere silliness.

Ancient Guillotine with a strong and somewhat fun mob theme: in other words, fun with the right crowd who play the metagame well.

Components: The cards are rather garish, with unattractive backgrounds behind the mobsters, and the same mobster featured on each card of a suit, despite each card having a different mobster's name (even with a female mobster name, there is still a picture of a male mobster).

The game has almost no strategy, and there's player elimination.  Since there's no strategy as to who to attack, the game practically invites metagaming (and/or tit-for-tat stuff).  There are good light filler games, but this isn't one of them.  Beats Monopoly but only because it's a lot shorter.

I remember playing this game an endless number of times. The ease of play, savagery, and propensity to incite us into ridiculous Italian mobster accents really was what this game was about. Yet as time went on, there was only so many times we could give each other "The Finger" and come back to the table. Family Bid'nizz lived its time in the lime light a hero and died a pauper on my shelf a few short years later. The game itself is pretty descent, but it is the elements that it inspired that set it above the rest. It must be played in a large gregarious group.

For what ever reason, as we got to the height of playing this game at a convention, one or more of the most socially inept gamers would find themselves over our shoulders emulating our absurd dramatics. This would inevitably suck the life out of the game as we tried our best to discourage there interjections. Boo to awkward gaming moments.

This game is utter chaos, and I love it because of that. It gets old playing it a few times in a row, but it's a great change of pace after playing a slower game for a while.

This is basically Guillotine, but you're killing your opponents guys instead of random french royalty.  Good game, kinda quick light and fun.  The one interesting thing about this game, it's almost a social experiment.  Most games I play that have some kind of screw your opponent aspect makes people kind of sour and disgruntled.  But this game doesn't.  I think it is because in the other games, you have the option of screwing over your opponents, but you don't have to.  If you choose to screw them, they take it as a personal attack.  But in this game, you have no choice, you are forced into conflict.  There is nothing nice you can do to the other players except avoid them, and eventually you can't even do that.  Yet it doesn't leave people angry like many other games do, even games with only very slight screw you features.  It seems that it's understood that "hey it's nothing personal, it's just business". Thus an aptly named game.

A fun confrontational card game that sadly I think is disappearing. This is one that I'll never part with, but for some reason never seem to remember when packing my bag up for gameday at the shop. One I need to play a lot more than I am. The game is very confrontational and because of that you have to negotiate and try to work with other families but in the end there can only be one winner so it is delicate work getting the timing right on when to turn on someone.

I thought this game was pretty cool when I first played it so I picked it up. After a few plays it mostly collects dust now. There is an interesting dynamic between players trying to earn favor with some and get revenge on others, but the winner always seems to be the one that draws the most "red" defensive cards. This makes the game purely "luck of the draw." It can be a fun party-game with non-geeks, but not one I would likely pick to play with fellow gamer-geeks. The massacre cards that slaughter everyone can be kind of fun though!

released on Mayfair in 1982. I wasn't aware that Mayfair had been going since 1982 before looking at the box of this one. It is a card game which in 1982 would have been innovative and maybe even ground-breaking. It is fun and maintains the interest through its 20 minutes but it does show signs of its age with the random card drawing determining the action that takes place.

My group loves this to play this game. Personally, I found it just average. It plays fast and a great filler for my gaming group.

Update: I enjoy it more after more plays. It's simple and its a nice filler. Knowing the cards well helps a lot. Player elimination. Theme is interesting. The card St-Valentin Massacre Day simply rocks.

Rating up from a 6 to a 7.

If you have the right crowd this game is classic. If you have a tight-knit group of four to six friends, this game of double-crosses and arbitrarily ganging up on one cannot be missed. If you buy the newest edition, make sure you print off player guides for card descriptions. 

Probably have logged at least 20 plays before I counted my games played.

Played one time with 5 players. Well, the game is ugly, has player elimination, cheap components, lots of take that, and seems to have several flaws (such as the player who draws lots of counters gets lots of turns and the player to his right (me, in the last game I played) spend many rounds getting no turn.) On your turn, play a card that will usually put an opponent's gangster on the hit list, or trigger the hitlist members getting whacked. Reminiscent of Guillotine, except that Guillotine has more variety of card, awesome artwork, and a short play time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
A party card game of luck.  Ridiculous with 2.  If I drank and used gangsta' voices, and there were a full 6 players, might think it funny.  But since that isn't the case, found it very simplistic and repetitive.  Just plain boring.  

Terrible card design.  Art work is unappealing and looks dated to me.  Two decks--but with the same backs!!  So, harder to sort than need be.  Even the player reminder cards have the same back.  

In its favor, the small box fits the contents.  The box & insert are incorporated into the game board's set up.

Since this is 98% luck of the draw with no strategy, this is much too light for me and dragged.  I can't even see it as a filler.  One play was one play too many.

RATING: 5
Silly little game. Its main appeal lies in its theme. If the players get into it with Sopranos "fuhgeddaboudit" accents, gravelly Brando "Godfather" quotes and snide witty remarks when offing rival mobsters then the game should go over well. It's no more than a filler and luckfest though, so don't expect any deep strategy. Warning: the box says players from age 8 to adult. Not everyone will want their kids committing the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, so handle with care. The mobsters on the cards are, for the most part, named after real-life mobsters, so a short history lesson may be in order for younger players.

RATING: 5
This is a nice light game. It's a little boring until you get to where everyone only has one or two mobsters left. Then it gets really tactical and interesting as everyone desperately clings to their lives.

This is a "take that!" game you can teach anyone in just a few minutes. It especially replaced Bang! for me, as it took even longer and had all those defensive cards. I think Family Business has in turn been replaced by other tricky mobster games. 

You have to play it with the right group. Players are allowed to gang up on one another, so a fragile player won't like it and others don't like to have to handle a mob. 

I wonder if the game would be better if you just started with 2 or 3 mobsters. The it would be interesting right off the bat, and shorter, and when it was over you could play a second time in the time it would normally take to play a single game. 

Also, the interrupt cards make it so you go next. It's possible for several players to go back and forth, skipping over a group for a dozen minutes at a time. This is painful in this kind of game. They're not even dead yet!

I sold this in 2014 after purchasing it in 2009. Take that style games are no longer very fun for me.

I remember liking this back in the mid-90s when I first played it and was pleased to pick up the new edition.  Unfortunately, this time around no one was feeling it and I'm not entirely sure why.  I'm hoping another game with a group more inclined to play up the gangland aspects will help, but for now I gotta say that I was a bit disappointed.  Hey, at least it's cheap!

Beware the "take that effect" in this game.  I played with my wife a handful of times thinking that each time it would get better.  Boy was I wrong.  She was getting more pissed everytime we played.  My wife hates losing and especially hates losing by direct conflict.

RATING: 6.25
Fun and fast game to play which I enjoy when playing with 5+ people.  But the game has its problems.  
i) The preemptiveness can leave you without a turn for quite a while, and it's necessary to get turns in order to get fresh cards.
ii) If you get no red cards you're pretty much done for.  You're a sitting duck for all the other players.
iii) Constant clockwise player activation means it's overly favourable to attack 1-2 players on your right so that if they counter you'll potentially get another turn quickly.

While I am happy to see Family Business back in print, and am pleased with the images of actual gangsters on the mob family cards, I am appalled that Mayfair has inexplicably chosen to remove the brief power descriptions from the action cards.  Without those descriptions, players must constantly flip through the rulebook to discover how a particular card can be used or countered.  This bogs down what is intended to be a fast-paced, fun game, and is totally inexcusable.  The person responsible for this oversight should be thrown onto the Hit List.  Well, maybe not shot, but at least suitably chastised!  

Once one becomes familiar with how the cards can be used -- which would take NO time had the descriptions remained on the cards -- the game plays quickly, often at a frantic pace.  Mobsters are tossed onto the Hit List, escape, and are thrown back on again.  Mob Wars start with great frequency, and the death toll mounts precipitously.  Don’t take offense when you are targeted, as at any moment, players will inevitably target the player who has the most mobsters remaining.  Thus, the game is usually quite balanced.

Also, don’t enter the game expecting a great strategic struggle, or much control.  You are hostage to your hand of cards, and the only path to pursue is to kill or be killed -- probably both.   Still, the game is fun, and offers the chance to slip into the role of a mobster, but without the actual bloodshed!   In true mobster fashion, Mayfair has served up a "game we can’t refuse!"  

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Lots of screw your neighbor.  Can be a good game to play with a rowdy bunch while drinking.  As with most card games, the right draws can save you while the wrong ones condemn you to a quick death.  Having printouts to explain the card actions is needed.

This is a fun light hearted game that works well for non-gamers and gamers alike.  Unfortunately the rules provided in the game are too ambiguous and in some cases we were left scratching our heads as we tried to fill in the gaps.

In it's time this was one of the very best card games around. Playing it recently it seemed to have lost a little appeal and it can suffer from the 'counter card' syndrome whereby if you're unlucky it can be quite a while before you actually get a go! Still has a place in my heart though!

First played on Dec 18, 2006.  This was an interesting game.  It seems to be filled with more luck than skill and is a take that game.  You would want to play with many people to get the game's potential enjoyment of the game.

This game is basically Guillotine with a cutthroat flair and last man standing edge.  Consequently, I think it is much better.  The Mayfair edition comes with cards that, inexcusably, have no actual text on them.  This is highly confusing for new players and reduces the game's appeal drastically.  Fortunately, the game is fun and light enough to overcome this glaring deficiency and excels in its aptitude for backstabbing glee.

My rating: (out of five)
Strategy: 2.5
Luck factor: 4
Players interaction: High active.
Play/Wait Ratio: Low.
Replayability: 2. This game is kinda borring. I really deslike the fact that there are many type of cards and they are only explained in the rulebook. Also, the line to the wall reminded me of another game, "guillotine", but not as good. If you're interested in that type of gameplay, play "guillotine".

Similar to Guillotine. This would be excellent if only the cards were more unique and fun, as Guillotine is. I don't much like the double killings associated with Vendetta and Ambush, you really feel out of control. It would be better if they died at the end of your turn, not the beginning. I have the new edition and I have to say that it's really annoying that they didn't include text in the cards or AT LEAST some reference cards for everyone.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Family Business is a simple card game with those ever-popular "take that" mechanics. It reminds me of Guillotine and might even be a little bit better, but it's certainly not one of my favorites.

RATING: 5
When I first was getting into the hobby, I played this game at my sister in-laws and had a lot of fun.  I bought it the next month and played it with my board gaming group a couple of times.  It was at play 2 that I realized that really this game is just ok.

It is a good beer and pretzels game and does appeal to non-gamers that don't mind a "take-that" mechanic but for me is "ok fun."  I would rather play something like Ticket to Ride, Bohnanza or Pandemic with non-gamers.

Has some good flavor, and I like the way the hit list on "the wall" works.

This is not a game you win, so much as a game other people make you win (by targeting people other than you).  I'm not sure I really care for that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Card game about gang warfare between hostile mob families. Not much skill required (although knowing which powerful cards it pays to hoard for the endgame will help you quite a bit), apart fom the ability to whine to everybody's annoyance if you are picked on too often. Mostly a mindless get-the-winner-of-the-previous-game contest, but fun all the same.

In my gaming group, gameplay contains all sorts of ritual. Somebody once mispronounced the Moran Gang as "Morgan Gang", so it's been called that ever since, always said with a snicker and a laugh. Also, countering somebody's Take it on the Lam attempt must be declared loudly: "FINGERRR!!" :)

Initial Rating: 4.5 ( July 2016)

Family Business was one of my oldest unplayed games, I finally played it this month :D.

Family Business is a very light “take that” game. Nowadays, I heavily dislike most “take that “ games and I also prefer heavier games, so I don’t really like Family Business.

The rules are VERY simple, you can explain them under 5 minutes. The difficulty comes from the many kinds of card available and, I cannot believe this part, the game comes without any text in the cards OR any player aid. Thanks to this, the first rounds are very slow as each player takes the game manual to see the effect of the cards. It is unbelievable that the game comes without any player aid whatsoever! My edition of the game is Mayfair Revised Edition (2006) and I think other editions do have text on the cards. To be fair, after a couple of rounds, most players know the effect of the cards by heart, but still having to pass the rulebook makes for a slow start.

The art and theme is ok.

The idea of the game is to be the only player with characters alive. It plays very fast and you do have some fun playing it.

It has lots and lots of uncontrollable luck, the decisions are obvious and the gameplay is very repetitive!

Bottom line, Family Business isn’t a game for me because it is very light and relies mostly on the “take that” mechanism. I already sold my copy of the game and I will do my best to stay away from it. I guess it can be a good family or filler game. To be enjoyed you need the correct game group.

Current Rating: 3.5

It's an ok game.  The player's aid here helps.  Usually I don't like elimination games but if you have a lot of other players and other games can start, I'd play.

1 game with 4 people.  Took a lot of passing the instructions around for people to know what card did what, but now that I've got 1 game under my belt I'll remember what does what, mostly.  An interesting "take that" game, but can be a bit frustrating when everyone is putting your gangsters on the hit list, or if you get eliminated first.

More plays may change my rating up or down.

Quirky defensive card rules regularly lead to player turns being skipped for several rounds, creating downtime problem.  I recommend putting one 'family influence' and one 'mob power' card back in the box during setup.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My rating here reflects my impression after a single play, I could definitely see it going up. This is a sort of take-that free for all, and the theme really comes through in the game play. The mechanisms are simple and easy to teach. One area of concern is turn order, where you go in clockwise order unless someone plays a counter card which allows them to steal the next turn. The turn order continues to their left after the turn. In our 6 player game, this resulted in some people getting skipped several times. The game plays fast, though, and even with that aspect, no one had to wait terribly long to play. It would probably be even less pronounced with 4 or 5 players. Will definitely play this one again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Fun little idea with a deduction element to it. It also gives you a little feeling of being able to control things. The game is just a complete chaos. Everything is completely random. You can't plan anything. The random and fun faction should be compared to pair of dice. Roll them instead, it goes faster! Tried the second edition I think. There are no text on the cards, and no player aid sheet. But why make something useful, for a useless game?

One of the better take-that games which doesn't mean it's a good game. At least it's not overly long and the theme matches the mechanism. A notch better than the Steve Jackson Chez Geek crap but they could have written on the cards what each of them does.

Talking like gangsters is an offer you can't refuse while playing this game. I like to do Don Corlieone, while my friends take on voices like Joe Pesci in Goodfellas or Robert Deniro in Casino. Lots of laughs in this "take that" style game.

RATING: 7
Family Business is another family favorite. Great 'take that' game that has some huge moments where you can wipe out ton of mobsters at once. Very simple to teach, it has huge universal appeal. Plays well with a wide variety of ages. 
We make a change to the rules that makes the game a lot more enjoyable for most. In the regular rules, if you counter someone's action, it becomes your turn. This adds a little more strategy to the game, but it can lead to a lot of people getting skipped over, and makes the game a less enjoyable for those who are just wanting to play a lighthearted take that game. I think this is especially important when playing with larger player counts. 
I wish that it came with more cards, or a least there were more expansions. because when playing with higher player numbers, you have to reshuffle the deck quite a bit. I have thought about just buying a second copy and taking out some of the cards from that to make a larger deck.
Sometimes the game drags with larger player counts, but this can easily be remedied by giving each team fewer mobsers to start with. I like that you can very easily adjust the play time by doing this. 

My only real problem with this game is that not enough people pick up on my Godfather references :(

A good, quick, and easy to learn card game of mob hits and doublecrosses, although the lack of information on the cards themselves does tend to bog down play a bit.

A great game that can be played in 30 - 45 mins where you take control of one of 6 mobs and try to be the last one standing. This is played with cards and is fast paced.

RATING: 4
A guillotine-style game where players build up a string of mobsters and execute them. A lot of bash-the-leader style play. Not too great as a party game. 

[NOTE: The new version does NOT have any text or symbols on cards, rendering them nearly unplayable. Based on that, I would rate this game a 2]

I knew I didn't like this game from the initial description of the game. I don't like games where you have to choose one of your fellow players to hurt. This is the whole game of Family Business. Also, I thought the cards would have made the game easier by listing the other cards that it counteracts--because it took about 20 minutes to explain the rules.  For a game of this type, it should take 5 minutes to explain (and 10 minutes to play).  Our first playing of the game took about an hour, which was about 59 minutes too long.

You know, it's hard to like this game, and it shouldn't be. The theme should be awesome, the play is similar to Bang! but simpler (so it should be faster). Our big problems: lists as a 2 player game, and it's ridiculously boring. Played with 6 people, a little more engaging, but now you have 6 players who have to look up which card cancels which. Why not have a little printed card with the corresponding relationships, perhaps have the  counter cards info listed on the cards themselves, etc. Feh!

Okay, so the strategy aspect might be mostly random with a few choices based on what you draw BUT the game is just a good time.  Definitely would not play this game with less than 4, its probably at its best with the full complement of 6.  Its all about taking each other out...and nothing beats playing the St. Valentines Day Massacre Card and mowing down the hit list!  However, it does become a bit repetitive over time.

Pretty awful card game that turns into a popularity contest in which players try to avoid having their mobsters chosen for assasination. "Pick on the loser," "screw the leader," " and "tit for tat" seem to be the operating principles of the game.  Mercifully, the game is short.  Unfortunately, life is also too short for repeated play of duds like this.  Playing the game with the right sense of humor among the right group probably knocks up the rating a point or two.

Fun game shooting up eachother's men.  Those who get lots of defense cards tend to be attacked, play the defense card, and then draw more because it's their turn.  They tend to have more options and get more good stuff.  Otherwise, it's a fun game if you don't think of the actual pictures that go with what you're doing.  The fun backstabbing trying to get your men OFF the wall is very fun.

  Made a mistake and thought I was buying Razzia.  I've yet to play the game and to be honest it doesn't really look that good.  I guess I'll play it one day.  The fact that all the gangs are real is kinda interesting.

  Extra:  Oddly enough I ended up playing with somebody elses copy over Thanksgiving.  I had a decent enough time, but not putting text on the cards was pretty stupid in my opinion.  I don't want to keep going back to the rulebook for a filler that's not even that thematically  engaging.  I think Bang will remain my filler of choice for now.

Basically a simple "take that" card game with a "death row" board. 
Quite luck dependant (card drawing), but with the right atmosfear and fake Italian accents it makes a real nice party game. With the right rowdy crowd this one is a blast, and I'd always want to play this.
Definitely better with beer.

NL: Engelstalig kaarspel, waarbij de speldoos de "gangwar"muur is. Je bent een mafiabaas met 8 gangsters. Je probeert de gangsters van je tegenstanders te vermoorden. Dat is soms handiger als je samenspant, maar uiteindelijk is er maar 1 winnaar: de laatste overlevende...

Eigenlijk alleen echt leuk als je jezelf een beetje in de rol verplaatst, bij voorkeur met slechte Italiaanse accenten. Maar dan is het ook echt heel leuk. Dus alleen goed  met de juiste spelers.

Perhaps TOO light.

But still moderately fun every once in a while.

Like Bang!, it is incredibly annoying that somebody felt it was necessary to make the cards language-independent, ensuring nobody is able to know what the cards do until after a few games, making constant referral to the rulebook an issue. There should be a law to avoid this nonsense.

This is a good game. At times it can be frustrating, especially for the beginner when they get skipped alot due to interrupt card getting played.

Had quite a bit of fun with the French version ("Service Compris"), themed around an ogre eating various fantasy folks. Plays like guillotine but much better; there is a bit more control over what is going on and it is possible to spread the pain or single out a player to dish out well-deserved revenge :)

Update: The new mayfair reprint is just slightly not as good as Asmodée's "service compris". There is no rule text on the cards, which makes it difficult to introduce the game to new players as they need to memorize what all the different cards do (or keep checking the cheat sheet). There is also too much text on contracts, making it difficult to see whether a contract is immune from mob power or familly influence. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My kind of party game.   Vicious and fun ... great for those rare times when you invite a non-gamer over to your pad.  I think I would prefer the Spielfreaks Edition art over my Mayfair edition.  I wish they would have at least had a different picture for each mobster.

Mob-themed "take that" card game whose light weight makes it easy to bring to the tables with those new to the hobby,  The major liability I see in this game is the mechanism that once a blue counter card is played, the turn order is disrupted and skips directly to the person who played the blue card.  This can be quite frustrating in a game accommodating so many players especially for those new to the hobby.

This game is *barely* a 6.5 because it's very simply a "take that and screw you" kind of game that a lot of people find unappealing, and understandably so.  Loathe your sister?  Bombard her with Contracts?! Have issues with the loudmouth at the table?  Hit him and hit him again.

But the game does balance out midway through, and it's there that the game begins to shine.  Even though I have issues with the "play a defense card, take two and it's now your turn mechanic", this game has some great moments and sagacious players can make for a very exciting game.  It's just a bit chaotic and random to be rated too highly, fun as it is.

Avoid the new edition at all costs!

This game is really dependent on the luck of the draw, because if you get a hand of interrupts without attacks, you're pretty much doomed.  That being said, it's a fun game mechanic, quick to play, and pretty funny.  I was frustrated with my hand during the first two games, but I'm going to give it more time before I pass judgment.

Surprisingly more thematic than just about any other mafia-themed game I've played. You put mobsters on the hit list, and if war breaks out, they're the first to go.

This game may be criticised for being another mindless "take that" game where bashing the leader is the best course of action. But it isn't. The optimal strategy is to always target the player on your right, since if your attack gets countered and your target becomes the active player, you're playing the following turn. Which manages to make the experience even worse than the previous assumption!

Also, whoever - responsible for the French version - thought a mafia mob war was not a suitable theme and that commiting genocide against sentient fantasy species by chewing them alive would be more marketable should question their sanity.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The game consists of a number of cards dealt to each player (5 cards in a hand).  Each player also has a family of 9 mobsters to start the game.  The cards in hand allow players to put out contracts on other mobsters, which puts them up against the wall in sequence.  Once six mobsters are against the wall a mob war breaks out, and the first mobster in line dies at the start of each turn until the wall is clear or a player plays a card to stop the war.

There are some interesting card abilities in the deck that allow for developing some strategy, but you are largely going to be relying on luck in Family Business.  In addition, the version we played only had the card title on the card, which meant we were all reaching for the rule sheet to understand how to play our hands.  I believe more recent editions of the game have the abilities clearly marked on the card, but this was a distraction from play with our version.

This has been compact and simple enough to travel around the world with me (second only to Bohnanza), but a very easy game to "sell" a game of.

Thrilling, hilarious and VERY aggressive card game in which mob families compete to take their men out of the queue to be executed. While the game has got a significant portion of luck the cards are all either strongly defensive or strongly offensive - no gentle action to slow the rhythm down... the possibility to kill a mafioso on the spot or launch mob wars with single or double executions at will gives the game a relentless atmosphere of menace - having an automatic mob war for the last six men on the line is the icing on the cake.

RATING: 4.9
Gioco di carte in stile Bang, ogni giocatore ha il suo clan di gangster e l'obiettivo del gioco è quello di eliminare tutti i gangster delle band avversarie. Idea carina per l'ambientazione ma il gioco non spicca ne per originalità ne per coinvolgimento. Molto forte l'alea con la pesca delle carte. Simpaticissimi i nomi di tutti i personaggi che si rifanno alla criminalità organizzata del periodo del proibizionismo statunitense. Un filler che una volta ogni tanto ci sta. Senza pretese.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Family Business will appeal to the confrontationalists and the backstabbers, but unfortunately, that's about the only aspect to it, making any skill element virtually irrelevant if your fellow gamers decide to gang up on you.

Whoever turned down the idea of writing a card's action on the card itself should be shot. What a way to screw up an otherwise halfway-decent game. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It is like Guillotine, with mobsters lined up to be killed, but those mobsters belong to each player's family, and they may be able to save them before they get to "the wall". A nice idea, but playing out random hands of line-manipulating action cards just doesn't do it for me. Maybe with the full 6 players it would be more fun as mayhem, but would probably feel even more random.

A mindless 30 minute leader-hitting whack-fest I played for a while with a group who didn't mind whacking any other player on a whim and then continuing to whack them because they're defenseless. And then randomly choosing a collective next target and hoping it's not you. The rules are easy and the cards are easy to learn and play so the game is quick to pick up. It's a fun theme and the game is pacy so it's a good laugh for the right occasion and the right mindset - but it can be horrible otherwise (ie with serious players) so be careful.

Fun! Game really fits the theme! Fast play! Games seem to end real close; if someone is too far in the lead, everyone tends to go after them, thus preventing the runaway leader occurance. This game seems best with at least 4 players. We havn't tried 5 or 6 yet; we can't wait.

One flaw:  The only thing it is lacking is a rule card for each player so we don't constantly pass the rules trying to see what certain cards do(there are many cards that whose functions are not obvious).

Very light card game that is adequate only as a filler or for novice/young gamers. Needs at least 4 to make for an actual game. The Action cards need text and the Mob characters need flavor-text if not actual variations that affect game play.

A "take that" type of game as you try to off your opponents while protecting your own mobsters. If you like to target your opponents this is the game for you. 

The cancel cards can be just as powerful by messing with the turn order, and gives you a good reason to intervene on the behalf of another player. However, this does mean you may be without a turn for quite a while.

Consider it a "long" filler

--Dec2009-- Gift from Secret Santa.  (Thanks, SS!)  #1 Daughter was amused; she'd just recently learned about "The Mob" in school, and found it delightful to play a game with Bonnie, Clyde, and Al Capone.  I suspect it'd be quite a good deal more entertaining with more than just the two of us, so I'll hold off giving it a rating until I've had a few more plays.

The "take that" aspect is, as always, lots of fun.

RATING: 7.5
Though the majority of this card game is rather simplistic - due to its heavy reliance on basic "luck of the draw" mechanics - the game is elevated somewhat in status over its card game brethren due to its rather interesting "Hit List" mechanic - cards are played in a line (called "the hit list") and the actual order of them is vastly important as it means life and death for your gang members. The cards can be altered, swapped out, and re-arranged depending upon the cards you have in your hand. This thankfully does add a much needed strategic element to the proceedings, which would have been rather bland otherwise.

Please note that the 2006 edition has a rather annoying attribute - action cards have only the titles printed on them with no directions or instructions whatsoever. In order to know what the ability of each card is, you will have to look in the instruction manual. This is acceptable for those who know the game well and have played it often, but is very frustrating when people are new to the game. Thankfully, this is corrected in the newest edition (2009).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
After playing Guillotine, which I enjoyed, I'm not sure I'll like this one. My big turn off is that you need to look up what the cards do on a cheat sheet.  Why not print the cards purpose on the cards themselves?

RATING: 6.5
This really is a cut-throat game.  I put off buying it for a long time becuase I thought the "theme" was too violent, but we all liked this one a lot.  Keep in mind that my game group likes aggressive, competitive games, and this one totally fit the bill.  It's very easy to learn and play, and it moves very quickly.  Do not play with people who hold grudges.

RATING: 6
Simple card game filler, set in a world of mob wars and contract killing. The game plays somewhat similarly to Guillotine, but it's just not as fun. Each player has a mob with nine members, and the goal is to be the last mob standing. You can sometimes kill enemy mobsters directly, but usually you have to put a contract on them, and they're placed in a first-in, first-out queue. When the queue fills up with six mobsters, a mob war begins, and one mobster gets whacked each turn until a truce is declared or the queue is empty. The strategy is light, of the "should I block this hit or save this card for later" variety. Unfortunately Al Capone is worth the same as his underlings, which in addition to making no sense, robs the players of an opportunity for some deeper tactics. If each mobster had a special function you could use but only if they were alive or unqueued, or if mobsters had different victory point values when executed, you'd have some real dynamic gameplay. Anyhow, enough whining about what it's not. I played this two-players, and it seems to me the game would be more enjoyable with four, giving you a choice on whom to bash, making mob wars faster and more frequent, but most importantly making the contents of the contract queue more interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The ultimate TAKE THAT! card game, since there is no in-game incentive to go after any particular player.  Even a Jyhad-like kill-the-guy-to-your-left structure would have helped.  With too many people, you play counter cards just so it will be your turn.
I liked the art, although we used to play this using any old trading cards as gangs (but especially Yo! MTV Raps cards.)

Another take on the whole take-that genre.  Unfortunately, like most take-that games, this one wears out its welcome long before the game is actually over.  The high point, though, is the theme, which really seems to fit.  Still, I generally don't like take-that games due to the excessive amount of ganging up that tends to occur.  As is often the case, how well you do is determined more by your hand of cards and less by how well you play.  The player elimination in this one can also be a problem (though perhaps a merciful exit would be an appropriate characterization).  Overall, there was some interesting stuff going on.  If the game had ended on the first pass through the deck, this would have been a much more enjoyable experience.  [01/15/2008]

RATING: 4
This 'American classic' rears its head in 2006 with a poorly designed Mayfair version. The cards contain only symbols ... but only one reference sheet comes with the game! Expect to spend alot of time going back to the rules for explanations of card effects. If you want to save trouble and have a better gaming experience, print pasteups/player aids or just play Bang!

Players are trying to protect their mobsters whilst a slew of 'take that' cards are used to affect the game. Principally, hits are put on mobsters to line them up Guillotine style. Once a mob war starts, these mobsters are killed off in line, one per player turn.

The cards get 'samey' after awhile and the whole business of the turn going back to a person who counters a card leads to a lack of control and much frustration. Heck, that's why they give you 9 gangsters I guess.

Sadly, Bang! has shown us how to do a modern great beer and pretzels game. Family Business is ultimately dated once the laughs are over.

I first played this game probably soon after it came out almost 25 years ago.  I don't like the version I picked up from ebay.  This must be some type of multi-language version where the cards don't have any words.  The artwork is also inferior.  I guess I'll need to print out a chart like the one used for Hera and Zeus.

Beer & pretzel game. Must have many players and preferrably drunk many players. 

Fun in the right mood. One thing though - why did they create cards for each separate mob guy and not a single special feature? I mean, I should get something extra for sending Capone to the wall...

A lovely theme of murdering off rival mafia families, this is a game to be enjoyed with fake italian accents and a glass of whiskey. Probably best if another set of cards is mixed in (they recycle too quickly with just one set).

Kill thy neighbor, lest yea be killed.  Not a particularly ingenious game, but for a take that game, I find it one of the best.  Game relies on the willingness of its participants to dig in an get vicious.  Make allies only to break them.  Beautiful. 

I give this a 7 for being good at what it does and for giving me some good laughs over the years.  As a game it probably only merits a 5.

I do not like the newer versions of this game where they have actual pictures of the mobsters. I prefer the more friendly ambiguous one with a cartoon mobster face for the groups.

Having the mug shots of the actual people adds a dark element to a what I consider a light-hearted fun game. Also my older set, the cards say what they do.

This game has a great theme and perceptably "unfair" mechanics (shifting next player) that usually balance out over the course of the game. It does suffer from the syndrome of players being knocked out and having to watch the others finish the game. However, it's fast enough that early elimination isn't too painful.

[url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/210126/item/4692361]1 play in modern times[/url] (I'm sure I played the original version way back before I started logging plays). 

My last ribbon! I thought I had one more leftover from last year but I apparently lost it so I played this one. I'm pretty sure I played the original version of this, but it was likely in the early '00s or earlier, i.e., before I started logging plays. 

This is a very light, random, [thing=116]Guillotine[/thing]-like game with a mobster theme. Players each start with 10 gangsters face up in a personal display, and a hand of cards. The cards mostly putting out a contract on someone (you pick any gangster in a player's display): add them to the Hit List line. Other cards add 2 gangsters, or pull one of yours out of the line, counter a card being played (and make you the next player!), start a Mob War, etc. If the Hit List reaches 6+ cards, a Mob War starts automatically. While a Mob War is in effect, the first 2 gangsters in line are killed (removed from the game) at the start of each player's turn. The Mob War ends when the Hit List is empty again. 

The game is quite chaotic, with your play being limited by the cards in your hand. Fortunately it seems to be self-balancing: people will generally target the current leader so everyone stays pretty even. Eventually (and in not overly long time, fortunately), people will be eliminated one by one until there's a winner. 

Cute filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I really don't care for this at all.  Put out a hit on a guy...maybe he has a counter, maybe not.  Meh.  To make matters worse, there is no rules text on the cards so you have to look everything up on a reference card (at least in the recent printing).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not much strategy or meaningful decisions here.  Still tense when you're up against the wall and there are some laughs with contracts, counter measures, etc., but that's not enough to persuade me to suggest a game or two.  The rules for all the cards take some getting used to, too much so for a light game.

Can be fun, but only if you are in the mood for it.

You have to be ready to verbally do "RATATATATATATA" followed by an evil laugh every time you pull off a StValentines day Massacre, in order this to be fun. By itself it isn't.

Light game, not whole lot of a strategy, don't like the fact that hoarding on a player is the most potent way to win it.

Family Business is wonderfully cutthroat, with fun gang names and a lot of "Take that!" in it.  Players need to make sure they don't get upset when attacked, and we've often seen frustrations from other games in the evening taken out via contracts in Family Business.  That said, it often feels like just "One game of many" rather than a standout.

A good quick shoot 'em up that will keep everyone in the game while you're still in the running.  Three flaws however; one, the cards are not printed with a description of what they do on them; two, it is easy to gang up on someone unfairly so it's more a case of who's feeling vindictive than who is skillful; three, once you're knocked out there is usually a boring 10 to 20 minute wait until your pals have finished gleefully shooting each other.

This seems like it is completely random.  The minute people decide to pick on you, you're out.  So, why do I like Bang more?  I think because you have teammates to help you out of a jam, not everyone can target you just because they want to, and I like the theme more.

Everyone loves to play this game. There is very little skill or stradegy involved. This game turns into people forming alliances and picking on other players.It usually ends with everyone yelling at each other.

Family Business is a good, light filler card game.  You have a "family" of nine thugs and criminals (represented by cards) and try to eliminate the other player's families while preserving as many of your own family members as you can.  In a sense, this game can be thought of as a more elaborate version of rock, papers, scissors.  Attack cards enable you to place another family's members against the wall (a game play area that when filled with six or more mobster starts a mob war killing one mobster per turn), counter cards counteract attack cards, and rescue cards enable you to save family members from the wall.  All of the cards give you a clear idea of what they do and I have not seen timing or play arguments during a game(watch out for that St. Valentines Day massacre card though).  The game plays best with 4-6.  If you are looking for something that can be cuthroat and tense, yet well balanced, give Family Business a look.

Got this early in my collection and mostly forgotten about.  I actually really enjoy this game for the take-that quality and it doesn't last forever.  I do play with a few less people in the family to make sure it doesn't last too long, but overall this is a nice cheap semi-filler (it's slightly long for a filler) / party game.  As someone who hates Munchkin, this is what I would point to as a better version of it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Quite a fun game, and a good one for introducing neophyte gamers into the fold. A few of the cards are a little useless, and the rather bloodthirsty nature of the game can be a turn off for some (although, not, curiously enough, people new to gaming!). Can drag on a little, particularly if you're limping along with only 1 or 2 gangsters, but reasonably good value for money, eminently so for those amongst us who are sociopathic...

A simple take that kind of card game with a really nice level of nastiness in it. Can drag a bit with 6 but 4 or 5 goes smooth. Think of it as a more linear and cleaner Guillotine.

This isn't the best game around. It has player elimination and the downtime can be severe, if playing with 5 or 6 and the players keep defending. But, my group and I like it.

RATING: 2
This is the first, and I hope, the last time I will rate a game following a single play (at least in this negative a way). 

My experience of the game was terrible, luck seems to play too large a part in the game.  If you get a bad draw at the start of the game (as I did) and then on the few occasions that you get further cards get more of the same (again as I did) then it feels like there is nothing you can do to get back in the game.  Without the reaction cards, you will frequently miss your turn, preventing you from getting new cards, and therefore potentially missing your turn again.  I found it to be a soul destroying experience, to the extent that I stopped playing part way through (I chucked my toys out of the pram) - I wouldn't normally do it, but as it is an elimination game (and I only had a couple of mobsters left most others had five+) I figured it didn't really matter.  

The only reason I have given it as high a rating as I did is because the others playing did seem to enjoy themselves.  I understand that my experience is not typical, but don't think I would be able to play a game again with the memories I have of that first game.

Hilarious game!! All players assume the role of a 1920s mobster and try to wipe each other out. Only the most cunning and devious lowlife will stay alive and win the game. My friends and I have gotten quite a few laughs out of this one

UPDATE: Traded in local math trade to UBG.

Good quick filler game (usually!!)  Lots of fun going back and forth putting other gang's mobsters up on the hit list wall!  Watch out for St. Valentine's Day Massacre!

Why doesn't this have text descriptions on the cards?  No text turns this fun and simple family game into a game that I'll never be able to talk my non-gaming family into.

Haven't played this in a while but I always enjoy playing and it's fast enough that we can play again. I sold my old copy before the new one came out. But then found out the new one doesn't have the helpful text on the cards. D'oh! I found an old copy for ~$10 at BGG.con 2006 though!

Leuke vlotte filler waarin spelers elkaars gang proberen dood te krijgen.

Het spel heeft niet veel om handen, maar het brengt wel een lekkere sfeer aan tafel (vooral de kaart 'finger' biedt mogelijkheid tot veel onderbroekenlol). Minpuntje is het feit dat de beurt naar een speler gaat die een tegenactie doet. Dit kan er voor zorgen dat sommige spelers een hele tijd niet aan de beurt komen, maar misschien wel bendeleden kwijt raken.

My copy of this game doesn't have the rules on the cards so there is constant rules look ups throughout the game.  We tend to play it in spurts since you can remember the rules after the first time through but the next time you need to look them up again.  I think there is a version that has the rules on the cards, but I don't think I could talk myself into buying a second copy.

Can be a fun game and sometimes a very bad game Very possible to be eliminated from the game before you ever get a turn, And can play a little long for what it is.

A good hand management game. The changing player order can be bad if you get skipped a lot. I think it probably evens out in the course of a game but it can be tough to watch your gang disappear and not be able to do anything about it.

RATING: 5
Played several times (both as Family Business and Service compris). Not much strategy - the most successful players are quite often the most discrete, and among these the winner is the one who gets the lucky card draws. Still, it can be fun with the right people.

I've played this a couple times. It's the older version of the game. The designers did pretty well having the game box be part of the game. It's a game about killing gangsters and trying to keep your gangsters alive.

RATING: 6
Used to own this; sold it at a garage sale. I shouldn't have. Its not a bad little game, if played with the right attitude. Needs a reference card to tell the players what all the different cards do, since many of them are 'inturrupts' and you might miss a chance to use one.

Tacky and boring. The game revolves around attacking the current leader, i.e. player with most surviving family members. Removal and pushing of family members against the wall seems to make up most of the action.

A serious problem to be considered: the gang-up on the leader. Okay, the theme fits, but the game is a pointless struggle. Out of date graphics. The game can barely reach a 6 if played in teams.

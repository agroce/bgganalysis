Small and quick (with 4 players it might be a bit too long, depending on the players) card game.
The choices are simple (each turn you just have to draw 2 cards from any discard pile or the deck, play one and discard one), but VERY difficult (even more at higher player counts): you will always have a hand full of cards which you want to keep because either a) you want to play them later, b) you want to score a certain color, c) you don't want one of the others to score a certain color or d) you don't want to give other players an additional card to add to their paths.
The only negative aspect is that, depending on the players, it can have a lot of downtime with 4 players.

Beautiful game with elegant rules but plenty of thinking. Short, involves calculating what opponents may have, evaluating risks, and making trade-offs. My favorite thing about this game is how every turn you draw & discard, but your hand is always full of cards that you don't want to discard because they're too good. It's a refreshing change of pace from games where you're drawing nothing good. The hard decisions in this game are what to discard, as any discarded card goes to your opponent. A little reminiscent of Biblios and London, although closer to the former than the latter. The depth of this game is incredible for such a short game. My only complaint is how much table space it takes up - it's kind of crazy!

Very beautiful and elegant card game. Quite thinky in the play of cards, but manageable. It is also a game of chicken as you hold certain cards to play and also try to stuff in cards that punish your opponent's end game scoring - only they are never sure what you have. That's quite joyful. It's a quiet, computational, zen-game of cat and mouse. I do like it, but feel like few others would.

RATING: 7
This game is a nature walk that ends friendships. It plays like a knife fight in an elevator and I enjoy it very much even though I suck at it. You spend the game setting up sequential, orthogonal paths of like and not like colored tree types. You create opportunities for other players through discarding and can block them through what you choose to hold in your hand or take from the assorted discard piles. You can also delay the game or accelerate it through the draw choices you make. Majority of a tree type in your hand matters when determining what you score in your tableu so There is a interesting tension throughout the game between your ability to score and what you score. When the game ends you score points based on what types of trees are in the paths you built and what sets you were able to build in your hand. I recommend this game if a theme about perverted landscapers is your kind of thing.

2016 10x10. Interesting and tension filled. Part of me wants to say that it isn't QUITE as deep as it might seem like it is, and that luck can play a pretty major role (if you draw into enough of a suit to remove the hidden information / make an opponent's holding irrelevant) but this is still a great little card game.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
Draw two (beautifully illustrated) cards from either the draw pile, any player's discard pile, or both. Play one card in front of you. Discard one card to your discard pile.

Cards should be played according to suits of like trees in the attempt to construct chains of cards of unbroken ascending or descending value, scoring extra points for at least four like cards in a row or playing the "1" or "8" of a suit. However, cards in your hand equaling the highest value across all players allows to you actually score the same types of cards in front of you. Otherwise, your arboretum is worth NOTHING.

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
Insane brain burn for a small card game. The rules are very simple, but no game on my shelf demands more careful attention to card counting and your neighbors' actions than this one. Control over what is discarded and what can be picked up by any player is mind-numbing in tension. "Well, I can't discard that card... or that card... or that card... or that card... or that card... Oh, wait, that was my whole hand. Okay, well, I DEFINITELY can't discard that one, and DEFINITELY can't discard that one, and..."

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
If any one player does not guard their discards wisely, any other one player can be set up for an artificially high level of success. I've played a few games which were determined by a single reckless discard. The card counting makes and breaks the game.

First play with two players was good, reminding me of Lost Cities though perhaps not as smooth.  The game shows considerable potential to get better with more plays, and I understand that Arboretum plays very nicely with 3 and 4 players.  All in all, a very worthy card game with straightforward rules.  Oh, and I do like the trees as well though perhaps the red and orange trees are a bit too close in color.

RATING: 7
Elegantly designed game with very simple rules.  

It's like Battle Line (hand management, defensive holding of cards, and the Zugzwang - forced turn) meets Quirkle (card/tile laying placement in specific combinations).

One key difference is that you draw two cards per turn and must play one and discard one card, which is then available to your opponent, whereas in Battle Line you need to play it or keep it in your hand.  

I found that the end game scoring was awkward due to the all/nothing nature of scoring a path only if you had the highest sum in your hand (excluding the 8 if someone else holds the 1).  Also, the bonus scoring of the 1, the 8, and the special ability of the 1 cancelling the 8 seemed a bit contrived.  

In the end, it was an interesting twist on Battle Line, but I would ultimately never play Arboretum over Battle Line.

Note - Since this is fundamentally an abstract game, I think the only way it should be played is with 2 players.

RATING: 9.5
It really is amazing how something so simple can be so deep and though provoking.  Add to that the cards are great quality and the art is very appealing and fetching.  It's a game that draws you in and I hope that I can continue to find people to play it with me.  Right now, it's the go-to portable game in my bag.

Update:  Not hitting the table as much as I would like.  It's actually difficult for first timers to wrap their brain around the scoring paths.  Still a great game, but dropping it ever so slightly to 9.5.

Beautiful cards in this, you have a number of colored tree species/suits and you simply draw more from discard piles or the deck, play one into a tableau where you are trying to create sequential rows/columns, and then discard, but also hold some higher numbers in your hand so you can score paths in the end. Not as simple as it might seem, but a quick one to pick up.

My brain hurts! In a good way... This has to be one of the biggest wolves in sheep's clothing out there. It is mindbogglingly beautiful and will start out easy enough, where you will have no issue with discarding at least half of your hand. However within a few turns you'll quickly realise: "I can't discard that, because I need it for expanding this path. I can't discard these because my opponent wants these quite badly. I can't discard my last few cards as I need them for scoring.... I hope I draw bad!"

The puzzle in this is very difficult which is what makes it fun. I would hate to sit for 3 hours with that kind of decisions, but for a 20-30 minute game it's fine. I'll need something lighter afterwards though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Beautiful, simple, and tense. In this game, players are placing cards in front of them to score. And while there is an abstract element that influences how the cards score, the heart of the game is how scoring occurs; to score, players need to have a higher value of that suit in their hand. Thus, players must decide whether to play a card (for points), or hold onto a card (to score and/or prevent opponent from scoring). And on top of that, players must also discard a card each turn, which their opponent(s) can pick up. 

Since the distribution of cards is known/limited, the game quickly feels brain-burning as players attempt to memorize what has been discarded and picked up. And as the game progresses, players have more information and can make informed decisions on whether to attempt to secure their score, score higher, and/or take points away from their opponent(s). It all works quite well.

One of the best looking games out there. Wonderful card art. The game play is really solid and for such an easy mechanic of draw two cards, play a card and then discard a card it offers some really tough decisions.

Meglepően mély kártyajáték, a BGG-s 2.1-es nehézség érthetetlen, szerintem sokkal nehezebb jól játszani. A szabály nagyon könnyű, de nagyon taktikus játéknak tűnik.  Ötletes, hogy a kézben lévő dolog is feltétele a sikernek, jó kis dilemmát visz a játékba, és ezzel jól megoldja, hogy ne pasziánsz legyen. Emiatt viszont nagyon szemétkedős, akár 0-ra is meg lehet szívatni valakit.

Very good game that can be played in 10-15 minutes at 2 players and easily taught. For the simplicity of its mechanisms, Arboretum requires a decent amount of thinking in order to be able to score your tableau. Much of the thinking relates to either a need for card counting and/or deducing what cards your opponent is keeping. Overall, this seems better at higher player counts, and feels much more akin to card counting at two players.

This rating is for the two player experience, as that's where quick fillers get played for me. At higher play counts, this game's rating goes up to a 7.5 or 8, since there's less of a focus on card counting.

RATING: 6
It’s mostly a guessing game as to what cards other players have in their hand and luck of the draw feels like a significant factor in deciding the outcome. However, the game does feel unique and it's not the worst choice for a light filler to pass the time while waiting for other people to show up and play something else.

Lost Cities recast as a 4 player experience with enough twists and innovations for this to feel a game in its own right.  I do find it a bit fragile though as many rummyish games can be if a player discards the wrong card it can king make.  This game is particularly vulnerable to this which holds it back.  Also unlike a lot of people i dont love the art.   I dont dislike it but find it hard sometimes to know which suit a card is from.

Do you enjoy games where you actively work against your fellow players? Where you can try to secretly hoard cards that will ruin their scoring, even though it comes at a cost to your ability to play well? Do you like being able to pull off double bluffs, while making smart calculated plays?

Finally, do you like games where there is a strong chance of someone calling someone else "a complete dick" at the end?

If you answered yes to most of these, then look no further. This is the game for you.

One of the more intriguing card games out there, with a super-interesting scoring mechanic. If you create a path of, say, jacaranda trees, you don't immediately get to score jacarandas, but rather have to win the right to score them. You do this by having the highest value jacaranda cards remaining in your hand... but whatever's in your hand deprives your actual path of points. This creates quite the conundrum! Through this game, I also discovered that I really enjoy tableau-building - probably for the same reasons that I enjoy tile-laying games. Bit-by-bit, turn-by-turn, you see your little world come together.

Arboretum is one of those games I love: a deep and thinky little puzzle that comes in a small box and is both quick to learn and to play. It has set collection, tile placement, hand management, and is packed with absolutely agonising decisions every turn. Place trees from your hand in a pattern that will score maximum points, but make sure you hold on to enough cards in hand that you actually get to score them. And also hold on to some cards to prevent your opponents from scoring. Basically you never have enough room in your hand to do everything you want, and you inevitably end up discarding the exact card that your opponent needs. So great. Oh and by the way, it's one of the most beautifully put together games I've ever seen. Those trees, man. Wow.

I think the fiddly scoring is keeping people away from this one, because I can't seem to find anyone that shares my enthusiasm when it comes to this game.

The fact that you have to discard something every round creates an awesome atmosphere... and also induces AP. Also the fact that 8 and 1 give you points but also help you score at all... The designer of this game has some dark passions. 

Reminds me a bit of Battle Line, but where Battle Line is about closing off your options one by one (and the options of your enemies a bit), here it is about constantly giving opportunities to your enemies.

This is an interesting card game with nice art. The meat of the game comes from the fact that players are pushed to collect strong cards in many suits, but have a quite limited hand and are forced to discard cards that become available to opponents. You can't do it all and have to choose. I find the scoring a bit obtuse and hard to explain to newcomers. I have enjoyed my plays, but haven't felt the need to come back for more very often.

One of the few games that I'd think was Knizia but I'd be wrong about.  It has Knizia's Lost Cities/Keltis ascending/descending order mechanic but in a hand management game where you only get to score your set if you have the highest value of that suit remaining in your hand at the end of the game.  Brilliant!

Lots of decisions for such a short and simple game. I know this word gets tossed around in the board game world all the time, but Arboretum is truly elegant.

The rules during the game are simple (draw two, discard 1 play 1), the art is absolutely beautiful, and the scoring makes for very tough decisions.

Tentative rating of a 9, but I suspect it might go up with more plays

The scoring and the mechanisms of tracing paths are barriers to entry, some pick it up faster than others, but this game is still simple and super tense. I LOVE the mechanism of having to keep cards in your hand. Only played with two so far.

Fantastic card game - and one that has maintained its high rating after 46 plays, so far. The game is simple to learn, teach and play but is highly engaging. The game creates a very fun tense atmosphere at the table without being overly taxing, but the simple yet brilliant scoring mechanism keep the game interesting and make each decision you make feel more important and more agonising that almost any other card game of this ilk. This one regularly hits the table in a variety of different situations and groups - very pleased to have taken a chance on this as a blind buy at my FLGS shorlty after its release.

My group tells me I did a very poor job of explaining the rules to this game and that I forgot to tell them several key ideas. I think, as is often the case, that they just weren't paying much attention. This game on the surface seems pretty simple Draw cards either blind from the draw pile or off the top of the discard piles, build a path using cards in your hand, then discard a card. After the draw deck runs out you score points based upon the paths you've created as well as a few bonus points for meeting certain conditions within your paths. Or do you... 

The twist, and in my opinion the key to this game, is that only the player with the highest value cards of a particular color in their hand gets to score points for a single route of that color. There are a few exceptions to this basic rule, but this isn't a full review so I'm not going to go into them. Hand management and an awareness of what's on the board or likely in your opponents hands is very important and is what really makes this game stand out for me.

RATING: 6.5
Clever "old-fashioned" set collection game. Weighing the cards that will score for you vs. those that will score for others is tricky: Holding cards in your hand that will screw your opponents is often better than keeping a card that will benefit you later on. I wish the game didn't last quite as long, as often a couple of bad opening plays will trap you into a terrible hand. I also wish it had a smaller table footprint: it would be a great travel game if it didn't take up so much room. But it's a good game nonetheless.

RATING: 6
A fairly clever card game where you must play and arrange cards to your own personal grid, but also be careful to keep cards in your hand that allow you to score the cards you've played.

For example, maybe you played a good sequence of Dogwood trees to your grid.  At the end of the game, you only get to score your Dogwoods if you're holding a higher value of Dogwood cards in your hands that the other players.  So, it's a struggle of wanting your Dogwoods to be worth more points, but holding back enough of them to ensure you don't get screwed by another player that may be holding more than you.

Another neat part of the design is that each player has a discard pile, but on your turn, you can draw cards from anyone's discard pile.  So, even discarding is a tough decision, as you don't want discard a card that another player might really need!

Overall, a clever design for a nice casual game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Wonderful design and art.  However, I will admit that I am not skilled enough to play this game employing any sort of optimal strategy.  Tragically, the same can be said of everyone else I have played this with so far.  This results in players essentially not knowing what to place, retain and discard each turn.  For that reason alone, it usually gets bypassed in favor of other games.

Neat puzzley sort of card placement game with all of the discard tension of Lost Cities. The semi-spatial element gives it a very different feel from other light card games in my collection.

Could see this rising to an 8 if it gets enough plays.

With 2 players, though, I'm not sure if it's better just search the deck every turn and go for point denial rather than trying to score big yourself? Need to investigate how valid this is. I think it would put a big damper on the 2p game if you could get away with that.

Abstract with minimal actions but tough decisions. Nice twist in the scoring whereby you need to keep sufficient cards in your hand to claim paths but with the '1's cancelling the '8's. The downside for me is that discards will often make you feel like you are being forced into a kingmaking position.

Rules reminder:
Pick up 2 cards from draw deck or discards, place 1 card, discard 1 card.
Score cards in path if player has highest total in hand*. Double if all same species. Add 1 if it starts with a '1'. Add two if it ends with an '8'.

Un gran juego de cartas en el que debemos colocar las cartas de una forma inteligente y gestionar nuestra mano del mismo modo porque estás obligado a descartar una carta por turno y la carta que descartes puede ser muy beneficiosa para el rival. La puntuación final también es muy interesante ya que solo se puntuará aquello sobre lo que tienes mayoría en tu mano, de modo que si lo has bajado a la mesa para tener puntos no te sirve para tener la mayoría. Esto dota al juego de decisiones muy interesantes cada turno y de un agobio constante.

It's a treat to have a game that is so beautiful and so easy to learn, also be so immensely satisfying to play. I picked this game up because of the theme and the artwork, yet I'm keeping it because it really delivers.

Players are selecting a card on their turn and then playing a card to their arboretum. At the end you'll score each type of tree individually for the best "path" of increasing numbers. But the twist is you only get to score a tree if you have the highest total left in your hand vs. the other players. Oh, and there's a twist with the highest and lowest values!

While this looks like a light and pleasant game, the secretive nature of what you're going to keep in your hand makes this a surprisingly nasty little gem! This is a terrific filler game. Highly recommended.

After further play, I think this is an example of a perfect game.  It accomplishes its goals in a perfect and elegant manner without requiring excessive rules, it's also great fun with all player counts.  I can't see myself ever not wanting to play this.

This is pretty much exactly what I want in a card game. The combination of the ingenious scoring mechanic with the ability to draw cards from the open discard piles of the other players, and the ability to see what people are working to build in their arboretum is brilliant.  It makes a card game where you're spending just as much time trying to think about what other players want as you are trying to decide what you want to do, and it does it in a way that is less overwhelming or AP inducing than you'd think. 

New players may take a bit of time to adjust to the scoring mechanic and to the spacial organization aspect of the arboretum, but one or two games should suffice, and the game is not overly long.

This is also the most beautiful set of cards I've ever seen in my life.

RATING: 7
Surprisingly tense for a game about creating the most sumptuous arboretum.  It feels very Lost Cities-ish, but with less tension around which card to play and more around which to discard.  Is a good game, but does not replace Lost Cities or Battle Line for 2 player play, and I think I enjoy Keltis: Das Orakel more for 3-4. 

I think there is some disconnect between the ostensibly harmonious theme and the prominent denial mechanisms.  Blocking the crap out of your opponent' scoring feels kinda mean in a game about beautiful trees.  "Who's the most sumptuous NOW, beatch?!?"

On the other hand, this game enables abnormally frequent use of the word "sumptuous"

RATING: 4
Total luck fest. Lack of any meaningful decisions as choices are fairly obvious so I don't really get the brain burn part that many have described. Probability gives way to 100% perfect information as the game nears the end which allows for changes in tactics. Good draws allow for over powered, 4+ same color cards in a row bonus.

Great game with 2.  Great game with 4.  Superior with 3.  During any given play through, this game will make you feel every emotion you've ever known and some that you didn't know about.  Love, hate, anger, shock and awe, happiness, sadness, depression, love, excitement, etc...  and it's flipping awesome.  You can only have 7 cards in your hand and it's never enough!  You don't want to discard these 2 cause you want to score that kind of tree, but you don't want to discard those 2 cause you're pretty sure your opponent is trying to score them but you don't want to discard the others, because...  But if you... Then maybe... But... AAAHHHHHHH!  HIGHLY recommended.

RATING: 7
The game is very good at offering tough decisions in a way that is not unlike Lost Cities.   While Lost Cities The Boardgame has replaced the card game for me, Arboretum is the kind of card game that could take that slot.   The spatial element is interesting enough.  The screwage is high, and it all happens at the end, so this can be a table-flipper, but I think the learning curve there is small.   Really nice production, although I agree that it would have been cool if the trees got bigger with the higher numbered cards.   All in all, a solid card game with plenty to chew on.

Simple rules to fry your head. Cards are nice quality and the art for the trees is nice. You'd think a simple card game about building a path along some trees would be a zen experience. Which card to play, how does that fit into the spatial puzzle in front of you. Now which to discard, you may want/need that card, your opponent may feel the same, it can be agonizing (but not in the bad way). Oh look at that beautiful path you built, I bet it would be worth a lot of points for you except I have the highest value card of that color. A heavy "filler".

RATING: 9
Very tense game where you never have enough cards and you don't want to give any up. Always happy playing this.

2 players: the game is tight, nearly able to be calculated but has just enough uncertainty to make the scoring a tense time.

3 players: Still fairly calculable but with more uncertainty. Still really like it at this count. 

4 players: almost a completely different game, a little too chaotic with more uncertainty. Still fun to play, but a completely different game compared to at 2 or 3.

After 15 Plays, I'm upgrading this to a 10. I still love everything about this game, still bring it to every game night, play at lunch and push for it to be played when I can. The player counts hold true, I prefer at 2 or 3, but such an excellent deep filler game.

RATING: 6.75
Arboteretum is a tricky card game given the need to retain the right cards in hand to earn the right to score the sequences on the table.  The need to organise things specially and the very difficult decisions over what to discard add to the challenge.  Great looking game.

RATING: 7
Very tight card game for 2-4 players where suits of cards numbered from 1-8 are played in personal tableau's, to be scored by the player who manages to keep the highest numbered card in hand. It's a very tough decision of when to play specific cards, when to hold, and which cards to discard, making them available to other players. I'm not sure about the spacial aspect to the game, I just can't figure out how to play it strategically.

30-45m, 2-4 players. < 5 plays.

Do not play if you are tired or lack brain power. This game is not for those who suffer from AP. You have to really think about what you are doing in this game. I like it as these games really want me to go back and do better.

I think it has an interesting idea that is well done. However, unless you are a quick thinker like me, it can drag at others may take 2-3 minutes to decide what to do.

Arboretum is a number and suits game that's not a trick-taker. This has many similar qualities to Lost Cities which I also enjoyed. The main difference is the spatial aspect that's involved in Arboretum and the choices of what to hold and play may have a little more angst based on how paths are scored at the end. If it has more going on than Lost Cities, it should be better right? Not necessarily. I don't know which player count I would like the best. At 2, you can focus completely on foiling your opponents plans, but it's easier to read what cards your opponent has and what you should do. I think I would like the uncertainty of more players, however, more players means two people can be screwing your plans without even knowing it. It's probably best with 3. Overall, I thought it was gorgeous, but only decent. Keltis: Neue Wege, Neue Ziele is a better choice for spatial Lost Cities in my opinion.

RATING: 7
I only played this once, and it seemed like a fun logic problem. The rules seem a little complex for to length of the game, which is why I have reservations about pushing the score up quite yet, but definitely fun. And I won, so it's clearly a very good measure of skill and intelligence. Oh - the artwork is beautiful too.

RATING: 6
Very clever game where you must keep track of which cards have been, and yet to be played. A definate push-your-luck element as you bet upon the success of the color trees you decide to collect. Laying out the tree's path can be maddening and may turn some people off. Gorgeous artwork and packaging.

Will not appeal to all, but a classy gem for folks who like "deck of cards" games.

This game is legendary in the board gaming community for a reason. We have yet to introduce this to someone who doesn't like it.

I really like this one. The scoring mechanic is very novel with you scoring for trees placed infront of you ...but only if you hold a majority of that colour in your hand at game end, thus you cannot be too greedy with those you place to score... as someone may pip you to the post with more of that set in hand at the end of the game thus denying you the ability to score that colour!

Another "Lost Cities"-style game, and the spatial aspect of this one, along with the beautiful art, really made it stand-out to me. Having said that, I'm not the target for these types of games: suits of numbered cards using the draw-collect-discard design ethos. 

Bought it to play with Natalie, but even she thought it was too dry. She prefers Morels; I would prefer to play a different style of game entirely.

This is almost Schotten-Totten 2.0. It gives the same feel but adds a lot of complexity. The production is utterly gorgeous and I love playing the game. Each card you play is tense and every decision is agonizing.

Unfortunately the game has a bit of a learning curve. The scoring is very unintuitive and I struggle to teach it to other players. This is a real shame as it means I will hardly ever play it and thus won't be as high in my rating as it should deserve.

Arboretum is somewhat like an advanced version of Keltis that adds spatial considerations and some scoring restrictions into the mix. The "bidding" for the final scoring is a nice touch but I'm not sure that many of the decisions you take along the path aren't simply overridden by lucky card draws. In the end, Arboretum looks like a gentle walk through the park, can be played like being a gang of muggers in said park, and still qualifies as a family picnic.

Reine Kartenspiele haben es bei mir schwer. Mir fehlt schlicht und einfach das geliebte Spielbrett. Bei ARBORETUM fehlt gar nichts, weil das Brett im Kopf entsteht. Das Brett ist hier ein botanischer Garten, indem der Baum für sich selbst steht in erhabener Pracht. Und wir sitzen auf einer Bank und schauen ihm dabei zu. In ARBORETUM erfährt der Himmelsakrobat seine respektvolle, stille Würdigung - in der Spielidee und einem zartenschönem Pinselstrich. Die Spielkarte ist ein komplettes Kunstwerk aus Vorderseite und Rückseite. Der geschwungene Schriftzug unter den Eichen, Weiden und Magnolien ist eine poetisches Namensschild und rückt die Lunge des Lebens wieder ins Bewusstsein, würdevoll verstaut in der unübertreffbaren Schachtel. ARBORETUM gelingt es im blossen Anblick zu verweilen. Und wenn es endlich eines "Absackers" bedurft hätte, der dieser schrecklichen Begrifflichkeit ein Ende setzt, dann tut ARBORETUM genau dies. Dezent, klug, gepflegt, bescheiden. Kein Kaiser. Kein König. Kein Glamour. Einfach nur Bäume in einem einfach nur Kartenspiel. Das muss man erst einmal hinkriegen in diesen schrillen, quietschenden Zeiten.

RATING: 9
PROS:
-Si juegas mal un turno, hay altas probabilidades de que pierdas bastantes puntos
-El sistema de puntuación permite combinar las cartas de muchas formas distintas
-Tienes que atender a varios caminos simultáneamente eligiendo colores para jugar al mismo tiempo que te quedas en tu limitada mano con cartas de ese color para poder puntuarlo
-La caja ocupa muy poco espacio
-El arte es alucinante
-Incluye hojas donde anotar las puntuaciones

CONTRAS:
-Los jugadores con más experiencia ganarán a los demás
-El sistema de puntuación puede ser complicado de entender en la primera partida y esto condicionará el juego
-El análisis-parálisis puede ser elevado
-El despliegue en mesa puede ocupar finalmente más de lo previsto, por lo que es necesario jugarlo en mesas grandes si el número de jugadores es mayor de 2

I'll start off by saying - maybe the most gorgeous art I've ever seen? Hot damn, what good art! (Even if the only art is different trees.) The gameplay is a bit screwy, but really quite interesting. Can't think of another card game that plays like it. Real neat idea of scoring played sets, but only if you have cards from the same suit in your hand with a higher value than those in your opponent's hand. Really super neat idea. The path-building is interesting as well, though things felt a little opaque by the end. And very confrontational (but maybe that's just a result of a 2-player game?) Couldn't imagine tracking everybody's shit in a 4-player game. Maybe 2 or 3 is best? Anyway- first play and I'd say this is a distinctive game. Maybe not one that I'd rush to get but interesting enough to capture my attention almost immediately.

Lost cities multiplayer with a unique theme that I enjoy.

The tension in this game is amazing. Usually half way through, you will get to a point where you don't want to  discard anything because you are trying to deny opponents or you need it to score.

Deciding which sets you will go for, when to play them out, when to draw from the deck to try and hit cards or when to slow play from grabbing from discard. So many decisions to be made, an awesome brain burn feeling

Arboretum is a challenging game to understand at first, but after a few games everything makes sense & the unique gameplay allows for exploration & creative play. Unfortunately, in my experience, since it takes multiple games to fully grasp, new players lose by large margins & are turned off by their first game -- they lose so bad they don't want to play again. I think the idea that players can spend the whole game building clever paths, but then can be blocked from scoring some of them at the end, makes new players feel cheated. I understand this feeling, but I think that aspect is the core of the strategy in the game & advanced players find this part of the game exciting. Overall I really like this game for its difficult choices, quick gameplay, & beautiful art. I just wish I could get more people into this game for some real competition.

Really simple set collection/set dominance card game. It plays fast and is super easy to learn and teach!

Arboretum is a top-tier set collection card game with a heavy rummy influence. Collect cards in sets and runs with bonuses from focusing on a single suit and "book ending" runs with highs and lows. On top of this, runs are determined by a spacial tile placement element that is unique to this style of game, and you can only score if you hold the most cards back in that suit. Arboretum is a winner, scales well, and is one of the best of the set collection card game genre.

The first thing one might notice about Arboretum, before even playing, is just how beautiful the playing cards are. This game is an interesting stock-esque Lost Cities type game in which the stock shares are in your hand and the valuation is played to the table (with some fun spatial stuff going on). There is a lot of subtle stuff going on (e.g., drawing from discard helps stretch the game out if you might benefit from that; playing out a whole suit means you don't have to hold ANY of the cards in hand), but I imagine that its the subtleties that make the game a gem rather being a big flash (I might prefer unassuming board games over unassuming card games).

Due to the subtlety of the game (rather than the flash-bang school of design we see a lot of today), I think that this rating will hold well over time, if not increase.

Arboretum is lovely little hand management/set collection/tableau building game, with a reasonably thematic goal of creating tree-lined walks in one's garden.

There is only so much control over the draw, but the public discard piles provide much anguish over what to leave for other players to scoop up.

Add the necessity of holding the high suit card to score a walk, and it can become very calculating indeed.

Because the deck is reduced for lower counts, game time scales nicely, and it doesn't out stay it's welcome.

Great new card game!

Arboretum is an elegant brain burner. It has very simple rules and a lot of depth. Every turn is a tough decision, playing a tree is hard but discarding one is harder, it's even hard to remove trees in games with less than 4 players because the artwork is just beautiful, I always want to play with all of them. It's one of the best card games I've ever played.

RATING: 8
Arboretum is one of my favorite card games. After about 30 games, I still haven't found a coherent strategy. I have seen certain players win consistently though, so I assume there is skill involved. The mechanics and scoring are a bit unintuitive at first, and it took some experience to really consider this game to be light considering how excruciating some of the decisions can be. Another plus is that mostly anyone can learn it.

I find it most interesting at the 3-player count. Four is a bit chaotic, and two sometimes (not always) has a bit too much parity.

It has a similar mechanic to Lost Cities in the drawing of cards (2), discard and play one card (-2) so your hand will always remain at the same size. To score for your color, you'll need to keep some of those cards in your hand--enough to have highest sum; but to get more points, you'll need to play cards of that color too in your tableau.

Managing your hand and the discards is like Lost Cities even though the card play and scoring is different (and if anything more complicated!).

So much strategy in just a simple (but beautiful) deck of cards.  The pain is real when deciding what to discard.  Best with 2-3 players.  Easy to explain rules and 20-30 minutes playtime are just bonuses.

The second great filler surprise from 2016. I love the design, the tightness and that special design. Mostly played with 2 players. Loses a bit of it's attraction with more players because it gets more luck dependent.

First card game I've played where every single card and what you do with it matters.  You have to pay attention to discards, cards you hold in your hand at game end and the way you lay your cards down.  This is one of those games you can very quickly teach (5 mins) but has a ton of strategy to it.  Lots of ways to win.  Tons of guessing what your opponents have and what they are going to do.  Really fun game.  Card art is great also.  I like trees!

I'm intrigued after one 2-player game.
I'm open to try the game with more players to see how it unfolds.  Because a 2-player game was as intriguing as strange,

Oddly (and sadly) the spacing aspect seems irrelevant (irrespective of no. of players).

Arboretum's mechanics have much in common with the two-player classic Lost Cities. Like that game, this one is full of agonizing decisions where players must risk helping opponents in order to help themselves. The difference here is a step-up in complexity that allows for better information hiding and cleverer plays. Add in a light but appropriate theme and the ability to support four players and one has a potential Lost Cities replacement.

Initial rating: 6.0 (October 2016)

I wasn’t expecting much from Arboretum, but it pleasantly surprised me.

Arboretum´s art is AMAZING and it really adds to the game. You could play with only numbered cards but it wouldn’t be the same. Many friends bought the game based only on the art.

The rules are easy to teach, you can do it under 5 minutes. Playtime is around 45 minutes.

For me, the game is reminiscent of Lost Cities, but now with an spatial element added to the mix, this make me think that perhaps the game is best as a two player game, but I enjoyed my four player game. I need more plays to verify this point. 

I’m not sure if the game has a high replay value, it seems to me that, every game is rather similar than the one before, but I need more plays to verify this point as well.

The decisions needed to play the game aren’t hard, but aren’t obvious either. Having to choose which card to play and which to discard is a painful decision and I really liked it. Managing your hand is the most important thing. Even if you have the best paths in the game, you still need to remain with enough cards of the same color in your hand to score the path, that is, you need to balance how many points to score vs how many cards of the same color you leave in your hand to score it (or to deny your opponents) in the first place . This mechanism is my favorite part of the game.

The luck factor can be high, but as it plays relatively fast, I don’t mind much.
 
Bottom line, Arboretum is a good family level game that has meaningful decisions in a short time frame. I sold my copy of the game because the game is too light for my current tastes and I’m looking to reduce my game collection, but I’m happy to play it again if requested. Most friends liked it more than me.

Super-simple ruleset, but very tricksy game to play. That the only person to score a suit is the person who has kept the highest value of cards of that suit in his/her hand is a small work of genius and the thing that raises the game above the common throng. The art's pretty cool too.

Great little card game with a beautiful production. Really enjoy looking at all the trees as you build them out in front of you. Can be a bit of brain burner since you have to make the choice of what to keep in your hand and what to play on the table. The game can also be a little mean due to the "take that" aspect of holding cards to keep others from scoring. Still, I really enjoy this one.

This is a really interesting card game that feels like a tile laying, tableau builder. The scoring is a little bit complicated, but not too difficult, at least in my opinion.

Was disappointed with this title after the positive things I had heard. It's a beautiful game, to be sure. It is an abstract speculative game of building paths in a tableau without really knowing how much they will be worth or if you will even be able to score them. Every play is certainly a gamble, and I can see why that would appeal.

However, I am not finding the puzzle and speculation aspects to gel all that well with me. I enjoy speculation games and puzzle games, but I'm finding that tying speculation to my puzzles makes them LESS satisfying...

Have upgraded the rating with more plays.  Very "thinky" game.  Draw two cards, play one, discard one.  Any card you discard may help your opponent.  This is "Lost Cities" times 10.

Arboretum 是款很有味道的卡牌遊戲，玩家放置卡片排列植物園的觀賞路線，要以數字升序排列樹木的路徑，遊戲結束才有資格計分，玩家每回合的動作很簡單，抽兩張卡，放置一張，棄掉一張，抽卡可以抽中央牌堆，也可以拿別人的棄牌堆頂，時時需要觀察對手，以及其他玩家的棄牌動向以及植物園的布置，我覺得這遊戲實在有趣又糾結，最近常常玩，美術也令人喜愛~~

Love the artwork and the tension of every single turn! Feel like it can be a little too restrictive sometimes, especially if someone just happens to draw a high card you need. Nevertheless, still a fantastic game that delivers tension throughout and a feeling of accomplishment at its finish.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Players have a hand of 7 cards. On a turn, a player draws two cards, either from the draw pile or from the discard piles. One card is played to his tableau, another is put on his discard pile, leaving him always with 7 cards. At game end, paths through a player’s arboretum can potentially be scored depending on this player having the highest sum of cards of the respective tree type (card color) in his hand.

Beautiful artwork constitutes a big part of the appeal of Arboretum. Gameplay itself is relaxed with the exception of the one central discard decision which is similar to the one in Lost Cities. With four players, influence is (too) limited with the 25% chance to get a specific card. Scoring one more of the ten different trees can be decisive. One or two of those could be attributed without much competition while some bad luck could lead to a player being contested on all of their paths. Probably better with two players.

This is one killer little cardgame, with lots of tense decisions revolving around committing cards to your arboretum and holding cards to prevent your opponents from getting their grubbies on them.  The depth is not immediately apparent and I've found multiple plays to be really rewarding.  Play time is about 15-20 minutes, which technically puts this into filler territory, but if so this is one of the most satisfying fillers I've ever played.

This game has a lot of thinking for a card game.  Beautiful cards, lots of decisions to make and depth for a filler card game.  We really enjoyed it but it can cause some AP with players and some confusion when scoring.  Aaargh! - So much angst because you don't want to get rid of anything in your hand yet you're limited as to what you can keep.  You want to hang on to cards to add to your tableau, but at the same time you can keep cards to prevent others from scoring their cards.  A challenging little game.

[PNP] Don't get deceived by the look of this game. It is mean as hell. You can see peoples soul crashing when you hold the cards that they desperately need to score and you feel both good and bad at the same time. I have never felt like this in a board game before. You kinda enjoy what you did but cannot refrain yourself from pitying them also. At least the game is kinda quick but at every single turn your decisions can mean life and death to you. So tense...

Beautiful set collection game that plays like a more complicated Lost Cities. Love the different types of scoring rules and I think that it scales well above 2, unlike Lost Cities' ability to.

For someone who isn't very familiar with tree identification, the trees themselves are not especially distinctive.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Only play thus far was two player and I really thought it was quite interesting and a bit of a head scratcher at times. Between considering what to discard to avoid helping an opponent, how do I spatially construct my arboretum to potentially grant the most point value, and can I keep enough value in my hand to claim the right to score that color I've been displaying in my arboretum your head will be smoking! I really enjoyed the graphics on the cards as well and the quality of the cards feel top notch. Looking forward to trying with more than 2 players. I think it oculd look different with more players (not necessarily better or worse, just different) as in a two player game one may be able to straight up deny someone points and it is a good play whereas in a 3-4 player game, one might be better off just playing for self and hoping the next player stops the other players...

Beautiful artwork of 10 different species of trees. Decisions that need to be made in this game are definitely stressful. Inevitably, you need to discard a number of cards that other players want. It's just a matter of limiting the value of those cards via timing of discard. And you will also need to hang on to cards that they want to prevent them from scoring at least one type of tree. This game requires a lot of both offense and defensive strategy if you want to win.

Thematisch baut man ein Arboretum auf... Spieltechnisch legt man einfach Karten aus seiner Hand in die eigene Auslage. Höhrt sich unspannend an? Ist es aber!!! Gewertet wird, sobald der Stapel durchgespielt ist. Von jeder Farbe (6 verschiedene) gibt es die Zahlen 1-8. Man versucht Reihen zu legen von 1 bis 8 von aneinander angrenzen Karten. Die werden am Ende aber nur gewertet, wenn ich in meiner Hand noch einen höheren Zahlenwert vorweisen kann, als meine Gegner.
Man steckt ständig im Dilemma: Ich will die Karte ausspielen, weil sie mir Punkte in der Reihe bringt, dann hat meine Gegner aber vermutlich mehr Punkte auf der Hand in der Farbe und nehmen mir so meine Wertung komplett weg! Ausserdem will ich die Karte nicht ausspielen, da ich sie brauche um meinem Gegner die Wertung kaputt zu machen... Eine Karte muss ich auch noch auf den Ablagestapel werfen, auf die der Gegner auch wieder Zugriff hat!!!!
Für mich ein echt tolles Spiel. Hätte ich nicht gedacht. (Und die Bäumchen sind auch noch schön ;))

Rather enjoyed this game, though it becomes fairly AP-prone right from the first turn. Doesn't really matter as a 2p game, but I would probably hate more than 2p. Not sure how much depth there is, but given my limited 2p collection, it's small and works.

RATING: 5
A neat little hand management/"tile" placement card game. The spatial aspect and the scoring only if you have the highest card of that color at the end of the game makes this game pack a decent punch despite its small size. However, the scoring and how paths work are really hard to explain; I would recommend people just reading the very short rule book. The small and large numbered cards of each color seem to be stronger than the middle numbered ones unless you're lucky to get a lot of cards of one color, as most of the time you can just lay down one row of 3 to 6's and have all your other colors branch off from it. Drawing from the deck rather than discard makes the game end in fewer turns, so there is some tempo strategy in that if it looks like your opponent is trying to work up to a long pathway. I fear with more plays some dominant strategies might evolve, but I think it'll be worth the money beforehand. Need more plays in the higher player counts, but it seems like 2 players is the worse number to play with.

EDIT: I've come to dislike this game more because it relies heavily on memory and for players to be of equal skill level to play optimally, that it doesn't feel like I'm altering my strategy enough from game to game, and that discard pile sniping can really limit your options.

I've only played this once, but I really enjoyed it.  It was very easy to learn the rules. But you can't snooze during this game. There is a lot to think about and is far more aggressive than its pacifying artwork might suggest. Oh, and I adore the artwork.

Arboretum is in the line of absolutely gorgeous small box games that Zman has put out. And it's one of only three games that I've ever tied even after the tiebreakers (though we declined to go plant an actual tree and see which was the biggest in 5 years). I love the balance between building out a lot of points and making sure that you can actually score your color that happens. Very solid game overall.

Super neat little card game that Matt and Quinns. It's lovely and a thinker, and tidy and would fit in my game bag. You draw and play cards from a draw and discard piles like in Rummy, but doing so to make a grid of trees that score based on the path you can take.

The artwork is gorgeous, but I just do not enjoy how the scoring works. Only the person with the trump card still in their hand gets to score that tree, and the lowest card trumps the highest card but still gets trumped by everything else... I don't mind mental statistics but I spend way too much time second-guessing everything. Not fun.

Different than the usual card games, perhaps more introspective.  Only one play, so it is too early to pass judgment, but it seemed that players would spend more time with themselves and figuring out their own "arboretum," (tableau), unlike card games based on trick taking that have fast moving hands and dynamic lead taking.  Great components (cards textile quality and graphics on the cards).  Would not choose it over other, more dynamic and interactive card games.

Arboretum is both relaxing and tense depending on with whom you play and your attitude. When I usually play with my wife it becomes very much a two player solitaire game and almost a cooperative. However, from time to time she's very much in a cutthroat mood so we're out to spoil each other's tableau. It's very adaptive that way.

This is probably, definitely, probably my favourite card game. If I had to keep only one it would be this one ... I think! But this play I did not enjoy that much. Why ... well it just took ages. Every turn seemed to take an eon and the length of the game dragged. No fault of the game, but if you are going to play with an AP prone player do not pick this as a quick, thinky, meaty card game. It is a quick, thinky, meaty card game and probably the best one out there, but for me, like any game, if it goes on to long it becomes unenjoyable. 

Maybe I am just getting increasingly impatient. I just generally would rather play a game twice in an allotted time and learn from my mistakes than play it once with an AP player. 

But this was a high scoring game, and as I play it more I am beginning to appreciate the different levels of play. Feinting with discards, and mining discards to prolong play. In the whole game I think I only took from the main draw pile twice!

If you haven't tried this before and you love card games give it a go. If you are a quick player come around and I'll give you a game! 

Previous thoughts;
One of my favourite card games. It can sometimes become like the terra mystica of card games as your brain crunches through the permutations of whose got what, and what's in the discard piles, can you dig down to them and what's still in the draw deck .... and this is all whilst you are deciding which card to discard, you then have to go through it all again in choosing which card to play and then all again in choosing where to play it! Don't let that put you off. This is a fantastic quick meaty card game that twisted my mind and left it with more knots than a snakes wedding.

Simply an excellent game, with excellent artwork and excellent production quality. One of my favourite card games.

(12/16) 9. I'm more liberal than most with my "10" ratings, but I suspect this might be a 10 for me.  This is like Biblios, one of my favorite games of all time already, on steroids.  I described it like a knife fight in a phone booth where everyone is holding their weapon by the blade.  The only issue I might have is that it's TOO tight.  NO choice seems like the right one.  And yet, as I've said, I think I love it.

(9/17) Raise to 10.  Yup, my early inclination was right.  I LOVE this game.  It is BRUTAL. Every decision is agonizing.  Biblios on steroids.  My #2 favorite game of all time.

RATING: 7
Really unique theme and mechanics, it's quite refreshing. I'd say it's a more complex version of Lost Cities. But the pattern in which you lay out your cards is multidirectional, which is creative. The tension in this game isn't so much within the timing of the Give & Take of each particular card, like in lost cities. in Arboretum the tension comes from knowing the balance between building a high scoring row on the table, and having enough cards left in your hand to win the right to score that particular row.

A truly beautiful game with a simple but infuriating mechanic. A ponderous stroll through your beautifully constructed garden should give you a sense of peace, of place. Instead you will be agonizing over ever detail, kicking yourself over and over again at wasted opportunity, and wondering at every step whether furthering your own plan is more important than hindering your fellow arborists'. I love this game. It's super-duper pretty on the surface but if you look beyond the spectacular art, man, does it get ugly. 

Two player isn't great but it plays significantly better with three or four. There is a bit of luck involved so sometimes your best laid plans will all come to nothing which can be frustrating. That being said, this is a rewarding puzzle that you'll want to play again and again. Maybe with something in-between, but yeah. Good. (Oh yeah did I mention this has the coolest tie break mechanic I've ever seen? What is it? well, you'd better play to find out).

It's a bit like a souped-up 2D [thing=50]Lost Cities[/thing] with some [thing=122298]Morels[/thing] DNA, i.e. the general concept builds on Lost Cities and makes the card play a lot more interesting, and the decisions feel as agonizing as in Morels.  It completely replaces Lost Cities for us.  This is one I can see us playing for a long time due to its short playtime packed with meaningful decisions and suspense due to unknown end game scoring.

Arboretum – Rummy-like tableau building card game where players build charming sequences of tree species and compete to earn the right to score each tree species.  The principal decisions hang between deciding what trees to place on the table versus retaining high value cards in hand. Interactions are mostly through deciding what to discard.  All in all, this is a slow and thoughtful game of careful hand and risk management. But the scoring intricacies makes Arboretum more brain-burning than appearances would suggest, and I’m not entirely sure it is justified. Lovely production values!

I love that there are multiple layers of game and strategy here... the somewhat simple tableau-combo scoring aspect, the trickier game of knowing what to discard when, the mind game of what your opponent is keeping back (that slowly reveals itself as the game goes on), and even the choice of which pile to draw from (go with the pretty good card you know, or risk digging for the perfect card, but bringing about the end faster).

EVERYTHING matters, and it's great.  Plays in 15 minutes with 2.  Beautiful cards.  

AWESOME.

The artwork does this game a great service, as it livens up what is a calculating and somewhat dry affair. To me I saw parallels to Biblios and The King is Dead (King of Siam), in how the gamespace starts wide open, then narrows as the game progresses (since you are more locked into a strategy). It might be that 3 or 4 players will open it up a bit more since your information is less certain - however I'm worried if it comes at the cost of player agency - still I like it and want to try it more, doesn't take long after all!

A fine game!

Lost Cities like game but now you take cards first before laying down a card. The scoring system is a little bit more complicated. You need to keep good cards in your hand to be able to score trees at all... need to play more to get better

I wanted to like this game, but I just can't. The whole "sorry, your big chain scores zero because I decided to hang onto this one card" thing just doesn't sit well with me. I have no issue in general with games that allow players to block other players, but here it is taken to a ridiculous extreme and feels petty and capricious.

Traded.

RATING: 8.4
A demanding abstract game that requires a very technical and calculating mindset. For the first half of the game, you need to be perceptive & flexible:  seeing what other players are doing & how your hand is shaping up.  During the second half of the game, you need to execute your strategy with mathematical precision.   For a fully-abstract card game that plays in 30 - 45 minutes, it is amazingly deep and engaging.

Although the game has nothing to do with arboretums (and the mechanisms are kinda hard to wrap around, for such a small gamebox), it works neat.

The terrible decision of how to build your hand is what makes Arboretum work so well. Keeping cards to assist your endgame scoring (or hinder someone else's) is important, but building your garden is important too. Always makes you feel like you want a hand size twice as large.

Puntos fuertes: Las cartas y las ilustraciones son bonitas, la caja también es llamativa por el dibujo estilo retro y la simplicidad. El manual es pequeño, impreso es mucha calidad. La mecánica es sencilla. Poco despliegue aunque requiere espacio. Gran detalle las hojas de puntuación.

Puntos débiles: El manual no es claro, podría estar un poco mejor explicado. Surgen dudas con algunas reglas de puntuación. Un poco caro para solo ser un mazo de cartas, pero podemos compensarlo por la calidad. 

Conclusión: Buen juego. Más profundo de lo que parece a simple vista. Nos recuerda al Fungi, aunque con menos despliegue. La mecánica una vez jugado es fácil aunque la primera partida a la hora de puntuar puede llevarte a confusión. Aún siendo un juego de formar escaleras con las cartas guarda cierta complejidad al tener que guardar cartas del mismo palo para poder llegar a puntuarlas. Definitivamente, un juego que es mucho mas de lo que aparenta. Buena compra!

RATING: 6.5
Beautiful cards, simple play--the scoring is more complex than the game itself, and is really the meat of things. Lots of interesting decisions to make and it's nicely competitive rather than a game of multiplayer solitaire. Big table-hog inevitably. I have not yet found a way to teach this to people that doesn't leave them totally baffled during the first playthrough, though :( .. 

Also, two gripes about the draw/discard mechanism:

1) while I like games where the endgame trigger is flexible, this game carries it to a ridiculous point: if people start digging through the discard piles rather than the draw pile this game will take AGES to end.

2) similar point: I don't like it when games regularly make you take time-wasting actions. There are a surprising number of occasions where you'll pick up a face-up card and deliberately discard THE SAME CARD.

In short: there's a good game in here but even though the rules aren't super complex there's something clunky about its mechanics.

Felt good, especially if/when the playtime goes down as people learn to play. Based only on one play, I can't say how much it's based on tactics/strategy and how much on luck. I somehow think the luck factor is not as big as it seems at first.

I like the theme/the art as such, but some of the colours/trees are a bit samey visually, which doesn't help mechanically. Same goes for the font of the trees.

The end game scoring mechanism can be disheartening to some players at first. It was for me. But once you understand how that works, what seemed like an odd subtlety becomes a massive element to keep in mind at all times and plan your strategy around.

What an awful game. Has all the makings of a great filler, but the scoring kills it for me. Laying out trees in different ways is a neat idea, but the fact that what you keep in your hand is what scores, and the fact that anyone else having more colors of cards than you completely prevents you from scoring ruins the entire experience. This is a game I could see a group playing over and over again in a similar way as Bridge or Tichu, even though it isn't the same kind of game. It does seem to reward those who want to sink their teeth into this design with the same play group, however. If that isn't you, then avoid this game.

Essayé une fois à 3 joueurs - Vraiment un jeu intéressant de gestion de main - On doit construire son arboretum et faire des points grâce à des sentiers. On veut avoir le plus de cartes de la même couleur, mais on doit aussi en garder dans la main pour avoir la possibilité de marquer ce sentier. On veut commencer par des 1, mais il faut faire attention aux cartes qu'on défausse pour ne pas trop aider les autres joueurs, garder d'autres couleurs fortes pour pas que les adversaires marquent des points. Et surtout optimiser son placement de cartes pour fait plein de sentier. Je pense qu'il est plus payant de faire plusieurs petits sentiers que de focuser sur une ou 2 couleurs.

[b]Accessibility: 4/5[/b]: The game is quick and simple, but the rules can be a bit of a problem to teach. 80% of the rules are scoring rules, which can be boring to teach and to learn. This causes a common problem that everyone's first play of this game will result in some rule being forgotten or broken. Because of the game's length, most people won't reject the game on length alone.

The game can be played by color blind people, but I can imagine it would not be a fun experience for them. The design of the trees are unique, but a color blind player would probably have a much longer time observing their trees as opposed to other players who can see their colored paths through their peripheral. I'm not docking points for this, because it's really not possible to be inclusive of everyone, but it's something I thought was worthy of mentioning in case someone colorblind, or something with a colorblind game partner, was thinking about getting this game.

[b]Emotion: 5/5[/b] This may be an odd thing to grade a game on, but this game is probably one of the most emotional tense games I've ever played. You always want to hold on to more cards in this game, but are constantly forced to play one and discard one once you've drawn two. Sometimes, you want to hold every single card in your hand plus pick the ones in the discard piles up. It becomes very difficult to figure out what to do. All the while, your opponent feels the same exact way, and you're both doing everything in your power to screw the other opponent(s) as hard as you can while still benefiting yourself. This balance is ingenious, and calls for one of the most tense and cut throat experiences that card games have to offer.

[b]Theme: 4/5 [/b] I've gotta give the game credit where it's due. The theme doesn't shine through every aspect of the game's fiber, but for a game as abstract as this one is, it does what it can to display some kind of theme of designing an Arboretum. I almost feel like I'm setting up the groundwork for an Arboretum, but will have to wait for decades before my trees grow. Also, I think the idea of trees is a cool theme. This and Photosynthesis are probably what most people will think of when the idea of tree themed tabletop games are brought up, but it's a very different theme than what we're used to seeing. I think that alone almost gives it a perfect rating.

[b]Artwork: 5/5 [/b]: This isn't the most beautiful artwork to ever grace the scene, but I think it does exactly what it sets out to do. The tree designs are all unique and distinctive. The cursive font isn't very difficult to read at all, the box art itself is nice. The entire game almost seems to take a minimalist stand point on the art, with the white backgrounds that contrast really well with the colored trees, down to the box which is literally just two colors, gold and green. It does so much with so little. So while this game won't match up to games that a huge team of artists spent weeks to months painstakingly making, I think this one still deserves a perfect score because it found a great balance of beauty and visual necessity.

Woah.  I wasn't ready for this.  What would have been an interesting card 'tile laying' game by itself completely knocks you out with a novel scoring mechanism; you only score if you also have the point majority for that suit held in your hand at game end.  You can't be too greedy in this one - and it's great fun preventing an opponent who has a nice layout from scoring.  Tough decisions throughout.  Egads!  I don't have a discard!  

It's great.

Arboretum turned out the be far more complex than its simple components made it look and yet once I understood the rules I knew the game wasn't for me.

I was just bored with Arboretum. After the 2nd round of play I basically knew which trees I would be pursuing for the rest of the game. Card placement was an easy affair, and what to draw and discard seemed so obvious that I was on auto-pilot until scoring, which was overly convoluted. What surprised me most was how 2 of my opponents seemed to sweat every discard, while I was just gliding along.

Anyway, the cards are good quality and the artwork is nice, but Arboretum is no more interesting than many traditional card games.

wallops with tough choices. can be infuriating, in the middle for the delay you are causing everyone because AP, and at the end because your opponents kept just enough of your cards to drop your score to 0.

Bellissima scoperta. Si tratta di un filler, un giochino di carte che però si trasforma presto in un gioco strategico e molto di calcolo. Certo può esser giocato gradevolmente anche in maniera leggera ma si presta anche a partite tese. Potrebbe rischiare un po' da paralisi d'analisi se al tavolo ci si ferma troppo ed infine non è assente una buona dose di fortuna ma nel complesso. Per un giochino semplice da 20' l'esperienza rimane soddisfacente. Valore aggiunto gli splendidi disegni degli alberi colorati che a me piacciono moltissimo.

[b]Arboretum[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]Arboretum has quite possibly become my favorite card game. It takes the sequential number play of Lost Cities and adds a free form spacial aspect to the game; you are placing trees in your Arboretum with paths branching off in many directions. You also have to manage your hand since you need the highest value of each tree you want to score in your hand at the end of the game. This combination of these mechanics causes difficult decisions to be made every turn. Add to that the amazing artwork by Philippe Guérin and Chris Quilliams and you end up with a brilliant game. Thankfully Arboretum is enjoyed by everyone in my house which means it will continue to see a lot of play time. I can't recommend this game highly enough![/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Amazing artwork, I would love to get prints of some of these images.
- Awesome 2p experience, great couples game to play at a cafe or pub.
- This is one of those chill games for us, you can't help but feel peaceful looking your tableau of cards.
- I enjoy the added complexity in how you can sequence different card types as you build your arboretum. (It reminds me of Lost Cities and Musee but the placement of cards is not as constrained.)

My buddy Mat taught this to me and I immediately went out and got a copy. I am quite happy that my wife enjoyed it as well, this will be in our rotation of cafe/pub games.[/i]

This tiny card game packs a punch! I'm quite fond of games that limit their components but utilize them in every aspect of gameplay. Thematically, Arboretum is a card game about taking a nice, leisurely walk through a park; realistically, it is the most strategic card game I've played, aside from trick-taking. Players draw two cards and play one, discard the other. The rules for playing cards can be a bit complex but the decisions made on every turn are meaningful and require strategy and planning. The game can be quite a brain-burner. This game may seem like light filler but in my opinion, this is anything but! A real, heavy card game that is rewarding and beautiful to behold!

RATING: 6
Others at the table liked it more than I. It's initially a game of eyeballing what suits you can get high and low in (to get out to your tableau for scoring) and then get another high card (or two) in that suit to guarantee ownership of that suit to be able to score it. That's a lot of if's, and will be dependent on card draw. And of course, you may well end up picking the wrong suits to invest in, a la Lost Cities - it is a card game after all. So you need to be flexible, and perhaps settle for some sub-standard scoring. Along the way, you'll be trying not to discard cards that help other players too much. And you have no idea if others are hoarding a high card or two in your scoring suit (from their draw) just to hose your scoring. As a result, the game felt slow while you're trying to analyse the possibilities, but if a game's going to be slow, it needs to increase your control (over what may be perceived as the natural randomness of a card game) to overcome that slowness and reward your time investment. And I didn't feel it pulled that trick off well enough. Still, kudos for bringing something different to the table, and there are good decisions to make along the way.

This is a really interesting card game. Very original the way it works and the artwork too is beautiful. Neat find but definitely something for advanced players.

I love how the game forces you into either holding on to what your opponents really needs and letting go what you desperately need, or giving up a card to your opponent so that you can have that one card you need.

Tough game! Treats players like dirt! Awesome!!

I like Lost Cities quite a bit but if it wasn’t for my wife I wouldn’t be that eager to play it. I just get the feeling that there are no real choices to be made. I do appreciate though the quick easy flow and I would like to have a chance to play with more players.

So Arboretum seemed to be perfect for me: More players, still easy to explain and quick to play, remarkable artwork and components quality. The aspect I admired the most is that the designer found sth useful to do with the remaining cards on the players hands and took the gameplay to the next level. 

I’ll play it anytime, but…

(Wife's Point of View: She also found the components beautiful but she was really annoyed by the designer’s effort to shove in as many complexity as possible. She just found it too much for just a little filler. Won’t play again. For her the Lost Cities feeling is ruined).

Based on one play: Firstly the cards are really nice and even the instruction sheet is made of nice cardboard. The game is fun as well as you draw two cards, place one in play and discard one. The goal is to make a path in ascending order but to score that type of tree you must hold the largest value of cards of that tree at the end of the turn. So you balance holding cards and placing them as well as possibly blocking others from scoring. Will surely play again.

Arboretum is a smart and solidly designed game.  However, I ended up selling it because it was too stressful to play.  There are several clever ideas in the design: the scoring system, the spatial aspect of card placement, the idea of needing to retain cards in order to earn the right to score certain suits, the "powers" of the 8's and 1's, etc.  Unfortunately, I think one too many clever ideas were shoved into the design.  Hence, though I have played games that are much more complex, I think Arboretum is just a bit too complex for what it is.  Arboretum is in the same neighborhood as games like Lost Cities, Biblios, and Battle Line.  But in order to play Arboretum well, there is much more to keep track of and the game is much more prone to analysis paralysis.  I also think card counting is far more important here.  As I stated before, I think it is a well designed game.  The fun factor just wore off too quickly.

I love the tantalizing decisions in this game! The game play is so simple: Draw 2, Play 1, Discard 1... but it feels so HARD! I don't want to give up ANY of my cards!

The scoring quirk (1's beating 8's) is a bit weird to explain the first time, but it feels so necessary to creating some of the great moments of the game.

I've docked this .5 points since we've house-ruled it so that all players get equal turns (per a suggestion from Jon Gets Games).

Also, beautiful artwork.

I'm not sure I'm sold on the final scoring mechanism, which imposes ruthless gamesmanship on an otherwise quite elegant and attractive game. I'll need a few more plays before I'm convinced it doesn't serve as a bar to this functioning as a gateway game for spouses more interested in gardening than gaming. Be warned, btw, this game demands a surprisingly large amount of table space.

**EDIT**
We weren't playing properly. Raising score to 8. 
Retaining the greatest additive sum of cards in your hand allows you to score YOUR run, not runs made by other players as we had thought. Our misunderstanding was that we thought players could steal the runs of other players. When stealing runs is possible, the most efficient strategy is to churn the deck and retain high cards and win by scoring the opponent's runs. But stealing runs is not possible. Players can only score their own runs - hence the wonderfully difficult tradeoff of what to (keep, play, discard) with each turn. Battle-lines level tension with each move. 

REVIEW:
Essentially this is a very good trick taking game for two where the tricks are placed card by card on the table so you can see your opponent building runs. The hand size restriction, and the foreknowledge of both of the discard piles and the runs under construction by both players adds strategy. Do you build quickly? Do you hold back and fake your opponent with multiple beginnings of runs (some deceptive) until you have the critical cards to start a run that cannot be stopped?

As the game progresses, the information you have becomes more perfect. At some point you may know that only the 2 and 5 and 6 are not played, and you can see that the 6 is buried deep in the discard pile beyond retrieval, so you know that if you hold more than 2+5=7, that your run cannot be stopped. 

Or you can hold vital cards to the run of an opponent until they shift strategy to another suit and then start discarding those vital cards to tempt them to divide their efforts and not finish either run.

Or you can push the pace of the game by drawing from the center or delay the endgame by drawing from the discard pile.

Ideally you need more than two runs to win. Two good runs and one average run will usually result in victory, but achieving that while your opponent can see you doing it... aye, there's the rub.

From video review: Almost free-form tableau builder, reined in because you want to set up ascending values to score runs, ideally beginning with 1 and ending in 8 of the same tree type for bonus vps. This sprawling placement to optimize seems to use some mental energy which will all go to waste in the final reveal of majority holdings in the hand: players only score if the sum of type scored is highest, however, the wrinkle here is a held 1 card cancels a revealed 8 type. This creates the tension of playing/discarding or keeping, but for me this tension isn't worth the pain of building to then have it come to nothing.

This is a delightful, short card game where the general idea is this. On your turn, you draw 2, play 1 and discard 1. When you play cards, you play them into your tableau adjacent to a previously placed card. When you draw you can pull from the pile or from anyone's discards. At the end of the game you get points in this really interesting way. The first thing is you check to see who has the highest sum of numbers on cards of each color still left in their hands. Those players get to score those colors. Then the scoring is, the player has to draw a path among the cards they played, where the start and end of the math match the color they score for, AND the numbers on those cards are of increasing value. There are a few more fiddily rules, but it's an absolutely fascinating game.

Arboretum - GameNight! Se4 Ep14

RATING: 6
Arboretum seems like a gentle affair of building your own display of eye-catching trees. And then you take in the scoring rules and it becomes a knife-fight with agonising decisions about what to discard each turn. The on-the-table play feels like a two-dimensional Lost Cities, but the card-hoarding for majorities reminded me more of Biblios. I think it's probably at its best with 2p, so you don't have the problem of choosing which other player to target.

Have 'soloed' one game, but will hold back till I get a chance to play with real fellow players - seems like a game where you have to try it a few times before the game clicks, and I don't want to get ahead and have a better start than the other players.
Seems like a very, very nice game though!

One 4-player game. Interesting and well made hand-management card game. I think it could be better if some cards were deleted from the deck at the beginning, otherwise the players know that every 1 and 8 will be in play.

I had 5 8's in my hand but not the 1 I needed to score my best series, anti-climatic.

Great card game where there are literally many "paths" to victory.  You draw and discard cards as you do in rummy, but as each player has a discard pile - and you can choose from all of them - your choices are greatly multiplied.  You never want to discard, which makes for some stressful decisions.  Very fun!

RATING: 7
Don't let this game fool you with its cute artwork and happy theme--it is a deep thinky game that is quite brutal in terms of competition. 

But I like that from time to time and this is a really smart game. I played at 4 and liked it, but it felt just a little hard to really be in control and the winner didn't necessarily feel like who played the best. I suspect I would find this an outstanding 2 player game and a pretty good 3 player. At 4, I like it, but would probably play something else at that count. 

Still if one is looking for deep tough decision out of a relatively simple card game, this one is a good brain burner choice.

Pros:
* Beautiful cards

* Plays fine with 2

Cons:
* The rules are kind of mushy on the edge cases.

Neutral:
* For as pretty as the cards are, I wouldn't mind a pure abstract version with bright colors and Qwirkle-style symbols on the cards instead of trees.

Mmmmmm.....TREES!

Very nice card art distracts you from a deceptively clever game. Route Building/Set Collection/Hand Management are the main gaming mechanics on offer here.

The price is a definite bonus and the game length is also a plus.

You will need a large table to play this game and that is the only negative but it's more just a consequence.

Great art, price and game!

Arboretum is elegant.

It's fast, deeply tactical, vicious yet gentle, and gorgeous.   All this in nothing more than a deck of 80 cards.

2 players Feels like a chess match.  There is very little randomness, and there will be perfect information by the end of the game. Extremely thoughtful.

With 3 people, there is less exact information about what each person must have in their hand, and each player has slightly less control... but a savvy player can negotiate the game state effectively.   This is where Arboretum really shines.

4 players: Too much hidden information to effectively keep track of, and too little control to be able to execute on skill.  Fine for players who dislike deterministic games.

RATING: 7
Just awesome. Great tension, tough choices and the game reveals itself to more the more you play. Alot of subtle things here, discarding a card into your own discard just to "hold" it so you can pick it up again next turn. Constantly keeping track of what your opponent is doing so you can try and prevent giving them what they need. Holding onto cards you have no intention to build with just to keep the other player from scoring that color at the end. LOVE the scoring in this game, just all around great. I look forward to trying it with more than 2.

Jogo muito diferente do habitual, embora com consideráveis parecenças com "Exploradores", sendo até à data o parente mais próximo desse clássico de Knizia. É simples mas pode se tornar numa dor de cabeça, pois dá que pensar, podendo ser jogado na desportiva ou muito a sério, consoante os jogadores e o grupo em questão. A arte é agradável mas insólita, tanto nas cartas, como na caixa, como até na conceção do próprio manual, cujo pepel é surpreendente. Não lhe sinto grande tema, mas enquanto jogo: BESTIAL!

Clever card game. The idea of having to keep cards of the same collection in order to score the cards you placed in your arboretum is really nice. the agonizing choices between blocking the others and trying to score for yourself (you always feel you cannot keep enough cards) creates a nice tension. On a side note, I love the ultimate tie-breaker in the rules (tied players must plant a tree and in 5 years, the players with the highest tree wins).

A deliciously tight game of resource management and set collection. Much of the game is tactical, especially early-on in a play and more frequently with higher player counts, but there is still room for strategy once you have a firm understanding of your hand's available plays and the layout of other players' tableaus. There is plenty of opportunity for guile, as well, and you can easily mislead (or be misled) through feigning scoring paths. I quite enjoy this aspect of the game.

The knowledge that there is only one copy of each number per color contributes to formulation of a plan, and it is surprisingly easy to track cards played. There is still that element of chance, of course, but you have some element of control with what resources you keep in your hand. Excellent. Elegant. 

(+) Very simple rules overhead makes it an accessible game.
(+) Beautiful artwork. A pleasure to look at while wracking your brain.
(+) Consistently presents difficult decision-making opportunities which results in great tension and engaging gameplay. 

(-) It can be very, very, mean, and I have seen it sour more than one mood. Every player has the opportunity to be so, though.
(-) Scoring is on the obtuse side, though a methodical explanation can alleviate this issue.
(-) Requires a substantial amount of table space for just a deck of cards.

fantastic, beautiful cards. the game has a timeless feel like it might have come right out of the Hoyle book. each round draw two into your hand then play one card to your personal path and discard another to your personal discard. you're creating a solitaire path of same suits/trees (not unlike Kingdomino), but with the caveat that the hand of cards you have at the end of the game MUST contain some of the same suit/tree as the path you'd like to score. anyone can see your path and might hold cards you need (not unlike Lost Cities), rather than discard them to make room for their own needed trees. my favorite thing is that every path has a personal discard pile and other players can take the top card (again, not unlike Lost Cities), or you can risk briefly storing your own cards there. i dearly love games where you can get at your opponent's discard! a favorite game of ours! note that it can feel pretty mean when random dumb luck has given you all of your opponent's high cards (denying them the chance to score); although, let's be real: you're the one who pushed your luck and over committed. occasional mean-feels aside, the game doesn't otherwise allow "take-that" actions (no stealing, discards, skips) and even allows you to somewhat defend against high cards (a 1 in your hand nullifies the 8 of the same suit in some other jerk's hand). can be quite fun at the end seeing some lovely paths crumble and others miraculously survive!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Make sure you read the rules carefully! I was taught the game, and we played with 3 rules wrong (paths may have gaps, so 1-2-5 is a valid path. at game end you may play several cards to claim a color, not just 1. when you claim a color you may only score for your own best path in that color, not from your opponent). The game was really bad with these rules. I later read the rules, and played the game as it should be, and like it a lot. It is really tough to know what to do, big AP risk. Feels quite similar to Lost Cities (which I like a lot), but it is easier to make a decision in Lost Cities.

RATING: 7
We were so excited about this game after hearing glowing reviews from so many different people, but it really fell flat for us.  It has some interesting aspects, but it really seems like the meat of the game revolves around ruining your opponents by holding on to the cards that they need until the end of the game so that they don't get any points for their arboretum.  This just seems so spiteful, and so out of place in this game.  Here we are building beautiful, peaceful arboretums, and then in the end we are just trying to screw each other over to get the most points.  Very strange.  Not our kind of game. We ended up trading this and Jaipur for Adventure Land.

This is the perfect little thinky filler. Reminds me of Lost Cities, but turned up a few levels. There are just so many painful decisions here, especially with the discard. There were many times in this game where I make a decision about what to discard by setting aside all of my "absolutely can't discard" cards, only to set aside every card in my hand. This is great. The fact that this all comes in a deck of cards and under 30 minutes is great. I need to play more but I could see this becoming my favorite filler.

Thought-provoking for sure, but serious and a bit slow, so be prepared for a silent room with people with cold faces. This may dissipate somewhat with repeated plays and what's wrong with thinking now and then?

I find Lost Cities and Court of the Medici much better-themed for thinky card games. 

Worked well with three and likely would work well with two. Four would be too much chaos I think, but could be interesting to try as it would grow even more cutthroat perhaps.

A kung-fu fight in submersed bathtub - slow and seriously lacking in manoeuvring space, maybe I could just push my elbow up there... Bam! Okay, how to get it back from the other person's face? Ouch! Dang!

Certainly has Lost Cities in its lineage - set collection, hand management, the discards, the progression chain, the narrow confines. Feels different though, I mean except for being tense and rather dry. Firstly you build your board in 2D trying to fit as many scoring options "paths" in there. But main thing is the area majority, actually suits majority, which determines which players can actually score what they've built (one player per suit). And because it's a very open information game, except those cards you're hiding for yourself and everybody already deduced which they are, well it's pretty tense and thinky. And as in Lost Cities you have to juggle between helping yourself and not helping opponents (actually here you can screw them over, hehe). 

Interesting contraption for those who like their brainburn masochism in slow burn format. Actually the only complaint I have, quite a serious one, is that it's pretty dry. Which with brainburn means hard to find willing partners for it.

Egy érdekes, de nehéz játék az Arboretum. Fákat ültetünk a saját kertünkbe, amivel próbálunk utakat létrehozni, amelyek ugyanolyan típusú fánál kezdődnek, mint végződnek. Az 1-től 8-ig számozott kártyákat növekvő sorrendben kell ügyesen lehelyezni, amivel minél több utat tudunk a kertünkben létrehozni. Plusz pontot járnak az 1-es és 8-as lapért az úton, illetve a csak az azonos típusú fákból álló ösvényért. Már önmagában ez is elég lenne a játéknak, de belevették a kiszúrás faktort is. Ugyanis adott típusú fákból álló útjaink csak akkor számítanak ténylegesnek, ha a játék végén a kezünkben maradó fa lapok között is magasabb értékű van az adott fajtájú növényből, mint ellenfeleinknél. Tehát hiába építi ki valaki fantasztikusan a kertjét, rossz esetben akár 0 ponttal is végezhet a játékban. Emiatt biztosan sokaknak nem fog tetszeni a játék, de én látom benne a fantáziát. Minden körben két lapot húzunk és minden játékosnak van saját dobópaklija, amiről is húzhatunk a talon helyett. A játék az utolsó talonlap felhúzásakor ér véget, ami miatt nem mindenki játszik ugyanannyi számú kört, erre azért lehetett volna figyelni. Elég egyedi játék az Arboretum, számomra kicsit nehéz egy kártyajátékhoz képest, de ötletes.

Nice game! It has my favorite combo of elements: simple rules with tough choices that get harder as the game progresses.  I have some worry about the long term replay value, but right now, I'm just enjoying it. I'll certainly get my $20 worth before I tire of it. 

It scales very well between player counts. I might think it's best with two, but it's hard to say. With 2, it's a great head to head experience, and there is more control in each player's hands. With more players you have the aspect of more discard piles to choose from, and a greater variety of trees. 

To top it off, I love the presentation. Great art with a nice box.

1 play, 4er

What a clever, interesting, fun little tile-laying style of card game! The angst begins right from the first turn! Which cards should you draw? Do you draw from the card deck, fishing for the right cards but rushing the end, or drag the game out by taking from the discards? Which to discard? Who do you want to help by discarding their card? Which cards should you try to build on? And where do you play? Go for the long single-suit path, or the longer path(s) of multiple colors? And the scoring rules? Brilliant! Hold enough to be sure to score the suits you want, but hold back too much and you're losing points! And 1s canceling 8s ... awesome! 

Need to try this with 2- and 3- players ... rating could easily go up, I think!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Setup: Deal everyone a hand of 7 cards, and flip up 1 card/player (start of discard pile). 

Your turn: draw 2 cards from any pile (discard piles and/or draw deck). Then play a card to your tableau, orthogonally adjacent to a card in your display. Finally, discard a card to your discard pile. The game ends if the draw deck is empty.

Scoring: Players then compare cards left in hand, suit by suit. A held 1 cancels another player's held 8. Then, only the player with the highest sum of that suit scores the suit:
- create a path of cards starting and ending with that suit, with numbers in ascending order. 
- score 1VP/card in path, or 2VP/card if the path is 4+ in length and only has that suit
- bonus 1VP if path starts at 1
- bonus 2VP if path ends at 8
Most VP wins! Tiebreaker = more colors (suits) in your arboretum.

Having to remove two types of tree for the two-player game makes me sigh in frustration - all of the trees are just so serene and lovely! What monster would exclude any of them?

Play is otherwise pretty calm, perhaps too calm as I can easily slip away into over-analyzing my decisions. Actually, my tendency is to avoid any commitment to laying down cards and cutting off opportunities, but that's a me-problem, not a game-problem.

If I owned a FLGS, I'd sell little "Mother Nature" gift bundles with Arboretum, Kodama, Pocket Hive, and Eco/Nature Fluxx. Add a jar of local honey and a bar of artisanal soap with chunky bits in it (you know the ones), tie a ribbon around all of it - bam.

This one is an amazing game, but really forces you to do some heavy thinking.  You have to be in the right mood.  I've only played with two.  Perhaps with more players it's a little harder to keep track of everything and is maybe a bit less hard on your brain. The card art is stunning.

tl;dr: I think I like this

This is a bit of a weird game. The way it approaches scoring is very tricky. You have to try to optimize your scoring potential while also making sure that you do well in the majority part at the end of the game or your work will be for naught. It's not easy, but it's a fun challenge.
I was at times frustrated though. If you're trying to do well at something and you simply can't get hold of the cards you need, you're screwed.
So I think I like this, I just don't have any idea how much.

RATING: 5
Arboretum feels very much like it was designed by a Knizia fan; the scoring is very tight and there are a few clever twists in there. Unfortunately, the optimum way to play seems to be to encourage others to block players whilst completely ignoring that element yourself. If you only hold cards in your hand that allow you to score all of the colours you have played, then that is the perfect hand for you. If you've clogged your hand up with blocking cards it is less efficient. Consequently, this style of play has become dominant in our group in just a small number of plays and so the game now has no tension.

This box is very deceptive. It's just a small card game, but from early on, the decisions are difficult and hair-pulling. You never want to discard.

RATING: 8
First of all, the arts on the cards are simple and amazing! LOVE IT!! This game can be played casually, especially when you are taking a break from a long game. It's not hard to learn as well, so it should be pretty easy to teach to a non-gamer.

The game mechanic is simple, take 2 cards, plant one card to your arboretum and discard another card. You play this until all the supply cards are depleted. The only tricky part is how a player's arboretum scores (incl. the privilege to score the trees). 

Beyond the simplicity of the game, there are a lot of thinking involved in placing the cards on your arboretum, discarding cards that can be drawn by other people, and blocking other people by holding-on specific cards. This game certainly shines when you play it with 4 players. The decision becomes harder as you play with more players.

Wow! -- what a mean game for something that is ostensibly about building a pretty path of trees. The artwork is stunning, with beautiful details that are certainly unnecessary, but absolutely appreciated. Everything about the production, including the game box is produced with top-notch quality. Yet it's the gameplay that has me really excited. The need to balance cards on the table with cards in your hand is devilishly clever. The fact that you can horde cards your opponents are collecting in order to prevent them from scoring at all is stressful in the best way. The fact that all this fits into a tiny card box and plays in 45 minutes or less is amazing.

The game plays well with two and with four. I haven't played much with three. In fact, if you'd like to improve at the game, I suggest playing with just two to give yourself practice at memorizing what your opponent has and manipulating the tableau to both suit your own needs and also interfere with your opponent's. Highly recommended.

Fantastic strategy card game that really makes you think. Has some Knizia-esque scoring ideas, where you can only score cards you have played based on whether you have the highest total of those cards still in your hand.

Just like Keltis/Lost Cities but... well, no difference really. This game adds a little bit of a spatial element, but it also seems much more random than Keltis because of it.

Arboretum is a card game with beautiful illustrations and coloring - so much so,  that you will, in all probability, want very much to like the game.  Sadly,  after several baffling plays,  it renders itself an illusion.

I gave it several chances and even if there had not been a ton of other light card game options out there, this game would never see the light of day - depressing too,  as I like the ideas and the graphics are top notch.  Traded away.  so those beautiful trees hopefully won't have have to wither away - that is assuming someone else plays it and doesn't wind up being a weeping willow at game's end.

What a fantastic card game.  There are many hard choices to make during game play.  Do I discard this card that my opponent needs, or hold on to it and discard another that I may need.  You are always thinking many moves ahead.  If I get this card I can do this, if I get that one I can do that.  You also need to make sure you hold on to the best cards for end game scoring.  Just so much going on in this little game.  It's truly fun and challenging.  Arboretum is a real winner!

Arboretum is a game where you're trying to score cards that you've played to your tableau... but you only get to score suits where you have the highest sum still in your hand. Which means that there's a lot of tension between whether you keep cards in your hand to qualify to score or play them to your tableau so that you'll have something worth scoring.

There are 10 suits (of trees) and each suit has eight cards (1 through 8). You start the game with seven cards in hand. Each turn you draw two cards, either from the facedown draw deck or from one of two discard piles. Then you add a card to your tableau, which must be orthogonal to an existing card) and discard one card.

The goal of the game is to build pathways from one card of a suit to another card of that same suit. The path must be in ascending (or descending) number order. Your path must start and end at cards of the same suit. The cards in between those don't have to be the same suit (but there can be a bonus if they are).

The game ends on the turn when the facedown draw deck runs out of cards. At the end of the game players go through suit by suit and reveal which cards they've kept in their hand. Whoever has the highest sum is the only player who can score cards of that suit (ties are friendly). However, if anyone kept a 1 card in hand, then the 8 card is discarded and doesn't count towards anyone's total.

For every path you've made, you get a point for every card in that path. If the path is four cards or longer and all the cards in that path are the same suit, then each card scores another point. If your path starts with a 1 then you get a bonus point. If your path ends in an 8 you get two bonus points.

The game is very thinky! It's tricky to balance keeping cards in hand versus playing them to your tableau. If you try to get too many cards of a suit to your tableau you risk not being able to score them. And of course if you see an opponent setting up a big scoring opportunity for a suit, you want to keep cards of that suit in your hand to nix their plan. And as the game nears the end, you can deduce a lot of what is going on because you can see all the cards that have been played to everyone's tableau and (at least in the way we played) you can see the cards in the discard piles. Since there's only eight cards in each suit, you start to get near perfect information, and can make informed guesses about hidden cards (especially if you have a good memory).

Quite often you're faced with an extremely painful decision about what card to discard. You don't want to get rid of cards that you want to play to your tableau, but then there's cards you want to keep to "win" a suit, and then there's cards that you don't want to leave out for opponents to get because they might need them for their tableau or hand. But you have to discard something!

I enjoyed this game a lot. It was a lot of thinky fun.

RATING: 7.5
[thing=140934][/thing] has some pretty simple mechanics: on his turn the player draws 2 cards, it cab be from the draw deck or the discard pile of other players or himself (taking the first card of the discard); it is allowed to take one from the discard and other from the draw deck. Then the player put one card from his hand in his arboretum (roll credits) and then discard one card, returning to 7 cards in hand. Play proceeds like this until the draw deck is depleted - at this moment the game is over and is scoring time. It is in the scoring phase that is the "heart" of the game. I will explain using an image from Steph:

[center][ImageID=2499951medium][/center]

In the image above there are potentially three lines of trees scoring. The rules of scoring are:

- the first and the last card in the line must be of the same type, and the player can only score one line of trees for each type of tree (the type is considered by the first and last card, not the ones in the middle, which can be used to score other paths);
- the tree line must follow an ascending order of the numbers on the cards;
- each card on the scoring line is scores 1 point;
- if all the cards in the line are from the same type of tree, and this line has [b]4 or more cards[/b], then each card in the line will be worth 1 extra point;
- each 1 card is worth 1 extra point;
- each 8 card is worth 2 extra points;
- to score a line of trees the player has to have, in the end of the game, the higher sum of this type of tree, considering the 7 cards left in his hand.

So, in the image above, considering that the person had the highest sum for the three types of trees scoring, the points she would receive are:

- the [b]Royal Poinciana[/b] (or the orange one) could be legally scored in two ways (but the player must choose one): from the 1 in the base all the way to the 8 in the high row (for 11 points - 8 cards = 8 points; 1 extra point for the 1 card; 2 extra points for the 8 card); or from the number 1 to the 5 in the same lower row (for 6 points - 5 cards = 5 points; 1 extra point for the 1 card). Of course, there is no reason to choose the line scoring less - it is just to illustrate that there might be more than one way to score a line of trees;
- the [b]Jacaranda[/b] (or the purple one) scores from the 2 at the bottom row up to the 6 in the higher row (for 5 points - 5 cards = 5 points);
- the [b]Lilac[/b] (or the blue one) scores from the 3 card in the bottom row up to the 6 card in the middle row (for 8 points - 4 cards = 4 points; all cards of the same type with at least four cards = 4 extra points, one for each card). It is also legal to score from the 3 to the 6 passing by the Royal Poinciana 5 at the bottom, but this would reduce the amount of points to only 4 points, for 4 cards, as there wouldn't be the extra gain for all cards of the same type in the line.

As I said, to score the three types of trees, the player would be required to have the higher sum of cards in hand for all of them. At scoring, players reveal their hands of cards and for each type of tree players add the numbers on the cards they have, and the player with the highest sum is allowed to score that type of tree. Tied players are also allowed to score. It is possible (and wiill happen often) that a player have the highest sum of a type but has none of this type of tree in his arboretum - the player used the cards in hand only to block scoring for someone else. When adding up the values of cards in hand, an 1 card cancels an 8 card of the same type.

Therefore, players must balance the need to expand the arboretum, vying for the highest score possible, while also keeping key cards in hand, not only to allow himself to score some types of trees, but to block others from scoring as well. And this is hard when you consider that you must keep in hands cards for yourself (to use in the arboretum and also to fight for scoring) and also discard at the end of every turn, and your discard can be draw by someone else! Tough stuff.

So players must be mindful about what type of trees the others are using to build their arboretum, the cards discarded and the possible cards in everyone hands. The game allows for a good grasp of this, since the game only ends when the draw deck is depleted, which means that all the cards in the game will be either in the hands, discard piles or showing in the arboretums (so, for example, if you have a line using the cards 1, 3, 5 and 8, and you have the 6 card of the same type in hand, and none of the type were discarded, you know that, somewhere in the draw deck or in someone else's hand, there are still left the 2, 4 and 7 cards - so, if the game is near the end, the chances you will be able to score your neat line, will be close to none, as the single 7 card can block you. But, let's say you draw the 4 card, you are now guaranteed to score, as with the cards left, it won't be possible to pass you sum of 10 for this type of tree).

[thing=140934][/thing] adds easiness of rules with some nice complexity in scoring in order to provide a good set of possibilites for players throughout the play, coupled with a nice tension in the reveal of hand at the game's scoring phase, something that is akin to what happens in the end of a play of [thing=56692][/thing]. [thing=140934][/thing] has a low screwage factor during the game (basically denial of cards), but, in the end, someone can be seriously kicked in the butt by the cards in the opponents hands, going from a game winning score to a sour and distant last place - but, at least the person should already be aware that this was very likely to happen, and not a big surprise.

A play can last longer if the players focus on drawing from the discard piles, but, naturally, it will stay around the 30 minutes mark. The production is pretty good, as the box has enough room to hold the cards sleeved (an important issue to me), while not being really big, and the art and graphic design is nothing less than amazing - simply beautiful.

To close up, [thing=140934][/thing] is easy to explain (only the scoring may require a time to get used to, and some mistakes by the players can occur in the first plays), quick to play and the cards are a work of art, so I recommend it for those looking for a filler with eye-catching cards and some meat.

Arboretum is full of very tough choices. Because players can draw cards from other players' discard piles, almost every discard decision will be between two seemingly terrible choices.

Currently, I prefer the 3/4 player version of this game. (To be confirmed after more plays)

Although players have a better control in 2-player version, I feel that the draw of the card seemed to have a greater impact in 2-player version. 

In 3/4 player version, one will have more choices of cards to choose from. The player interaction in a 3/4 player game feels more interesting.

RATING: 6
So far with one play in, the rating is a "6" which is a good game but nothing spectacular. I however, desperately want to rate the game a "7", elevating it to an above average game. After having played with 2, the set collection feels a bit loose and transparent. I could tell immediately which paths are being chosen by my opponent and vice versa. On paper, the rules are delightfully easy and filled with twists and turns. I anticipated a game closer to Parade in terms of brain burning goodness. Not sure if that is the case. Will have to play a few more hands to find out and also likely better with 4 players? One thing of note is that players have to plan well and keep cards in hand for scoring but in a 2 player game, it is easier to observe which cards are being played and which are being discarded.

After a few more plays, Arboretum is certainly more brain burning than I anticipated. All cards are seemingly good but having to discard is painful. Any inefficiencies are immediately punished.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Rated at 2p only.  I can possibly see where the game would shine with more, but at 2p it's too zero sum.  It just feels too arbitrary and chaotic at 2p.  Oddly enough, it presents a facade of being deeper than Keltis the card game (NOT referring to Lost Cities the card game which is less deep than either), but when it comes to scoring you realize it isn't - at least not at 2p.  That's because your ability to score a row is based on what cards are still in your hand.  

Never played 4p, but I'm going to assume that this might feel a little like a trick taking game involving card counting and bluffing.  That's great.  But regardless, I have other card games I'd rather play at 4p.

Not really understanding the hype around this one.  It's a neat card game, but it's not like it's deep and involving like Tichu and it's not groundbreaking like Triumvirate (arguably the best trick taking game for 2p there is).

Very enjoyable for a quick card game.  Has that smooth ease of play that games like Biblios have, where you're just drawing a few cards and discarding a card, but the additional placement and scoring facets really add a lot to consider.  How you arrange your grid of trees is very important, there's a lot of juggling which cards to keep and which tree types to shoot for.  Great for a game of simple cards.

build tableu of colors

at end of game for each color. the person with the highest total in hand (unplayed) only gets to score that color
scoring requires spatial planning as the position of cards in tableau manner.. have to have an ascending path
fast. small box. almost abstract.. maybe a lite/subset of 5 tribes

An incredibly brutal game of making sure you absolutely ruin everyone else's garden in the stealthiest way possible. The game is crafted beautifully and the plunging feeling you get during game scoring is an essential part of the experience.

This game is really really a brain burner. My brain melted just planning for several steps ahead. The combination, possible outcome and try to guess what your opponent moves are simply too much for me. Though I do think the game is neat and awesome.

Card laying/path building game with indirect player interaction. Scales well at all numbers. Simple but great. Lovely card art.

This is the most clever game I've played in a while. Broadly speaking, Arboretum feels like Lost Cities with a spatial element and some added twists. Similarly to LC, you sometimes have to make speculative investments that put you at the mercy of the card draw, but I'm not too bothered by it as after all this is a sub-hour game. Probably best with 3. UPDATE: Every session has been less interesting than the last. There's a promise here of something, that just isn't fulfilled.

RATING: 6
Quick to explain, easy to get people to play and very portable. Tough, interesting decisions every turn. You can get through enough games in an evening that luck will even out and it's well worth improving your strategy, but also beginners can fluke an individual game for the warm fuzzies.

Occupies roughly the same slot for us as Lost Cities or Jaipur- quick but interesting games after a long day. That's our main gaming window, so it's nice to have some variety.

Only a 6 for me because I would _always_ play something different if I had more time and more mental energy. Nothing wrong with the game.

Has turn angst similar to Lost Cities. Left a desire to try again after first play.

RATING: 6
Draw two cards, play one to a (virtual) grid and discard one. Form numerically sequential paths in the games different suits, and score them. The catch is that you can only score the paths if you also have the highest sum of cards in the matching suit in hand at the table as well. So every turn is an agonizing decision between making a path more valuable but weakening your chances of scoring it, or assuring yourself of the score and lowering the payout. Even the end of turn discard carries a similar dilemma, as whatever you throw away is usually either going to strengthen an opponent's tableau or weaken your ability to control who scores each suit.

It's not really my cup of tea, to be honest. But from the standpoint of having a Love Letter level of simplicity in the rules while still creating an incredibly tense decision with every individual card play, it's hard not to give the game a lot of respect. I may not love it, but I think the buzz and scarcity of the game are fully deserved.

Divertido, te hace calcular y pensar el mejor camino y que cartas conservar y cuales gastar, muy aconsejable.

Very interesting card game were the players try to set up two dimensional numerical and color patterns while trying to avoid discarding cards valuable to their opponents. Fairly easy rules but deep thought required especially as the end game approaches. Recommended filler.

Now that's a weird game. It's very simple on its surface, but in reality it's full of tough decisions. It's not easy to decide which cards to keep, which to play and which to discard in order to get a high score at the end and outsmart your opponent. I'd gladly give it another shot someday, there's more to this game than it initially appears.

By the way, the cards are a real eye candy.

RATING: 8
Lots of decisions in this tiny little game.  You will find yourself stopping to think more and more the later in the game you are.  There are some definite strategies that are almost always the way to go...and I build my Arboretum almost the same way every time... but it is always a new and different game because the whole thing hinges on what the other players are going to discard!  

If you enjoy Splendor, you will more than likely enjoy this little gem as well.

Surprisingly, a challenging game with some lateral thinking required to maximize the score!  Some degree of "surprise" at the end scoring, with some sneaky "take that" opportunities.  

After playing this game a number of times during a more recent vacation, I highly recommend this as a fairly quick, compact game that gives a satisfying experience despite it's diminutive size.  The beautiful colours and tableau add to it's appeal as a great game to take while traveling.

RATING: 4
While the art is attractive and the game is portable, its downfall for me is that it's simply too mean. A player can build a lovely tableau and then end up completely shut out of scoring at the end of the game, based on which cards are in opponents' hands. That's just not fun.

Tile placement strategy card game. The deck consists of ten types of trees valued 1 to 8.  Draw cards, play them to your personal tableau (arboretum) and discard. Each player has a separate discard pile that all players can draw from which leads to agonizing discard decisions. It seems like a simple little pattern builder of different tree types with an interesting ascending value requirement to build scoring paths. But, the kicker is that trees played will not score points if another player is holding a higher total value of the same tree in their hand!  Such a simple little rule with such a huge impact on meta game, strategy and bluffing--brilliant.

Wow, probably the thinkiest game I have for it's size. 

You take turns collecting trees and building out your arboretum trying to make long paths that start and end with the same type (bonus if the entire path is the same type). The kicker being that the cards in your hands at the end of the game determines who gets to score a particular path. 

An insane number of painful decisions, this game in incredible and one for every gamers' collection.

Once a player understands the flow and the exception as well as scoring, this game turns into a nasty little deny-fest.  

First few plays we kept the discard pile stacked.  After reading designer's commentary that this is not meant to be a memory game, another world of strategic possibility opened. 

What a fantastic game.  May climb up to #2 behind Innovation as my go-to 2p card game.

Don't believe the beautiful, relaxing artwork; this game is amazingly cutthroat! Of all the games in my collection, this innocuous-looking game has some of the hardest decision making for me.

Cool spatial trick taking game. The conflict isn't super harsh but it can be painful to have someone claim your hard work. You have to be aware of what other people are doing to keep 'shares' of their suits while also making sure you can score your own runs. Very interesting little game. Great card stock too.

Based on 1 play.

The box looks drab and I wouldn't have guessed from it that this title came out in the 21st century. 

Having said that, however, this game was surprisingly neat! It's a really thinky game in which you have to constantly reconsider which cards to keep and which ones to (possibly) grant your opponents. Creating your own little grid of (gorgeous) tree cards is really cool, and it's interesting how underneath it has this little layer of meanness :p

I would love to play this one again. Only disadvantage may be how tricky it is to explain scoring, but once you've played once it's fairly simple. Thumbs up! :)

This is a big hit with my wife. There's more strategy here than meets the eye. You have to worry about building your own paths while simultaneously holding back cards that your opponent(s) will need in order to score their paths. We like Arboretum with 2, 3, or 4.

THE heaviest 30 minute game you'll ever play. You get to a point where you don't want to draw anything, you don't want to play anything, and you don't want to discard anything, but you have to do all 3. I love how players can dictate the pace. You can play as mean or as nice as you want. Great art. We typically play this every week. The only thing keeping this from being a 10 is that I don't care for how it plays with 2

Solid card game.  Actually a lot trickier and deeper than it appears.  Good art, some of the colors are pretty similar but it's easy to tell them apart based on the shapes.  We take those similar ones out when playing with less than four.

Plays pretty fast and every placement is important.  Really digging this one.

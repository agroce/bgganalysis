There are no real decisions to make - just stay in the peleton as long as you can and attempt to screw everyone else at the end by playing a 50 and a hill. This game is heavily luck based so if you draw low cards it's just frustrating and you'll lose. There's a game here but not much of one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
3 plays (4p). Wow - fun, fast, fun, and also FUN.  Exceeded my expectations.  Feels like bicycle racing - except for the leg pain.  Great for aging bi-wheeled charioteers. Rewards clever plays, imaginative combination, and hand management, as well as trash talk and the strategy of lucky draws.  (That's what they get for calling the peloton the "pelican".) Luck certainly, but over multiple rounds should even out?  Seems really to find its worth in a multi-round session for luck flattening and stage feeling.  I like the scoring method - you can win 0 stages and yet win the race. Also seems to be ripe for variants, not to mention, Bacchanal exuberance. As I've so far only played it sober, my rating could rise.

No tactics to speak of: draw the high cards and win, get the low cards and lose. This game is won by not losing: the rules actively punish players who, by luck of the draw, could not keep up, and because people want to prey on each other's high cards, they are predominantly played unless there really is no alternative. The rule that every unit of velocity counts once you obtained chips sees that people who begin losing keep on losing. Therefore it is much easier to lose time than to gain it, proving my original comment that you win by not losing. That makes it a stupid game, but also a broken one, since there is no point to it: there is no way to influence which cards you get, making the outcome completely random. Save your money and throw a die instead; highest number wins.

RATING: 5
Clever cycling race game played with a deck of cards.  The lead player plays a card featuring a speed, and the other players must play within 2 km/h of the value or fall of the pack and take time penalties.  Excellent filler, but don't look for anything deeper than that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Does a good job siumulating a bike race: it's better to draft than to lead, but when you fall out of the "wind shadow" it's extremely difficult to catch back up.  Unfortunately I'm not sure this makes for a good game: this kind of poor-get-poorer mechanism can be pretty frustrating.  The rules suggest you play 3-5 rounds, which makes sense to even out the luck, but each round is 15-20 minutes which makes it overstay its welcome as a light filler.  Perhaps cutting the deck in half would make for shorter rounds, or else give everyone an identical deck to even out the luck.

A very light bicycle racing card game. It depends quite heavily on the luck of the draw but it's quick enough that it's not that much of a problem. Once you've fallen behind the peloton it becomes increasingly hard to come back so it does tend to punish those that cannot keep up even more.

Light, fun card game. The race leader sets the tempo, which others must match with similar (or slightly weaker) cards. Timing is all - being an early leader isn't great, as others can use slightly weaker cards to stay in touch with your better ones. This means they can keep their better cards for later use, when they kick in with their breakaway.

For me, it's main weakness is the amount of luck involved, especially if you draw weak cards over several turns, as you'll be out of it through no fault of your own.

Unfortunately there are available crap like this. Awful game, very luckdriven (which is not necessarily a bad thing) and takes too much time. The first part of game is just meaningless and the important rounds just begin when the deck of cards are almost running out of cards. Nice theme, but fortunately there are better cycling games, so I don't have to play this on (Breaking Away is good, Um Reifenbreite quite-good).

Decent filler/light game in which one seeks to stay with the leader or take the lead.  Falling behind often seems to lead to further misfortune as its really difficult to dig yourself out of a hole.  Quite a bit of randomness in this game based on card distribution.  Also, forgetting to draw a card at the start of your turn can be harsh as you can never draw that card again and it drops your options for future turns.

I'm not convinced there is much strategy to this game. Players play cards, these have a number value on them. You must play a card that is within 2 points of the player who has played the fastest card or you fall behind. Plus a few tweaks.
It is effective at giving the feel of a cycle tour but I doubt there is much skill. Obviously in each round of cards there is some finesse of the odds, try to play cards 2 lower than the leader except when you take the lead in which case you play cards exactly one higher but the total variation in card value dealt to you is going to swamp your ability to finesse the odds and the finesse is fairly obvious.

Nice game to play when everybody is to tired to think. Add some beers, and I'll enjoy myself playing this game!

A cute game, but especially fun for those who are both gamers and bicycle enthusiasts.  This is more a game of trying to get ahead and keep the front.  If you get really good cards, you can blow everyone away for the whole game.  Bad cards can keep you in last place the whole game, likewise.  Still, it is fun, quick and light.

Actually a very fun little game.  It can get very nasty also if you play with the extra cards.  We play this a lot as our final game of the night.

Got in 2007

2007 Plays = 6
2009 Plays = 2
2010 Plays = 3
2011 Plays = 2

Finally managed to pick up a reprint copy of this deceptive little game.  Nothing like as random as it appears, although when you lose the pace it is crippling.  Plenty of variants to address this for people who don't like that though.

FX Schmidt version.

Fun filler. Up to 6 players have a hand of speed cards. The tempo is set by the race leader and players play cards to either keep up or snatch the lead. Penalty chips are given to those who fall outside the leader's wind shadow and once the deck runs out, the one with the lowest negative score wins.

There is a fair variance between numbers (39-50) and you can get hosed by poor card draw but often, careful play will overcome this. One must know when to set the tempo and when to follow. Watch the deck and try to time your finish! The worst thing that could happen to you is to have the leader play a 50 card, +2 spurt AND a hill card!

In a similar vein to games like Formel Fun/Devil Take the Hindmost. Whimsical artwork adds flavour.

I just don't get it.

Draw the high cards and you win, draw the low cards and you lose.  Of course, you are going to draw some low cards and you have to make choices when to use them, but there is only one "suit" and heirarchy is determined by the value of the cards.  A real no brainer.  My vote for best game to play when overdosing on heroin.

Silly but entertaining card game. The cards you get determine your chances of succes, as the choice of which card to play is usually pretty obvious. Playing several laps mitigates that somewhat. 
But for such a simple game, the theme is actually pretty good. The real entertainment comes from making fun of people when they forget to draw a card.

Great filler/end of night game. Works best with 3 or 4. Has some tactics, but essentially luck + good fun :)

I found this to be pretty awful - barely a game. Draw a card, play a card, and there aren't many choices in what you play; you either have high cards and can keep up or not. The luck factor is enormous (higher than most card games) and there is little room for strategy or clever play. Deadly dull when not being frustratingly constraining ...

Plays better with more players (watching who can stay with the pace and who will fall behind). It seems to suffer that when you've got bad cards you realy do poorly

Simple card game of cycle racing. Players fight to hold the yellow jersey when the race ends.
One player starts as the race leader with a yellow token, and plays a speed card. Successive players must match the leader's pace to stay in the Peleton.

Addictive as far as solo card games go.  Art is cool.  Mechanics seem solid, albeit the balance seems awfully tough at least in my early games.  Will revise my impressions as play goes on.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I never thought I would say this, but this is a game that needs to be made easier.  Every play feels like defeat.  If you play with a random Axis deck you can have your deck full of disorganized cards, or thinned out by dead soldiers super fast.  Almost everything is weighted against you to such a degree that it REALLY needs some more powerful allied cards added.  This could be really great, but it needs a way to re-balance it.  Expansions could help greatly here.

This game is about the deck building engine.  The artwork is beautiful, but the theme is pretty thin and it's not really a wargame.

It is a pretty good light filler, but it's no [thing=147020][/thing] .  The rules are a little terse.  Once I understood how to play it, it went from impossible to beat to kind of easy.  The rules for the Medal of Honor victory are just too easy, but I think you can fix that by changing the victory levels.

An awesome and fun experience that concluded much too quickly. The first game I played I just barely managed to succeed. I really enjoyed it and was driven to try again later. The next day I took what I had learned and tried again, and scored the Medal of Honor effortlessly. I am really disappointed I "solved" the game this quickly. I know I got lucky with a variety of draws but it didn't feel like I got THAT lucky. I'm going to try to come up with a house rule to amp the difficulty a bit.

Not really sure what people are seeing in this one.  It doesn't seem particularly balanced.  I've been through all the questions here in the forum, and I'm fairly confident that I'm playing right, but every game so far has been a Medal of Honor win.  Fun, but not particularly challenging.

I had the opportunity to play this a couple of times as a prototype. I am not really a war gamer and certainly not a solo gamer but this game really grabbed me. Tense, interesting decisions. Short play time. There is a sense of building towards a finale like one of those scrolling video game where you are fighting boss, after boss. Excited to get a copy of the finished edition and get some more plays in

Nice military theme. This is a "beat your own score"-game but it seems to be so many ways to loose and fun playing it that I donÂ´t think it would be a problem even if I usually find those troublesome.

When they launched the kickstarter I decided to take the step and go all in - game, expansion and playmat.

Kickstarted

Last night, not having much else to do I figured I'd give Airborne Commander a shot. Let me just start off by saying that this game has an absolutely horrible rulebook, this really could have benefited from a professional editor. To be completely honest I hated this game, the rulebook just put me in a poor mood from the beginning and the brutal game play didn't make it any better. At no point did I feel in control of my path and I was ready to send this game to the depths of my collection, right next to flux. Before that though I figured I'd stop by the Geek and see if other people had the same thoughts as me. It turns out that most people acknowledge the sub par rulebook, but most seem to actually enjoy it.

Wait a second... This usually means that I did something wrong. A trip to the videos section of the game gets me a play through. Crap I did get several major rules wrong. And I mean important rules. Looks like this game will be getting one more try before it gets thrown down a hole.

Interesting concept with some solid mechanism and decent weight for its size. What holds the game back from being great is that it's a bit of tweener. It's not as compelling or strategic/deep as Friday. It's not as thematically strong as Space Hulk: Death Angel. It's certainly decent though and I've had fun with it. Enjoy the artwork as well.

Great little deckbuilder that does a couple of unique things: a) it tackles a war theme with wonderful imagery and thematic elements. and b) it gets rid of the hand limit that other deckbuilders rely on for tension. It is a well put game, and one that I will enjoy seeing more of. Recommended.

+ solid rehash of the main deckbuilding mechanism, with a fun twist
+ lovely theme and art
+ plays quickly

= seems a bit on the easy side (I am sure I can tweak the knobs to make it harder if need be)

- the rulebook is a bit inconsistent and has blind rule spots, nothing serious though

RATING: 6.5
After playing a second time, and after watching a video on game play, I really love this game. I am a big fan of solitaire games, deck building games and wargames. This small, fairly quick, deck building, solo wargame combines them all into an excellent card game. I felt like just didn't have enough men or resources to pull out a victory so I was always on the edge of losing. The game forces you to make decisions every turn. Will be playing this frequently!

A solitaire deck builder themed on the 101st Airborne Division in Normandy.  Basically, the game deck (the Germans) flip up four cards a turn, which represent units, static defences (which can defeat you if they build up), objectives (victory points) and terrain (rule tweaking events).  You as the Airborne flop five cards a turn, and can "buy" extra cards from the "drop" - representing your frantic efforts to muster a fighting force from your scattered troops.

It's simple and works quite well, once you get the poor rules down.  I wonder if the game really should have the Medic card included, as it seems very easy if you get that early, still it's rather difficult if you get it late.  Still, nice game, with some tough decision points, and feels like you are walking a tightrope.  As soon as a few disorganised cards get into your deck, it becomes a lot more difficult.

Poor rules but an ingenious little game. Generates a short, sharp, chaotic narrative where you feel like you are rounding up your paratroopers, beset on all sides, constantly under pressure and forever on the edge of defeat. The negative snowball effects of early disorganization are so powerful that the game can be a bit fragile -- expect to mulligan and re-deal every couple games. Would feel more like the battle if the Objectives were required, instead of targets of opportunity. I like it.

RATING: 6
Game 1: Lost - scattered, but I played that the axis only had equal my defense to kill a guy, and that static defenses stayed on the board even when engaged. 

Game 2: Medal of Honor victory, but I allowed the pathfinder to add his two recruit values together, and I allowed the P-47 to take out armor from the support area. 

Game 3: I think I have rules right finally and scored a 4 VP Bronze star victory. 

So... I think the difficulty level is closely tuned to playing correctly (shocking, right?) and I imagine the scoring is going to vary based on luck of the draw. Once you get the suppression dynamics down and understand where to engage to minimize losses, the play seems pretty straightforward to me. But the components evoke the theme well and it's a fun short diversion, and is conveniently small for the war gaming business traveler.

When I first read about Airborne Commander I thought that I didn't need another solo deckbuilder since I already owned Friday.

But then I watched the explanation video and I finally succumbed to the lure of the small-print-run-Essen-releases and preordered it.

Luckily, it was worth it. Airborne Commander and Friday are both solitaire deckbuilders but that's pretty much where their similarities end.

The theme is surprisingly well implemented and depending on how the cards come out it's a good challenge.

If you haven't the energy or application to get out Warfighter or Fields Of Fire but want a quick-play soldiers-in-combat game then this does it pretty well.

Quick, fun, creates some tension along the way, you are engaged the whole time, your decisions matter most of the time and you have to plan your card play too. Sure it's on the lighter side but hey, it packs a lot of fun in a 30 minute game! 
Well done!

Was not going to get it as the gameplay seems a bit simple, but decided I wanted to support the guys for trying to make such a game.  Not expecting much.  20 Eur for two decks a bit costly as well, but we'll see.

Have played a couple times, and it seems ok.  Not sure how many choices I really have but the story it tells seems interesting.

Aha!  I actually get eight troops to start, and not four!  That makes it a lot easier, so much so I actually won a game!  The rules are not the tighter, and I still wonder what the seargent redres rule is exactly...

[u]29-Oct-2017[/u]:  This is a WWII themed, solo only, deckbuilder.  It comes in a small box and plays rather quickly, 15-20 minutes.  Each turn you play three or four new enemy cards into the display, you draw five Allied cards and must deal with what's in front of you.  Just like other deckbuilders, you will cull cards from your deck, purchase new ones, and attempt to score VPs by defeating Axis cards.

So far, I'm digging this game.  It's still early in my experience, but I'm enjoying the gameplay...once I got the rules down.  It's not complex, but there a few ambiguities to overcome when first learning the game.  I enjoy how there is a new set of obstacles to deal with each turn, and that you only go through the enemy deck once.

I feel like there is one major concern that some gamers won't be able to look beyond.  Because this is a deckbuilder, the actions you take do not jive with the reality of what's happening in the game.  I think if you play this one like a deckbuilder, focusing on its mechanisms, rather than playing it like a wargame with a strong narrative, it is much more enjoyable.  While I certainly enjoy a game that provides me with an engaging story, I don't mind playing some games focusing more on the mechanisms.  But that isn't for everyone.

Oh, and one more comment...I love the artwork in this game.  It's such different style than any other game I own.  I think it's really well done.

Thinking about it.
Looks great but it also looks like the more familiar you become with the game the more mundane it gets (and simpler).  Sort of appears as though I'd eventually just be going through the paces.
Additionally, it looks infrequent that you're able to purchase the cooler/stronger cards.
I'd snap this up in a second at MSRP somewhere but they don't sell it in stores yet, and it would come to almost $60 to order it online. So for now, a pass.

Deckbuilding and Solitaire? Color me intrigued! But, holy rules madness, the rule book is bad. More holes than a swiss cheese. Luckily FushigiTV has a great video on it that clears up game play. So the second play went much smoother. The game is fun, and it provides an interesting puzzle, but it is kinda a One Trick Pony. Definitely would need more enemy decks with more twists to the game for a higher rating. As it is, I might take it with me when traveling due to the small size and literally play it when  in the mood, but not feeling the yearn for the next play as with other games.

Only played a few times so far but I think it's a really enjoyable solo game that plays fairly quickly. There are a number of little rules you need to get down but it's not too hard to learn. Once you get them down the game flows smoothly and there are some really hard (fun) choices that have to be made. Look forward to playing it more.

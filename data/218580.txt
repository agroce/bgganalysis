I wanted this to be a camel-cup killer.  We need to house-rule the special powers, because they just never triggered in a 3 player game. With some tweaking, I think this could be better.  The card selection idea is pretty great, but most of the cards are too similar for this to matter. I suspect this was not tested enough.

A nice and simple game. Seems more like a filler. If we didn’t play it wrong, it seems like a half-an-hour game.

A rethemed, reworked version of Hab & Gut by the same author.
It is much lighter, and not as serious.  More randomness (with the selection of the two cards to disqualify).
Not having the player elimination of Hab & Gut cuts the tension.
Doing the same race 3 times, gives the game a bit of wash, rinse & repeat.
I definitely prefer Hab & Gut.

Update after 2nd play. Dropped from 6.5 to 5. The randomness of drawing the disqualification cards produces huge 11 to 14 VP swings. Too much for my liking.

For me, there’s really no occasion to play this when Hab und Gut is so much better.

The concept of betting on a race, and then seeing how the race plays out is a good one that's successfully carried out in other games, and I typically enjoy those types of games.

The problem here is that the main "hook" of being able to see and play the cards to your left and right was done leaps and bounds better in another game, Hab & Gut, which being a stock market game, is also a betting game with an extremely similar feel.

The main issue in Divinity Derby is that you're required to place 2/3 of your bets before the race even begins, based on very little information (especially in a 6-player game). It's almost entirely a crap shoot. This vs. Hab & Gut, where you can buy/sell stock on every one of your turns, responding to current conditions and what other players are doing. The games are so similar in every other regard that it's hard to not see this game as just a poorly executed version.

It's also pretty disappointing that given the fantasy creature setting, the creatures really have no personality to them, or interesting race tactics. They're all just represented by numbers on cards, which was a bit of a let down.

Overall, if the betting/wagering plus the neat hook of the card racks between players sounds appealing, hunt down Hab & Gut, as it's an extremely similar game, but hands down far better in execution.

Fun betting game, like a version of CamelCup with a different methods of randomising and an illusion(?) of more control.  Easy to learn, but not simplistic...

RATING: 8
A nice change of pace from Snow Tails and Flamme Rouge, games with which it has most in common. Whereas the numbered cards in ST create a challenging puzzle in conjunction with the track, and the numbered cards in FR make you try to maximize shared bonuses from other players, in DD the numbered cards plus the partial information of your neighbors bets forces you to prioritize your choices to achieve your goals before those choices disappear from under your nose...

In short, a very nice mix of light deduction, shifting alliances, and racing tension.

Deluxe Edition.  Not quite as good as its predecessor 'Hab & Gut', but still a lot of fun.  I play with a couple of house rules that improve the experience (one bet before race and 2 bets during race, remove Disqualified/7pt. bet cards).  More strategy and subtlety than many give it credit for.

Despite its easy-to-learn and creative core mechanics, gameplay is the exact opposite of the excitement you would expect out of a race.

Following the rules to the letter, we managed to get one creature less than 3/4 of the way around the track the first go. The distance between first and last was 14 spaces (more than half of the track). Cool race, man. This lame result, though, was far from the most infuriating thing...there was NOTHING in the rulebook that commented in ANY WAY about the EXTREMELY COMMON CONTINGENCY of no creature finishing the race. Of course, we had to come here and listen to the designers say "well, of course, by the rules it is nice and obvious the final order is where they stand." Inexcusable.

And freaking boring. You know that my group is annoyed when we unanimously vote to put in a house rule during the FIRST PLAYTHROUGH to add two movement cards per stack. And even then, the *only way* creatures were finishing was by ample use of dirty tricks. With how many of those came out, I found myself not caring about risky bets that were not all that risky because so many were being used.

And while it did not happen, I also read nothing about the other EXTREMELY COMMON CONTINGENCY that would be a tie game. Feh.

At very least the deluxe edition that I reserved was still a good investment, with decent quality painted miniatures and the wood cardholders. Can make use of those elsewhere.

Rating is for the base rules. But given how long the initial slog took, and consider adding ten times the fiddliness with disparate player powers and stupid pet tricks? Add another 15-30 minutes to that and find more undefined contingencies? Only giving it one more shot, and I do not have high hopes.

EDIT: There has been no call to bring this one back to the table, and thinking about it (and seeing it on my shelf) makes me increasingly bitter. Putting it on the trading block.

Nice atmosphere and an easy fun game.
Not so much choice in strategy as expected since you always end up using all of the cards. So its fast for yours and slow for the others.
Dirty trick adds some options and complexity but it also adds a lot of luck and it backfired 3/3 on first game earning DQ where I didn't want them and no DQ where I wanted them. 
This easily decided the outcome of the game so that ended up very luck dependent.
Will play with some of the optional rules next time.

Its an awesome game, easy to learn and quick to play. The mechanics allow you to have a certainty that you have the best bets but with all players interactions things get messy and funny. Ill be playing a lot this game, specially because it can be used as a filler (1h tops).

Racing game with an awesome theme. Can play with 6 players but While I played with 3 and loved it I know people who played with 5 and said absolutely not. I think it is pretty random and crazy anyway, and at least with 3 players you have a bit more control over the creatures. Would advise fewer players when playing. I quite enjoyed my experience with the game. AMAZING theme!

The blend of mechanisms that comprise Divinity Derby is very compelling. I don’t think that I’ve seen any game quite like this one before, so it feels fresh and unique. On its surface, the game is about racing and bidding, but the actual racer movement, bidding, and scoring are really all driven by deduction and possibly some bluffing. The movement is card-driven, and because each player shares cards with neighboring players, the tension created by that shared, but limited information in engrossing and really provides for emergent gameplay. To begin, players must make an opening bid before any movement occurs based solely on the limited cards that can be seen. However, more information quickly surfaces based on the racers bet on by others players. Especially of interest is how your neighbors bid and then trying trying deduce why a particular racer was picked as well as what type of bid (e.g., first, last, disqualified?) since you are able to see half of the same cards. All of this subtle, but new information floods in and must be evaluated when placing the second opening bid, again before any movement has even occurred. Just sitting and watching all of the other players bid is fascinating. Divinity Derby is really a game of trying to predict what may occur and using the available betting cards to capitalize as best as possible. Now, pair all of that with seeing the racer cards get played out and things get even more interesting. As players pick and play cards that indicate the racer color and movement type (e.g., fast, slow, or “dirty trick”), all players get even more information about how various players may have bet. Or does it? Maybe somebody is actually trying to artificially hurt a racer based on the other bets or maybe it’s just a limitation in the cards a particular player has access to play. It’s so hard to know! Seeing how your neighbor plays cards that you can also see is key information as well and it can help you figure out if there are common interests for a particular racer or not. All of this guessing and double guessing can become somewhat intense – in a good way – and makes for a completely engaging experience that’s a lot of fun. Then there is the final bidding opportunity and just getting to that point can be a critical decision based on the turn order that will occur and what racer colors are left for bidding. I won’t go into any more detail about all of the strategic and tactical considerations encompassed in this game, but hopefully it’s clear that I’m quite enthralled with this game overall! From what was provided in the final prototype copy that I played, the production quality of this game is going to be over the top, resulting in a game that looks as good as it plays. I really enjoyed playing Divinity Derby and look forward to playing it again.

this game was a blast!
You bet on creatures with only knowing parts of the movement cards available. This leads to assuming to have your bets under control but it can come out quite differently :)
if you like these gambling games such as camel up, you could really enjoy this one
Also the gods special abilities are very cool and keep the game interesting.

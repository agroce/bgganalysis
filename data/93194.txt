A gorgeous game with a very bizarre theme. Beautiful bits which are also the game's biggest flaw: why, oh why, didn't they use different coloured bases on the minis rather than these teeny tiny runes?

An excellent deduction game, but deduction is not the key to victory: knowing where you want to be in turn order and how to outmaneuver your opponents to get there is!

The game does start kinda slow; but the end is nail-bitingly tense. I hate games with lots of down-time, so I'm puzzled at the many comments here about how the game drags between turns. That just wasn't my experience!

This game is one I purchased mostly due to the theme.  It's Steampunk and Viking Mythology, together at last(?)!

Eight investigators, one of which is the Chosen One, and one of which is trying to kill the Chosen One, are tooling around steam powered Turin.  Each player (the players are NOT each one investigator, which is simple enough but is thematically a bit weird to me) will select and move a character on each turn, attempting to progress towards the three separate parts of the win condition.

The "deductive" part of this game is the same as in Clue and every mystery game since: there are cards.  There are missing cards.  Find out which ones are missing through process of elimination.  Ho hum. You do have the ability to obfuscate the character cards in your hand by hanging onto action cards which bear the same backing (cards are revealed at random), but there is not much strategy to this, since there's little advantage to playing some of those action cards earlier than you need to.

The best single mechanic in this game is the gears.  Each turn, you'll turn the three interlocked gears so that you have a certain combination of bonuses available on that turn.  These are neat, but the correct play here is usually fairly obvious.

The core of the game's strategy comes from the bidding for turn order.  At the beginning of each round, you'll bid Time (your main resource in this game, which you'll start with a stockpile of and try not to run out of) to decide who gets to play in which order.  This is the most important thing to do, since in addition to the usual advantages that come from turn order in games, there are also event cards that will reward the Nth player, and you'll want to play after someone whose current objective will give you a favorable alignment of gears to work with.

The components are decent.  You'll get cards for characters and your starting actions, but inexplicably, the action tiles you'll get during the game are tiles, when they could easily be cards.  Not going to complain, as the tiles are sturdy and there's nothing *wrong* with them, but it's just a bit weird.  The component I would like to complain about is the character tokens.  Each investigator gets their own plastic mini, but they're all the same color grey and are very hard to differentiate, without looking closely for the identifying rune on the base.

High marks for theme, but mediocre marks for gameplay.  If you would rather play Clue where you could ride around on Zeppelins instead of roll-and-move, all while trying to outwit Fenrir (and who wouldn't!), this game might be for you, but only if you don't mind Clue to begin with.

RATING: 3
A deduction game that transposes the Cluedo mansion to the streets of Turin, populates those streets with the members of a Nordic rock band, turns one of them into an evil wolf god, and ends when an organ is played.  That sounds like it could be some wild fun, doesn't it?

Sadly, while Cluedo takes a snappy 45 minutes, 011 trudges on and on for well beyond the published 90 minutes.  And what you're doing is simply wandering about picking up enough clue tokens to take a look at the cards in each player's hand.  There is a sub-system to place the organ, although its location scarcely matters.  Then there is a convoluted bidding system to determine turn order that slows things down a lot for insufficient purpose.  Player interaction lies comatose until half way through the game, when a random player becomes the incarnation of the wolf and seeks to kill the organist before s/he can play.

The one element that deserves to be salvaged is the interlinked cogs that turn to determine your action, how far you can move and a mode of transport for this player turn - think a triple rondel.  

I liked the game's 19th Century gothic artwork.  However, the plastic character figures are tiny and quite hard to distinguish.

I only played through a demo (and ended up abandoning the game half-way through)but this is a classic example of a game with lots going on but nothing really much to do.  It's full of neat ideas (like the gear/rondels) and some ambitious approaches to turning a detective story into a game, but ultimately there wasn't much to this one.

I'd be curious to see what Valtriani does next though.

The main event of our Friday night session was this deduction game. 5 players (Me, Brian, Flo, Jamie and Peter). One negative I had was the length of the game, which ran about 2 hours and 15 minutes with rules explanation. This will obviously go down with repeat plays. I love deduction games. Any game where there is some sort of hidden information just really appeals to me. In this game, you are trying to find out the identity of the Chosen One, which is 1 of 8 characters. Each player starts with 1 character in their hand. Gameplay is actually fairly simple. First up is bidding for Turn Order, which can be very important. What do you bid with? Your Time, of course! Each player starts with 45 Time. If you get to 0, you are eliminated. Different spots in Turn Order are good depending on the Event card that shows up. Players then influence one of the 8 characters on the board, which gives you an ability for the turn and tells you that that character is the one you will be moving during your turn. The abilities are to Investigate (look at cards in other players hands, etc.), Get Music (you need to get to 15 (or 12) to win the game), draw Tiles, get Time back, etc. This leads me to one more negative about the game, and it is a big one. The models, while very nice, are almost impossible to tell which is which on the card where you influence them. We figured it out after a while, but it does significantly slow down the game. I think I will come up with something (maybe a dab of paint on the heads of the minis) to try to differentiate them. Moving the minis on the board can allow you to pick up Clue tokens, which increase the effectiveness of your Investigate actions. Eventually, the organ will be placed on the board. The Organ, you didn't mention that??!!??? The Organ is added by placing Tiles at the top of the board that will pinpoint the location of it. For example, if you place the museum tile below the Organ, that means that the Organ will be above the museum on the board. Once 4 tiles are placed (or maybe 3) the Organ comes onto the board at 1 of the spots where it geographically will fit. To win, you must move the Chosen One to the Organ and have 15 on the music track. Or, have 12 on the track and move and kill the Chosen One if you're the Wolf. Yes, another complication. At the beginning of the 5th turn, each player gets a card which tells them their Loyalty. One player will be the Wolf of Fenrir and their win condition changes. The Wolf must also discard Tiles showing 2 wolf head symbols (looked like about a third of the Tiles had the symbol). This was how I won, actually. So, is the game good? Yes!! It is actually a lot of fun. Trying to most efficiently Investigate cards, get Tiles, move on the music track, all without using too much Time, it all works together well. The production quality is also very good for the game, aside from the issues with the minis. I will hold onto this one, as I think it offers a different feel to many other deduction games and it is unique enough to get people to play it.

Others say: Cluedo-like but overstays its welcome as you spend too much time walking around looking for clues and passing clues among players.  Games usually last only 6-7 of the possible 11 rounds, thus the traitor (revealed on round 5) only has 1-2 turns to try to win.

A muddled mess of a game that had me clawing my eyes out about half way in.

It felt like there would be a lot more of interest in this, but in the end, it's too much fiddly for not enough payout and I would have rather had the 2+ hours spent on this one doing something else, like calculating the binary values of arbitrary numbers.

The game marries beautifully about Cluedo, BSG, Mr. Jack, and Arkham Horror. You need to find the Chosen One (Cluedo) which is some kind of savior, but one of you might be the one to kill him/her (BSG), to find them you must pick a character and use their ability and move them (Mr. Jack) in various location on map and gathering clues to help you (Arkham Horror).

The bonus mechanic is also unique, and limited actions in total one game (not one round) makes it very different with any other game. Also, while it's semi-coop with traitor, there's only one winner. There's no all hero side win together. But strangely the mechanic doesn't make one player (that's not the traitor) try to sabotage the main goal. This is truly quite unique game.

I have been a big fan of Therion for nearly about a half of my life - of course I was interested about the board game related to the band. So it was one of my main interests at Essen 2011. Although the mechanics of the game are not my favorites, I wanted to get to play the game at least once. It's not bad game if you like detective games, it's just not my favorite genre so if those game mechanics are pleasant for you, then you should give it a try. Steampunk artwork is gorgeous and plastic band member figures are cool!

Really like the mechanic where you can move any piece as you are not playing one character, however strategic placement of clues, playing pieces etc, seems null and void due to the sheer number and accessibility of the public transports.

The hidden traitor mechanic is nice but the game is usually over very quickly after loyalties are given. (typical games are only lasting until turn 6-7 of 11) and so the Fenrir player only has a single turn really to maneuver all the pieces into place.

The powers on the various characters also seem a bit hit and miss. The woman who gives +2 search grossly over powered and the guy who can put clues in landmark buildings a little underpowered.

That said, despite my small complaints, I really like this game and all its clunky goodness. :)

Quite beautiful components, the artwork is a really good job. Miniatures are a bit tricky to identify sometimes, albeit we didn’t have a hard time with that along the game.

Blending in mechanics from known eurogames and some elements from deduction games, this is not a bad try at all. Four or five players is the best option. Some actions may result nonsense at times and the tension could decrease due to monotony in some turns, but overall I’ve enjoyed the game experience. The story behind is bizarre but at least is original and matches the game mechanics, more or less. Rules are easy to grasp and have no holes.

It's a game that features a real rock band, and the theme is loosely based on being a muscian, but it is a glorioussly fun game despite my low expectations. I would describe it as Mr. Jack x Arkham Horror x Clue. Gorgeous bits and it works despite any sane reason otherwise. I would love to see this with Fenrir (I played a 3 player game). The hidden traitor element feels like what will take the game to the next level.

An awful rehash of a few euro mechanics grafted to a deduction game.  It does have a very unique theme.  It is pretty complex, using a lot of different mechanics to distract the players from the fact that not too much is actually happening.  Also runs too long for what it is.  You spend the early turns trying to get an efficient peek at other people's cards, trying to collect music, grabbing tiles, or grabbing the ? tokens to make later turns more efficient.  Later on you concentrate more on looking at cards since after people play some things out of their hand it becomes more efficient.

The triple rondel (with gears)is sort of a neat gimmick, and the worker placement role selection combined with the auction for turn order is interesting.  The board movement is not especially unique and often has little effect on the game from a turn to turn basis.  Sometimes there are a lot of clue tokens to pick up and other times there isn't much to do.  The clue-style deduction is a decent rehash of that mechanic, but the effect of luck in choosing random cards to look at someone's hand feels too strong for the tightly balanced action point optimization game.  The traitor mechanic is totally pasted on and really doesn't add a whole lot to the game in my opinion.  

The game is not that much fun, the decisions it presents you with are not terribly interesting, and the mechanics are basically a frankenstein's monster of european optimization mechanics grafted onto a deduction game.  All that might warrant an average or below average rating, but when you consider the length and complexity of the game, and compare it to other games of similar length and complexity, it really is a stinker.

A lot happening in this beautiful game. There are a bunch of elegant mechanics - the gears, the use of time for everything, the turn order auction, the event cards, the fact that the "traitor" isn't determined until the fifth turn and so on. I'm most bothered by the language- independancy. Some of the cards and tiles have quite complex meanings which don't come across well through symbols, so there's a lot of stopping to look things up - just as it's hard to identify the characters from the tiny symbols on the miniature bases. It's difficult to strategize in this game because of the constant change. Challenging!

Talán a leggémerebb dedukciós játék, amivel játszottam. Elsőre kicsit sok a szabály, főleg ahhoz képest, hogy alapvetően nem egy bonyolult játék. Sok mechanika keveredik benne, de szerintem jól sikerült mix, egységesnek, jól működőnek éreztem. A táblán a műanyag figurákról nem mindig könnyű megállapítani, hogy melyik karakterhez tartoznak, ez igényel egy kis plusz figyelmet. Azt hiszem, alapvetően 7-est adnék neki, de mivel a téma közel áll hozzánk, ráadásul az egyik kedvenc zenekarunk fotói, dalkottái az illisztrációk... nos. :)

This is Cluedo evolved. 011 has some minor flaws mostly related to visual design, like the hardly differentiable figurines (can be easily solved by adding colored stickers). It can also prove to be very difficult comprehending all the elements during initial play - but it becomes logical towards the end when all the different details form a unity in the player's mind. The pretty well-designed mechanics of the game deliver a long duration of gameplay. The cooperative rivalry is a refreshing element, as even if there is one "winner", only willful collaboration can bring about a successful end because there is also an unknown impostor who plays for the demise of the other players.

Pros:

011 has some interesting mechanics such as gears that turn every round and make only certain moves available to you, a deduction element where you are trying to figure out who the traitor is by looking at their cards one by one, a time track that doubles as both your resources and a game ending condition, and variable player powers in the form of the members of the metal band, Therion. 

Cons:

Unfortunately, the game can induce a lot of AP and not much to do between turns. It also runs a bit too long.

Interessante gioco ambientato a Torino, gioco differente e originale. Il gioco è un semicooperativo ma sarà sempre un unio giocatore a vincere (oppure tutti a perdere). Per cominciare abbiamo 2 obiettivi di vittoria a seconda del ruolo: Prescelto o Posseduto. I ruoli verranno determinati casualmente e segretamente alla quinta ORA del gioco. Il gioco ha una fase di scoperta indizi, che può ricordare alla lontana Cluedo, e una fase di asta con successivi movimenti su mappa integrati da azioni speciali. Il gioco soffre di tempi morti, soprattutto con l'aumento del numero dei giocatori; d'altro canto con l'aumentare del numero di giocatori diventa interessante e importante l'asta che assegna le priorità di movimento, i bonus speciali e la scelta personaggi con relative abilità. Nel complesso considero 011 un buon gioco, da approfondire e provare, al gioco non manca una spruzzatina di fortuna. Le miniature di plastica sono carine, il problema è che tra di loro non si riconoscono e necessitano di segni identificativi o di essere dipinte/colorate.

Rating after one play: I like the theme. There might be a good game in it. But the production ruined the experience for me. The plastic miniatures are sadly too difficult to differentiate. Also I didn't find the gear that much interesting. They seemed to make the decision longer for few additional fun. So turns lasted longer than needed. No point in planning ahead as other people could ruin your turn and the map is to difficult to decipher. With better components it might be a decent game.

My wife absolutely hated this ("I wouldn't even give it a 3") but you know, I quite enjoyed it. She prefers deduction games based on logic, but this is down to luck - you need to deduct the "chosen one" by looking at the cards of your opponents. Just the way I like it!

OK, there's not a lot of critical decisions to make, but I had fun. And yes, those miniatures are too difficult to pick out in your first few games, while the steampunk story is ridiculous. But while I'd never pick the game up (she'd kill me) I thought this was as much fun as Fury of Dracula, and a whole lot better than pure deduction or chase games like Cluedo or Letters from Whitechapel. 

UPDATE: Played six player, far too slow and dull. Fell flat. Too many uninteresting, arbitary mechanics, and felt like it needed a polish. Played twice, could be tempted to play a 3-4 player game, but probably finished with this now. Not good for an $80 game.

This is supposed to be steampunk themed, but aside from pictures of the band Therion on some cards used, there's a lot more steam than punk to this game.
The idea is to figure out who The Chosen One is and escort him to the...wait for it...The Inscrutable Organ of Eternity.
Sounds like a bad porn movie.
Anyway, by the end of the game, which is at midnight, we were all ready to expire.
This is a deduction game, wrapped in many layers of tedium.

Wanted this game for a while now and it showed up at Origins from one of the vendors there. $65.00 later and 1 play, the game is okay. Bidding mechanics and the loss of time were fun, but the main draw was that it was a game created through the band Therion which had me interested. One of my fave bands of all time did an okay job on a board game. The art and theme is different and much appreciated but the gameplay with 6 people playing can be nauseating while waiting for your turn to come around. This would play better as a 4 player game at most.

I jumped at this because the theme is amazing, even if you don't know much about Therion (the Swedish metal band from which the themes are drawn and whose members are the characters in the game), and because I heard a review describe it as "Clue on steroids", which sounded fairly promising for a neat deduction game.

Unfortunately, though it satisfies when it comes to theme (just read the description from the box), I found it really fails as a deduction game.  Rather than a more complex Clue, it seems to me that it's Clue with fewer dimensions, so few as to make deduction trivial; you simply use process of elimination, in the simplest sense of the term, to determine what cards must be where.  

I'm still keeping this game forever.

A fantastic journey into the heart of a steam punk city. The Art is amazing and the rotating gears help move the game along and give players choices to work with. Some of the actions seemed unnecessary but overall a great game.

Очень высоко требование к количеству игроков. С предателем играется только в варианте от 4 игроков. Оформление игры на любителя. Фигурки Персонажей похожи друг на друга и с трудом различаются на игровом поле. Механика смесь детективного жанра и ходилки. По сравнению с предпродажными ожиданиями, несколько простовата в игре.

Played with Gal, Roni, Nir, Hila, Doron.

Nice mechanic with the 3 sprockets as means of user-action selector. Also the days counter is a great choice for the only available and finite resource and is the basis for tension.

However the gameplay itself is so-so. The deduction is not accumulative, you have to gather almost all information before you can actually act, so if you dont have all the info you have to guess, but there is not so much to base your guess on.

Mostly the downtime was really bad. With 6 players it took us 5 hours.

It's okay.  It's really not a well-built game.  I like the idea, but it's mostly uninteresting.  The gears-as-a-triple-rondel system seemed cool at first, but I find that the gears tend to have little impact on the game.  It really matters more if you can get lucky when pulling cards out of your opponents' hands.  There is a traitor mechanic, but it is so useless as to just seem shoehorned in for the sake of variety.  All the traitor mechanic really does is make it so one of the other players has a slightly different path to take to win the game.  I wouldn't mind playing it, but the "slightly boring" aspect of this rating surely applies.

A big mess of a game, way too long for what it offers (which ain't much).
The figures are hard to distinguish (and so is most of the art), the interaction is minimal and their is a real possibility of disruptive gameplay (organ, werewolf, end game, ...).

Players take control of members of Swedish symphonic metal band Therion (what) who must wander the streets of Turin, composing the Song of Making so that the Chosen One can play on the Inscrutable Organ of Eternity (seriously) to avert Ragnarok.

It's billed as a deduction game, which is ludicrous; there are eight characters and both victory conditions require identifying which is the Chosen One, but there are no lemmas and no logic, just repeatedly taking the Investigate action to look at all of the cards -- it is more properly thought of as some sort of track to be completed.

011 is actually an efficiency game: a race to complete both the Music track and the (virtual) Chosen One track. This is handled through role selection -- choosing character X lets you draw tiles, make investigations, regain Time Points etc. -- and through taking the action indicated by the rondel. The real trick is that the rondel action can be boosted by playing clue tokens, which have to be collected through movement on the game board. Characters (roles) with better abilities might not be well-placed to collect clues. As the clues are placed by players after turn order is auctioned off, placing and collecting them adds both a layer of second-guessing and a route-optimization puzzle.

The problem is that, while this is the most interesting part of the game, clues are not actually required -- rather, they mitigate luck factors in blind tile and card draws. Make no mistake: 011 is a game where it is better to be lucky than good. Unfortunately, it does not play quickly, in no small part because of the layers of pointless sub-games, like the bizarre placement/discovery of the Inscrutable Organ, and because clue collection can induce AP hell even though it confers relatively minor rewards.

It's like someone had a lot of good ideas, but instead of polishing them into interesting games they just threw them together and into production. There's got to be a great game playable with these components, just not with the rules included in the box.

That's a pity, because the components are great. The lavish production does have some issues (notably it is difficult to distinguish the identifying rune on the miniatures) but it's a great looking game.

Wonderfully atmospheric design!  It plays well with three, though I've yet to try it with enough players to bring Fenrir into it.  It seems as though a typical game would rarely last as long as 11 rounds, but perhaps with more players complicating things ...

I'm thinking it might be best to at least paint the runes on the figure bases so that they're easier to see at a glance.  There are also a few spaces on the board--plazas and a garden--where it's not clear from the rules whether they can be walked on or not.  I've been led to believe that "not" is the case, but it would have been nice to have that in the rules to begin with.  I don't love the title, though I've nothing to suggest for a better one.  Looking at the box cover, it's not even clear that "011" is the title since it blends in with the artwork so well.  How should one pronounce it aloud anyway: "zero one one", "aught eleven", "eleven", "naught one one", "three" (translated from the binary :) ), etc. ?  And yes, I've seen This Is Spinal Tap and thought of the "Our game goes up to eleven." joke too.  Also, be careful tightening the screws that hold the gears and the clock hand in place--the clock hand on my board started to break off because the screw was too tight.  I also thought it might be worth investing in a cloth bag to hold the research tiles.  Then I wouldn't have to worry about shuffling such a large stack and discarded ones could simply be placed to one side.  I had my wife make one out of a wonderfully steampunk-y fabric we found, and it looks quite nice.

I'm told that "011" is the area code for Turin.

Marco created a really interesting game here. It's very easy to play and smooth, and the atmospheres, the gameplay and the overall feeling is of great fun.
I'm not much of a fan of how the modular nature of the phases is very evident, to the point that it feels like you're playing several different games and not one. In other words, the rules of each part of the game aren't very smoothly integrated.
But the game itself is quite nice and easy to teach and learn. The setting is very well integrated with the rules.

Great looking components, though functionality is low since it's a sea of biege. The game plays like a random jumble of mechanics that individually sound cool but are mostly pointless. We didn't finish the game since it was so monotonous.

Steampunk artwork is very nice, good components, good flavour overall. Sadly the game isn't that good. Few strategies and a bit boring (based on just one game with the author).

So I have played it once. 
I think the game had very good potential but few things are messing things up. I like the components, and mechanic idea with three "clock's". Things I don't like...
- Miniatures, don't get me wrong. They are looking very nice. But when you are trying to fast find someone on board then there is a problem. Of course there is special symbol which helps recognize characters, but it's placed in front of basement and just there. That is the thing that realy slows the game. But what's good this is issue which you can somehow fix. Paint bases or something.
- Fenris player. Is it just me or he has much easier task?
- Organ. In our game the Organ position wasn't even known when Fenris finished the game.

Amazing fun.

When I introduced this to a group of friends that know I am a gamer I got a couple of replies:

"This is the best gamer ever!"

and more depressingly:

"This is the best game you've got!"

It deserves its reputation in the pantheon of dexterity games.  Points deducted only because it requires batteries and I don't own it (nor feel compelled to purchase one).  Though my wishlist says otherwise.

Possibly the most fun game for parents and their kids that I have ever played.  Ok, so for some critics this would be "just a dexterity game" or a "kid's game," but in both categories it's just about in the best couple of games I've played - and I think the best of any type deserves to be a 9-10.

It's a bit addictive and everyone who plays it seems to love it.  Yep, you can get the adults to play this for ages, too!  We play that if you're out of tokens and you can make Louie stand up vertically, you can get a token back, and we cheer anyone who can make him loop the loop. We also regularly declare and play "the World Championships" between us. It's a game that needs some skill. With practise, you can (sometimes) get the plane to flip just right onto any of the other three player's chicken tokens in a way that means they cannot defend the dive you get Louie to produce.  And what a great idea to have the adjustable paddles to give the kids more of a chance against you when you get that good!

Tried this very cute dexterity game last night.  I don't normally care for dexterity games, but this was a barrel of laughs and the catchup mechanism keeps everyone involved to the end, though the player with the best technique will usually win.  Can't believe it didn't sell well in the US....

RATING: 7
04+, 2-4 players, best with 4, 10 mins. New version. More silly fun. Played 8 or 10 3-player games one after the other, with N and V tying for the win. Need a solid table for this game and also need to find a balance between excited violence and calm and deadly skills! Much laughter. (It would be ridiculous to record every separate game of this so will just try to record an estimate and the days on which we play it.) Not sure why this is the top rated children's game. Yes, it is fun but it is very quick fun and there seems to be quite a bit of Louie looping that can't be dealt with no matter how skilled the player, e.g. when Louie flies over the centre and lands right on top of a row of chickens.

many dex games, like carabande, i find enjoyable but i don't rate them very highly and i wouldn't want to own them.  the reason has mostly to do with however pleasant the game might be, i just couldn't picture it getting removed from its box.  replay can be a factor too.  loopin' louie is perhaps similar in these respect.  i honestly wouldn't know until i owned it, and i probably won't.  but i have to rate this one higher, because it is that fun.  you can destroy the person to your right pretty easily, but hitting people across and to your left is more of an artform.  i like the original version's action much better.

This is a kids game.  Only kids should like it right?  Well, pull up a chair and let Louie loose on the chicken coups and you'll find that everyone is having a good time.  A nice game to set up on a side table at a game night and let players casually experience the game.  You'll find people in a good mood as they flip Louie around the barnyards.  The novelty of the game can and will wear off, but as an occasional distraction - its a great kids game.  [GTI: TGSL]

Good stupid fun for 5-15 minutes at a time.  I consider this to be a filler for adults.  Can be enjoyed equally well by adults as well as children.  Be sure to use buttons if missing tokens.  I'm looking forward to the drinking game variant.  

Plays best with 4 players.

This game really needs to be reprinted and sold at the big retailers.

One of those games that's awesome for about five minutes then your happy you never actually payed money for it.  Weee! then, meh.


*Update* And then my nephews get old enough to play games.  I'll give it a 7.  It has it's place, but after playing it with them for thirty minutes, I think I need to take a month break from it.

*Update - Update* Then I play it with bunches of random people (up to a 9).  Still easy to over-play.

OK, so really this is much closer to a toy than it is to being a game.  That being said it is a ton of fun for adults and kids.  It's one of those things where everyone has so much fun playing that they instantly start setting up for the next game immediately after finishing the first.  And it's such a simple game system.  You simply try to time your flipper so that you knock Louie away from your chickens.

I find myself wishing there was a little more length to this game.  A "game" literally can take less than 1 minute.  It feels like there needs to be just a little bit more to the game in order to safely classify it as a game rather than a toy.  We've tried playing that you score points equal to the number of tokens you have left when you win and the player with the most points after a number of rounds wins.  That seemed to work OK.

This is far too much fun for me...the fact that I can play this with grups AND kids makes it that much more valuable. The sight of four adults hunched around this puppy is pricesless. 

My only complaint is that I get a bit tense while playing it, knowing it's hard to get a hold of a copy.

Fun game to play with kids. I bought it to play with my nephews. Its a little bit annoying that the chickens keep falling down if you push to hard on the "button" that is supposed to make Louie fly away and protects your chickens. Rule book has a very dumb rule that says "You can keep your left hand on the game, which will make it more stable and prevent chickens from accidentally falling down from pushing the button, but you can not keep your left hand there constantly, you have to remove it at least once every time Louie makes a lap". This rule makes no sense to me at all? And try to explain that to the kids..

Umm. OK. It&#039;s more fun to watch than it is to play, and it&#039;s less fun to watch than it is to watch someone play Puerto Rico. I give it a 4 because I had to play it a second time. Doubt I&#039;ll ever play it again.

Pretty fun, but I don't think near as good as some other BGGer's claim to think.  I can't really imagine getting it out with just adults.

For kids, the think its cool, but there actually is a fair bit of needed dexterity here, specifically timing, and its kind of hard.

Above average dexterity game for kids & adults.  Huge box & semi-fragile components (especially when kids are involved).  Strategy tip: tap the tail of the Louie's plane... it makes him do cool flips which (for me) work better to protect my chips than light taps on the front wheels.

Wonderful fun, gets played more than any other game at our house by children under 5, by far. but has the weakness that holding down the levers protects your chickens almost all the time. It's not as good a strategy as an adult can devise, but it's good enough that it blocks kids from willingness to experiment. 

Probably the most asked-for game in our house. It can't stay on the shelf.

Having attended an event where a group of children played this with great enthusiasm, I thought this would be a good grab for my son.  I would have rated the game perhaps a 6/10 at the time; unfortunately having now owned it, at best I can give it a 3...

We managed to play only two games using new (2-AA) batteries purchased just hours earlier, before the batteries died.  Worse, it only took me those two games to realize that if you're in control, there's a sweet spot that you can play to your advantage that prevents others from even touching Louie.

I do still enjoy this game but it has lost something but I do give it higher marks due to accessibility.

For what it is, this is a tonne of fun.  Glad I managed to pick up a copy of this from the UK when I was there.  Bobbin Bumblebee isn't quite as good.

I wrongly thought that a player's actions are quite limited, when I first saw this game played. Now I have played the game myself I learned that I was wrong: a skilled player can exert a lot of control over louie's loopings.

The game is a lot of fun for young and old alike. The possibility to play with mixed skill settings is quite useful when playing with kids. 

I was quite surprised that several adult friends of mine, who I would not classify as boardgamers, claim familiarity with the alcoholic version of this game. ;)

RATING: 6
It's fun in a I have very little control over the outcome kind of way, however, I always feel the game should end as soon as someone is eliminated because hitting someone three away is harder than hitting someone two away is harder that hitting someone one away.

But it plays out very quick and is a game that can be played with kids as well as adults.

This is one of those very weird, very addicting games.  In a span of about 15 minutes, a group of four of us busted through about 5 games.  By the end of the 5th game, there was a crowd of people hovering around the table waiting to see who was going to survive.  In the end, we rotated about 7 players (via musical chairs) and played the game for about 2 hours.

This game is really a lot of fun, and without a doubt is one of the best children's games out there.  Why they decided to stop publishing this in the US is beyond me.  Milton Bradley / Hasbro, bring this sucker back!!!

Initial rating an "8." What a riot! For sheer gaming silliness, this is top notch. Only Ca$h n Gun$ caused me to laugh out loud like this.

The sobered part of me wonders what kind of replay this has, and what it plays like with less than four players, blah blah blah. But for now, after two plays, this is a clever, enjoyable, wonderful dexterity game that has to be great for gaming with kids.

Update: So, with a number of nieces and nephews and children of friends, I started picking up some kids games, and saw this classic was back in print. It has totally delivered. This game is like crack for kids, and they just keeping wanting to play it. I'm very glad I picked this up. The sheer amount of times we played this over Thanksgiving alone was reason enough to buy it.

Absolute hilarity for my daughter trying to keep her chickens safe from Louie and being able to hit the plane, spin it around, and take out my chickens. Even my 2 year old was getting in on being able to hit the plane. Great family fun in about 5-10 minutes and easily handles repeat plays. Very happy to have found this awhile back and finally gotten it out for her to play. A children's game everyone with little ones should try at least once.

Hungry Hungry Hippos with 3D vector movement.  Seriously folks, this is a _kids_ game, a good one no doubt but who over the age of 10 really wants to play this more than once or twice?  I'm a kid at heart and it held my interest for about 15 minutes...when I have a kid, I'll get one for him/her and play but come on, _tournaments_?

This childish activity soars off the fun meter more than anything I`ve seen before. Had to buy 3 copies , so I would be able to engage 12 people at the same time. Sometimes we have over 50 relatives over for special occasions and this crazy toy never ceases to engage young and old. Oh those wonderful men in their flying machines. They go up-ti-yi-up-up. They go down-ti-yi-
down-down Up! Down! Flying around. Making a loop and defying the ground. Some older geeks will get this song tidbit I`m sure. C`mon sing along. See now the melody
is in your head and it won`t let go.

RATING: 7
Another game where you have to accept it for what it is: silly fun. We regularly pull this out when kids want to play a game, or as a filler to waste a few minutes between "real" games.

One difference between this and many other games for children is that Loopin' Louie is actually quite fun for adults because there is a skill component instead of just randomness. Not a lot of skill, mind you... but enough that it's fun for everyone to try once in a while.

Also great as a decision maker when deciding who gets to pick the next game you'll play.

Got half of the folks at work to order for their kids also!

RATING: 6
A children's dexterity game.  Players are trying to protect their three chicken disks from Louie.  Louis is a barnstormer, flying a biplane around the playing area.  He's whips around on a counterweighted boom, and will flick your chickens off if you don't deflect his flight path.  This is done by flipping a lever which tosses him over your barn.  The trick is to flick it just high enough to clear another players lever, and collect one of their chickens.  Hilarious fun if played in short bursts.

Fun dexterity game. Only really works with exactly four. People of any age/skill can take part, though smaller children (<6) may struggle slightly to get timing right. Occasionally a palpable hit doesn't knock the chickens off because the token is leaning at the wrong angle; we nudge it into the right position for the next hit and chalk it up to luck. Recommended. Rating would be 9 for kids I suspect!

What's not to like?  This fun dexterity game plays in only a few minutes, which means that you end up playing more and more and more...  I have the original in perfect condition (lucky score on ebay in a garage sale game lot) and it has a really great feal to the plane.  With practice you can aim old Louie right at your various opponents' chickens.  Needless to say, kids adore this game.

Excellent. Always a hit with children and one of those rare games in which adults and children are on pretty even ground, i.e. very little competitive advantage for adults.

I particularly relish smack talking at 4 year olds, boasting about how I'm going to bomb their chickens during play. Psy Ops, in the finest tradition.

I'm not saying I dislike it, but it's hugely overrated. Should not be the highest-rated kids game. Sumo Ham Slam certainly looks at least as good. La Cucaracha, which I used to have, is better. In short, meh. 
(I'm willing to entertain the idea that with the right group of motivated adults, this could be some fun, but I apparently don't know that group of people.)

Great as a quick warm-up to get people in a mood to listen to rules.  Just know you can't pull it out every time unless you want it to wear out its welcome.  I'm intrigued by the 8 player mod.  If the game were cheaper I'd definitely pick up another one to try it out.  If you have younger players at all it's definitely worth the extra cash to pick up.

Personally I give it a 5. I would probably never choose to play this unless it was an in-between time killer, but I bring it to my school when we have some recreational time and there are always a bunch of kids who love to play it and constantly ask that I bring it.

RATING: 7
Really fun game.  Took a bit to put all the decals on (Louie's eyes look a bit weird, but it was hard putting them on any better).  And took a bit to understand the strategy (similar to Hungry Hungry Hippos (where you try to get all the marbles and winner has the most marbles; but instead you're trying to lift Loopin' Louie up and away into the air, thus keeping him from diving down and knocking your 3 coins into their slot) but more fun).  Definitely not a 10 min. game in 2-player form.  More like 2 or 3 min., and probably a minute or two longer when kids play it.  Definitely would like to play it again, but with 3 or 4 players instead if possible.  One rules correction:  The printed directions said to use a C size battery.  Wrong.  My copy of the game uses 2 AA size batteries instead.

I got this at a thrift store, and I immediately wanted more for gifts, and everyone who has played wants a copy.  How sad that they are so difficult to find.

A great battery-operated dexterity game.  Don't be fooled into believing that this is a kids game, adults love it.

RATING: 6
I am definitely happy to have this one and it does live up to its cult status. I say that because it wouldn't have deserved to fall into obscurity, and thanks to adult geeks, it didn't. It's a pleasant dexterity game with some nice thrills. Could overstay its welcome for sure. Not sure how it gets so many 10 ratings, but given what other goddamn trash kids get as games these days, LL is cream.

I'm not quite sure how or why, but this is the most fun anyone could have playing a game. It's so silly and fun yet very addictive and plays quickly. This is by far the best filler game ever created.

I was sceptical at first, but after finding a copy in a thrift store for a dollar that was in like new condition and complete. I couldn't resist. Especially after hearing so much about it here on the geek. Well after playing over 40 games in 2 days I can honestly say that everyone should own a copy of this awesome game. Just for the laughter alone it is worth it. FUN FUN FUN!!!!

Also it is great for any ages. I even had my 88 year old grandmother playing and laughing her ass off and the kids will absolutely love this game.

Kids love it, quick (usually way under 5 minutes) and simple. Completely over-hyped, but a decent game for what it is. (Certainly better than "Hungry, Hungry, Hippos", etc.) 

After a few plays, its easy to adjust your hits to consistantly skip opponents ramp and pick their chickens off. Not much point in playing after that.

Got this for my sons.  Not that great.  If you hit the paddle too hard, your own chicken falls through.  It's too easy to hit Louie consistently so that he skips over the next 1-2 players, which makes every game feel a bit samey instead of unpredictable and chaotic.  I'm wondering if a little oil will make him spin around more unpredictably.  I sorta wish he spun around faster.  /shrug

Yes, it's a children's game. Yes, it's over in a matter of minutes (or less). Yes, all the hype is very well deserved. This game is just downright F-U-N! I would echo all the other comments about how adults enjoy it as much (if not more) than kids. It can become very competitive very quickly, but is short enough to allow for plenty of grudge matches and chances for revenge. The adults I've played it with all make the same comment, "This is a kids game?". Yeah, it is, but it's also lots and lots of fun and has a wonderful ability to bring out the hidden "kid" in those who play. This will be one that I will probably end up owning several copies of so that I can accommodate more of our youth group during the same gaming session.

The only downside to this game is that its really best with 4 player.  It is good at 2 player.  With 3 player, the player with an opponent on each side of him will almost never touch Louie and the player with nobody to his left will have an advantage.

Good stupid fun! Don't let him steal your chickens! I like the way louie seems to move so naturally like a barnstormer.  You do have some control, in that how you hit Louie, will determine where he lands.  Do it right, and your opponents won't get a shot back at him.  

Probably prefer slightly to the newer small Eurpean edition.  However for the art and extra humor of the Japanese edition, I score these the same.  What's nice about the original is 

1.  It's much larger, about double sized.

2.  Has an airplane noise maker adding to the theme.

Japanese version "Kururin Panic" has the best art on the box and game of any of the Louie editions.  Physically the game is identical to the small European edition.  The newer smaller edition has some differences to the original.  

1. It's much smaller, about 1/2 size.

2. There is no "airplane" noise maker in the base

3. The bumpers come to a point instead of a flat plank in the original.

4. The Louie figure seems a bit more acrobatic, and can spin some awesome manevers.

Once that you figure out the timing and power to hit the "lever" it is kind of "solved", but everyone is always laughing throughout the game.  The version that I played had buttons with chicken stickers applied for the long lost tokens, they worked very well.  We switch seats every couple of rounds to keep it fair.  It does have a "screw the player to your right" situation.

This is my absolute favorite drinking game. Despite being unbelievably simple this game becomes an absolute riot once you add shots as punishment for failure. There's enough skill involved to make it interesting, especially if you decide to gun for a specific opponent. My only complaint is that in the original version Louie flies a bit too slow, though this can be fixed with modifications.

Thrift store purchase. 

You really have to be careful with where you sit in relation to other players. The game can be very unbalanced otherwise if playing with younger players. We've played with switching seats (if requested by a player) and keeping the amount of tokens left, if with tournament rules. 

Fun anyway, though.

A hit in a second grade class.

This is a blast for about 5-10 minutes.  It is a hit with the younger crowd, but suffers from table bounces and "sticky eggs" which don't fall off when hit.  

Other than that, I see this as a diversion from real game playing.  If you want to really look at airplane tactics in a family game, I suggest Wings of War.

Ok, seriously now - this is the highest ranked children's game on bgg? Is this some sort of elaborate hoax? I am really at a loss. I mean, the game is fun for a couple of minutes (maybe as many minutes as it takes to assemble it and apply all those stickers). My daughter and her friends (around five years old) gave it a try and then abandoned it nearly immediately. In some cases, they couldn't be bothered to hit the buttons at all. For me it was as forgettable. There is no development in the game, it seems to just be over at some point. It is mercifully short, at least if you aren't an expert yet, but why would you want to become one? I mean, I am generally a fan of dexterity games, but this one just falls rather flat. I should probably deduct another point for the fact that the publisher (MB) didn't even bother to come up with some sort of a background story for this.

Tremendously fun kids game. A bit more involved than Hungry Hungry Hippos, requiring a little bit more skill and rewarding it, which makes it more fun for adults. Less robust than "Hippos" though. Kids slamming the arms too hard will knock their own chicken tokens off. Still, great fun and a nicely executed concept. Not one for the hardcore gamer, but addictive as hell, especially to the children you're playing it with, which pretty means you play it a lot too.

Grab some alcohol, grab some friends, grab someone by the crotch, say 'sorry, I'm drunk', grab some more alcohol. One of those parties. Oh, and play a game, make new friends, grab more alcohol, end with less friends.

Oh you, ol' Loopin' Louie, always messin' with people's lives.

As an adult I would still play this if only to keep confirming its not quite as fun as people seem to make it.  When I've played I sort of feel like everyone is just "spamming" their levers not unlike how you might in Hungry Hungry Hippos.  Not unlike that game you will do better (and likely enjoy the game much more) if you try to put just a little more thought into exactly when you hit your lever. Ultimately though you can overthink it just the same such that you'll still get better results just hitting the lever over and over.  Still it can be fun when the plane hangs in the air a bit but I tire of it pretty quickly and think I prefer other dexterity games more that focus on stacking, flicking, or even sliding.  For something with levers I much prefer Battleground: Crossbows & Catapults.  Our son received Loopin' Chewie as a gift so we didn't need to keep this one.  Loopin' Chewie only plays 3 and its much flimsier than this version.  In fact it barely works and this one is definitely the version to get.  Mine I think was even better as I got the older German version of Loopin' Louie which was really solid and could take a beating.

This game is just plain fun with the right crowd.  If you're looking for strategy or a precise dexterity game look elsewhere.

There seems to be some skill involved in Looping Louie.
Louie will perform consistent manoeuvres depending on the magnitude and application point of the force from the paddle to the plane.  Its not precise by any means, but there definitely are moves you can make to target other players.

Fun for kids and adults.

Guess it must be great fun to play it when being boozed, but never experienced that myself. As far as I know it is widely valued as a drinking game with younger adults. There are even pimped versions around (search on YouTube).

The rating of 7.0 is in consideration of either constellation. Otherwise it is quite boring (5.5 or so).

Great fun for children ... and the right crowds.
When playing with children or the right crowd it is a 10 For mindless fun. However can get boring pretty quick.
Ideal as a break after some heavy games. 
After one play most of my friends have bought this for their kids (so they say)
Update 10/04/07 
It appears that everyone is the right crowd. I can't justify only a 7 for this. I can't justify an 8 for such mindless game. I rate it a 7. 5 and it will allways stay there.

This game isn't asked for by my friends down to 7.

Reprinted in 2005, in a somewhat smaller scale, documented in A photo comparison of the Classic and 2006 editions.

Technically, this is a kids' action game, along the lines of Hungry Hungry Hippos. After an appearance at Alan Moon's Gathering of Friends, though, it's had a renaissance.

SOOOOOOO much fun. Got this for $20 bucks at Toy's 'R Us and such a steal for that price. 

Plays are more an estimate of sessions rather than individual games. It's hard to really record how many games you've played of this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An altogether charming and amusing diversion.  Harder than it first looks.  Works well with 2 (each player plays 2 paddles), and best with 4.  Does not play well with 3 because one player has an advantage by having an open area next to him.  

Loopin' Louie is a good opener, filler, or closer.  Who knows, you may get someone interested in the hobby with this.

Poor chickens, I don't know what Louie has got against them. I guess its just a case of wrong place, wrong time but he does seem determined to get my feathered friends.  V. Quick, v. light relief between brain burners.  Score would be higher if had children, or alcohol or if Louie was on fire and it was called Flamin Loopin Louie but I guess that is one of the more extreme variants.

The game itself is more interesting for its high BGG rank and shows the influence of key people and events in the board game community.

I'd heard that LL was a fantastic dexterity game for kids and adults, and now that I've played it agree -- it's fabulous.

There's definitely skill in manipulating your paddle, and a good player to your left is a real problem. Louie makes some devilishly unpredictable swoops, and there are times your paddle just won't help you.

Loopin' Louie is a hoot.

Loopin' Louie, the lunatic pilot, is trying to steal your chickens! The appropriate response is to merely haphazardly whack him back into the air at your convenience, right? Well, maybe not... because with a subtle act of dexterity, you can launch him into your neighbor just to your right. On the other hand, the player to your left can do the same to you, so perhaps it's worthwhile to perfect the move in which you launch Louie up into the stratosphere, only to land on your left neighbor's coop. Tactical decisions abound, the adrenaline-pumping fever of slingshotting Louie around and around is exceptionally satisfying.

The concept is fantastic, but it seems to be a highly positional game.  It is far easier to hit a chicken on your immediate right than it is to hit one in either of the other positions.  Hence, if you have a weak player on your immediate left, you will win.

If the game were redesigned such that force applied was directly proportional to degrees of rotation of Louie (on a direct hit, at least) the game would be truly addicting.  As is, the game is overrated.

More of an activity (toy) than a game.  However, it's surprisingly fun.  I think it would be a fun way to determine start player as a game warm-up!  I rank it as 8 because it feels a certain niche perfectly.

RATING: 8
This qualifies as stupid fun. Check that: It's not stupid at all. It's amazingly simple, and it's fun to watch how Louie moves. It's so repetitive that it doesn't seem like it should have a lot of replayability. But the first day I owned it, I played with it for a couple hours. I even played it by myself, just to watch the plane.

"It is what it is" has never been so appropriate as with this silly little gem. This would be a must-buy for a family with kids or a family with dexterity-game lovers if it wasn't so expensive. Even so, you should still try to get it. Unless you're a fun murderer.

My family found a copy for christmas. I've since played it over 40 times. I have yet to play it with someone who didn't like it. It's simple, but there's enough skill in timing your hits that it's worth trying to be good at. And to boot, my niece loves it! (2007) Crokinole is now my dexterity game of choice. But this is still solid. (2012)

This is probably the best dexterity game ever. Louie is a little motorized plane which
                                                   circles around trying to knock chickens off your barn, but if you hit your paddle at the
                                                   right time, you can send him looping toward your opponents. Amazingly fun, and the
                                                   description doesn&#039;t do it justice.

MB version.  Very sturdy construction.  Louie flys extremely well (he loops and dives).  Dexterity important (not my strength!) but fun to play for anyone.  Very good game for a mix of ages, also a great party game for any ages. 1-5 minutes to play.  I won my very first game I ever played of this (a crowning achievement!).

I got this mostly cause of how high its ranked, but also cause I was told it was better than sorry sliders.

I mean there is actually some strategy and skill in Sliders and I know you can get pretty good at louie, but it feels very wack and see .... perhaps we just don't have the skill yet...

My three and a half year old really enjoyed this one as did I. The fun in trying to knock down the other player’s chicken tokens while protecting your own is immense and one that seems to have a fair bit of replayability.

The game looks great and plays really well and I can certainly see why this is a hit with the youngster (as well as young at heart oldsters too).  I will consider this one for purchase if I see it at the right price - it would make a fine birthday or Christmas present for either of the little fish.

I am re-entering the gaming world after a couple of decades away, and now that I have two young kids, I want them to discover the fantastic world of games as well. So, as part of my entry back into board games, I'm looking for games that we can play together and foster their enthusiasm for games. I purchased this based on it's childrens game ranking, and the constant raves that adults give it. 
After an initial testing session between my wife and I (my wife utterly thrashed me every single time), we introduced this to my three year old. Although she didn't necessarily follow the rules of the game (she kept replacing her lost chickens, thus ensuring she would never lose), her squeals of delight at seeing Louie rocket from one place to the other were enough for me to want to crank this one out again.
She played a couple of other basic kids games, which we thought she might connect with, but when asked which one she liked best she said "the one with the plane." So, a hit already. Cool.

If it's just played with adults, I'm not sure that this one deserves the cult status that it's achieved here.  But my two-year-old sure loves it and it gets extra points for that.  I find this game very, very fun, but I wouldn't pay the asking price for an imported copy to play it myself.  However, I will pay for my kids, so they'll be getting it from Santa this year.

If you live in a country where this is widely available, it's easily worth 15-25 USD.

Kicsit többet vártam Louietól. Az ötlet nagyon jó, a kivitelezés sem rossz, Louie trükkjei pedig lenyűgözőek! A játékmenet azonban nem ragad magával, bár 2 perc alatt nehéz is lenne. Ugyanakkor kb. 3 játék, azaz 10 perc egymás után untig elég belőle.
Oké, oké. Magasan a mérce... Lehet, hogy az embernek egyszerre csak egy addikciója lehet? Sorry Louie, de majmokkal kókuszokat lőni sokkal menőbb.

UPDATE: I now have small kids. That changes things.

I mean: whatever.  It's light, it's fun, it's worth a laugh or two, but more of a curiosity than anything else.  Almost anything you do causes your chicken to fall, so it's very chaotic that way.  And any time you spend playing this means you're not playing an actual game, so I'm not getting the point.  But I'd pick it up on sale or discount just for the sheer wackiness of it.

In this children's dexterity game, Loopin Louie is a battery operated plane attached to a pole, and flies around in a circle to knock off player's disks. Each player has 3 disks, and they have a launch pad mechanism to protect their eggs, and propel Louie just out of reach of their own eggs, but hopefully at a right trajctory to knock off other people's disks. It's actually good for a few laughs, watching Louie twirl around and make flying noises while everyone is frantically hitting their launch pads. The novelty wears off quickly, however.

Played in the tournament at the 2004 GoF and learned to appreciate the game even more! ***UPDATE 4-17-07*** Another GoF tournament and my rating has gone up. Sadly, I only get to play this once a year, but that hour in the tournament is always a highlight of my time in Columbus. Unfortunately, I can't compete with the big dogs, though I usually end up with a couple of wins and 2 or three 2nd places every year. This year's winner won all NINE of his matches... very impressive!

Yes, it's a kids game. That doesn't mean it doesn't make a nice filler, or the neigh perfect drinking game :)

It doesn't really scale, though - two or four players is what works, three isn't all that hot. With more than four players, here's what works for us: four players play, while the rest is waiting to play. The loser of a round leaves the game and joins the waiting queue, and is replaced by the player first in the queue. That way, the players rotate nicely, and nobody has to wait too long. Also, the player positions change over time, which is quite nice as you will discover while playing.

The production is quite poor. Bad materials. The pieces fit loose, and the vibrations can make you drop discs during the gameplay if you don't solve it somehow. The stickers came separately, you have to stick them to the plastic pieces. And the batteries are not included.

Loopin’ Louie is silly fun. It has a pinch of skill, because there's a point where the aviator cannot be stopped, and a careful and well timed launch will drop a disc of your rival. But other than that, it's crazy and random enough for everybody to win and enjoy. Even the longest games last less than 5 minutes and nobody can play just one game.

My main complaint is that it doesn't handle the player elimination that well. It doesn't work well when there are only 2 people left and they are not front to front.  Maybe that’s why they created Loopin’ Chewie as a 4 player game.

People say it's a kid game that adults can enjoy, and they are right.

People may laugh at you when you pull out this children's dexterity game, but your table will soon gather a crowd once everyone sees how much fun you're having.  Ridiculous, silly fun.  Games play fast enough so there's always time for "just one more."  It's a shame they don't make it in North America any more, since not everyone will be willing to shell out $45 for an imported copy, but if you see it sitting around in a garage sale somewhere, DO NOT hesitate to pick it up.  Fun for absolutely everyone!

Simple realtime dexterity game for 4 players. Silly and fun. Usually after a few practice runs I play game(s) with the following "tournament rules": 

Play a round according rules. Winner is the last one to have an egg. Winner now takes away one of his eggs and plays next round with one fewer. Goal is to get rid of your last egg to win a tourney. One extra rule I have found useful is to have a player who dropped out first to switch seats with another player (both keep their egg status as they were in previous seat). This way you're not always on a "bad seat" next to a too good player.

One tourney takes a few minutes which is perfect time for the game. Why I have a feeling I'm taking a kids game a bit too seriously? :-)

[Children's Game] Hilarious action, closely related to Hungry Hungry Hippos.

The new, smaller edition is not as good as the original: The chickens fall when the plane is nowhere near them, and sometimes they do not fall when they get a direct hit.

GINO PILOTINO. E' un giochino per bimbi, ma è divertentissimo. Senza strategia, solo un po' di abilità e confidenza con il gioco, fa sorridere... da provare. Meglio in 4 giocatori o al limite in 2 con due controlli a testa. Direi dai 5 anni anche se può giocarlo chiunque. Tanto divertono le prime partite, quanto stancano dopo un po'. Consigliatissimo un torneo per i più agguerriti.

I've upgraded my score of the game to an 8 thanks to my middle school students who love it and want to play it all the time.  I took the game to the cafeteria at my school without announcing it, set it up and let it run.  Within 15 minutes no fewer than 30 kids (aged 9 to 14) were standing around and cheering the players.  Incredible!

I've seen college students use this as a drinking game. Louie knocks your chickens down; take a shot. Lots of uproarious laughter and yelling. That's the way it should be played if you play it as an adult; inebriated.

Okay.  For me, the game is ranked a five, but the enthusiasm that my middle school students show for it raises the overall rank to 8.

It's on sale at the Toy R Us website for $11.98 as of yesterday (07/07/2016).  Bought three copies as gifts.

A fun, fun, fun dexterity game!  Always brings out laughter from the players.  This is a great game for kids and adults to play together.  Make sure you have a fairly new battery installed when you play this game because it isn't much fun at half-speed.  I picked my copy up at thrift store for AUD$5.00.  Unfortunately, I'm missing 1 chicken token so one of the 4th player's chickens is a round piece of cardboard instead.  I still scour thrift shops, garage sales and flea markets for an elusive chicken token. :-) (UPDATE 31 March 2009 - mirrordude sent me a spare chicken token for 30GG. Thanks!)
I also now have the new edition of Loopin' Louie although I prefer the older, larger version.
UPDATE 12 May 2008 - Traded my new edition in a math trade for Clash of the Gladiators.

I like this game and it is a great party game that absolutely everyone seems to have to play at least one time...no more like 20 times! My wife really does not enjoy this game much, she finds it to be a bit brainless and monotonous! But, she has no problem bringing it out for others to enjoy (including me). I don't feel it is our number one game by any means, but it does see an amazing number of plays at our house! My wife also has a theory that this is probably the ultimate boys game! Guys of all ages are just amazed and fascinated by this game, girls on the other hand seem to loose interest! So if you need the perfect gift for that special boy in your life...this is definitely it!

It seems impossible not to have fun with this one. The trick is to not attack the person on your right until the person on your left is gone. Downside is that it's clearly best with the full count of 4 players, but I've also had lots of fun with the kids with less players, putting myself in the weakest position. We play with the "tournament" rules, where the winner loses 1 chicken from their starting position, and keep playing rounds until someone starts a game with 1 chicken and wins a round, and they're the overall winner. That provides a game of about the right length that's a lot of laughs with the kids.

Fast, real time.
Lots of laughs guaranteed.
The theme is absolutely nuts: a plane that crashes into farms taking their chikens.
A little bit of dexterity, a lot of randomness.
The main problem is it only works really well with four players. It's lame for me otherwise as it is much harder to target chikens from any other but the one next to you, so it always gets uneven with fewer players.
Another issue is the need for batteries.

As an adults only game, it's pretty good (maybe an 8, but that could be pushing it).  For kids (2 and 3.5), it isn't as engaging, as they don't hit the lever successfully most of the time (if they attempt at all).  Also, the game is just too overengineered.  Why, oh why, didn't they just let the chickens fall off the board, instead of falling into a slot and jamming up?

Exactly as mindlessly fun as you think it's going to be. Easy to handicap as the little kids get the wider paddle and the adults get the narrower one. It plays quickly and requires no teaching at all. 

We play either on the floor, or on top of placemats on the dining room table to help combat the rattling. Sometimes you take out your own chickens simply because of the vibrations caused by pushing down your own lever. It's a minor nuisance.

Really should be number 1 in the BGG rankings - who says no to a game of Loopin Louie? I have the Buzz Lightyear version. Always good for a filler or with the kids. Love that double whammy of hitting two chits in a row with one bash of Buzz.

RATING: 4
The game isn't bad at all, but as others noted, quite overrated, and should be on par with Hungry Hungry Hippos.

It is fun for a while, but there are things that really spoil the game:
- the overall construction isn't sturdy -- you hit the buttons hard, and the tokens will go down without Louie's help;
- it is very easy to keep Louie away from your chips;
- your neighbors can keep you out of the game all the time if they are skillful enough (just press the button hard enough to let Louie fly over your neighbor's flap, and that's it).

However, the concept is fun, so the game is worth trying. I'd say they could pack the parts better. The game box is quite big, and it occupies too much space for a toy that will keep you busy for 15 minutes at best.

I didn't believe the hype. It's not everyday you find an ages 4+ game that's this fun for adults, after all. Sure enough, game night rolled around and everyone who saw Louie was immediately interested in giving it a try. People kept asking for one more play. I paid about $20 for this game, and if you can find it for the same price there's no reason not to add it to your collection. Hilarious, edge of your seat entertainment.

Such a simple game, such a neat idea, such wonderful execution. An adorable pastime, suitable to all ages. It's the kind of children's game most adults will love to play, over and over -- even to the point of monopolizing the table, leaving out the poor kids!

Kid/Adult game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's a kids' game for sure.  My rating, however, is the same for a group of kids or a group of adults - it's a game that is fun for a couple of times, but I can't seeing wanting to play it numerous times in a row.  There's definitely a disadvantage to sitting to the right of an experienced player.  For a game that lasts five minutes and is dependent on a motorized bi-plane - that fault hardly matters.  Kids' game that is fun for adults as well.

Actually (to update this rating), the more that you play the game, the more that you want to play it in a row.  Once you start getting some "skill" at bumping the plane just the way you want, it really becomes engrossing.  I've picked up a copy and expect it will get a lot of plays with the kids and at TGD.

RATING: 6.5
This actually was quite entertaining.  there is a dexterous skill to this game but can also be enjoy casually and seems to be a great kids game and can equally be enjoyed by adults.  Played with 2 thus far and I imagine would be much more chaotic with 4.  Seems like it would be silly but frankly its just fun.  Games are fast 5 minutes or so, so it will be interesting to see if the entertainment value continues after dozens of plays.  

We really like the 2 player game where each takes two paddles.  Tons or funny moments and great entertainment.  

3 players is not the most balanced game but still fun I think 2 or 4 is at its best.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
 A silly game, yet so incredibly fun to play. I just love that sometimes the chickens won't drop even if you hit them a couple of times. There is some neat little tactics involved. Your worst enemy is the guy on your left. Once you learn the right amount of force you must use, you can drop your right-hand opponent's chickens more easily. You can't hit too hard or you'll drop your own chickens. You will either hate or love Looping Louie. I allow myself to be silly sometimes and enjoy a few rounds of Looping Louie. Suggestion is to play about 5-10 times in a session, more playtimes will feel a bit repetiative. Basically a 4-player game but it can fun a few rounds even with two or three players.

WBC, drinking with Gary and Scott and a sordid amount of people turned this into a night of fun. We must have played this for a couple of hours with multiple people coming by and sitting down taking their turns. I will never forget Scott telling some kid to calm down and he called him "Huffy" because he was talking about riding his bike. I about pissed myself. This had turned into two hours of playing this game with about 20-30 different people giving it a whirl.

RATING: 4
Tactical depth and sweeping strategies?  Not on your life.  A simple dexterity-type game to play between heavier games or with kids when the moment strikes.  Sure thing.  Nice feature to adjust the "skill" level by having large or small paddles.  Just give some allowance for mechanical inconsistencies - token can be struck and not fall (or) seem to just fall on their own.  Don't think in this game - just try to have fun.

Great and funny dexterity game.  I have a lot of fun just watching the so-called "grown ups" playing this game.  Fun to play with teams too.  Loopin Louie tournaments are great.  One of the rare "board" games that takes batteries.

--Apr2007-- Goofy fun that entranced all my children (12, 7, 4).  I'll need to report back after we've had the game for a month or two; I'm not sure how long they'll maintain their interest.
--Jan2010-- It has maintained their interest!  Lots of "alternate rules" defined by the youngsters; lots of single-player practice; lots of fun with friends and family.  Definitely a winner.

It's a novelty... but in the end I don't see the attraction to this over other silly automated games.  In fact I find that there is less skill involved in this game than most others of it's type, and more often than not a good jostle to the table will drop more pucks than Louie does.

This was on my want list for a very long time when it finally was reprinted.  I'm certainly glad to have finally been able to pick up a copy, as are my kids.  It is easily one of our most played games.  Ostensibly, this is a dexterity game that requires a nice touch in order to do well.  In reality, however, it is more toy than game.  Thus it seems to be meant to be played with as a toy and less a game.  For us, it is just plain old fun that I expect will be around for a long time.  [02/02/2008]

Without question a game that gets everybody to sit and play. Some of the tournament rules (changing paddles, taking coinc away)that have been mentioned on the site are quite good. 
I do feel that the perfect shot (especially on the next player) is far too easy to master, but, if all players are really skilled, that shot doesn't have to be available at all times. Get ready for a laugh.

After all the hype surrounding Loopin' Louie, I was expecting a livelier and more frantic game. But Louie flies surprisingly slow and it is quite easy to anticipate his movement. Also, pushing the lever with anything more than a gentle tap tends to result in the discs falling by themselves.

That said, this game has gone down great with younger players. As for me, I'll just stick to [thing=145639][/thing].

Came in a trade. I'm trading way too much. Airmail shipping is killing me...It's a silly kids game but I just had to have a silly kids game.

OK, I've played and smashed up this game more than I should. At least 10 different friends have had a go too. They all love it. However, it can be 'broken'. Some of my friends realised that if you tap louie with the right amount of force, he can glide up and swoop in unstoppable on the player on their right. Once the physics of it was discovered, the 'fun' factor is gone. It needed a house rule: no 'cheap' shots are counted.

Have old edition and new small box edition.

I heard about this game last year, and scrounged Ebay for a copy to get my daughter for Xmas. With a doubt, this is my favorite dexterity game. Louie flies around on something like a crane arm which can swivel in various directions. He flies at a constant speed, and if he flies low over your "barn", he may "steal" one of your three chickens by knocking a token down a slot. LL really shines with 4 players, although 3 is alright. If the fun-quotient remained as high with fewer players, I would give this game an 8. Ah well. It always generates some laughs in our house, and games are usually quick, so you can play a bunch in a row. There is also a way to make the game harder for some players (when adults vs. children) by altering how the arms work (which are used to smack Louie into the air on his little plane.

My copy, published by TCG (The Canadian Group) crapped out after only a few plays. The motor went kaput and I've been unable to get them to replace it. Earlier version seem much higher in quality. The game is fun; TCG's version is junk.

Update: I replaced the motor myself. Louie now hauls ass and the game is mucho fun.

YES!!!!

This game rocks my poop!

Use the tournament rules (remove a chicken if you win, when you win three times you are the champion).

UPDATE: I can't believe I'm actually going to criticize this, but I fear that the new version just isn't as good as the old version.  The circuit is smaller so Louie just doesn't fly as well, the balance seems off as it is too responsive, he flies all over with less control.  I also don't like the new bevel-cut paddles, I just don't thing he reacts as well.

I'm glad that I have the old version.

A riot!  Sure, on the surface it looks like a stupid little kids game, but it is a fun and quick dexterity game.  Not only do you keep Louie away from your 'chickens', but with the right hit you can make him dive-bomb your opponents' 'chickens'!  Quite probably the best price-to-fun ratio game in my collection.

Great kids game and a ton of fun. It's amazing how competitive you can get with trying to knock the chickens from your opponents. Louie can end up flying in a bunch of different ways, giving a lot of variety as to what can happen... this is good, silly fun.

Tons of fun. Not as much fun if you don't have 4 people though. My children regularly request it, and it can be played by a 3 year old. A round of 3 games doesn't even take 10 minutes. We find it's a lot more fun to talk smack during this and name all of your chickens.

Our copy: box damaged in shipping.

The game is simple: there's a battery-powered figure (Louie) that spins around. Each player has 3 discs (chickens) carefully balanced in a slot, 90 degrees from each other. If Louie spins by your chicken at the right height, he'll knock your chicken down - the last one to have any chickens left wins the round. Your defense is a little lever just in front of your chickens, which you tap to knock Louie up so he flies OVER your chicken. If you have enough control, you can get him to fly over the next player's lever and right into a chicken. You can also get him to hit they guy across from you (180deg turn) or go for the 270deg shot.

This is a surprisingly fun little game - or, really, toy.

Too bad it works less well with fewer than four players.

RATING: 5.5
[Milton Bradley 06 'Loopin' Louie' edition] {toy-like; action; optimal 4p} {Adult 5.5, kid 9} LL is a hilarious children game.  Only motor-coordination skill is needed, decisions not.  LL gives players an enjoyable 10 minutes.  Nevertheless, LL only works with 4p. With less than 4p, the flight path of Louie is too obvious.  With 4p, the flight path of Louie is more random and hard to catch and it is thus more fun.

The physical design is clever.  The fiction of the joint is quite right to allow random (yet controllable) movement.  The illustration is cute and funny.  The speed of Louie is slow for me but appropriate for children.  If it can allow players to choose a speed level, it would be GREAT.

Time your interventions to make the rotating flying dude miss your chickens and fly into someone else's. In my only game (championship rules) my chickens behaved like airplane magnets, and my dexterity wasn't enough to save them. It's fun. A little fiddly to set up, and I'm told it was a little slow because the batteries were running a bit flat, but a very enjoyable little diversion.

Rating +1 just for the look on Ian P's face when he refused to play in public. Wuss!

This is a children's game.  Just keep telling yourself that as you sit and play it over and over and over with 3 other adults.  Loopin' Louie is one of the most addicting games I've ever played.  It's a dexterity game at heart as you try to deftly maneuver Louie to take out your opponents' chickens.  Deeper than that, it's a whole lot of laughs and outright silliness in one box.

Played 50+ times.  I'm sorry but this is just crazy fun.  I'm really glad they re-printed this.  I will need a second copy. Variant for two players: each player control 2 opposite flippers.  Makes for a crazy game. 

Smaller box re-print.  It feels like the original is slightly better designed.  MB has shrunk Louie and the apparatus by a greater percentage than the chickens so it feels like it's not quite balanced as well.  He has a harder time catching the chickens with the tail of the plane and it seems to be easier to bat him away, but we'll see. Update: Louie loosing up and playing better.  2006/10/03

This was on my want list for a long while. But I was lucky enough to find it at a nearby thrift shop.

This is a great family game. And a nice filler for adults as well.

This is an odd one to rate. There's basically no game here. If you can learn how hard to hit your lever to make the plane land on the next player's chicken there is nothing they can do about it so in that regard, it's a little broken.

That said, it's a huge amount of fun - we played this 8 times in one afternoon.

I can see why this game has such a following.

Louie is here to mess you and your chicken coup up! Use your flipper to knock him out of the way as he flies drunkenly around to everyone's chicken farms trying to cause havoc. Knock him into everyone else's chickens so you can become the chicken king! This game is much funner than it should be. It's a kids game, but after a few drinks it takes on a whole new layer of difficulty. Check your brain at the door and take your frustrations out on Louie!

Pure, silly fun. Interestingly, with practice, players can develop skills to the point where they can "target" not just the next player to their right (next in line in Louie's flight path and so the easiest target) but also the player across from them and even the player to their left (sending Louie looping backward - the most difficult "shot" to make).

I was surprised to see that this is the best non-gamers game I own.  I saw a commerical for the game when was little and put it on my Christmas list.  When I pulled out my set, I saw something in the mechanics made the game not work like it used to.

Ha! I actually got to play this game! It was at the library at SaltCon, 2011. So I checked it out in order to say I had experienced the legendary kids' game. It was fun and I can see how a bunch of drunk adults would play this game until the wee hours.

I own it now! I had it set up at work for the first week I had it and everybody loved taking work breaks to play a quick round of Looping Louie.

I'm sure if I drank it would be even more fun.

UPDATE, 3/29/12 - I have to bump this up to at least an 8.5 simply because of how entertaining it is for children and adults alike. I just love it and it does exactly what it's supposed to do. If you can get ahold of this gem of a game, do it.

I never saw what people love about this game. It's certainly better than Hungry Hippos and has much more control, but I didn't find it terribly different. The fun seems very limited. 




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 2
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1

UPDATE: Nevermind, turns out I really enjoy this game and have played it a lot, and have improved, and just traded for a copy ----- This was a pretty fun dexterity game despite the fact that I was rather horrible at it.  I'd usually agree to play, although I don't think I'm going to go through the trouble of finding a copy for myself.  It is enjoyable though, and I do think I could improve with some practice, which might make it even more fun, but I don't see myself playing this a whole lot.

 For what it is (a motorized spinner dexterity game), this is quite fun. My only complaint is how often someone slamming their paddle down too hard will make your chickens fall out.  Also, the Loopin' Chewy 3-player spinoff has a few mechanical issues that make it not quite as good.

RATING: 6
[thing=327][/thing] is a super light dexterity game in wich players defend their area (chips) by pushing a button and making the plane go up, sometimes, really up, enough for it to flip and dive right back at you!

The game has a mechanism, moved by batteries, that makes the airplane always keep going. The buttons make it elevate, and, thus, avoid to hit your chips. If all your three chips are hit and fell, you're out of the game. The winner, of course, is the last player with chips left.

If [thing=327][/thing] has some sort of depth, it is hidden from me. I can see, however, that, as dexterity games go, timming and strength count a lot. You can learn how hard (or when) you must press the button in order to achieve some effect. This is the depth of it.

But I did enjoyed it, because it provides a fun time while it last (though it can drag a little when only two are left playing). Overall, no better than [thing=2452][/thing], but it do have more bling and sure the kids will like this one way better.

Can't believe I am rating this, but I am.  It is just fun, can't explain it, don't want to understand it, but once you play for hours you really do start to believe that it takes skill, that you actually have control of it...  Actually....  you do...  And I am currently the Looping Louie household champion.  And does that matter?  Oh yes Sir, it does.

A silly and fun mechanical toy that can be hilarious in short bursts and with the right group. I can't see myself playing this for more than 15-20 minutes. Probably great with first-timers or a knockout competition with a larger group. Not quite sure about pulling this one out frequently with a regular game group. 

06-2017: Still a silly and fun little game. In small doses but perhaps a good way to determine the start player for the game du jour.

It's not exactly complicated, but there are subtleties of skill involved in hitting the plane to send it at your opponents in tricky ways. Also, it's playable by kids as young as three or four! So, as a short family dexterity/speed game, it's a winner.

It can be amazing. However, you need...

A. a group of people with the right mindset for it.

B. one simple house rule - Play to X number of points, with the winner of each round getting a point. When only two players remain, the player with the most remaining chickens wins. If they are tied, both get a point. This keeps the game from stagnating.

This was Germany’s children’s game of the year in 1994. Louie, an aviator with a deranged grin and thick mustache, is swooping down to players’ barns to scare away their chickens. Designed for preschoolers, Looping Louie is a four-player tabletop game with a motorized plane that circles around the board, knocking off players’ tokens. It has now become more popular for adults and is often played at parties as a drinking game.

On the one hand, this is a good dexterity game because it rewards people who develop the right sort of skills and finesse to play the game properly.  On the other hand, it can become frustrating and boring to be sitting to the right of someone who's mastered the game and knows how to hit Louie just right so that you can't hit him to get him out of the way, and he'll bump one of your chickens out of the coop.  At that point, you may as well sit back and play a few rounds of Angry Birds.  At least you'll still be playing a game with avians in it.

In Loopin' Louie, a battery-powered motor placed in the center of the table rotates a boom with a little plastic plane. Four radial arms lead out to the players' barns and the chickens they're trying to protect. Each player's barn has a little lever, which is used to knock the rotating plane away from your chickens and hopefully into someone else's. When only one player has chickens remaining, he or she wins the game. Very silly and very addictive.

After having read about Loopin' Louie for years on BoardGameGeek, I happened to stumble across a used copy down at my local thrift store and all I can say is WOW!

I have no idea how a toy designed for pre-schoolers is so much fun for all the adults in the house. Other than Liar's Dice, this might be the best drunken party game I own. It might even be better than Liar's Dice, because you don't have to count...which can be a problem after a few cocktails!

Loopin' Louie is just pure, laugh-out-loud fun. No, there isn't any real depth to it but that's not what it's for. This is just the kind of game that you can take to a family gathering and get folks ages 4 - 80 playing together and, more importantly, ENJOYING IT! It is so perfectly exciting and accessible for kids and yet adults find the fun equally enthralling.

It is NOT a game to be taken seriously and is ABSOLUTELY a game that everyone should play. Honestly, with the average game lasting 2-3 minutes, you have no excuse to pass it up...especially considering that it will probably be the most hilarious 2-3 minutes you'll ever have gaming.

Initial rating based on two games with my wife and 21 month old is a 6.  My 21 month old figured out a near unbeatable strategy of holding down the paddle.  Wife and I tried to explain that she was cheating, but she just grinned and said "FLY!".  Hmmm...

Had this for about a week and Caden loves it.  Short 2 chickens but still works really well for the three of us.  I admit it is a great game for kids but it might be slighly overrated or maybe HANG IN THERE is underrated as I think they are both very good.

It is the very best airplane-flying chicken-catching game ever made.  A classic, must-play epic game.

RATING: 8
I wouldn't say there is a lot of strategy here. Nor would I say the "best" player always wins - my five year old son frequently beats everyone. However, it's a great deal of fun and my favorite light game. You have to have four people though.

Ok. This ranks up there in the super-lite category of games. But, it is painfully addictive. Suitable for young kids and young (at heart) adults. Play time is what? 5 minutes. What's not to like?

My kids love playing this 5 min game.

This may be my most-played game.  Everyone rolls their eyes at first and then begs to play 15 more times.

Dexterity game. I'd rather do something else.

Played a few times (with 4 players). Not a serious game, but enjoyable anyway.

RATING: 7.5
Far more fun than a game like this should be.  There's actually more skill involved than you think at first glance.

Dexterity game for kids. You can get some cool bounces. Players to the left have advantage. Louie should change directions.

What can I say? Adults and children alike all end up squealing and shouting whenever Loopin' Louie starts dive bombing their chickens!! Fun Fun Fun!

Its a big success. If there are 4 players that are only moderately silly (or more like me :)) its one of the best dexterity fun fillers imagineable.

Fabulous simulation of WW1 air-ground attacks.  Surprisingly well-tuned apparatus allows for everything from low altitude barnstorming to wingovers and, of course, loops.  Much more fun than a barrel of monkeys, this game works well with kids, drunks, and competitive dexterity gamers.

What a fun dexterity game with a very well developed and functional electronic/mechanical aspect. Lots of fun, generates lots of laughs and table talk.

RATING: 7
What a fun game! This is a blast for the whole family, and it plays so fast, you can play it over, and over, and over again. I really like how you set how hard the game is per player, so adults can play with the difficult setting for their controller, while any children play at the easy setting.

The tournament system of the winner of each round starting the next with one less chicken, and playing until someone is out of chickens makes this game even more fun.

This is a game in the vein of Hungy Hungry Hippos, but that actually seems to teach patience, fine motor control and cause and effect instead of "hitting the button a lot is good"  It will be a while before Hazel can play, but I think I'll be getting this once she can!

One of the funnest children's games I've tried and I definitely prefer to play with kids more so than adults.  Would not hesistate to recommend it to others and would be on my top gifts to purchase for friends and family with little ones.

As a game to be played on a quiet night in with the wife I give it a 6 tops.

Even with the kids I can't really say it's 'that' exciting.

Unfortunately the kids seem to love it, and it's on its way to my Most Played game :(

An unusual example of a game for young children that can be enjoyed by adults too. Not the game that I enjoy most, but of all the games my young children want to play, this is the top of my list for sure. See my video review...

Kids's game, only fun as drinking game...

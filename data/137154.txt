Great components for a simple gambling game - the poker chips are high quality. There are enough interesting quirks in the system to make this game feel unique and the artwork is offbeat. Very enjoyable.

RATING: 7
Great push you luck game..very light betting really, but the game is FAR more intense if you use a house rule where pulling a devil forfeits your bid.  Became a group favorite with that one little change.  Beautiful components, but it almost needs twice as many chips in order to not have to be constantly making change

RATING: 9
Quite good betting + press-your-luck game.  Familiar mechanics put together in a fun new way.  Almost a little long, though...it could use a timer mechanism.  The components--particularly the poker chips--are fantastic, even for Zoch standards.

Although mechanically very different to Can't Stop, Auf Teufel offers similar thrills and laughs. Each round players bet on the highest value of coal that any one of them will steal from the Devil.  There is a press your luck element to that theft, with little demons interspersed among the coal, who, if drawn void your turn.  The game provides incentives to draw the biggest collection of coal, but there is also reason to keep the value of your set below that rash better's total.  The game is less interesting when you're out in front and the incentives to push your luck vanish.  It can also run long for what it is.  

The artwork is big and bold.  Production values are good. My one gripe was with the low quantity of poker chips.  We were constantly having to change up, when a good quantity of low value chips is needed for betting.  Having said that, the quality of the chips provided is good - they could have been so much cheaper and nastier.

RATING: 7.1
This is a nice push-your-luck game with an interesting balancing mechanism designed to help the last-placed player - which works pretty well for the first 2/3 of the game (and could be exploited by a clever player in the later stages if everyone is very close).

It can get a bit math-y at the end as you try to calculate if you can win the game on a given turn, but generally it's not bad.

Do NOT trust the time on this one though.  Yes, it CAN play in 40 minutes if you have fewer players and/or someone gets really lucky, but our 6 player game took almost three times that long.  It was still fun though.

Rock solid push your luck with chip wagering and phenomenal components. Not wild about the art, but the theme works - especially in regard to the 'pact with the devil' catchup mechanic.  Could see non gamer gambling types enjoying this.

The game looks simple and it is once you get it but the betting is a little counterintuitive (you win your bet if anyone draws the required amount of coal).  It is also counterintuitive that you can get points for drawing coal independent of your bet.  

It works well but confuses most people for a few rounds.

RATING: 6
A nice push your luck game with typically excellent production values by Zoch.  Players simultaneously and secretly bid on the largest amount of coal to be extracted from the Devil's cauldron this turn.  Bids are revealed and players take turns flipping wooden discs of coal - these reveal a value or a devil (you crap out).  Players are paid their bid if anyone pulls their bid total, but highest bid total is paid double, and bonuses are paid for most coal/highest value coal.  Really nicely done, and quite thinky.  Great pieces.

Physically satisfying, mentally not really rich enough to justify the amount of counting and futzing you have to do, nor the amount of luck involved.

The mechanism for deciding whether it's time to reshuffle ("do all the black discs fit into the circle at the center of the board, if you sort of smoosh them all toward one another?") is brilliant and more games should do that.

A betting and push your luck game. Players will place a bet on how much coal they believe will be able to be pulled out by any player. Each piece of coal has a money amount on it. Players can continue to pull coal out until they choose to stop or, if they pull a devil coal out of the fire, they have to stop and none of their progress counts. This one was probably our favorite of the night and, again, I really want to play this with the full compliment of players to see how it plays out.

RATING: 8
Wonderful press your luck/betting experience.  Great with all counts of players.
Also love the poker chip quality here, as well as the bits.  Top notch.   

Personally, I don't care for the art style, but I realize that, due to the chosen theme, it needed to remain silly.

I find that in many instances, the 1600 point goal goes on slightly too long, so we usually play to 1300, which runs 4 players about 45 minutes.  

If you can get your hands on this, get it.  It really is a simple, great gameplay experience!

Outstanding push-your-luck game with great quality components. Each players mut monitor their progress, wager an amount of money they're willing to lose hoping someone will flip more than their value, and flip tokens themselves hoping not to go over other player's values, or to bid the max or most tokens. There are many ways to score.

Went over like a lead balloon.  Players asked for a light game so I pulled this out.  Ended up being too light.  Most people felt it had no decisions.  So, just playing a game to see who randomly won.  I don't agree completely.  You're making decisions on how much to push your luck (how much to bet and how many coal to pull) and you have to consider the coal that has already been pulled out of the cauldron.  You also have to balance pulling what you need, coal majorities, and watching what your opponents need since you can reach your bet on anybody's turn.  Definitely not for everybody.

A simple push-your-luck game with absolutely stellar production values. In the game, players draw face-down coal pieces from the board, each of which adds to a point total or causes a player to bust. Players are incentivized both to get their highest possible score from round to round and to guess how high any player in the group will go. The game plays smoothly once the rules are understood and doesn't outstay its welcome at about 40 minutes. A lot of silly fun with the right group.

[b]Auf Teufel komm raus[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> [b]8[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]Auf Teufel komm raus has become our extended family's game of choice when we get together. Auf Teuful is simple to teach and creates a really fun and boisterous environment. Everyone at the table is constantly engaged waiting for someone to either bust or cover their own bet. I can't recommend Auf Teuful highly enough, it offers the best combination of betting and push your luck in a game that I've played [i](in fact friends of ours hunted down a copy after playing at our house)[/i]. 

Auf Teuful is the quintessential party game for us since our families prefer betting/push your luck games versus party games like Codenames or Wits and Wagers. [i](Camel Up, Ca$h N' Guns, Cockroach Poker and Winner's Circle are other party games we enjoy).[/i][/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I had been wanting to play this for years, I'm not sure how I originally heard of this game but I am a huge fan of betting + push your luck games. The components are beautiful and in our 4p game making change wasn't a huge issue. I'd rather have the beautiful poker chips that were included instead of paper money any day. The mechanics of the game are quite simple and there is a good catch up mechanism that keeps all players engaged throughout. I think I drew a devil first draw every turn but one or two (which makes you bust), but still had a blast. 

What really makes this game stand out is how winning your bets is determined. You don't need to cover your bet, as long as someone else draws enough tokens to beat your bet you're in the clear. This leads to some fun decisions as you decide whether or not to go for certain bonuses while also helping someone with a huge bet make it. Fun, fun, fun. 

Auf Teuful delivered in spades, best of all my kids loves it. This one will surely end up in our collection, thanks for teaching Mat![/i]

世界観、コンポーネントなど含め、トータルで見て好きになれるかによる。
ハイリスクハイリターンの戦術が効きにくく、無難な勝負が強いため、
気付いたら毎回同額のチップをかけているなど、ターン毎の動きが少ないのは欠点。
一度のプレイでは面白さが解らない可能性が有るが、
プレイを重ねることで新しいドラマが生まれ、それがゲームの味になって行く。

A game about betting how far you can push your luck. It's really quite entertaining as you are constantly engaged even when your it's your opponents' turn to push their luck. It has the possibility of running rather long though if all players are constantly taking risky bids.

A light betting / push-your-luck game that moves along nicely. You're aiming to grow your seed money by betting on how much coal players can steal from the devil. As long as one player hits your target without going bust you win this round's bet.

Because of the way the odds pay out, you'll do best if you can judge where everyone else is bidding and bid [i]slightly[/i] higher. If you bid lower than everyone else you'll earn less; if you bid [i]significantly[/i] higher than the pack then nobody else is going to hit your target for you, but the randomness of the coal tokens means players can overshoot their own target - and then they have to decide whether to help the players that bid high or continue until they're bust and rely on someone else hitting their target.

Sometimes everyone losing is better than everyone winning - especially if you lose/win least.

With 6 players, there's too much change-making.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Now here's a light filler game I didn't mind at all. It's push your luck. But it gives players some nice dilemmas. Do you play safe(r) and bid lower for a bigger chance of a smaller reward, or do you bid big with the risk of maybe losing your bet? All this is implemented in a nice easy to digest set of rules. And the included poker chips are really rather good.

Initial rating: 6.5

A really wonderfully produced and engaging push your luck/betting game. The theme just about makes sense and holds everything together and the very blatant catch-up mechanism means everyone should be pretty much still involved right up until the end.

It's probably a little expensive for me to consider picking it up, but it's a game I'd certainly be happy to play any time.

RATING: 10
Considering my overall dislike for most push your luck games,  how I feel about this one speaks volumes.

To be fair,  I would categorize this as primarily a betting / gambling game that utilizes a push your luck mechanic,  but I suppose that is all conjecture.

Any way you look at it,  Auf Teufel komm raus just happens to be a devilishly good time in any language.  If you based it solely on it's components alone,  this might still warrant a high rating.  They are that good.  But this is not just shiny chrome that is meant to distract you from a bent fender.  There's a lot of game in that hefty box too.

From the quirky artwork,  to the chunky pieces of coal and right down to the casino quality chips, this game - to quote Richard Attenborough in Jurassic Park - spared no expense.  Suffice it to say that the production here is second to none.

Now if that's all there was to it and this turned out to be merely a mediocre game in disguise,  it might still be worthy in it's own right.  However,  there is more......much more.  The betting mechanic in this game is exquisite.  Each player blindly selects chips,  after which the totals are revealed.  To win your bet,  at least one player must draw coal equaling or surpassing your total.  The payoff is 1 to 1.  The player who bet the most will receive a 2 to 1 payoff if successful - however,  this usually means you will have to do the dirty work on your own.

There is much more going on,  including a built in catch up mechanic for those that are unlucky enough to get torched by those sneaky red devils lurking among the coal.  There is very little that has not been addressed in the design of this game.  Add to that the fact that in this genre there is generally slim pickings and you have yourself an indispensable gem that should make it's way to your collection without delay.

RATING: 8.5
First 3P game left an excellent first impression on all of us. First off, the rulebook is excellent and the teach was very straightforward. Components are of good quality and even though the board looks like a hot mess at first, once the teach is over and the game gets underway the board state is actually easy to parse. 

The core mechanics of seeding assistants, moving the president and getting/building stuff are really satisfying. It's difficult to know where to direct your attention at first as there are so many paths to pursue. It's also very unclear how much time you have left until one of the endgame triggers is looming large. But you always feel like you're making progress. So in essence, a sandboxy game but with the right amount of tension and interaction to make it feel like you're playing against each other and your decisions are important each turn.

It's a bit of a themeless point salad, but there are worse offenders (e.g. Castles of Burgundy). And tbh, themeless point salads are some of my favourite games (e.g. Castles of Burgundy). 

In summary, a satisfyingly elegant blend of mechanics with many paths to explore, and a ton of setup variability. I think this will prove to be a favourite.

2 plays / 3 players

LIKE: Fun to maneuver your assistants and president around. I really liked the race element to grab bonuses and place buildings, slowly building up assistants on competitive areas. Each turn seems to have a plethora of options. Good indirect interaction for a euro: blocking, paying coins, and racing for imports.

DISLIKE: Lots of min/maxing may slow the game down. There are so many options available that it is easy to forget points or card powers. Breaking ties during end-game scoring was based on turn order, which is disappointing. Order cards coming out randomly and can create lucky turns, but very minor. 

OVERALL: Good, solid game. The game is heavy with combos and min-maxing points, which we've seen before, but the board movement is what separates it as its own game.

A very good Euro with all the trappings - loads of scoring paths, variety of actions, stress in the abundance of decisions, regrets for not planning ahead - it's all here. Like layers of a Euro cake, baked up and iced well. It even has a bit of solitaire feel - as long as you stay out of each other's way (impossible)! So I like it quite a bit. Nice game.

Great production on the deluxe version (though, with some defects).  Good iconography--easy to learn.  The design, though, is essentially the longer, more complicated version of [b]Istanbul[/b].  I can play 2 games of [b]Istanbul[/b] in the time it takes to setup and play this.  Don't get me wrong...this game may be a little better, but twice the playing time.

Solid, the deluxe edition is very well done. Though there are lots of options, it doesn't feel particularly overwhelming. The interaction with others is fairly minor and is limited to blocking (minor, and fairly easy to overcome) and racing (to certain bonuses and limited rewards). The game can end in lots of different ways so you do need to keep an eye on what others are doing. Don't need to own this one, but happy to play it.

this might seem like a harsher judgement than this game deserves, but there it is. The main reason is that it is a worker placement game that somehow managed to build in a runaway leader problem. Now most will simply look at the same game and say some technologies are better than others, but it just seemed like if you weren't riding the highest wave, you were just plodding through an arbitrarily long game.

Yokohama is an incredibly interesting game from the sense that it gives you a lot to do. The central mechanism of route building is smoothly integrated around the recipe fulfillment and resource collection game play. But the game is all on the surface, there's no depth. Once you have some goals in mind, you can quickly find a route to them, which if you're smart you can optimize and get your buildings out at. 

At it's core the game has an interesting mechanism, but there's just way too much in the game. There are too many layers, too many rules, too much breadth with minimal depth to go with it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game has been called Istanbul on steroids, and I would agree.  On the first play, the decisions in Yokohama felt remarkably open-ended and unclear, with eight or so "euro action" options to choose from each turn.  What should I do now?  Or later?  

Yet, this open-ended aspect of the game seems to me to be Yokohama's strength and appeal, certainly for fans of heavier euros.  On the edge of too many choices?   Yes, but in this case, particularly on the second and further plays, the result is a very interesting and enjoyable heavy euro gaming challenge.  

And yes, when the game is laid out on the table, the overall look of the game appears to be busy and chaotic, with a curiously conspicuous absence of overall graphic continuity.  What IS this set of tiles?  

Yet, upon closer inspection, each tile does appear to be attractive graphically. Hmmmm, how would I improve the appearance of the tiles?  The answer is not immediately apparent.   

In the final analysis, Yokohama is, I believe, a euro gaming classic, destined to be in the top 100 on BGG.

An interesting worker movement game that seems like it would play very differently each game thanks to its very modular setup. The game might have run a little too long during our first play for what it was (which is unusual considering we like long games), but I'd imagine it will move along more quickly in subsequent plays. Really looking forward to playing this one more.

With so many games feeling unfinished, unpolished, and unoriginal, Yokohama reminds players that there are still wonderful designs waiting to be discovered.  Overall, the game is reminiscent to something Stephan Feld would have designed.  But truthfully, this game may be stronger than some of Feld's most ambitious games (e.g. Trajan).

Ultimately, Yokohama is a point salad euro done right.  Tons of options, every decision matters, and with a mix of tactical and strategic decisions.  Even money, something many games don't do right, feels appropriately constraining without overshadowing other elements/mechanics in the game.  This game is simply polished to such an extreme that if feels like a labor of love.

Excellent point salady Euro with moderate amount of theme.  Easy teach and iconography is pretty intuitive.  Game has a good flow and a v high fun factor.  Ultimately though there is nothing here that quite rises this above the very high standards of point salady action selection games thats on the market at the moment.  Will be very happy to play this but wouldnt rush to play this over some other games that maybe have more interaction.

Modular board, pick and drop mechanics, point salad, gorgeous seizure-inducing artwork - I want this game instantly!

Yokohama is often described as Istanbul on steroids but both are essentially quite different except for the pick and drop mechanics. However, it's still similar enough that if I can only afford to have one of these type of games in my collection, Yokohama will be my choice by a mile (and I love Istanbul, so that's saying something).

The rating will be 10/10 if this game doesn't suffer from AP issues by some players, which can lead to long downtime in between turns.

Three plays in so far, two at 2 player and one at 4 player.
Super smooth gameplay with lots to do on your turn and setting yourself up for future turns. 
When you pull off a great combo it's very satisfying.
Variable set up makes for lots of replayability.
Deluxe version is a real treat, really nice wooden components and best coins ever.
Fairly simple  game that has lots of depth to it, makes it firmly a nice middle weight game.
Only critisism is the tie break room for tech and end game. Easily house ruled though.
Well done TMG for a stellar job here.

Although it looks overwhelming at first, Yokohama is easy to teach with a low overhead for learning. The game has a fair amount of entertaining decisions along with tactical, strategical and timing choices. It seems to have replayability because of the different locations that the tiles and cards come out in each game. The components are wonderful and the player interaction is sufficient.

Good and interesting game, but lord is this one fiddly and needs further streamlining. I already feel giddy just by looking at it. For example: why are their two distinct locations for contracts (I think they are called like that) when both spots essentially offer the same? For now I would rather play the simpler yet smother Istanbul in most circumstances.

This game looks like an utter Euro game disaster with stuff everywhere and tons of resources and conversions and so many things that make it look like it would be quite bad.

Initial Impressions:
------------------------
Istanbul on steroids.  Much more of a gamers game than Istanbul, as there are more layers to explore here.  The has a TON of replayability, since there is so much initial setup that is randomized, and the location of the "areas" matters greatly.  Also the amount of technology cards and random scoring cards for each area will make each game play out differently.  Need to explore player counts, but 3 seems like it would be the sweet spot, although it was fun at 2p as well.  The components are fine, but nothing to write home about.  Should be in the running for top 10 games of 2016 when is all said and done.

Positive: The TMG Deluxified components are fantastic and add something to the game. There was more depth in the game than I originally thought from the rules. While the actions you do are fairly simple, there is lots of room for combos, long term planning, strategic timing, some player blocking, and variable paths to victory. I was able to teach this to 3 people very new to gaming and all really enjoyed the game. The game gives you the feeling that there are always many options, but you know that you need to make efficient actions to win. I also enjoyed the variable timing for the end game. I was able to score a bunch of points, then end the game and prevent some opponents from finishing some big final moves. Very satisfying :) I assumed this game would be much better with a higher player count, but I really enjoyed the 2 player game (probably more than 4 players). 

Neutral:  I was surprised that there wasn't more blocking at 4 players, but the board remains fairly open. I felt that the game actually felt tighter at 2 players.

Negative: The graphic design and look of the game is very overwhelming at first. The game just looks too complex for what it is. I also thought the game dragged a bit for what it is. It took us 2.5 hrs for a first play with 4. While I'm sure that will go down, I would have preferred 2 hrs. 

Overall: I'm presently surprised with this game. I feared it would be too light for my heavier tastes, but I think this strikes a nice balance of simple mechanics, but some underlying strategy to keep heavier gamers interested. If you can get over the first overwhelming visual shock of the game, I think you will find a solid medium weight game with quick turns and a nice mix of tactics & strategy that is able to interest both newer and more seasoned gamers.

Got to play the "Deluxified" kickstarter version.  Sweet.  Looks amazing.  Great quality components.  Off one play I know this is a game I would play again anytime.  Tight gameplay, decisions to make between getting resourses or money or orders to fill or tech or going for victory points.  There may be too much value in a couple of spaces that overshadow going to other spots, but that will be more clear after more plays

5/11/16 - deluxified Kickstarter version arrived at my door today and the first 3-er game didn't disappoint. Quick turns and engaging gameplay. The only angst is through the races to various "better" victory point spots. Otherwise, as long as you manage your money you can move about the board freely. Didn't do well in the first game but looking forward to more plays.

Kickstarted

When I first heard that a deluxe edition of Yokohama was coming to kickstarter I was very excited. TMG seems to be doing a very good job with their deluxified editions of games lately. The designer Hisashi Hayashi is one of my favorites and a number of his games are amongst my favorites. 

Unfortunately Yokohama didn't really live up to the hype for me. The rulebook for this game was very well written and on the lighter end as far as number of rules go. It's also got some interesting mechanics and choices and plays pretty smoothly. With my group rounds went by pretty quickly, but you end up playing a ton of rounds and I could see this really being affected by AP. Especially since the game seems like it wants you to drag it out. There is a definite disadvantage for going first and a definite advantage for going last... I'll play it again, but I've got a feeling it won't get played again after that.

4/23/17: First impression is great after 2 4p games.  There are many strategies to pursue and multiple ways to execute them which may induce AP for some.  Replay-ability would seem to be great due to the modular setup and variable achievement cards.  My only minor gripe is that the game's overall footprint is large and somewhat awkward and can make reading the cards in the Port/Dock and Research/Lab areas difficult,  but it's still an 8.5 and likely to go up.

RATING: 6
While the game was decently fun to play, I think this was a case of a game just not living up to my expectation for it. I was really hoping for a weighty gamer game with a lot of variety from game to game, as it appears to have so much random set-up that could affect how to approach the game.
 
However, the random set-up just seemed really superficial, as most of the stuff being randomized is incredibly similar. The goals, building sites, contracts, etc, are such minor variations on each other, that it doesn't feel like the incredibly high possible variety in set-up is really all that varied. It looked impressive at first, but then felt kind of "meh" in practice once you saw how similar all the different things were.

Also, what you do in the game just wasn't all that interesting. It's very standard "go here and get some resources" sort of stuff. Now, I still enjoy optimization games, so the overall puzzle of how to optimize while working around the other players was still somewhat fun, but felt pretty average, rather than something I was wowed by. Overall, I'd be happy to play again, but it's not something I'd push hard to get on the table.

The special powers and extra actions add a nice layer of decision making. But with all of that it is all still digestible and easy to play. Pretty good.

One of the better worker placement games. So many possible actions, so little time. Yes because if the end of game conditions are met by any other player, you only have one more round and all your plans are useless. Enjoyed playing and recommend it. We played the KS version: love those coins !

Another amazing Kickstarter deluxe edition from Tasty Minstrel. Not quite as good as Orleans overall. Though it looks extremely busy on the table, it is actually a fairly straightforward action selection and resource management game. A little point salad-y but does not fall into the worst trappings of those types of games, in my opinion.

I really enjoyed my play of this game.  Very interesting strategic and tactical decisions to be made as the actions of other players cause you to rethink your strategy.  The game comes across as really busy/complicated at first but after learning it you realize how well the graphic design communicates all you need to play the game.  Looking forward to playing this again ... only wish I had the deluxe edition.

[b]After one play I know that I want to play again for two reasons:[/b]
1. I misunderstood one of the end game scoring categories. As such, I thought my foreign agents were more powerful for the end game scoring than during the game. I was wrong. It certainly would have changed some of my in-game decisions and use of these foreign agents at opportune times.
2. I like the plethora of in-game decisions and blend of mechanics. I'm not one to get too stressed out if one option will give me 'x' points more than another - I just do what seems interesting so AP was not a huge issue (like a lot of other people find) and the game flowed quite nice. Buuuuuut, the first few turn were slow as we were still processing the game in general.

[b]I bought this for the following reasons:[/b]
1. My wife is excellent at spatial reasoning/moving games (Istanbul, Five Tribes) and I thought that this would really speak to that aspect (I was right).
2. The replayability provided by the cards and random setup. In particular, I like the random building cards put on each location - it reminded me of The Voyages of Marco Polo (which is our favourite game). 
3. I love games that allow for clever in-game bonuses and combos. It feels very satisfying when you execute a turn that triggers something else that sets you up for your next turn. Again, for some this might induce more AP and downtime.
4. The building on the bottom of the front cover looks like a duck swimming at you! :)

Despite what it looks like (a mountain of intimidation to some), this is a very easy game to teach...if you are familiar with it. 

No rating - see initial comments - but 8ish.

As someone at game night said, "Istanbul, fixed". I agree. The cool thing is the progressively powering up of actions before you take them. Those looking for strong theme will want to look elsewhere. If there's a contest for highest ratio between how complex a game looks, and how complex it actually is, this game would be in contention. It's really not that complicated. Kudos to TMG on a (mostly) clear rulebook. I read the FAQ (thread), and everything was already as I understood it from the rules. Couple production gripes: Countries are a little hard to tell apart. I with there were symbols instead of text on the cards. You can't read the text form a distance.

Two plays into the game and it is easy to see the appeal. The layout of the board dictates your approach each game more than I probably realize, but less than a lot of the early buzz would have you believe. The one thing that is bugging me about the game is the last turn. It feels tacked on and pointless. It is the type of last turn where everything is calculable and point min/max counting takes over. I would much rather the game end the round when the endgame condition is met. If you are paying attention to the other players, the end should not be a surprise.

This was my favorite game of Board Game Geek 2017.  The board is messy as hell, and it looks convoluted as heck, but the central mechanic is novel, interesting and offers a lot of depth, and is actually fairly simple once you figure it out.

The key to the game is the placement of workers, and the quick assembly of buildings, especially in places you know your opponents are going to go.  Once you figure it out, you can very quickly have some very aggressive turns with multiple actions.  

I do note that I was much more positive than the others at my table, who did not catch on as quickly.

It's a worker placement game. You get goods and money and then you turn them into points. You obtain technologies that make you better at doing certain things. Also, you can get points other ways. There's lots of ways to get points. Is it a point-salad? Absolutely it is.

But! The layers you add by having to place your workers are brilliant. Every turn, you have to consider what locations you want to use in the future, whether your workers will allow you to get there, whether you can work around the locations of other presidents (and, if not, whether it's worth it to pay them), and where you expect other presidents to go based on the current locations of their workers. The tenuous balance between what you can do now and what you want to do down the line has never felt more fraught. Every turn is interesting. Every turn has implications that echo long into future actions. 

At first, it can be intimidating to look at the board. There's a hell of a lot of information to take in. But, as you begin to play, you realize that what looks overly complex instead makes understanding the locations and reading the board state fairly simple, which, in turn, allows you to make the most informed decisions possible without feeling like you need smash your head against the wall for an hour.

And as for the point salad bit... this might just be the best point salad I've ever played. Because all the things you get points for--fulfilling contracts, making use of technology, building shops and trading posts, qualifying for achievements, establishing relationships with foreign agents, developing partnerships with a variety of international merchants--all of these things make a ton of sense given the role you're playing and the historical moment in which the game takes place. They don't feel arbitrary like so many sources of points in other point-salad games do. 

Like all salads, point-salad can be pretty damn good if the ingredients are top-quality and come together to create complex, interesting flavors.

Yokohama is right up my alley. While it doesn't do anything new and feels more like a clever mash-up of some acclaimed euro games, it's just fun to play. Especially the spatial planning aspect with the assistents makes for an interesting experience. Although I would prefer a little less point-salad, the package as a whole is quite engaging. It's only downside may be that it's a little to Euro for my regular gaming group. Fingers crossed that I'll still get a few more chances to revisit the city of Yokohama.

My gf likes it. I think it's pretty standard fare. Nothing new or inspiring about it, and the rules are unfortunately quite fiddly and non-intuitive. However, I would probably think it was the cat's pj's if I hadn't already played dozens of euros that are effectively the same. (Point salad, set collection, worker placement, contracts)

Stellar production by TMG takes this from 6 to 7 but I can't get more excited about it than that.

Edit: With 2p we have never paid each other to place an assistant or to move through a president. Not once. With 3p this happened often, and added much needed tension to the game. These are not minor rules. They are core mechanisms that are made irrelevant at 2p [i]and yet we have no official 2p variant rules[/i]. The slightly smaller map emphatically does not begin to make up for the lack of extra players. 

My rating of 6 (upped to 7 for production value) is for the 2p game only. With more players it is unquestionably a better game.

I love a dry Euro and am not too concerned when it is presented with very little theme as is the case here.  There is a lot to love about [thing=196340][/thing]. The way you travel around the board building up the power in your actions, racing to get the one-off bonuses, avoiding your opponents, all the time watching the end-game ticking ever closer and inevitably not quite getting the time to do quite what you intended to do.

Yokohama, whilst not offering anything obviously innovative, does what it does in such an interesting way that it feels all fresh and lovely.  And the deluxe edition components are just the best.

Regardless of whether I end up loving the game or not, I have to give it props for the clever design and popping production.

2017-05-22 : First play - mancala style worker placement/action selection that allows for long term planning and tactical combo play. Clear graphics and iconography that make it a breeze to play once you know the rules. Could potentially move up to a 10 if it plays as well with 3/4
2017-05-30 : Second play, now with 3 and it pretty much had the same feeling as the 2-player game, it only took longer - so this is definitely a max 3 players game, which is a bit of a shame because that's what's keeping it from getting a 10

Yokohama is commonly referred to as Istanbul on steroids. I can understand this comparison for the following reasons: it has a modular board of tiles, your character is moving on this grid of tiles based on assistants, you must move on your turn, other player's characters will get in your way, you can acquire special abilities, and there is somewhat of a race element (though this is more prominent in Istanbul). I also felt that it has some elements of Splendor. I say this because players will lay assistants on three different tiles or two of the same. In addition, players are using acquired resources to fulfill contracts. To take it a step further, if you complete the right kinds of contracts, you'll be eligible for a set bonus. In splendor, this comes in the form of immediate VP noble tiles. In Yokohama, it's end of game VP for sets and you can make more than one set.

Beyond the comparison to those games, there's just a lot of stuff happening in Yokohama. It's a much heavier game than either of those two titles. It kind of has a kitchen-sink approach, as it also has a race to meet certain goals (ala RftG, Grand Austria, and Terraforming Mars) and some majority scoring. There are various ways to end the game and player's will sometimes try to push one of these conditions, if it's advantageous to do so. When setup, it's looks like a busy and confusing mass of icons, but when you understand the rules of the game, it's a lot more intuitive than the initial impression provides. Overall, this is a lovely game that people who like point salad style euros are likely going to really enjoy. It's an even nicer production, if you were lucky enough to get TMG's deluxe version.

I like the game, and at the start of the game, I really liked it. I cannot really tell why my enthusiasm went down a little throughout the game.

Maybe because you didn't feel like you built up to something really great, just some points here and there. Anyway, a good experience.

This game looks pretty intimidating once you've got it set up. There is a lot of iconography all over the place, but once you know how everything works it is actually quite a simple game.

It has some similarities to Istanbul in that you move across and activate tiles in a grid. This one has a great mix between strategy and tactics. There are a a few different goals you can aim for, but each turn you'll have to figure out how to best get there.

The game plays fast and looks great (especially the kickstarter version.

Despite very simple mechanics, I am glad I didn't end up trying to teach this game (as I'd originally intended) to someone with low tolerance for complexity. Grasping the iconography, the vast variety of scoring options and the numerous tech abilities takes a bit of effort.

I'm surprised that 3P is by far the strongest recommendation. I've played two 3P games, and none 4P, but it seems that having an extra president pawn on the board would make movement far more challenging (and thus more interesting). But maybe people find that simply bogs down play too much to their liking. 

Definitely one I'm looking forward to playing again.

Yokohama is where Japanese minimalism goes to die. Without the script on the box you'd think you were deep in new age Euroland with its rehashed resource conversion stews and elaborate point salads. There are lots of references to other games in its class, with Istanbul and Le Havre perhaps being the two most obvious.

In spite of this lack of originality in its ingredients, the resulting game doesn't feel particularly close to any of its inspirations which, I suppose, is a compliment to the designer. If it still doesn't fully convince me, it's because quite a few of the elements don't particularly appeal to me (starting with its heavy front-loading, passing by its point-salady nature, and not ending with a somewhat repetitious conversion treadmill) and I cannot find anything that would elevate it above the games it builds on.

RATING: 7
2 plays so far. 1 at 3p and another at 4p with same people from the first game with an addition for the second. 
First game focused on getting import goods and customs which gave me big points. 2nd game was a lot more crowded and the layout put the dock and port right next to each  other so orders were heavily contested. The player who won that got some key technologies that boosted his ability to benefit from orders and locked those zones up a lot. Was able to get close by changing strategy half way and going for the church. 
so far I like that the path to victory can be dependent on the layout and multiple viable paths are available in each layout. Will be trying to get more plays in to see what else people come up with and if anything seems too strong of a strategy

Gespielt, verliebt: YOKOHAMA von Hisashi Hayashi, dessen INARABI von Japon Brand bei mir letztes Jahr nach Kauf und Regelstudium ungespielt durch den Sieb gefallen ist und an einen Freund der aufgehenden Sonne zum EK abgetreten wurde, hat es geschafft sich nach einer einzigen Partie bereits in mein Herz zu spielen. Und dies mit einem im Grunde klassischen WP-Spiel, welches das Rad der Rikscha einmal mehr nicht neu erfindet, aber es zauberhaft und charmant interpretiert - mit typischem Asia-Design und japanischen Schriftzeichen. Man hüpft mit Würfel-Workern und einem Pöppel-Hauptworker über Produktions-Felder, baut sie auf, aktiviert sie und sahnt ab, hüpft weiter, blecht an Mitspieler, kommt ihnen zuvor, erledigt nebenbei Aufträge, belegt Siegpunktfelder, kümmert sich um Abschlussmehrheiten und tut, was man schon 1000x zuvor bei anderen Genrebrüdern getan. Oh, wie ist das Alte neu so schön! Der pyramidale, ungelenke Aufbau von YOKOHAMA ist in seinem Umfang und mit seinen Variablen allein an sich schon eine Zen-Kloster-Meditation mit Gong. dlp hat sich die Deutsche Lokalisation geschnappt und wird die Geisha im Frühjahr 2017 adaptieren. Gute Idee für ein sehr gutes Spiel.

Yokohama is the first game I ever KS backed, based on the strength of TMG's quality when it comes to their "deluxe" editions and also the game was described as being a heavier take on Istanbul, a favourite game of mine! Yokohama starts off looking like it may be a dry economic Euro.  But as the game plays it develops in such an intriguing way.  Also, a very nice aspect about the game is that players naturally develop their own paths to victory heaven, so you get to see a lot of the board used in dynamic ways.  Yokohama doesn't try to hide its mechanisms behind too much theme and that can make it feel steely, but as long as you're a fan of Euros, this isn't really an issue. As everyone points out, the board looks simply overwhelming, but it all makes sense after the first couple of rounds.  I'm not overly drawn into the artwork on the area boards, with its very clean approach that only suggests the areas it represents with simple lines and muted tones.  I also find the actions available in Istanbul are a little more rich and interesting, where the majority of the actions in Yokohama are resource acquisition.  But the way you power those boards, and move to those boards, and what you can actually use those resources for is much deeper than Istanbul.  It's hard to have a firm feeling on Yohohama after one play, but I've gone with an '8' so far.  It's not terribly innovative, but it is a great next step forward in quasi-worker placement, route building design.   I feel anticipation towards a next game, so that's always a good sign.

Nice optimization puzzle and because of the end game triggers it doesn't drag a bit.   Fun to boost what spaces work best for your strategy.

Components: really good, I have the retail version
Complex: easy to teach, not so easy to learn
Weight: medium
Players: from 2 to 4
Length: less than 90 mins
Mechanics: route connection, resource management, set collection....
Decisions: a lot, you have to choose from many options and plan ahead several turns
Opinion: a game I have liked a lot, this is one of those game I say that offers a lot in few time, with a length of no more than 90 mins (usually) you have many things going on.
It seems that you are a merchant in the now emerging port of Yokohama (I say it seems because the theme is out there, but it's a typical euro). In this port you have your Merchant going around all buildings around the place in order to execute different actions you need to get the points you want, but this guy is not much clever, so you need to help him a lot in his job.
With a different board each game you have several buildings in the game, some to gather the standard resources, others to get contracts, other to get technology, others to export/import products, others to work hard your faith, others to recruit....and you need all of them (at least many of them) to get you points. Yes, you get points for many things, but all these things are connected, you can get points for contracts, while other go for technologies, but both things are connected and have to look one to another.
The turn is easy, place assistants, move your President, execute action, depending on the power you can build useful shops or trade houses, gets bonus, send your assistants to rest.
As said at the beginning, this is a typical euro, yes, but an amazing one. You get many things in just 90 mins, with lot of planning. Should I go for this contract or would it be better to get that technology, dam, there is another President there, cannot do that, wait what? I have to pay to move myself over there?
Right amount of interaction, you could see almost none in the first game, a bit more in the second, but you will always hear something like... "what are you doing here? come on, go out there!!"

This is a good game, but it's a bit too abstract to me. Two games in and I still can't figure out what the best moves and strategies are. I tried technology and orders and just can't seem to blend everything appropriately. The variable board state can be a bit frustrating as well if various goods are spread out throughout the board and you don't have a special card like "tram" to navigate things better. There is just something missing for me. Too much going on, too many options, not enough direction, SOMETHING. Something minor, admittedly, but something missing nonetheless that leaves this as a good, but not great game, in my opinion.

This reminded me of Istanbul, but it actually reminded me more of Rudiger Dorn games that [b]aren't[/b] Istanbul, because of the systemic incentives to heavily specialize while punishing players for being TOO tunnel-visiony (Goa, Steam Time).

I have now played several times. It is a great game and works well at 2p. But is is very AP prone (or more accurately, we are and this game triggers it) Because it is already a longish game (90min on box) with the AP, it becomes a game that is perhaps too long for us to play often. But rest assured we will play it regularly.

Ok game that doesn't offer anything new, in fact it bored me hard.

The game is completely fine and you can play different strategies and all, but there are just no highs or lows, just a flat line without much interaction on top of it. Oh, and the artwork is well... looks like someone threw a few paint buckets at a wall.

In short, it works and offers enough depth, but it fails at bringing fun to the table.

Thoroughly enjoyable experience! It looks 'busy' at first, but it ultimately plays very smoothly and presents interesting and engaging choices at every turn. It's a 'typical' euro in many ways, but one that still feels fresh in the way it combines its mechanics. Hoping to get this to the table more frequently to solidify my rating/thoughts, but early impressions have been very positive.

Yokohama is a terrific worker placement, action planning game, with a lot of variability in setup and goals.
While there are a large number of choices for placement and movement, it's not such an exhausting array of choices that one spends a lot of time min-maxing every placement.
Turns tend to move along well, and the flow of the game moved along until one of the multiple endgame conditions is met.
A very solid game I'd be happy to play again soon.

Lovely game--it is like if you put Istanbul on steroids.

If you add assistants to a tile where someone's president is standing AND/OR if you move your president through a tile where someone else's president is, you must pay them a coin per person. Also you can't do the action of a space where someone's president is currently standing. Money is pretty tight--you need it to buy more buildings, etc, so you of course won't want to pay anyone. This tends to result in a lot of GAHHH I HAD A PLAN BUT NOW PEOPLE MOVED AND ARE IN MY WAY which can slow down the game as you have to recalculate. Unlike Istanbul though where you can just do "some other action" while you wait for people to move, uh, it's pretty awful in this game, as you have a limited amount of people that you can drop down; you might just have to alternate your plans. Which is fine, it just means it may take a very long time for each turn to go by.... which generally means 2-3 hours is closer to expected play time?

So I liked this game a lot, but 2-3 hours will make it hard to get played that often. (I'm more tempted to suggest Great Western Trail.)

Nice worker placement/area majority euro. It feels like a mix of Spyrium, Voyages of Marco Polo and Manhattan Project: Energy Empire. It's fairly easy to teach, streamlined in terms of ruleset, but still manages to be a heavy and thinky game.

Also, excellent production values all round (though I have the deluxe version, so YMMV).

I'm not on the hype train here.  Setup is a pain.  Hard to make plans before your turn.  And the pile of little things to do on each turn make the turns slow down.

It's true I was playing with a slow-playing crew, but I also believe that's the general crowd this would appeal to.

Sort of like Istanbul by way of a heavy Uwe Rosenberg game. There are a lot of elements that feel very familiar, but the core twist on worker placement is very solid. There's a heavy tactical element around where the president is located and a great tempo/planning aspect to the workers. The first edition has frustratingly small text on cards, but that should be moot in the new English edition. The instructions are a beast and our group was exhausted in prepping for our first playthrough, but once we played a round, it all clicked and it was smooth sailing. Eager to play more.

I love this game. This is essentially a worker placement game with a bit of maneuvering around other player's workers. The "breadcrumb" mechanics reminiscence of a Rudiger Dorn design works perfectly here. The actions of each area is very simple, yet when put together creates an intricate web of strategies for the game. The timing aspect of each action is also very important in this game. If you mis-time your actions, you might have to wait 3-4 turns before you get to perform it again and potentially very punishing. Highly recommend this game

RATING: 7.5
I'm trying my best not to let the unbelievable AP of my opponents color my opinion of the game. I've heard that this game can induce that on people, and I have some AP folks in my regular group, but this was beyond the pale. I was fairly excited for this game as it seemed to be doing something fairly unique and I was hopeful about the aspect of working toward getting the actions you want while also working up to the four and five power actions and the bonuses they give. And that is there, and it's fun coordinating where to put your cubes down to create paths. But ultimately it just didn't all quite click. I think it's at least partially the same issue I had with Istanbul, where you're better off just hitting the same few actions over and over rather than trying to find some clever paths across the board. It's also partially that none of the arcs are that exciting. All of the main ways to score points basically amount to "collect resources and go to the specific spot to trade those resources for points." I mean, as far as a resource collecting, contract completing euro it's competently made, but it just didn't have that something special to make me want to go back to it. Maybe what I'm getting at is that it just didn't really all gel together the way I'd have liked it to. It wasn't any more than the sum of its parts.

Another thing that bugged me was how easy it was to accidentally get in someone's way. I'm fine with fairly interactive games, but it has to be deliberate. When someone's move ends up forcing me to stall for a turn for whatever reason and I know they have no idea I just feel like I've been randomly punished by the game.

I mean, don't get me wrong, it was fun enough, and I'd certainly gladly play it again, but I'd also gladly not.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2017)

I´m not sure why I backed Yokohama on Kickstarter, it must have been the “fear of missing out”. At that time I had just received my copy of Orleans Deluxe (a game I love) so I thought another deluxe game? Why not, but after learning who was the designer, my desire to play the game plummeted. I have disliked every game from designer Hisashi Hayashi, until now. I really liked Yokohama. Another thing that caused me to disregard the game, was the comparison to Istanbul (a game I dislike), in reality, both games share very little (fortunately), or it is much better implemented in Yokohama.

The rules of the game can be explained under 20 minutes. At first, it seems the game has complex rules, but they aren’t hard to grasp. The complexity comes from the amount of rules you have to teach. I learned the game at 1.00 in the morning so I misunderstood some concepts, still the game flowed easily and the graphic design helps to understand everything. I still haven’t read the rules so I don’t know if the game has variants. Playtime was a lot faster than I thought it would be, we finished the game faster (we were 3 players) than a 4 player game of Automania other friends were playing nearby. I think I prefer the game with 3 players, with more the downtime becomes excessive.

The theme is ok, nothing too exciting, but it doesn’t bothers me either. You don’t feel it through the game though.

The game´s components are very good as is the art. I played a retail copy of the game, I haven’t opened my copy so I’m not sure what are the changes between the retail edition and the deluxe edition of the game.

Yokohama has a lot of interesting decisions, nothing is obvious. You need to carefully plan your moves or you will lose. There are many ways to earn VPs, that is, it seems the game has many paths to victory. In our game, all players pursued a very different strategy, but we were very close at the end. I hope to find more differentiation in the score after some games. In your turn, you play workers to the areas you want to execute (now or in the future), 3 workers in they are in different areas, or 2 workers if they are in the same area and then you move your boss, following the trail of your workers, when the boss stops at an space he can do the action of the space and if the space has enough workers you can maybe build there and/or win some bonuses. Planning where to play your workers and where to move your boss each turn isn’t obvious and it is a lot of fun. The other player’s bosses can hinder you and you need to pay them if you go through them. Money can be very tight so paying this fee be very punishing. There are lots of actions you can do, in most spaces you can gather a resource, but you can also get a contract, get new technologies, send workers to special places that will score now and at the end of the game, get more workers and/or buildings, get money. The game also has 3 big goals for players to achieve during gameplay, they are different from game to game. To summarize, the game is highly strategic and it offers a plethora of options to pursue, timing is very important and the game offers lots of tension.

It seems Yokohama has a lot of replay value as it has a variable setup, lots of technology and contracts cards, variable goals.

Bottom line, I really liked Yokohama, it is a good Euro game. It is the best Hisashi Hayashi game out there and a keeper among my game collection. The retail version of the game is gorgeous, when I open the deluxe version I will come back to comment on the components. I really want to play it again soon and it can, perhaps, get an upgraded rating with more plays. I wasn’t expecting anything good from it, but I’m glad I bought it.

Hisashi Hayashi has tried his hand a virtually every genre you can think of, and a few others he's made up himself (string games?). With Yokohama, Hisashi takes a stab at a big scale resource-driven, pure-breed euro. It's the first Hayashi game that I've really enjoyed without major reservations.

At a high level, this sounds like most other euro games. Players collect resources and money in order to fulfill contracts for points and other bonuses. Players can purchase action improvement cards and get end-game bonuses for sets of cards with different symbols as well as meeting in-game goals that change from game to game. By that description, I feel like I own 30 versions of this game. So what sets this one apart? 

The action spaces are randomly placed, offset from each other, in a pyramid format. Each action can be performed at 5 different strengths. Players place 3 cubes ("assistants") on different action spaces every turn and they move their president piece to activate actions where his assistants exist. The level of action is determined by the number of a player's pieces on the space, including the president, any assistants, and any buildings that have previously been built. Presidents can only move over spaces where their assistants are present and presidents block other players. You have to pay another player if you want to place an assistant or move your president through the space. All this combines logistics and power in clean, compelling format that really is unique to this game. There are so many options and so many ways to execute them it is a true pleasure figuring out how to get what you need and do it better than the others.

RATING: 7
Rating based on 7 plays thus far, all within two weeks of the game's arrival -- TMG deluxe version which I backed on KS.  The game has justifiably been called the Istanbul "killer," as it uses a very similar mechanic of traveling to randomly setup locations but with alot more strategic depth and replayability.  I suspect the newness will wear off in the coming months, but can see the game making the table as part of the regular rotation given most of the people I have introduced it to seem to like it quite a bit.  In terms of medium to heavy Euros introduced in the last year or so, I probably would rate the game second only to Great Western Trail.

UPDATE:  Up to about a dozen plays now, and frankly I don't see the game staying in the regular rotation to the extent of my favorite of the past year (indeed, an all-time fav now), Great Western Trail.  This game doesn't have the strategic depth of GWT and, after about a dozen plays, I think I have explored it -- of course, were there to be more options, a new expansion, who knows, but for now the rating drops to a 7 -- good, solid game but not one I feel the need to play all the time now that the "newness" element has worn off.

The coins are so heavy it is a little concern when traveling to a con: I might actually put them in another bag just so they don't ding up the other components.

This would be JASE if it wasn't Japanese. JASJ. But somehow, being set in Yokohama instead of some European trading hub excuses it from being yet another cube pusher. Most will immediately compare this to Istanbul, but I find them to be completely different. This is open enough where I find there's very little of a puzzle or maximization element to the game. There's always something to do, which is where the fun lies. It has some component and physical design issues, but all in all it is enjoyable to play and actually feels somewhat unique, which is kind of impressive.

An Istanbul-type game but a lot heavier and with more interlinking parts. It felt quite solitare-ish except for occasionally using your piece to block someone elses (although this was usually incidental). 

Overall a good game but probably too many fiddly rules to introduce to new players often.

The movement aspect, and the pulling of workers after you activate that space, means you need to plan ahead. The fact that you can't use another President's space, and you have to pay them to go through, means you need to be flexible. That could be frustrating, but the fact that you always have solid alternatives means you never get messed over too badly. Also, the number of Tech cards means this game is highly replayable, and I can't wait to replay it some more.

RATING: 10
Fantastic puzzly fun.  I like the way you can plan ahead for future turns in an approximate way by laying assistants that may power up an action you won't get around to taking until many turns from now.  Everything feels positive and rewarding rather than restrictive, demanding, or punishing.  Excellent iconography made learning easier.

First play:  Rules were a little scary, but we persevered through them as a group.  AFter finishing the body of the rules, we still had lots of questions.  But after reviewing the rules for all of the various areas, it became clearer.  It took an hour, but eventually we understood it enough to get going.

Turns clipped along at a good rate, with some pauses as people figured out how to accomplish their various in-game goals.  With time running late, we opted to wind down the game just a tiny bit early.  We played for about 2 hours.

I believe I can teach the game much quicker now, say 20-30 minutes?  And I think turns have a chance of speeding up too.  Feels like it might be a full evening game.  At least with all four players.  Likely much quicker with lower player counts.

I am enthused, and will be looking to play this again soon.

Nice mix of well known mechanics - the result is ok. I like the Istanbul-like moving mechanic and because the board is different every game (it's built from smaller parts) there is a bit different pace every time. Rules are easy to learn and the game flows well: 90 minutes is totally doable. BUT for my taste there is too much room and too many things where to get your points. So similar issues as Uwe's (very popular) designs. So if you like for example Caverna, then you'll like Yokohama as well. For me this is just OK game, so I'm ready to play every now and then, but nothing more. Still have to give some credits to graphics and components: what a great looking game - (at least in Deluxe-edition).

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is Istanbul on steroids. I enjoy this one quite a bit more as there is a bit more going on. Quite a bit of point salad and whomever is most efficient in working out their routes will likely win. Feels overwhelming at first blush, but the game is fairly straight forward. A fair bit of replay value due to the 5 power chits and building cards as well as the locations themselves being in different locations each game.

Yokohama was the second game I ever backed on kickstarter and has the honour to be the first KS game that will leave my collection. Yokohama isn't a bad game by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, I very much enjoyed my time with this game. But after 10 plays there is nothing left to explore. The game plays out the same each and every single time. Initially I thought Yokohama offered multiple strategic avenues and routes to victory. But this didn't end up to be the case. So Yokohama will leave my collection but I will remember it fondly.

In my mind, this is a very Feld type of game, with lots of different ways to score. Definitely a super charged version of Istanbul. Istanbul is probably a better gateway game to introduce to newer gamers; Yokohama is more interesting for more experienced gamers who want more complexity and choices in how they move towards point accumulation and victory.

RATING: 8
Ein Worker-Movement und Planungsspiel der Extraklasse.
Wer am Zug ist, setzt bis zu 3 Assistenten (Würfelchen) auf 3 verschiedene Orte, danach darf man mit seinem Präsidenten zu einem Ort gehen, auf dem mind. 1 Assistent liegt und dort den Ort ausführen. Je mehr Assistenten und Gebäude an dem Ort vorhanden sind, desto stärker fällt die Aktion aus. Man erhält Waren, Auftrage, Technologien (Sonderfähigkeiten) oder kann direkt Siegpunkte erhalten.
Wichtig im Spiel ist dabei immer vorauszuplanen, Assistenten an einem Ort ansammeln zu lassen um in 2-3 Runden dann dort eine mächtigere Aktion zu machen, denn ich brauche für diesen Auftrag die Waren, dann brauch ich für das ein Handelsgut, das ich vom Auftrag erhalte und dann mach ich noch Siegpunkte in der Kirche, wofür ich in 2 Runden dann das und das brauche....
Sehr cooles Spiel, macht mir viel Spaß, aber es hat auch eine Menge an Material. Die Regeln sind an für sich eingängig, was mir aber nicht so gefallen hat ist die Spielendebedingungen (ja, davon gibts ein paar verschiedene) und das hat man nicht so einfach im Blick.
Wenn ich mich zwischen Yoko Hama und Istanbul entscheiden müsste (die Spiele kann man gut miteinander vergleichen), dann würde ich Istanbul spielen, auch wenn ich Yoko Hama das bessere Spiel finde. Istanbul ist aber leichter, schneller auf- und abgebaut und eingängiger von den Regeln und vom Spielende. Istanbul aber nur mit beiden Erweiterungen zusammen in der "Große Bazaar" Variante.

RATING: 6
As this was explained to me I was worried this was going to be another more-is-more point salad buffet of stuff piled upon itself. It comes very close to that. But one thing that it does right is: it gives real options.

Unlike a lot of games which throw everything in and then force you to sample every bit of it lest you miss out on a part of their amazing design, Yokohama seems like you can find a path, stick to it, and not worry too much about everything else. What I don't know is if all of those different paths are viable.

This isn't to say Yokohama couldn't stand to lighten itself up a bit. I know it's a tired song coming from me now, but do we really have to include every single idea one had for a game in the final version? 

Word in our circle is that this game "fires" Istanbul, a similar type of game. For me, that's not the case. Istanbul isn't a beloved favorite of mine, but it's one I'd be more eager to play, as it's much more direct and playable.

RATING: 7
Initial impressions: I haven't played many new to me games in 2017, but this may be the best of the bunch. Normally I dock games for being a jumble of mechanisms, but while the thematic ties to the assistants, the scoring tracks, the different countries set collecion, and the order cards aren't super strong, they at least a passable level of sense. I think the bright color palette, somewhat fresh setting (even if the theme of delivering goods isn't), and that all the mechanisms work in a way to make the flow of he gameplay feel smooth are all factors that also help make me not feel like the mechanisms are not shoehorned in.

Your opponents each blocking a single spot at a time makes for a surprising amount of interaction. It's definitely not ameritrash level, but since they also make it costly to move through them or to prep future actions in that spot it matters quite a bit.

Yokohama took Istanbul's limited movement due to assistant mechanisms and really improved upon it. The boosting of actions based on assistants adds a lot of strategic complexity while adding barely rules complexity (even if it may seem so initially due to the cluttered board).

I would speculate this game has moderate replayability. You can focus more on one of the scoring options from game to game, but I would assume the general feel is still try to collect sets of resources to convert to points, and trying to bunch up assistants to get the bonuses while at the same time not hampering your options too much. The different board placements each game probably change up logistics each game, and it seems like you only get a small fraction of the special powers cards per play, so those may help a bit.

This game is like Istanbul's bigger, more complex cousin. That's not to say it isn't elegant, or that it's over-wrought with mechanisms or rules; its' not. The game just has SO many avenues to pursue, and SO much variability to the setup, that determining what you what to do is less based on what others are doing, and more just picking your path (or paths) and executing efficiently.

I will still play Istanbul, as it's shorter, and can support 5, and is still a different experience. Honestly, Istanbul feels like the start of a genre which Yokohama has built into.

We've got the Deluxified version from TM, which rivals Scythe in production values.

I really like the quick flow of the basic action you do every turn. Nevertheless there definitely is strategic and tactical depth as I am learning with every play. I like the technologies as they give the different games a twist. Also art and theme are appreciated, as I definitely can see the little assistants run into the different areas for the president to seal the deals. Even the set collection element is something I can enjoy in this game (I normally don't) as I think of them as favors and standing with the different nations. Overall good game I am looking forward to play more.

Only downside I can see with 2 players is that there is little blocking of each other and we rarely pay each other to move through or place an assistant.

Very interesting worker placement game where you place cubes on tiles and move your President to one of those tiles and take an action.  You then focus on getting resources to expand building, develop technology or advance on tracks.

After One Play: Yokohama feels reminiscent of classic Euros, with resource management, and races to achieve X condition, fulfill X contracts, or be the first on X track.

[b][thing=196340][/thing][/b] is a resource collection, set collection game which borrows a bit from everywhere.  In fact, it reminds me a bit [b][thing=178336][/thing][/b], in the set collection scoring and that your action is to place cubes into one or more areas (and then your "President" pawn) and then take the action/items.  But [b][thing=196340][/thing][/b] is so much more than that and I enjoyed it so much more because it also has elements of [b][thing=141736][/thing][/b] in it's multiple use of cubes, and a bit like [b][thing=35677][/thing][/b] in that the pawn can block others from use of an area and that there's just more things you want to do than you possibly can.  And, of course, it's often been compared to [b][thing=148949][/thing][/b] because of the way actions are based on the location of one's "president".

Like many others, I thought this game looked too busy and confusing to bother with. I ignored the Kickstarter, but when some one in our gaming group brought a copy, I decided to play. I ordered a copy before finishing that first game. Admittedly, the game does LOOK daunting, but it isn't.

Once you've played a couple of turns, it becomes clear and easy. Since we did not get the Kickstarter bonuses we have chits instead of meeples and those fit better on the boards and don't look as cluttered as the wood pieces. I will say that the non deluxe version is much less cluttered than the Kickstarter version. There is a LOT going on in this game so there is no clear path to victory. Turns don't usually take long at all, but there is so much going on that I could see AP becoming a factor.

I am not a member of the 'Cult of the New' but I have to give this game a 10 because it is truly one of the most interesting games currently on our shelf. It plays very well with two players, which is our most preferred choice.

This is a perfectly fine and enjoyable game to play.  However, I am not a big fan of games that offer tons of "options" while pretending to be a deeper game than they really are.  This falls directly in that category.  Most actions are too similar. It feels like no matter what you do, you'll eventually score points for something.

I do enjoy the technology cards and wish they were an even stronger focus of the game.  Allows you to set yourself apart from others in the type of actions you might take.

Very straightforward to play, but a very busy looking board.  Not a lot of interaction.

May end up buying an expansion for my copy of Istanbul instead of keeping Yokohama.   Even through both games are about being efficient, Istanbul offers more tension throughout the game and feels like each decision matters more since it's a race.  Plus, Istanbul is much easier to teach and faster to play while being more satisfying to play.  I thought I wanted a deeper Istanbul, but I think I was wrong.

Was turned off when I saw this game as it looked like another overly convoluted new-age euro.  Instead, it is a stupidly simple game of laying down workers and picking them up later to do more and more powerful actions.  Let that be a lesson to not judge a game at first sight.

Kickstarter.  Received 4/20/17.

Reminds me of a mish-mash of other games in the collection...
Variable order board (Argent)
Fulfilling orders (Viticulture)
Variable A/B/C goals (Grand Austria Hotel)
Rondel-ish movement with strategic blocking (Vinhos)

My only real gripe is that you don't see a lot of locations in the 2 player game.  At 4 players, I feel like the board might even be too busy.

+ Variable setup and goals
+ Many ways to score points (orders, techs, goals, etc.)
+ The technologies are strong enough to make a real impact on the game
+ Great production value and art
+ Rondel type movement and placement of assistants creates difficult decisions that really reward long term planning
- Church board feels like it's not quite worth the investment (i.e. Book track in Mombasa)
- 2 Player game removes certain boards that we won't be able to experience unless we play at higher player counts

Gameplay is silky smooth and rules are simple even though at first glance the board seems very busy. It plays like a more advanced point salad version of Istanbul.

I'm not sure I like how the endgame can be a game of chicken with everyone trying to calculate the right time to trigger. There can be huge swings in scores during this part of the game, especially with the area control points. For this reason, I may prefer the game with two players rather than three even though there is less blocking.

Walking around with your assistants and president and do an action on a tile. Modular board, multiple roads to victory. You need quick players for this, it's terrible with AP people. Point salad, points are everywhere. I like the mechanism, good planning needed, although it isn't very innovative. It's just resource collection and converting them into points as we have seen a thousands times before. Plus the game takes slightly longer then it should. Still solid game. I like the part of planning several moves ahead.

Lots of strategic space to explore, paths to take, and decisions to make.  Intimidating number of pieces and symbols, but definitely much less complicated than it looks. Mostly clean and intuitive.  Potential for big combos and chains of bonuses, which can be exciting but can also take a long time to sort out.  Good with 2, and interactive enough, but probably better with more players as board position/path become more important.

An excellent engine builder/worker placement game.
With 2 players the playing time is a bit too long which makes it a bit easy to do everything you want to do. More contracts should have been removed from the 2p mode.

It looks especially daunting in the beginning. There is just so much going on. I did pretty well in the end, taking second place. But it's not really the kind of game I love. It tends to cause AP with a plethora of options. It's basically an efficiency engine. It's not bad, and I would definitely play it again, but ultimately I'm glad I didn't kickstart this, because I think I like Istanbul better -- it's a lot more straightforward. 

I was very impressed with the kick-starter components though. They look great and function well. The game felt a little longer than necessary, too. I think I would rather play with 2 or 3 players if I play it again.

After one play, I'm not sure if my attitude towards this will ultimately be:  
"This is an awesome, grown-up version of Istanbul with a lot of interesting paths to explore." 
Or:  "This is bloated, fiddly, overwrought version of Istanbul with a bunch of needlessly funsucking bits tacked on."  
I need more plays, but I really think I could come down either way on this one.

Three plays so far.  Very good, if not GREAT game.  Just not sure that I need to own it, seeing I already own Istanbul, and there are some similarities between the two.  Will have to give Istanbul (with expansions) another try.

Yokohama is firmly in the gamer's game camp.  Where Istanbul is both a family and gamer's game.  My preference is slightly towards Istanbul, just because it is easier to explain, and more fun to play IMHO.

Really solid Euro that combines the Feldian point salad with the Rosenburg philosophy of pursuing whatever strategy you decide is appropriate. The comparisons to Istanbul are certainly warranted, but this gave me a closer vibe to Notre Dame with how your workers powered up your actions. Overall I found myself really enjoying the game. It really is much simpler than it would appear, but I almost found it too easy to do what you wanted to do. Along with that, I don't know that this boasts as many plays as it strives to have. Still, one of the better Euros I've played in awhile. TMG usually is great at import games. Too bad the same can't be said of their in-house designs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Yokohama has its charming moments that remind about Istanbul. Place servants on production spots and use your master to pick up both them and the resources. The spots are used to acquire contracts, acquire resources to fulfill those contracts, acquire servants and buildings, acquire technology for game advantages, or simply fight for majorities for victory points.

The game flows quite well but the point salad makes it hard to focus on a strategy. Instead it becomes a receptive hunt for tactical opportunities until someone decides to end the whole. It's a pity but also a sign that eurogames have moved from clean designs to overloaded.

A fun game about running around the play area gathering and trading in goods to build buildings and score points.

I tried it at 2 players and enjoyed the smaller game space, so I suspect it will scale up fine with the extra boards.

Nice game, and certainly reminiscent of Istanbul in the movement and collection of the assistants.

Initially its confusing as to what you do where, but after a round or two, the options become more fluid and the connections make more sense.

There is little in the way of hidden or unaccouted VP, so the score track represents a pretty close view of who is winning at any point.

I'm so glad I didn't buy Istanbul.  Yokohama gets the same ya-yas with five times the strategy and 50 times the replayability.  There's more than a few edge cases to the rulebook that you'll need to understand, but this looks like a permanent addition to the game collection.

Between Orleans and Yokohama, TMG is filling in the imported-from-the-world space that Rio Grande used to fill.  Both are smart acquisitions.

Gran bel gioco. Quasi inaspettatamente. La prima visione del tabellone fa lacrimare gli occhi, in realtà Yokohama e un gioco interessante e profondo ma al tempo stesso semplice, seppur la prima spiegazione richieda tanto tempo. Si tratta di un piazzamento lavoratori. Gioco molto tedesco con un paio di effetti casuali e ad informazione nascosta che assolutamente non tolgono nulla alla bellezza del gioco. Gioco strategico più che tattico con interazione presente ma non eccessivamente fastidiosa. Dopo le prime partite è diventato una della più interessanti novità dell'anno. Gioco giapponese e non di facile reperibilità

[i]A lot of folks are making a connection between Yokohama and Istanbul and I just don't see it. I was indifferent towards Istanbul and after one play of Yokohama, which I really didn't want to play because of the comparison, I came away pleasantly surprised at how much fun it was. I think there is a lot more going on in Yokohama with many more scoring paths to pursue. I enjoyed the deeper decision space in Yokohama and would recommend trying it even if you're not keen on Istanbul.

Admittedly, I have a weakness for the city of Yokohama since I lived there for three years but this is a REALLY good game! It looks imposing when you set it up but the mechanics could not be easier. However, like the best Rosenberg games, the decision tree is enormous because there are so many different directions you can go. In that respect, it is a bit of a "sandbox game" but it is a controlled sandbox since you need to commit to a strategy to get points. 

A game that I will repeatedly come back to and enjoy.

From the start I was told that one technology card was more powerful than all others and it came out in the setup. That player won, but not by much so I think that there is potential here. I really like the mechanic of adding tokens to then have your president activate them and the benefit of having more tokens when activated. Most points are also made during the game, so you can see who is doing well, but those few end game points usually determine the final winner as the game is close. After a second play I am still undecided, one things is sure, there are many routes to victory.

Yokohama is a resource-gathering contract-fulfillment game. Each turn, you put some cubes on different action spaces, and then move your president pawn as far as you want along a path of your cubes. The space he ultimately lands on is the action you take, and its effectiveness is determined by the number of your cubes there. In your action is powerful enough, you can place a building on the space, which gives you a permanent cube in that space as well as some other bonuses. The actions you can take include gathering resources, taking contracts, buying tech, getting more cubes and buildings, and claiming extra spaces that are worth points. There is a lot going on here, but it played a lot more smoothly than I thought it would. I enjoyed this one quite a bit.

I really shouldn't like this game. Point-salad.. Why is the Church even in the game? It's off-topic, tacked on and the game would have been cleaner without it. 
No really, I should not like this game. Takes too long. First game took almost 3 hours and the last half hour was just waiting for it to end and tally up the score. 
Seriously, I should NOT like this game. There is no interaction, except when someone accidentally blocks your move, which is annoying. There too much down-time since you cannot plan your next move until it's your turn and then everybody has to wait until you figure out what to do. 

I like this game. The mechanism is extremely smooth and clean : place your assistants in 3 different locations (or 2 in a single one), move you director along a path of assistants and then take the action of the area you end up in.  And that's it. That's what you do most of the time. Simple and clean. 
Recommended.

Played two-player thus far.  Seems a bit long for what I got out of it.  I wonder if we need to push the end game harder.  It also suffers from what I consider to be too much set-up randomness.

I'd like a few interesting set-up suggestions to ensure a tight game.

Meaty game with an overload of decisions to make every turn. Lots of details to keep track of and a big busy spread of game parts on the table.

But after a few plays and experience it becomes more enjoyable.

Yokomama is a tactical recipe-fueled pickup and deliver game. It has an interesting mechanism where you lay your workers down on tiles like breadcrumbs and then walk your meeple along chains of tiles containing your workers. You choose where to stop and then resolve an action in your end spot with a strength equal to the number of your pieces there. The game rewards you for taking actions of higher strength encouraging buildup. The nice thing about the recipes here is that you can claim the cards ahead of being able to compete them, which helps a lot in terms of what I see as an issue in similar games, where you are fighting to grab the goal faster than other players after already spending the time lining up the ingredients.

While this game might do nothing "new" it's extremely well done, the iconography is consistent and quickly understandable and the gameplay feels very smooth and enjoyable. Downtime between turns is fairly low. Player interaction isn't extremely high, although you do have to pay other players money when you walk through them, or place workers into where their pawn is standing, so it's not completely solitaire. The game also has some nice rules that allow you to earn extra action tokens, so there's good room for clever and creative moves.

I just finished playing a 2p game and my oh my is this a smooth game. I own the deluxe edition so the pieces were top notch with the metal money. Very very good production. A lot of the changes to the game were made from the japanese edition to the TMG american edition. 

The game is very interesting -- the network building mechanic with the workers allow you to call 'dibs' on certain actions on the board but you pay extra if you happen to drop dibs on a action that was performed previously. Also forces you to not place every worker on every space because you will be limited by the amount of workers you have at the beginning. This game gives you full reign on what choices and strategies you want to employ whether it be via contracts, buildings, foreign goods or through the church. The more workers you have on a space allows you to take a powerful action, and allow you to combo off your previous moves if planned correctly. 

It's a well balanced game and i suspect that my rating of this game will only go up. over time. The only con i can think of is that this game is VERY busy. It will turn off people who aren't hooked on by game play rather by image and style/theme. Set up time is longer than it should be. I suspect an insert will remedy this.

Highly, highly recommend.

Really enjoy this game. In the same vein as Istanbul, Five Tribes and even Trajan. I love the idea of placing cubes to create a road/path of sorts while at the same time strengthening future actions. Lots of ways to score points and timing is key for a lot of these. Really looking forward to many more plays of this game.

RATING: 7
Once I became comfortable with the rules, I really quite enjoyed Yokohama.   It's an intense and calculative dry Euro with a remarkable twist on worker placement that requires solid planning.  Add to that an extremely claustrophobic board ripe for getting in each-other's way, and life becomes delightfully stressful.

But oh my god is it a lot to take in at first.   The art is joyless, and the board looks less exciting than a TPS report... Neither of which makes this an appealing game to approach, or aids new players in figuring out the massive web of occasionally unintuitive rules.

RATING: 7.5
Great game. I think it is brilliant, and offers some real decisions; and lots of ways to score. That being said, I don't think I love it. It's just a bit to much brain power for this one. There is a lot going on to think about on the board. Some say this is the gamer's version of Istanbul. I haven't played Istanbul yet, but if it was the lighter version of this I think I would love Istanbul. That being said, I would enjoy playing this one if it came to the table. I just have to take it off of my Coolstuffinc Wishlist at this point, because I don't think it would hit the table if I owned it over my other games. If someone suggested it though. I would love to play. I did play a 4 player game, and it did have a little more downtime than I like, so I could like this one even more at 3 players, and with more familiarity with the many areas and symbols.

:) Very elegant and rather original (though a little Istanbul-like, but better) game mechanics. Combination of finding a way through a grid/maze, resource management, repeated engine building and some minor set collection.

:) Game flow is fluent, there is no downtime to speak of.

:) Different set-up each game, increasing replayability

:soblue: The game doesn't feel 'epic' in any way. It looks a little bland and though it offers interesting challenges to players it feels a little light.

All in all a beautiful game which plays away smoothly and which would be ideal for parties of medium to medium-heavy players to enjoy for a medium-short and accessible game (90 - 120 min).

Man this is an excellent, excellent Euro. Not too simple, not too complex, not too short, not too long - it's just about spot-on in every respect. It's tense, thinky in the fun way, and very, very satisfying. We cannot get enough of this one. Only con we've seen is that the game is not always tight, and it doesn't seem to have any built in catch up mechanism. So if a player pulls ahead mid game, it may be very difficult to turn things around, which can be frustrating. But for us, the game is so much fun that if that happens we just go ahead and play again! Highly recommended :)

--Jul2016-- It's quite cool.  I like the decisions; it's not terribly difficult to explain; and the game is clear and sensible in practice.  My rating could improve with further play.
(And, to my eye, the comparisons to Istanbul are amusing: while there absolutely is some structural similarity, I found the logistics and the things that I needed to consider to be quite different.  I'm not a fan of Istanbul at all, and yet I liked this.)

Very fun "one-worker" placement game. I need more plays but I'm already pretty sure this is replacing Istanbul for me. There are many routes to victory points and lots of layers to think about (do I want to score 3 fish now or go for 5 fish and the bonus tile but that'll take more time and I need to get a building first to place to make it worthwhile and uh oh, someone else is shooting for that bonus and...). The technology cards are fun, allowing you to break the rules in minor ways. Thematically it's medium. I mean, you're moving dudes around to score stuff to score more stuff, but it still gives a flavor of 19th century Japan. It helps a bit that I have the Kickstarter pieces. 

Another bonus is my wife like's it. She's not big on conflict and she like's the economic puzzle aspect of the game.

After one 3p game, I am intrigued. The game seems overwhelming at first because there is just SO much on the table between the boards and bits. But it quickly comes together and we only had one rule question which was cleared up pretty quickly. I loved the worker placement as President action and with 4p could make for some super interesting strategies especially by blocking out other players. This happened in our game but we only just started to unlock the mechanic mid-way through. You try to fulfill orders with resources, build up influence in key areas with purchased shops and trading houses, find ways to get more workers available, purchase tech, collect sets of cards and sell import goods. There are certainly a ton of paths to victory and how exactly to become efficient at any of them remains a bit elusive after one play. I also wanted the game to last much longer than it did as there was a quick push with the churches to end our game.  A good first play and definitely want to have it hit the table again.

3 2er games

Cool, worker placement action selection gamer-y game in the style of Istanbul. The board is randomly configured of the same locations. Players place assistants (2 in one, or 1 in 3 different) then move their President along assistant paths and activate the final spot: the more pieces of wood (assistants, President, shop/trading house), the stronger the action. Actions give you resources, money, order(s), or technology; allow you to pull more tokens (shops, trading houses, or assistants) from your warehouse; or place a worker on the Church or Import boards. A lot of that stuff gives you points as well, during the game and/or at the end. 

It's a fun game requiring a good bit of planning and optimizing. You need to decide when it's better to take the quicker/weaker action or wait for the stronger one. And you need to plan your routes a few turns in advance, especially if the other players are potentially going to block you. 

I'd like to try it with more players, although the additional boards don't seem to add much (they're just duplicates of the basic game, aren't they?).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I bought this game on the description that it is similar to Istanbul which I like.  I don't think it is really that similar to Istanbul but this is still a really great game.

The game is made up of a bunch of tiles set up as a map.  On your turn you put out a certain number of workers and move your president and activate the tile you move to.  The quality of the action you take is based on the number of pieces you have there.  There are a lot of tiles and therefore a lot of options and ways to play this game.  There are technology cards, orders to fulfill, achievements, church and export boards to claim spots on, and more.

I think the sheer number of choices is what attracts me to this game so much.  You can play this game tons of times and pursue different paths each time.

The game is beautiful but I should caveat that by saying I have the Deluxified edition.  I don't know how it compares to the standard but this version comes with wooden resources, metal coins, and stickers to differentiate each player's president.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A pick-and-deliver, resource management game (a more complex version of Istanbul). I liked how you had to leave your assistants on tiles to form a path for your president to travel. You can't stop where another president is currently, and if you pass through a tile with a president on it you must pay 1 coin. This created interesting strategies, as you may not want to pay 1 coin, or the location you wanted was blocked.

I wish there was more diversity among the locations as in a 4 player game, it seems to be a lot of duplicate tiles (for each resource, order cards, technology). I also liked the set collection aspect with the different nations.

Played the kickstarter version: Components are great, but some of the colors of resources match the player colors exactly!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I like the game. It's a sort of logistics or efficiency kind of game in which players do it all, instead of pursuing a single strategy. I like those kinds of games as they seem to present enough alternatives and replay ability even though most of the times that's not true, that's much more like a feeling than actual diversity.

The graphics and board organization are not user friendly but in my opinion the game deserves a big chunk of the hype it has and I surely will play the game more often. 

Also on the plus side, Yokohama feels different from the usual. Hisashi presents this novelty factor really well, IMO.

I prefer playing it with 3 than with 4.

Finally played this (Dec 2017). When it was all set up my head started spinning. It just looked like overkill and that somebody needed to take a hatchet to this game to trim it down.

They took some of the ideas from Istanbul, and then they made a longer, more complicated, less elegant, less interesting game out of them.

Interesting take on a kind of worker placement game where you have to plan ahead on the strength of the actions you want to take. There's a decent amount of depth and a large amount of choices that the game could grind down due to AP.

I think the game would only be "okay" but the technology cards push it to "pretty good" since I'm always a fan of "special player powers" in games. Will have to play it more to solidify my opinion, but I definitely enjoyed my first playing of it.

tl;dr: very solid euro

Now here's a nice variation on things we are familiar with. It's not a real worker placement system, but it is something in the same vein. You add workers to the board on locations you want to use, and then you can move your main pawn anywhere on the board, as long as the locations you pass over contain at least one of your workers. The location you end on is activated. The strength of the effect depends on the amount of wooden bits of your color on the location, including your workers, pawn and possibly buildings.
The different locations do different kinds of things: give you resources, give you goal cards, score you points, give you more playing pieces... This allows for a huge variety of possible strategies that can be combined.
This is a rather heavy game, and new players will probably have no idea of how to get started. But after a couple of rounds, things fall into place and everything will become clear.
I was pleasantly surprised by this game, I look forward to exploring it more.

My wife and I played Yokohama for the first time the other day and we both LOVED it! There are so many different strategies that can be used, so many paths to becoming the most successful trader in Yokohama. We both felt that even if you were not the most successful trader at the end of the game (a.k.a. you lost!) you still had a good sense of accomplishment and had fun trying to figure it out. 

If you are looking for a game with great strategy, theme and that is not that hard to learn, then give Yokohama a try!

I own the Deluxified (Kickstarter) version.  The components are simply beautiful and I love the metal coins.  

The setup looks very complicated but it is still quite easy to explain everything in a short amount of time.  A couple turns into the game and everything feels comfortable.

We have played it several times and I have tried different strategies each time.  I enjoy how balanced each of the routes to victory can be because I have had to change my plan each game based upon what other players have done and the achievements selected for that game.  I also enjoy that turns are fairly short so that downtime between turns isn't too bad.

I have added this to my 'A' list games that will come out frequently.

Yet another themeless resource conversion game about gathering stuff and filling contracts for that stuff. Gets positive marks for the modular board. It's kind of a middle ground between Concordia's loose, free, and easy attitude and Marco Polo's straightjacket-and-vice combination. 

Concordia is a more mechanically solid game, but I prefer this to Marco Polo.

Damn, this game is awesome. It's confusing for the first couple of turns, but once you play about 2 rounds, everything clicks. The variability combined with the different layouts depending on the number of players makes every game interesting. I've used different strategies each game I've played and they all seem like viable strategies. I'm basing this on the Japanese version of the game, but highly suggest this to anyone when it comes out in America or elsewhere.

I was able to play the Japenesse version at the TMG booth at Dice Towed Con.  At first it looked way too busy and complicated, but by the time it was explained to us, it made total sense.  I really enjoyed the simple easy of the actions (play 3 workers to 3 different spots, or play 2 workers to one spot), move your president,  do the action.  Paired with the strategic nature of the game.  I didn't have to put up the game since it was at the booth, but I am curious on how that would be.  My wife liked it, although said she wanted to see what another play would do.  I did back the deluxe version from TMG on KS, and am looking forward to getting it in my hands.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
5/20/2017: Played and taught the game for the first time. It takes a long time to setup and on the same account, it provide variability on the buildings, building site cards, achievements. All of these random setup changes the game from one play to the next and makes it different from one play to the next. Additionally, the decision made by each of the player also affect how one will play the game as well. 

This is a game that seems to be complex but once you start playing it, everything makes sense. There are so many different decisions that you can make during each of the play and rarely you will run out of options to take. Though this also causes the game to be analysis paralysis (AP) prone. In some turn, people may take some time to think through their strategy as the board is changed by the buildings taken by other players in previous turns.

One caution that I have is not to exceed 3 players. The downtime can be a bit longer than what you would expect. Other than that, I really like the the game: the variability, the vast options of strategy, the player interaction. This is definitely a game that will stay in my collection and be played from time to time.

RATING: 8
My initial impressions are high. After two games (one at two-player and another at four-player), the comparisons to Istanbul are apt, but also somewhat misleading. I would call this advanced Istanbul, but they are more second cousins than siblings. While in Istanbul, everything centers around your Merchant, in Yokohama placement of your workers and the forward-planning to do so effectively is more heavily emphasized. Likewise, Istanbul is a straightforward race to collect gems while Yokohama is a point-salad Euro. Both games require optimization, but Yokohame is the more sprawling puzzle. The problem there is that the game can overwhelm, especially new players staring down the dizzying collection of tiles that make up the Yokohama board. All of those options leads to a game that can last more than the promised 90 minutes. That time is filled with decisions and planning (all good), but I wonder if that longer experience doesn't overstay its welcome. Especially for this last reason, I don't think this will be a game I seek out on a regular basis; but for what it offers, Yokohama is a solid entry.

It's also a game that can be brutally frustrating for someone who finds themselves with a similar game plan to another player, as you can get caught continually a step behind, especially since there is a race component to be the first to use each space with 5 power. Even worse, this has a severe rich-get-richer element and for anyone falling even a little behind, there is no way to come back or compete. In some games, where actions have equal importance, the mechanic of being able to block certain spots from other players by using them works well ... in Yokohama, it's simply brutal and annoying, as certain spaces, especially early on, are clearly more important to getting an engine up and running than others. Overall, there was not much I found here that I would consider compelling or fun. I certainly don't understand the high ratings, other than the cult of the new rearing its ugly head.

First play impression: I didn't like Istanbul overall. The gameplay was fine, but there could be a runaway leader and it felt like the two paths to victory were a little limiting.

Yokohama has very similar gameplay but it opens things up quite a bit. There are several paths to victory and Yokohama just has a better feel to it because of the number of options.

Neither Yokohama nor Istanbul are engine-building games, but I like that in Yokohama you can get a tiny bit of an engine built up. As you place permanent buildings onto the tiles those buildings count toward your power, so you can always take a slightly stronger action when you go there.

I will say that I played the deluxe version and although the gameplay stands on its own, the deluxe components enhance the usability of the game. The standard flat tokens can easily be overlooked while laying on the busy board, but the deluxe wooden buildings are impossible to miss. So you can easily see if someone else will get money from your action, or if you already have a building on a space before you move there.

Overall this seems like a keeper. For the amount of options, the game actually flows really fast and smooth. You just put out your assistants and then take an action. Occasionally you'll chain a couple of bonuses together, but turns generally take seconds instead of minutes. Good stuff.

RATING: 9
A game with a lot to offer. After 2 plays, I'm already considering where it should go among my favorites. I like all the different ways you can take it. It creates a tactical game of maneuvering and out maneuvering opponents that's enjoyable--I usually don't like those kinds of games. I think there are certain techs that are important. I won my last game and I think it's partly because I picked up two cards that essentially allowed me to ignore other players' presidents. I could go where they were and take the action, and I didn't have to pay anything to move through their locations. It was almost too good. Every other player had moments where they felt they had to take sub-optimal moves because they were blocked.

Anyway, Im' putting it at a 9 for now. Only time will tell if it will maintain its high rating, and possibly break into my top 10.

Yokohama was the first new game I tried at Lobster Trap. I had seen some buzz about this game, but after looking at a picture of the board I felt overwhelmed. I really wanted to try this one and see what it was all about.

The initial setup is a visual cacophony. But... it's actually not that complicated once you know what you're doing. There's a pyramid of action boards (the shape doesn't really matter except for what's next to what else, which changes from game to game). Each board does one type of action and has some bonus spots you can build shops or a trading post on. The actions are essentially stuff like get resource x, get resource y, spend z to get points, etc.

On your turn you put down either 3 cubes on three different action boards or two on a single board. Then you move your "president" who must follow a chain of your cubes to get to his destination (paying 1 coin for every opponent president he passes and not stopping on any action where there's currently an opponent president). Where the president ends is the action you take. The level of the action depends on how many things you have in that space. Every cube, building and your president give you a level point. How many level points you have decides how powerful the action will be. But the cubes will flush after you trigger them.

There's some ability cards you can buy. And there's some bonuses for doing A, B or C in each game (where A, B, and C are randomly determined at the outset).

The game really kind of reminded me of Istanbul, but less of a race and more of a resource management game. It looks really complicated, but is much simpler than that. I enjoyed the game a lot.

I rate TMG's Deluxified edition 9.4, but the standard Edition gets a 5.9 from me.
The bad components from the base game completely kill the pleasurable gameplay I get from the Deluxified edition.

The flat buildings are very hard to see when placed on the already heavy to the eyes setup of the boards. Whereas in the Deluxe Edition the wooden pieces pop out and are immediately recognizable.

The cubes that are supposed to act as your assistants are tiny and look more like breadcrumbs than people. Whereas in the Deluxe Edition the mini Meeples are real co-workers that help you to achieve your goals.

If you would ask me to play Yokohama the standard Retail Edition, I would flat out tell you "No way, because I know there is a much much better game out there called: Yokohama the Deluxified Edition!"

One of the Birthday Trilogy, as I've just now decided to call it: three games I bought for my wife's birthday (tomorrow as I write this), all named after places we've visited.

After a few plays: Wow, what a challenging set of intertwined decisions. It's a medium Euro--it only lasts for an hour or a little more, and you can already start to feel competitive after a turn or two of learning the ropes--but it is a heavy decision matrix. Very fun at 2p, where you're rarely blocking each other all that badly, don't know how I would feel with more players with more traffic bottlenecks, which I tend to find frustrating (Le Havre, eg). But we're mostly going to play at 2p, and it will go into heavy rotation at least for now--it's a very good brain burner.

After a couple more: for now, as we get to know it, I always win this against my wife (that won't last), but still, she says it might be competing with Trajan for her favorite game. That's how much we like it: fun even when you lose.

After many more: In very heavy rotation, one of our three or four favorite games.

To me, Yokohama plays like a gamer version of Istanbul - and that is quite high praise indeed. It also scales well from two to four players, even though three is probably the sweet spot. Turns go quickly in this game, and I love how the game encourages you to think a few turns ahead, but leaves room to take advantage of suddenly arising opportunities. I also love the look and feel of the deluxified TMG edition, adding to my interest in all games from OKAZU Brand. The board looks complex when the game is set up, but belies the relatively simple rules.

It's basically Istanbul on one too many energy drinks. And by that I mean, it has a very similar worker path system in which you are picking up and fulling contracts in order to score points, but it is almost blinding in its coloring and numerous end game scoring.  The game is an interesting blur and while I would always play it before Istanbul, I do find the design as elegant.

There is a lot going on in this Heavy Euro.  The options seems overwhelming upon first glance, but becomes clearer as you play.  The game in some ways felt like a heavier version of Scoville.  (Order fulfillment and blocking movement on the grid, but there is a LOT more going on here.  It felt too complicated for me to want to own and the theme is almost non-existiant.  Many games I'd rather play...but I'd be happy to give it another play sometime.

RATING: 9
At two players, the game is easy to play but lack of interesting decisions.  It's not very engaging and you don't seem to build something, just doing the same actions one after the other. Maybe it's to easy to go anywhere you want. This is the kind of game I want to be tight,
Update:  way better at 3 and 4 players because it's more challenging to do well.  Sure, everyone is pursuing is own strategy, but there's some direct and indirect interaction and it's feels more like a race to some point.  You have to stay focused.  Beautiful game!

Provisional rating, one play, with the Achievements/Free Agents promo.  Reminiscent of Istanbul due to the movement mechanism, but with a lot more going on. Seemed a fine medium-heavy Euro, interactive to a limited degree - you need to work around your fellow players, but typically your plans will be delayed rather than ruined. Nonetheless, I personally prefer the scope and length of Istanbul.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
All of the comparisons to Istanbul are pretty apt, it has a similar feel on the board as you move your main piece around to activate locations.  The process of putting your assistants out on the tiles is more free-form and requires a little less planning ahead as far as maneuvering, but there are more ways to interact with the spaces themselves, and the amount of assistants on each spot makes a big difference.  

It is a bit of a point-salad game, which usually annoy me, almost everything you do is going to give you points in some way, you just need to do it the most efficiently.  Usually these games can be tiresome, but there are some neat concepts in this one, including tech cards which can alter your strategy.  There's also a lot of rushing to grab limited bonuses and the occasional clever blocking of your friends.  You have to pay attention to everyone else, and I like that aspect.  

Lots of variability through the board setup, card layout, bonus changes, etc.  The decision tree will always be about the same though.  I think I prefer this game system to Istanbul with lots of expansions piled on, but there is still a beauty to the elegance 
 and speed of Istanbul.

Yokohama is one big surprise for me. At some places I have read about the comparison with Istanbul, reviewers 'shame on you'. Yokohama is a better game. The great style of planning your actions with the placement of the assistents is a simple mechanism but ver wel implented. The constant deliberation about the route you plan to travel is a good thing about the game. For now I'll give this game 8.5, but I smell a winner.

A medium-heavy game with many components while you have to take at least 30-45 mins for first time setup and teaching. Afterwards the flow is pretty straight forward where the master blocking and route building are some interesting elements that adds intensity and interaction in the game. This is a relatively soul-less point salad game but overall this is a very tight and intelligent designed game with abundant path to obtain victory points. However during our very first session, we found it seems that the game is a bit too long where we seem to push for the end. But don't get me wrong, this is still a VERY GREAT game and i would definitely looking forward to play it again and again.

It feels like a game on ice skates -always quickly moving forward!  Your opponent's turns allow for some quick planning time, and then revision-to-the-plan time, as other players make unexpected moves.  I don't feel like there are wasted moves or too much down time in this game.  Replayability is high, and tactics abound.  There are aspects of El Grande, LOW and Istanbul, all of which fit well together.  Great game!

The game feels a lot like a Feld design, with many different ways to earn points. It plays quite smoothly, and each individual turn is relatively simple, but there are a lot of interrelated parts and end game scoring bonuses that must be kept in mind. I think it's probably the designer's best game since Trains. I just wish it didn't take up so much table space, because that will limit its playability for me.

Economic and historical worker placement simulation of the transformation and modernization of a Japanese fishing village during the late 1800's emphasizing the influence and adoption of foreign technologies and opening of foreign trade. Modular setup of the city district hierarchy and action bonuses ensures wide variety of starting conditions.  Develop foreign relationships by advancing tech and collecting and filling contracts in copper, fish, tea, and silk.  Build shops and trade houses, import goods through customs, donate resources to the church.  Very interesting worker placement grouping system of assistants--Take more smaller actions or consolidate with your leader pawn for power moves.  Many viable victory paths is refreshing. I also like the race for many variable incentives and goals. I like that you can build a strategy and plan actions ahead. KS backed.

You may have heard of the 1945 Great Yokohama Air Raid, when B-29s firebombed the Japanese shoreline and in 69 minutes reduced half the city to rubble.

That is one fiddly setup. I'm interested to play again to see if its worth it for variety of game setup or if its just a bit too much work for my tastes.  The game itself is certainly interesting.  I like the spatial chaining to get your worker where the need to go and the balance between getting options by spreading out and more powerful moves by bunching up.  I did feel like between the export track, church track, and competition for goals and contracts that there might have been one or two more scoring areas than I would have liked, but Yokohama is still a very good middle weight Euro that I'd like to try again.

A lot of good planning, plotting, and scheming, and very satisfying to play. Unfortunately, this is an AP-prone game for some, which drags my enjoyment of it down a bit. When I play with confident players, it's very fun. When someone gets stuck in a loop of "I want to do X, Y, or Z, but I don't have a building to place to make it really worthwhile, so I should get buildings, but I don't have any money, so I should go to the bank, but then I can't place a building there to make it really worthwhile…" and can't see that money is the linchpin to escape the loop (or whatever other AP scenario), there is not a thing for the other players to do, other than try to convince that player to take the optimal sub-optimal play, and move on.

Most likely should be a 4 but I can see why people like blokus, its just that abstract tile laying games aren't my thing and I'd like to at least attempt to judge it on its goal.

RATING: 10
Short and very sweet. I catch myself playing it in my mind once in a while. One of my current favorites. It reminds me of Go but better (tongue-in-cheek, don't cry blasphemy, please), in that I don't feel that I'm playing blindly, it is more "graspable". It might satisfy those who are intrigued by Go, or have played it casually, but don't want to dedicate themselves to the study of the game. It's a quick fix :)

If you are trying to decide whether to buy it, you can try it on the web (blokus.com). 

Only, it's too bad they couldn't make the piece storage attach to, or be part of the board, so that it could travel without the box.

The same old Blokus, except for 2 players only. It's a shame that the game does not scale well to different player numbers. You need a separate game for 2, 3 and 4 players.

Own Travel Blokus. Very portable, and its biggest plus (compared to Blokus Duo) is  it can be "saved" for later...and it is cheaper too.

RATING: 6
If a filler is determined by length of playing time, this is a great filler.  You can play 2 or 3 games in one sitting.  Has a nice depth of decisions as well.  

However, my 9 year old daughter does not care for this game.  Even my 7 year old does not ask for it.

I found this 2 player version a clever improvement on the original blokus and because it doesnt rigidly require 4 players to work it gets played more

RATING: 6
A nice average puzzle style game.  Nice bits which "snap" into place on the game board which reduces the chances of a piece getting lost.

The game isn't going to win any awards, but if you are looking for something to pass the time while traveling, it will do...

Can't really understand why this is so popular (well it's big brother anyhow) it looks nice, and the corner thing is a nice twist on these sorts of games but it just seems like a passing the time sort of game.

Just played Blokus proper and really enjoyed it, so need to give this another chance.

After a few more tries, I concur it's a good game but Blokus is far more interesting. 
This is a knife fight to blokus's advancing armies.

RATING: 8
i think this is the best way to play blokus.  looks like there's a first player advantage.  a higher quality treatment would have been nice, but it's far from bad production.  quick play, simple rules, extremely replayable.  a superior 2p game.

RATING: 7
Blokus for two.  Murderously confrontational because the starting points are in the middle of the board (instead of the corners.)  If you stick the pieces onto the board too hard they're very difficult to remove.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice abstract that's fun and interesting to play. You can apply strategy without taking too long to plan your moves. Note that it's a great two player game, and should not be considered as a cheapened or dumbed-down variant of the 4-player game.

I prefer this version to the original.

RATING: 6
Rating is a seven for playing with kids.  After regular Blokus I was disappointed by this version.  My chief complaint is that the board is a little too tight.  However you can't always get 4 players and my niece enjoys it.  You're just left with a slightly frustrated feeling because you have so many pieces left over at the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.7
I don't usually love abstract games, but this is a pretty decent two-player game. It involves a lot of back and forth and trying to outmaneuver your opponent. There is definitely strategy involved in your placements. This was much better than I expected.

I'm giving Travel Blokus (or Blokus Duo) the same score as the full game because they are, in essence, the same game.  One could simply play this two-player variant (with its smaller variant board) on the full-size game.

It's worth noting, though, that this two-player version is far superior to what the rules of the main game suggest.  If you have both (or if you have neither) and want to play with only two, this is the one to get.  But if you ever want the option to play with four, you may as well get the full version rather than purchase both.

Ok game, but hard to get excited about it. I don't like the small, flat, clear plastic pieces.

You know those Tetris dreams you got when you played your Gameboy way too much? Prepare yourself for Blokus dreams. This game is more like anti-Tetris, since you are joining pieces by the corners. Every time I see a grid pattern now, I visualize spaces and shapes to fill them. Help me!

The other game that came to mind while playing this offering is Cathedral.  I think I like Cathedral better, but enjoy this abstract game as well.

Easy enough for my son (7 years old) to play with me, and if I'm not careful, he can beat me!  [Christmas gift]

I didn't think I needed this because I have regular Blokus. When we'd play 2 players, we'd play with the Travel Blokus rules on the big board (just used the extra pieces to designate the smaller boundaries). But it's nice having this version as well. Most of our games are 2 player and it's nice to be able to take this out and play a quick game when we have a few minutes free. Couldn't really do this with the big board.

Good travel edition - pieces really can't get lost.  However, the "wings" that pop off to that hold a player's pieces hold the pieces so close that it's hard to tell them apart.  To really see what you have to work with, you need to remove the pieces from these panels, which cuts down on the can't lose a piece factor.  Also, if you pop the pieces in really hard, they can be harder to remove at the end of the game.  -S

This version may revitalize this game for me, as this two player variant is far better than playing the original game with two. I still love the ease and depth of play, and this version becomes much faster than something like Ingenious.

Edit: Simply reducing this game to two sides adds an attacking element which gives me a bit of a "Go" fix, but in a tenth of the time. Great tension.

I took the tip of a BGG user and got two plastic hockey puck cases to keep in the Blokus Duo box and hold the bits--they're much nicer than plastic baggies, though if you really wanted to you could fit the game board and bits (in baggies) into a cheap iPad sleeve to make it more portable.

I prefer playing two colours on the four-player board to playing this.  I gave it to my mom when she expressed interest; won't miss it. Someone pointed out you can just square off a portion of the larger board and identify the starting locations to play this style using that one.

Excellent game to break out and play in small spaces and to teach people since the rules take literally 2 minutes. Also, the pieces look delicious. If you like orange and grape candy anyway.

Blokus always seemed like a 2-player game in 4-player clothing to me.  Playing it with 2 just seemed tedious having to play with 2 colors.  Now it is 2-player and plays better than Blokus ever did.

I give it two points less than its big brother. Blokus is much more dynamic and interesting with 4 (managing multiple threats - implicit collusion etc.), and having to buy 3 games to play with 2,3 or 4 players is a little annoying.

The only reason to buy this game and not the original Blokus is if you don't have much space (original Blokus comes in a rather large box) - in the original Blokus, you can just as easily play with 2 players if you just downsize the map to 14 x 14. Boom, there you go, now you have Travel Blokus... I don't really like that and I think this game has just been made to earn more money.

Not bad, but the two player game of standard Blokus is actually pretty good. What this offers is a simpler approach that does not require juggling two colors as one player. But I actually like that balancing act, and so I'd likely stick with Blokus for two.

(3/9/10)I haven't played the four player version enough to be able to compare, but on its own merit, this one can be quite a workout. Still seems to have a lot of the interesting look-ahead of the original (he has that piece and that piece, but not that one, so I don't need to protect here yet...etc.), but perhaps without the interesting feints available in the four-sided version.

Thanks, Pete!

Found this to be a great fun 2-player time killer. You can work your own strategy, screw over your opponent, or just make pretty patterns. As deep as you want it to be and has that one-more-go factor. putting the pieces away is like an extra little puzzle in itself. A well though out design makes it neat and portable, although it can be a pain to remove pieces if you have short nails

RATING: 2
Components: flimsy and each piece snaps into the board differently - some loosely, some tightly.

EDIT: After 1 year of ownership and mostly-shelfed-life, some pieces have begun snapping and becoming weak. Unforgivable. Components are a stark shortcoming. Brought from 6.5 to 2, not at all recommendable.

Original review:

It's still a fun game where most of the fun is in the end-game, when you're both down on pieces and trying to stay afloat. But that situation is up to the players to create, and that's where the game falls apart. It's a game that welcomes infinite amounts of AP, because your choices are so numerous for the whole game. You basically feel like you're better off placing your pieces without TOO much thought, or else the game will take much too long.

You basically never feel like you or your opponent is playing optimally in this game. Which is fine. :) This is a small abstract game after all - most of them work like this. I'm sure abstract strategy fans will enjoy this.

- Gameplay and replayability: 3/3. This is fun to play, somewhat chesslike but lighter. Because of this, players tend to play enjoyably fast.

- Luck factor: 3/3. Appart from the selection of the start player it is luck free.

- Player range: 1/3. This can only be played with 2.

- Duration: 3/3. Blokus plays very quickly, say 15 minutes a game.

- Learning curve: 3/3. The rules can be explained in less than a minute.

- Theme and looks: 1/3. This is an abstract game, but I do like the looks of the blocks.

- Set up/clean up time: 3/3. Both take less than a minute.

- Documentation: 3/3. The rules are so easy they don't need much documentation.

- Durability: 1/3. The components look robust enough, but I can imagine the plastic board to break, especially when it is taken on a journey. Also, one of our blocks show a little crack already, probably because of low quality plastic being used.  

- Portability: 3/3. This is a real travel game, which can easily be played on a train. Regrettably the box doesn't close tightly, so you will have to find a way to tighten the lid yourself, for example using an elastic band. 

- Summary: Blokus To Go is quick, easy and fun to play, so it is the perfect filler game. And as the icing on the cake, it is small and compact so it can be easily carried around and played just about everywhere.

Blokus To Go with the snap-in blue and orange pieces. I was dismayed that the fold-in sides have faint outlines you have to follow to put away the pieces. And then when they're put away, you can't distinguish one shape from another! Disappointed.

Everyone likes the 4 player version of Blokus, but of course kingmaking and psychology play a big role. The two player variant, on the smaller board, is a tactical game full of trickery and nous. A pie rule should probably be used for fairness, but first player will probably always have some advantage.

Compact, 2 player edition of Blokus, played on a smaller board.  Everything that applies to the four player edition also applies here.  Players attempt to place as many of their 21 pieces onto the board as possible. Pieces may only touch like-coloured pieces at diagonal corners. Theoretically there is room for every piece, with some change, however it never works out that way. Very addictive game.

RATING: 6
One of the better mass-market abstracts. I much prefer this to the original, which didn't balance multiplayer incentives with spatial concerns as well.

Here, those multiplayer concerns are removed; it's purely a competition between you and your opponent to get the most pieces down. This produces the expected attempts to barricade off board edges and deprive your opponent of the small tricky pieces and the long easy-reachable ones. The endgame can become a space-packing problem, which might be a positive or negative for you (I don't enjoy it so much). The game has a fair amount of variability, and there's a good mix of strategic and tactical considerations.

Unfortunately, the game has a significant first-player advantage. This is easily fixable with the pie rule, but I don't like adding aftermarket kludges to games so much.

Blokus Duo is a cute little quick playing abstract tile placement spatial puzzle game for 2. It is super easy to learn and play, with only one rule. Place your pieces on the board to control as much area as you can with the caveat being that your own pieces may only touch each other by their corners.

The board is sturdy and the glass-like pieces are lovely. My gaming partner loves orange and I love purple so this set is just perfect for us. Gameplay is snappy and exciting with an almost duelling feel as you frantically place pieces back and forth in a bit of a frenzy. At least, that’s the way [i]we[/i] play it! :) Once most of the board is filled, gameplay becomes more deliberate as you’re looking to optimise your placements as much as possible. Almost scratches the same itch as Ingenious so I would recommend this if you’re a fan of that.

A fun little game that ticks a lot of boxes. Great 2 player game. Great filler. Great abstract game. Great area control game. Great tile placement game. Great 'small box' game. Now if only it made waffles...

Good version of Blokus for 2 players.

RATING: 8
This inferior knockoff edition: [gameid=124323]

Blokus Duo is a better game than the two player variant on the classic 20x20 board.  Playable on a standard Blokus board by marking off a 14x14 play-area, and both players using starting squares 5x5 from opposite corners.  See my explanation with pictures here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/338040

I prefer Blokus Duo to the original Blokus; it's more sharply tactical, quicker (you also use less pieces, so you are forced to choose more, and can't use everything).  Terrific two-player game.

This game is a bit redundant since I already own Blokus, and I don't like the official rules of playing two colors each in a two-player game. I usually use the larger game and block off a smaller grid on the bigger board with two of the colors and play with the other two. This version is more convenient if you always play with two players.

Excellent little travel game for when my wife and I need to kill some time.  Not surprisingly, Blokus feels like it has less dimensions when compared to something like Rumis, because, well, it literally has less dimensions ;)  I enjoy the greater tension in Rumis between scoring and positioning.  Blokus is all built into one which is less satisfying.

Fun, but I prefer regular Blokus more, but can't beat Travel Blokus for being conveniently sized for a table at a restaurant or anywhere else where there's a minimum of surface space to play a game on.

Blokus Duo is the only way to fly regarding the various Blokus (Blokii?) 2p options. Every other option plays better with 3-4p. Our matches are very "night-fight in a phone-booth" if you catch my drift.

Nice, light, strategic little filler.  Play is very aggressive just due to the smaller gameboard and having only one opponent.  It's certainly enjoyable enough.UPDATE:  This is holding up much better than I thought it would.  We've had multiple plays and it's yet to feel "old", which was my fear on such a small board.  Bumped from 6.5 to 8 rating.

Jeg kan bedre lidt Travel Blokus end det oprindelige Blokus. Det skyldes nok at det som et 100% abstrakt spil for mit vedkommende passer sig fint for spillet, at man ikke tilføjer en tredje- og fjerdemand med det kaos der følger dermed. Endvidere er spillepladsen meget trang i Travel Blokus og det gør at man fra første brik placeres føler hvor aggressivt spillet er.

Great 2-player version of Blokus that turns vicious much more quickly than the standard version. I think I prefer the full version, as it allows you to take your time and be more subtle. This one is aggressive from the start. As someone else commented, though, it is really not a *travel* version. It is only its smaller size that makes it portable; it is not magnetic or anything.

There is noticeable first player advantage, so playing many times and switching starting player is recommended. Or using Go-like komi (point compensation) for player going second. Around 4 points is probably ok for komi (3.5 or 4.5 if you want to avoid ties).

I'm rating this edition of Blokus low as a TRAVEL game.  As 2-player Blokus, it's great, and we played it in various different places like airport waiting areas, hotel rooms, etc. during a recent trip.  But it's a PORTABLE version, not a TRAVEL game as named and advertised.  The pieces don't fit inside anything or even come with a ziplock bag; there's no cover to keep a game in progress (like, start playing in the airport, close it up and open it on the tray table...); the cardboard box falls open and lets pieces fall out.  Even the crappiest MB and Hasbro travel games are designed with an eye towards actually *traveling*.

I'd rather see a cheaper, lighter set with Colorforms- or Uniset-style pieces on a folder with the same size board on one side and storage surface on the other, that closes with wax paper or something in the middle so you can keep a game in progress.

[Initial Impression: 6]
A much more competitive and cut-throat game than the larger version, as players are colliding after the second move.  Extremely appealing colors - especially the purple!  In my experience, there seems to be a severe first-mover advantage - the only games we've played in which the first player did not win was one in which a piece had gone missing (since recovered) and another against someone who'd never played before.  I need more plays to see whether this advantage holds up over time - if the first-mover problem can be overcome, my rating would rise.

This is a 2-player version of Blokus.  This game really favors the person with the most Blokus experience so I dropped my rating from 7 to 6 for now.  I enjoy it but need to play with a more experienced, cutthroat player like myself.

I must admit I was dubious when I saw this on store shelves, but a 2 player, zero sum game may be the best way of all to play Blokus, there's none of the "You're all picking on me!" effect that is possible in the 4 player game. Only problem for me, is that I rarely play 2 player abstracts, so it wouldn't see much table time if I had it in my collection.

Blokus, but for two. The ideal game to give players when they have to wait for others to finish a different game. You can explain the rules in under a minute and have the two guys enjoy the game for quite a while.

Blokus Duo is a fantastic game for just two players. I lump it into a similar category with Chess, Connect 4 and Othello. Pattern recognition and long-term planning is a must. If you enjoy games like the ones I mentioned, then you'll have loads of fun with Blokus Duo.

If you good in math you probably good at blokus :)

*This* is a knife fight in a phone booth.  The first night my wife dropped the f-bomb on me but kept asking for more.  I really like the small space requirements and quick play time.  And yet the board is just large enough to let each game play out differently.

Very, very good game. I bought it for my latest trip to Nauvoo and to play with my friend Heather. I thought she'd enjoy it knowing the other games we've played together. She has a good mind for these type of games. And, of course, I love Blokus as well. I'm usually playing two-player games so this was a great buy for me as it plays much better than two-player than normal Blokus.

I will usually give this as a gift to my friends that get married. Excellent game for couples.

Blokus for two.

It doesn't make any sense to own this game.  It's much better to buy just Blokus and if you want to play 2-player game - narrow down the playing area on standard Blokus board (e.g. with unused pieces of other players - that works great).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice little light abstract game for just 2 players that reminds me of tetris and feels very puzzle like. Scores some points for playing fast, some screw you, a little strategy and just enough tactics to keep you interested. I prefer this over regular Blokus as with 4 players there are so many good games, for 2 players this is a great little head to head duel.

Update: I am really starting to think this is the perfect weeknight "couple" filler game, a little strategy, great tactics, good replayability, slightly addictive and fun, plus its portable!

I generally don't like abstracts games but Travel Blokus is growing on me. I like it way more than regular Blokus because it´s 1on1 and a true battle of skill (regular Blokus you can get screwed if 2 or more players "attack" you and you don´t stand a chance), also with its smaller board, it is a lot more confrontational and has a feel of "take that" that I really dig. You have much more control over your game than regular Blokus

It´s playtime is around the 20 minute mark and the rules are really simple (you can explain it under a minute). 

One of my favorite 2 player abstracts, love to play it with my GF. The rating just went up :D

After more plays, I’m downgrading Blokus Duo (as it is known today) to a rating that matched my feelings toward the game. I still like it and it still have a place in my collection, but now I have other abstracts I enjoy too. Now I’m a lot more harsher with my ratings.

2016-02-01

Initial Rating: 3.0 (April 2011)

To read my comments about the game, please see the comment in the other entry. Here I will only talk about the component´s quality of the Mattel edition.

In one word, the Mattel edition is crap. The game components are very low quality. In our game, 3 pieces were broken and we were having a lot of care handling them. At first blush, it seems they are very good quality, but the fact that Mattel made holes in them, affected the pieces structurally. Now they are very brittle. Also, playing this edition takes longer because setup and packaging the game after a play now takes a lot more time than with the previous edition of the game.

If you are looking to buy this game, make sure you get the Educational Insights Edition, it has a lot better components. My low rating reflects how displeased I am with this edition of the game, but Travel Blokus is an ok game for me.

I have a lot of love for this game and its multiplayer sibling. It's part puzzle solving, part spacial logic, part strategy. The pieces are essentially Tetris pieces but instead of trying to densely fill the board your goal is to build snaking walls that hem your opponent in. Young players seem to grok the game pretty fast too, and I was able to have reasonably competitive agems against my son by the time he was 5.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After a couple of plays I'd have to say this isn't nearly as good as the original Blokus. There doesn't seem to be enough space to get in to each other's territory so we block each other off and then go about filling in our half of the board. Not very challenging or interesting.

Effectively a subset of the original Blokus (even if it's not officially part of those rules), Blokus Duo drops the strategic dimension for an intensely tactical composition where one mistake is likely to be fatal, i.e. the "knife fight in a phone booth" metaphor is apt. This kind of brain burning is not what usually draws me to games, however, so I rate it one point lower.

One of my favorite things about this game is that, as the game progresses, the board looks more and more like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

I don't understand people who insist on creamy peanut butter.  Super-extra-crunchy is clearly and obviously the only best possible option.

Also -- Nutella?  I just read that, worldwide, Nutella actually OUTSELLS peanut butter!  Why, that's UNAMERICAN.  Yes, well, I know, by definition.  But STILL.

I wouldn't recommend spending money on this - unless you actually want to play Blokus while travelling and space is _that_ much of a premium for you. If you want to play 2-player Blokus with only 2 colors it's easy enough to change the board to a Travel Blokus style: Travel Blokus gives you no additional pieces beyond what Blokus does - the only real differences are starting locations (NOT in the corners) and board size (a little smaller as far as  square by square area). The game itself is solid but, unless what you've read above sells the game already, just stick with Blokus.

With no travel case and all of the little pieces, this game doesn’t really seem that suited for travel despite having the word in its name.  

It’s got the same rules and shapes as Blokus but for two players only. It’s a fine game, though it might be less appealing to some being 2 players only because I think two player Blokus can be a bit cutthroat. 

It’s also worth noting that you could play this 2 player version with a normal Blokus set by restricting yourself to the center of the board (though in that case, unless you mark the playing area, it is easy to forget where is out of bounds).

RATING: 9
Not much to tell really, the game plays quick in about 20 minutes, the pieces look very shiny and beautiful, the gameplay is every time you start different and fresh. By construction the game is versus your opponent, but at the same time it is quite puzzly and also not so much take that in your face. Well suited for playing with your SO. 
Pricing is attractive around 15 euro, and the quality of the box and components make it well suited for travel abroad. Imagine a sunset with sangria and blokus on the table in front of you.

playing board has little grids to guide the pieces so, even if you have very fat sausage like fingers, you can place the pieces without much problem.

In the long run it could help you in developing spatial awareness and eye-hand coordination, but that's just me wishing.

If you like catan the 2-p variant, or duel, then you cannot go wrong with blokus DUO.

I gave this a 9 because the game is not played that often any more, around once a year now.

This is 2-player version of Blokus.  It's a smaller grid b/c there are only two sets of player pieces.  Both must begin the game on the start spaces close to the center of the board.  Great thing is that it has both orange and purple colors!  Cool...

Superb little two-player abstract.  Ordinary Blokus didn't interest me because when I've got 4 players at a table I don't like to play games where you sit and stare at the board and let your brains burn.  I do like that in a two-player game, though.

Travel Blokus doesn't play quite like any other abstract I have.  At first it seems it'd be cold and logical, but because you're using 21 unique pieces I feel it's a bit creative, too.  This is one I'll want to keep playing, figuring out strategies as I go along.

UPDATE:  8 ---> 7.  Surpassed by Rumis, a game that scratches the same itch so much more satisfyingly for being three-dimensional and more variable.  I still see a reason to own this, being as its so compact and a game you could more easily play at a small coffee shop table than you could Rumis.

Although Blokus is a clever design, I am not a fan. I blame my younger days of playing Gameboy Tetris for this conundrum. I want to fill up the board Tetris-style instead of fitting corners together as the game dictates, . Unfortunately this strategy does not work very well.

For a similar feel, Cathedral is better.

I got this game since I thought it would make for a nice, portable two player game.  However, it wasn't nearly as portable as I thought it would be---there's no compartment to hold all of the pieces, and you have to spread all of your pieces out when playing to see what you have.  Still, it's a nice looking game and I enjoyed playing the [url=http://www.blokus.com/online-game/]online computer version[/url] to get a feel for the gameplay.

However, the game was a total flop with her.  She found it boring---she's much more interested in games where the pieces can do different things.  I think that she tends to prefer games with a wider branching tree rather than necessarily a deep one.  That is, she likes games that offer lots of different decisions, rather than just a few, more brain burning decisions.  She also doesn't like more abstract games---that little bit of theme can help a lot.  As a result, games like [GAMEID=21763], and [GAMEID=2453] aren't really cut out for us, as we just can't give them the amount of effort that they deserve.  ([GAMEID=171] may be an exception, since the pieces can do different things, so it's more interesting).  This is another game where we had very different responses.

Orange and purple are the new black for 2006.  Taking on board the weaknesses from the 4-player version the publishers have developed a game which provides a more intense and involved game.  Right from the start your choices are critical and the true attacking and defensive value of the individual pieces become clear.  Blokus is becoming one of the best abstract series around and I cant wait for the next version.

I expected this to be more fun but when I played ti with my wife we found it was not as much fun as we expected. We tried to put as many pieces on the board as we could & each time we were annoyed by having too many pieces left over. It seemed like if you were good as spacial relations you would enjoy this, but we didn't have fun. After trying it a couple times I even tried to put together the perfect Blokus Duo board & used almost all the pieces, but still there were ones left over. The winner was simple the person who had made sure the largest pieces were put doen first. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
If you’ve played the original Blokus, you probably have a good idea whether you should buy Blokus Duo. If you enjoy Blokus a lot, and play any amount with two, Blokus Duo is a no-brainer. If Blokus bugs you, you’re unlikely to enjoy this variant.

That’s because Travel Blokus is virtually identical to Blokus. The differences amount to a smaller board, each side playing one colour (rather than two in 2p Blokus) and the start points located about halfway between the corner and the centre.

That said, the feel is marginally different in Travel Blokus. It largely cuts out the maneuvring stage that occurs at the beginning of original Blokus and the players are engaged in a knife fight almost from the first move. The effect is reminiscent of the difference between 9×9 Go and 13×13.

If you haven’t played Blokus, by the way, you really should (or this if you mostly play games with 2). It's such a pure design that it seems like it should be hundreds of years old, not a little over a decade.

Not really a travel version.  I would have preferred the pieces to be the same size as the original, so they could be played in a 4 player game.  Or if it was really meant to be a travel version, then they should 'lock' into the board to prevent spilling and jarring of the board.  Otherwise, you can really play this on the regular board with the original set without the need for this game.  In any event, I much prefer Blokus with 4.

What a good game. It reminds me of Hive: minimal rules, symmetrical forces, simple to play but packed with depth. I love games like this, where a small package provides a lot of entertainment, and Blokus is short, thinky, and dirty -- it delivers.

True to its name, blocking matters a great deal. You can box your opponent -- and yourself -- out of using some pieces fairly easily if you're not careful.

Even after just a few games I can see that early moves matter, your opponent's stash of pieces matters, piece placement order matters, blocking vs. taking a wide-open area matters -- so many things matter, and yet it takes just a few minutes to play!

(I have Travel Blokus, which comes with interlocking piece trays -- which make it hard to see what you have left, but would be nice, say, on a train -- and a grooved board that keeps pieces in place, lightly.)

A very elegant ratio of rules to depth of play. Has many of the concepts from Go (territories, sente, etc) while being much simpler to learn and quicker to play.

Since first player has a definite advantage, I think they should have introduced a handicap for second player. Personally I find 4 or 5 blocks to be about right (i.e. first player must win by 5+ blocks to win, otherwise second player wins).

Game in a Nutshell: A two player abstract of piecing in as many of your own pieces as you can while restricting your opponent from doing the same.

Played as: Two-player only

Pros: Small size, excellent two-player variation from the Blokus mold. Simple rule set makes it approachable to teach and play. Plays quite differently from a four player game and presents a whole new challenge and approach to a match. A great example of how simple design can often be the most brilliant.

Cons: If you already own the regular Blokus, you can duplicate everything this game offers (by boxing in the board to make a smaller playing area) other then the smaller form factor. The game itself can be vicious and is best suited for players with an equal feel for the game. 

Other: I would have never gone out and purchased this having owned the regular Blokus first. And that's despite the fact that I pretty much played it two-player almost exclusively of late. In short I'm glad to have the 'real thing' to bring out for two-player Blokus sessions, but wouldn't recommend buying both.

Best Use: Purchase only if you'll likely only play Blokus two-player.

Like this more than I wanted to, and it's better as a two-player game. This rating could go up. I really like how the board splits up and the game forces you to choose the hottest area to play in. Similar to [gameid=188] in that at the beginning of the game, these regions haven't become well-defined yet. But, it's not only a matter of temperature - the long-term strategy lies in the deployment of the different pieces.

Almost as fun as the regular game of Blokus and is definitely good for travel. However, I feel that a 2 player game isn't as exciting or tight as the 4-player version. Still good though, especially if you're short on players.

Blokus Duo, a Christmas gift from Amanda. This is exactly the same as the 2-player variant we play with the original Blokus where we zone off a portion of the board. It's a nice compact edition of the game and, while I prefer the 4-player game, it's fun with 2 as well.

My 1000th play logged on BGG was Blokus Duo.

RATING: 6
Picked up in mathtrade, thinking it was a perfect game to play with my wife. Unfortunately, she hates it.

I myself do enjoy it. It's still a bit dry and abstract, but I feel like there are plenty of opportunities to discover the game deeply as I continue to play.

Took it to school as a lunchtime game to share with kids where it is *HIGHLY* popular - second only to Hive in terms of demand.

NUMEROUS unlogged plays of this. It comes out a lot at lunch and I will usually do a pick-up game with one of the kiddos before I turn them loose on it.

Blokus is a fine abstract game.  It's accessible to gamers and non-gamers of nearly all ages.

I'm not a huge fan of abstracts.  Furthermore, my brain does not think spatially very effectively.  Getting crushed in this game repeatedly is not particularly enjoyable.

Attacking. Defending. Speed. Tempers flare. Drop in pieces with lots of corners, blocking off certain portions of the board while simultaneously giving yourself outlets to continue expanding. Work from your corner to your opponent's corner, eating away at his real estate like a cancer. Stop the action to go take a dump, thinking about your final moves.

Duo is a tight, 2-player version of Blokus with the exact same gameplay as the regular, full length-sized version, just with uglier colors.

A neat encapsulation of its bigger brothers in tasty pocket-sized (at least if you've big pockets) form. The piece variety is a little disappointing, and the whole thing can tend to stalemate, but it's no less a game for those reasons.

I've never played the original Blokus prior to purchasing this game but had always heard positive comments about it.  When I saw the 2-player version at half the price of the 4-player game I just had to buy it.  It appears the 2-player version sold in Australia has been renamed Blokus Duo.  This is one fun little game!  The action commences pretty much straight away as you attempt to cut-off the other player from space to move.  An instant hit with my wife and games only take around 10 minutes.

[b]Blokus Duo[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]In the last six months my view on abstracts has changed since I've found quite a few that I like [i](Glux, LYNGK, Kerala, Tatsu and YINSH)[/i] and Blokus Duo will now join that list. Blokus is a spacial puzzle somewhat similar to Patchwork except both players use the same board and you have access to all your pieces from the beginning. Your goal is to get all your Tetris shapes played or get more down than your opponent. 

I am a huge fan of spacial puzzles and Blokus Duo plays quite fast [i](> 15 minutes)[/i] which makes it a game I'd definitely enjoy playing more. Also the footprint of the game is small which would make this a great care/pub game. The rules take less than a minute to explain and are extremely simple making this a great game to play with kids. I'm sure a lot of folks have already played Blokus, but if not I'd recommend checking it out especially if you're looking for a great travel game.[/i]

Liked this a lot more than I thought I would.

I ran out of moves and watched my opponent keep building her lead.

Found at Unique Thrift on 10/31/2007 for $1.98. Missing one purple tile. I actually find this to be better than the original Blokus. This is probably because it is easier to get two players together rather than 4. The original scales to two, but it take extra effort. The travel board is really nice, because it fills up very quickly and makes for a nice tight game. Not really a fan of abstracts, but this one is near the top of the heap.

By necessity this game is a lot more directly confrontational than the 4-player version need be.  I really can't decide if I like that or I don't.  It ends of taking on characteristics of area control games like Go, which I don't think really benefit the game.

I'm just not a fan of abstract games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I like abstracts for a variety of reasons: they usually are easy to teach, I can go a long time without playing them and remember how to play, they are visually very clean & relaxing, the decision tree expands and contracts because of your own ability (or lack thereof), and they have no risky themes to put off hesitant Muggles who want to avoid Dragons and Spaceships and any other Geekish nouns. 

While I was never a big video gamer, I was definitely a Tetris Kid, and so I'm sympathetic to polyominoes. I also tend to enjoy spatial games and spatial reasoning. This 2p Blokus version hits a lot of what I like about abstracts.

Very interesting differences between Travel Blokus (14x14) and classic Blokus (20x20).
I've marked my Blokus board for use with this Travel Blokus ruleset, and like how quick the conflict comes. Further plays would determine which ruleset I like better.
I'm pretty sure this would be my preferred 2-player set-up, though.

This is definitely more fun than playing 2 colors each on the regular 4-player game.

But a full game with 4 players is still a better gaming experience.

Also, in regular Blokus you tend to rush to the center to claim some space, but in Blokus Duo, you start so close together that if you rush to the center you will get capped.

Travel Blokus is the smaller 2-player verson of [gameid=2453]. It is an abstract strategy game with transparent, tetris-shaped, colored pieces that players are trying to play onto the board.   This copy is a generic version with a different title but it is still the same game.

In all regards - better than Blokus - smaller board makes the game more competitive.  Smaller box makes the game easier to carry around.  I find that I can get a 2P game started much more readily than a 4P game - so if I needed have only 1 Blokus variant - this would the be one.

Don't know why this one is called travel blokus, or why it's out of print, that all seems weird to me. Blokus is a great game, why force people to play on a 4p board with awkward double-colour rules? I'm not even gonna contemplate playing this with 3/4 players--I'm trying to talk about abstracts here, people! (you know, 2p no hidden information, no random elements...)

used to love playing with my wife before I accidentally got really good at it, which canned that opportunity. Too bad. Played online for a bit, but somehow I want to play this one in person...I'm currently looking for opponents...

gotta use the side switching rule common for many abstracts here--after the first player plays, the second may switch colours/sides instead of playing, and then the player who played first plays second, as the other colour.

Hey, this is pretty cool. The components are shoddy, but the gameplay is up to Gipf standards, I reckon. I find that a lot of ideas from Go translate well to Blokus, e.g. defending cutting points, urgent moves before big moves, etc. Gets a bonus point for the girlfriend liking it.

Abstracts should be two player only, ne?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Enjoyable and fast as a 2 player abstract. Games are 'played out' much quicker than the full game, but speed of play is one of the attractions. If you want a meatier game, go for one of the big brothers with 2 colours apiece. Would prefer an edition with a built-in, plastic carrying case.

RATING: 8
Blokus for two! I guess it plays better than the original Blokus when you're playing with just two players (of course, it's been streamlined for this very purpose so it should naturally play better with two), but otherwise it's the exact same game as the original - only that it can't accommodate more than two. Recommended if you more often than not play only two player games, otherwise the original Blokus may be a preferred choice as it handles up to four players.

The two player version of Blokus.  Nice, compact, fast and fun.  Rules explanation takes about a minute and you're ready to go:  Place your color piece on the board.  It can't be adjacent to any of your other pieces, but must touch at least one corner.  And, you're pretty much ready to go. 

 The game itself only takes about 10-15 minutes to play.

The small packaging on this one is quite nice, and I've found it's a great game to take on trips, etc.  Gameplaywise, I actually much prefer doing 2 player games on the full-size Blokus (using two colors per player), rather than just the single color here.  It's a bit more fun to be able to get your pieces to interact a bit more interestingly, on the full version.

Still, it's a very nice game, and I'm glad that I've got it.

Seems superior to the original version, and has some nice spatial considerations with the area enclosure. I'm just not a fan of pick-one-from-your-pieces-to-place and abstract strategy games where the decision space starts out overwhelming then narrows down into forced moves are weird for me.

RATING: 6
Much better than Blokus for me. Rumis still gets the "spatial abstract" nod, simply because it scales so well, plays fast, is interesting, and because you get to build 3-dimensional structures. But Travel Blokus is also fast and fun. Here, we say goodbye to the 2 and 3 player fiddliness of the regular edition, and the Travel Blokus package is excellent. It really *is* designed to take on trips, with little tray for the bits. The play is essentially the same as Blokus, save for the fact that you begin by placing a piece of your choice on a starting square which is offset from the center of the board (as opposed to beginning in the corner). This works very well, kicking off the conflict for territory right away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
An interesting variant of the normal Blokus game.  There are almost exactly half the number of squares (just a handful different), but the game feels a lot more compact, and thus sometimes a lot more cutthroat.  Works as a great 2-player variant of Blokus, whether on the road or not!

RATING: 9
I loved the original Blokus and I was pleasantly surprised by the different dynamics of a smaller board and less colors. Travel Blokus is much more confrontational. I always found that the key to the original Blokus was to keep as many paths open as possible. In Travel Blokus, blocking is much more vicious and players can cut off entire areas of the board. For 2 players, the original Blokus was always a little confusing because players have to alternate turns between colors. The new Travel Blokus is perfect for 2. It is a great addition even if you already enjoy the original Blokus.

This is a solid little abstract filler.  I'm not sure why you would get this over regular Blokus, but perhaps people just want to save on shelf space...or just can't go anywhere without having the opportunity to play.

RATING: 5
It seems to play slightly mechanically and though it has some interesting options (mostly at the start) it quickly descends into mild tedium.

Also, though I understand that the box is designed for travel, it is woefully unfit for purpose. It's all but impossible to remove the playing pieces from the storage area and then almost entirely impossible to remove them from the play area. We resorted to smashing the board upside down on the table... Not how I usually want to treat my games, but somehow fitting in this instance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As a game, it's just as good as Blokus (and obviously better for two), but the little pegs that hold the pieces in are kind of irritating. Also, the doors, where the pieces are stored, don't give you a good idea of what shapes remain to be played (especially if you're unfamiliar with the game). Disappointing.

Blokus Duo is a wonderfully tight little game.  Takes very little time to play, and yet every piece is an agonizing (but fairly rapid) decision as the (very limited) board space available quickly dwindles into nothingness and you wonder "How the hell am I going to place this plus sign?"  I rate it above Blokus.

Update - I miss Blokus Duo.  I can't find my copy.  Where, oh where, did my Blokus Duo go?  Oh  where, or where could it be?

Revised July 2012 from 7 to 7.5.  Minor upgrade, but played it a few times recently waiting for game nights to start and it's fun.

This one is nothing more than a smaller board and two sets of pieces from the full game. In fact, you can play the same game with the full set, so there is no real reason to get this. Despite its name, its not a travel game - the pieces lock down in no way shape or form anymore than the original did. That being said, I love two player Blokus - its mean and nasty and usually pretty fast.

Compelling abstract game, a variant of the popular Blokus, but for two players only. The smaller board provides an intense battlefield and the quick playing time and portability allow for many plays. Visually-oriented players (like my engineer husband) seem to have an initial advantage, but I've enjoyed quite a few victories recently. I think that the competition tends to even out as you study and analyze your opponent's moves, so it definitely rewards rematches. Also great for non-gamers--you can explain the rules in less than a minute. Even better, it's cheap and since I can see this being played frequently for a long time, it's a great investment.

It's a neat little 2-player game, but it seems so inconsequential on my shelf next to bigger, meatier options.  My girlfriend appreciates the convenience of it so I play it more often than other games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I admire this game for the purity of its design. The Blokus system stripped down to the bone. The essence of tactical gameplay. Unforgiving, raw, brutal and yet so rewarding. A no holds barred, bare-knuckle street fight with no witness.

It is a much more tense affair than the 4-player version. Because it is 2-player only, I find it easier to find someone to play with, and it's portable.

While the storage solution for the pieces seems clever at first, it turns out it takes more time than it should to slot them in and out of the compartments. I store them separately in ziploc bags instead.

Highest score: -5

Culled - First wave; Yard sale

Why we culled it: Blokus remains a great abstract game, and one of the better offerings in the mainstream. That said, we rarely played it on our own and know many friends who own copies which we can visit. Passing this along to a better home made good sense.

I don't like Blokus and I don't really know why. I am not very good at it, that could be part of the reason.  Mostly I think it makes me feel uptight.

My five rating is not because it is slightly boring, but because it is not enough fun, if that makes sense.

I like this game but can't ever get my husband to play it.  I'm such a geek that I find it fun to play solo and try to fit all the pieces on the board, by following the rules, without any leftover.  That's honestly what sold it for me at the game demo.  GEEK!

RATING: 7
A mini-version of Blokus designed for travel and which plays only 2 players. Same rules and pieces (but in only two colours) as the original game, and it's exactly the same basic area control game.

One unfortunate thing about the smaller board is that there's a much denser set of possible plays so it can start to become a little sameish once both players start to play aggressively. There's not even the option to work together with two colours that the larger game has.

A good lightweight travel game, but not as good as the full Blokus.

Don't think of this as a "Travel" version of Blokus, but rather as a significantly improved version for when you're only playing with 2 players.  The smaller grid, use of only two colors, and closer starting positions all make this version much better than the original when playing with 2 players.

I like the small board for a nice tight competition. This, I think, gets to the essence of Blokus: the tension between attacking and defending, fighting battles on multiple fronts, finding the balance between growing your opportunity space while shrinking your opponent's. Plenty to think about each turn.

2 player; Blokus Travel is the smaller 2-player verson of Blokus. It is an abstract strategy game with transparent, tetris-shaped, colored pieces that players are trying to play onto the board. The only caveat to placing a piece is that it may not lie adjacent to your other pieces, but instead must be placed touching at least one corner of your pieces already on the board.

In my opinion, Blokus is at its best as a two-player game. This board is smaller than the original board (only 14x14 squares) and players start in the middle rather than in the corners. This means you run into each other as soon as someone puts down their second block. Blokus Duo is surprisingly strategic but it's more fun if you play against someone with the same experience level.

Played once. As I suspected before playing, it works about as well as Blokus. The starting points are closer to the center, which makes the blocking start even earlier - probably a good thing.

Surprisingly fun abstract game. You can not plan too much ahead which makes it more easy fun.

What a great little game.  I have to give this a 10 based on the criteria..I would never turn this game down.  It's so quick and yet so strategic.  ....and so devious!  

Updated:  It appears as though I've turned this game down a few times...knocking it down to a 9.

Bought this version to start playing it with my son. It's easier to take on vacation. Usually I don't like abstract games, but this one is ok.

Well, it's Blokus.  The board is smaller and more contentious.  That is good or bad depending on your preference.  I think it is a worthy variant.  It plays quickly as well.

Regular Blokus can be set up with the same configuration as Blokus Duo by using a portion of the board and the game play is the same. So why do I own both? It is easy to bring Blokus Duo to gaming events. As regular Blokus only effectively works with 2 or 4 players it is not a very flexible option for the space it requires.

Simple, elegant abstract game where players try to fill board completely with their own pieces of different geometric shapes. Great filler.

Great abstract game.  Picked up the travel edition because it is smaller, tighter and best suited for two.

I have more plays than listed under my belt.  My wife and I used to play two or three games every night.

As with the original Blokus, this is an abstract game that is easy to learn and provides sufficient depth for replayability. Although part of the Blokus family with almost totally identical rules, its feel and the strategies involved are quite different. Active blocking becomes the key to winning in Blokus Duo, whilst finding opportunities and exploiting them is more important in the original Blokus.

As this is a two player game, players can now react immediately to each other's move. This is a big plus over Blokus for me, since my Significant Other is my only board game partner for most of the time.

Another positive is its portability. It is much smaller and lighter, and can therefore be quite easily carried around.

An almost perfect adaptation of Blokus for 2... Small, portable, but I wish the grooves were deeper or the pieces magnetic so they weren't so easy to jostle -- the board gets displaced much more than the larger 4 player format.

I play Blokus Duo on my big Blokus board, but with the smaller duo board marked off in permanent marker in the middle of the larger board. It works perfectly and that's good as Blokus Duo is a darn good game.

Ah, Blokus.

This belongs to an abstract subset I'm not too fond of - though certainly strategic in nature, geometric shape-placement games have never appealed to me that much... hell, I don't even like Tetris!

Nevertheless, Travel Blokus wins me over through sheer quality of play - it's a solid two-player game, with some very attractive pieces, and even despite my dislike for the style I find myself engaged whenever I play it.

Oh, and it's extremely quick.

A 6, going on 7.

After one play, I think I liked the full version better.  But this is probably a better option if there's only 2 players.

Simple, quick and scratches that abstract itch when you have only one other person to play with.  I imagine the gameplay will become mechanical after a while (which is probably the pitfall of all other similar titles in the same genre).  Even so, it is something I don't mind getting out once in a while, although I'd probably prefer the version that accommodates more people.

I dig abstracts and this 2-player implementation of blokus gets a lot of play. It takes 1 minute to teach and plays quickly enough to get back-to-back plays.

Make sure to pronounce the O as a long O, as in go, not as a short O as in block ;)

An interesting and clever abstract strategy. Play feels limited and I'm not sure there's more to explore here.

It's the same rules just smaller and with 2 players. This means that the game is cutthroat and ruthless. What's not to love?

After 5+ Plays: My favorite Blokus game. I generally prefer positional abstracts with 2 players, and this version is better than the each-plays-two-colors option of both original Blokus and Trigon.

Blokus for two (duh). However, it begs the question as to why this is needed at all. This can be played on the regular Blokus board by sectioning off the correct number of board spaces.

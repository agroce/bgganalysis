RATING: 5
[I]tl;dr - I could get used to the dice luck in this game, because there's some mitigation strategies at play. But a totally solitaire experience (minus a warmed-over military component) makes Dice City just feel...boring.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Dice City is an interesting take on a city-builder, and the idea of optimizing and growing your city through dice rolls (that place buildings on certain columns) is unique.

While the idea of optimizing your city through dice rolls is interesting, in practice I found this to be really boring. There wasn't even a need to be present while other people were planning out their turns (which took a long time, and didn't involve other players at all). I found myself taking my turns quickly and then talking for minutes at a time while waiting for the other three players to suffer through a game. 

I wonder if this game would be more successful as a deck-builder, actually. I like the card-based idea of building a city, and it wouldn't be that hard to adapt this concept to a basic deck-builder. I'd also like a way to could acquire more dice of the same color, so that I could activate more than one building on a really good row, or even the same building twice! 

Unfortunately, Dice City is a game that just didn't do it for me. If you're looking for a more effective, lightweight city builder, [thing=176396][/thing] has since come out and accomplishes the goal better in a similar timeframe/game weight. I'm also curious to see how [thing=227171][/thing] uses the same mechanic to deliver a cooperative game.

Fun game but can get long, at least 40 minutes by players if they are experienced in something-building games (dice building, deck building, etc). Luck will be your best ally on this game although you can minimize random effects in several ways. Do not recommend to players that hate pushing their luck with dice.

Un juego divertido pero puede ser largo, almenos 40 minutos por jugador si son experimentados en juegos del estilo something-(dice building, deck building, etc).

A highlight of BGG.CON 2015.  Fun engine-building dice and card game.  Simple and non-taxing.  Nothing really new but a really good production.  It felt a little long with 2 players, but the gradual, visual development of my city was really gratifying to me.

I love this game but using the recommended setup with Crossroads and All that Glitters leaves a 3 card infinite loop as a possible combo that will end the game in a real cheese fashion. I recommend take out the Garrison and replace it with Training Camp from the setup recommended in Crossroads. 
Otherwise I love this game! :)

RATING: 8
A great little game that's very similar to Castles of Burgundy and allows players many ways to gain victory points, as well as a changing home base. The public drafting area changes out often. Players can attack each other's "village" which results in specific cards they've drafted being disabled for a while, forcing them to spend actions to fix it. In a game where action economy is tight and you'd better have a plan, it has such a satisfying end game payoff.

RATING: 5
A bland development and harvesting game in which dice are used to activate parts of your tableau.  Build your production capacity early before switching to what scores victory points - you know the drill. Building up military forces offers the potential for conflict between players, but the pay off for the attacker is so insignificant compared to killing bandits, that only a player with a grudge should consider it.

The artwork reminds of Imperial Settlers with its little sim people.  Production quality is good.

Feels like what I wanted Machi Koro to be. I like that you can dial in your strategy, and I like the cutesy (imperial settlers-like) art. Biggest negative is that it's a table hog - each player gets a board that's bigger than some whole other games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Light dice placement game.  Plays like a cross between Machi Koro and Imperial Settlers.  Is a bit of a table hog with up to 4 players each with an A3 size city board.

You roll 5 different coloured dice and place them on a city grid corresponding to the colour and number on the dice.  This will let you use whatever ability is on that space, either gathering a resource, generating attack points or a special ability of a building.

You gather resources to buy upgraded city or resource tiles to enhance your board and final score.  The diversity of buildings offer a variety of strategies.

There are a number of end game conditions including being the first person to have 2 complete rows of active buildings so there is a requirement to be aware of everyone else's boards and start attacking to deactivate opponents' buildings.
In my opinion, a far better game than Machi Koro with less blatant 'take that' moves.

Think of this thematically somewhere between Machi Koro and Imperial Settlers, although it's a dice placement game in which you get a ton of potential locations to cultivate resources from, affect other spots and score VP. It's quite interesting how you roll your hand and set up the dice in appropriate player board squares which might or might not have been covered up with cards you've built, and I also like that you have an Attack mechanism which can not only score things from cards in the field, but also directly target other players to Deactivate their action spaces and swipe resources. Cute artwork, easy to teach, good stuff.

Light, whimsical fun! A favorite for my parents (non-gamers), this game has some cute art, a nice theme, just enough randomness (that you’re always trying to mitigate) for it to be a nice gateway resource management game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Essentially, this is an engine-building game. Players roll dice, which activate cards; and those cards give you resources, VP, the ability to attack another player, and the ability to buy replacement cards (hence, the engine-building). Mechanically, the game is simple, plays quickly, and provides tons of ways to manipulate dice-rolls.

Typically, this isn't my type of game. But the dice manipulation in this game is interesting enough where the game feels like a puzzle, which I like. There is a significant amount of luck, but the game is quick enough where it doesn't frustrate me as much.

This is a nice game!  I don't have an expansion yet, which I think will help shake it up nicely.  It is surprisingly puzzly for my game groups, which seems more contrary to its lighter feeling aesthetic and presentation.  I don't take too much time to puzzle things out, but I do enjoy the dice-chucking resource-gathering good time.  I have just binged on it, so it may be that I should rate it higher than this and I just need a bit more time away from it.  Quite fun, but not a "must".

Je bouwt een stad en verdient overwinningspunten.
Heel veel elementen van Puerto Rico.
Maar de dobbelstenen bepalen welke plekken van je stad worden geactiveerd.  Grondstoffen, leger of punten.  Elks van deze plekken kan je upgraden tijdens het spel.
Verschillende strategieën mogelijk... Military, levering aan schepen of nog andere...

Na één keer spelen is mijn oordeel:
Leuk spel, mooi gemaakt, leuke dynamics.
Met 4 newbies spelen was echter bijzonder saai.  Je wacht gewoon eeuwen tot het jouw beurt is en ondertussen is er geen interactie.
Daarom denk ik dat het spel met 2 wel ideaal moet zijn.

En ik vond het echt wel leuk... Als ik aan de beurt was.

Initial rating after a 4p game. Art is cartoony (in a good way) and effective. The small cards could be a problem for some but wasn't for me. It's not a super-deep game but it's a nice light-weight, dice-rolling, city-building sort of game with quite a few decisions to make. I see this game being best with 2-3 as the downtime factor is somewhat high at 4.

My expectations were not real high after reading the rules and checking out some of the cards. In my one play, I was able to get the engine going a bit.

I'm just not sure how good it really is.

RATING: 4
Dice manipulation and random card placement in order to, at best, attain a strategy that doesn't really feel like it works. It does have a bit of player interaction but that just ends up being more of a nuisance for all parties involved. Personally, I tested very specific strategies such as pure war/antagonize, pure resource hoarding/trade ships, pure victory point assets. I have concluded that the best strategy is a combination of everything in order to mitigate the variable spread of dice rolls. 

Unfortunately, it has lost it's shine over a short time and hasn't been thought of or brought out to the table in over 1 year. Not enough staying power for my group.

Not sure about this one. It gets extra boost from my wife liking it. I love the concept of building out a city and using dice to figure out what you get. I was hoping it would be a step up from Machi Koro, which we like very much. It's not as interactive though. Everyone seems to be playing their own city quietly by themselves. That can be great when in the mood for a quiet, thinky game. But I like to be plugged into what everyone else is doing, and this game doesn't promote that.

I got this hoping it was a better dice town building game than Machi Koro and I was right, I like this vastly better than Machi Koro and when I lost it was because I passed on a card I thought wasn't worth it when it paid out big for my opponent.  I got out played, not sabotaged by the dice.  But the randomness of the dice is still a factor but has goods ways to mitigate and overcome that fact.  Excellent game.

Dice City, at least in my mind is very similar to Stone Age... Not so much in game play however I feel that a large portion of both games is reducing the luck of the dice. In Dice City you only ever roll a handful of dice however you need to develop your city to maximize each die roll. Overall I think this game meets a nice balance of luck, planning and fun.

Great concept that may play a little too slow to really shine. I like it. As any dice game is going to be, a tad too random. Luck should even out over the long run. Attacks are hardly ever worth it so this ends up as largely a solitaire game.

Random, as you'd expect from a dice game, but plays very smoothly and pretty quickly with enough die rolls over the course of the game that you feel that there's a least a chance of the luck evening out. However, the limited carryover of resources between turns imposes an additional layer of luck, making you dependent to an extent on the available buildings matching the resources you collect on your turn - first impressions are that military buildings are particularly important, if you can get them. A fair slice of luck then, but it plays fast enough that I enjoyed the ride.

Hmm. This was, unfortunately, yet a forgettable game. The game does have a few somewhat interesting concepts, but basically it is a simple sort of engine building game with dice. And you really do feel at the mercy of the dice; sure, you can change the results, but that costs another dice, so it's quite expensive to do so. The different strategic paths do seem balanced, at least it was in my first game. It was a 2p game, but it still took way longer than I expected even though I tried to end the game quickly. To me, this game is a poster child for "meh".

A little too simplistic for my tastes.  This game just doesn't do it for me, although I may be cajoled into playing it again at some point.

After one play I'm not sure what to think of this game. It definitely has a few different paths to victory and the ability to create some interesting combos with the buildings you buy assuming you get the dice to roll your way. What started out as a very slow engine in the initial rounds turned in to us being able to buy 2 or sometimes 3 cards in a single turn towards the end. My complaints are managing the 3 different resource types to buy new buildings just feels like more work than it needs to be since you have to keep track of these in your head pretty much. Machi Koro has the advantage here as it's simply a single coin value to remember instead of different numbers for wood, stone, and iron. Next, this also takes up a ton of table space given the individual player boards are huge and you need room for all the common cards/chits. Finally, even though there is military interaction it is minimal and often just better to push towards VPs and game end so it still feels like a very solitaire experience. Ultimately, I'd be willing to try it again with maybe 2 or 3 players, but I think for a light "gateway-ish" city building game Machi Koro has this one beat.

I am undecided on this game after my first (incomplete) play.  I was not able to finish the first game due to a time constraint.

I dislike the "steal a resource" aspect of the game as this somewhat prevents you from planning.  However, this can be mitigated by a strategy where you do not normally save resources between turns.  You could instead collect 2 pass tokens to later trade in for a resource if an extra were needed.

In my first game I started buying the special buildings where it increased the power of other buildings.  For example, one building gave one extra sword to all Army buildings.  However, it is difficult to utilize these unless you are lucky enough to have the perfect dice roll.  Otherwise too many dice are used to move other dice.  So I think a simple engine may be best.  I started getting 2 ore cards for awhile and placing them every other space, so I could move a dice by one column to get it on them.  Then I started buying 2 sword cards and placing every other column. It seemed to be working ok.  I might want to try this strategy through a whole game to see how well it works.

Feels like a grown-up version of Machi Koro: more strategic, but also less engaging.  There's nothing to do on other players' turns unless they choose to attack you.

Would recommend with two or three players only, as four players is slow.

One play isn't enough to rate, and I would play it again, but two concerns come up:

Balance may be an issue.

MP Solitaire is certainly an issue. Found myself wondering why we didn't just throw out a bunch more cards to the market and all play at once. If someone took what you were after it would be a small price to pay for not having to wait through events that you can't alter or react to meaningfully anyway.

On the upside, it doesn't last longer than it should, and it has a nice feel for a light dice game. In fairness maybe all dice games suffer from not moving fast enough - you're always itching to roll the bones again...

Only 1 2-player game so far, and likely the only one.  I should probably play it more, but this one just doesn't do it for me. There seems to be a lot of options, but that is illusory. There are only 2 basic options: Upgrade resources to get trade ships, or buy red (military) cards and fight bandits.  Any other strategy just can't keep up with those two.  A neat idea for a game, but a poor execution.

Players develop their personal player board, and try to amass the most victory points.  Simple engine building game, where players all roll five different coloured dice.  These dice are placed on to the player board matching their result (white 6, yellow 2, etc).  Players then use these dice to action the space below the dice - gain resources, victory points, or special powers.  Resources buy better cards which slot onto the player board, growing the engine.  Eventually you want to be able to defeat the barbarians, and pick up the trade cards, all worth lucrative victory points.  

Pleasant game, attractive to look at, and played well.

Feels somewhat like a blend of Machi Koro, Imperial Settlers, and a generic deck-builder.   It's on the lighter side of that blend.   Takes up a lot of space, but it kind of needs to.  There's some interaction that feels a little bit forced and a bit Plan B.   Straightforward to learn and play, however.   Downtime is a serious problem, so this is probably best as a 2p game.   The art is cool too, sort of in the Kingdom Rush vein.  Lots of sky on the cards, though.   Would certainly play some more, but probably don't need to own it.

A decent light game about place dice where you roll them and trying to maximize your resources from that. It's simple and good enough once in awhile. Lots of chance and multiple ways to end the game, but you likely shouldn't until you think you'd win.

RATING: 6.5
It feels a lot like Imperial Settlers, only with a dice matrix.  Like Imperial Settlers, you build up production but have limited storage, and there's also an option to attack the other players that no one really wants to do.  The biggest flaw, IMO, is that the most rewarding part of the game is building combos in your city, but only one type of building actually allows for dice manipulation.  That means that it's just luck, otherwise.

The Kingdom of Rolldovia is in turmoil. Her royal highness, the Queen, has decreed that there will be a new capital after the old one was sacked by hordes of barbarians and bandits from the south. As leaders of one of the country's influential noble families, players vie with each other to establish their provincial city as the best home for Rolldovia's new capital. You must choose your city's path in gaining the approval of all others in the kingdom.

Dice City is a "dice-crafting" game in which the locations in your city act as the changing faces of your dice each turn. Use tactics and strategy to press your claim!

You each have several ways to promote your city; create strong armies; construct wondrous buildings; or open up trade routes. The secret is to manage your city and its natural resources carefully to make the best of your fortunes.

I first played this game at GenCon, and was really impressed with it. Upon purchase however, it's felt a bit "meh." I suspect that it was getting a GenCon and a "cool people we were playing with" bump on that first play.

That said, it has a slight twist on worker placement / world building via dice that I enjoy. Players roll colored dice and place them on their designated rows in a column dictated by the rolled number. The cell each dice lands on gives the player resources or powers for that round. The players can improve the cells in their cities, attack each other, attack pirates, or offload resources (for big points). 

With both two and three players the game ended up somewhat tame.  But sometimes you want to play something low-key.

[b]Light, tactical tableau-building dice game. The cuteness and light sensibility of Machi Koro, combined with a tiny bit of the more sophisticated manipulation/building powers of Imperial Settlers. [i]I owned it, but traded it away because of lack of variety in the box, and not a single friend enjoyed it.[/i][/b]

[b]Rating history: 10|8|8|6|8|6|4[/b]

[b]June 2016[/b]
After more than a half-dozen plays, I just find the base game uninteresting. Yes there are expansions evailable, but the value in the box isn't high enough. They should have charged $5 more and included another 12 buildings types. Also, none of my friends enjoyed it.

[b]December 2015[/b]
I've read the complaints of people who don't enjoy it, but they don't bother me. When played with 2p, this is quick tableau-building, dice-chucking filler that is fun to play, and has a lot of VP routes in a small package. Great graphics, easy to understand rules, just a bit of interaction with the military, but not in an overly-interfering way. 

This game might have been a 10 for me if the deck had been twice the size, with some one-of and two-of buildings, instead of 3 copies of 20 different cards (which means you see most buildings most games). Still, as is, it's fun to chase down the different VP opportunities.

What really makes the game work is the speed at which it plays with 2p. And since one of the end conditions is filling two rows, there is a good chance one player will put speed pressure on the other player (like Race for the Galaxy). 

[b]-5th play-[/b] The quicker this plays, the better it is, in the sense that it becomes the filler-type game that I want it to be. Reading the available buildings and racing for the finish line is fun. I played more aggressively (attacking key buildings for points) and that added a new dimension.

[b]-4th play-[/b] This play just went flat. Can't explain it. I still like it, but only mildly. I think it's just not the kind of game you play three times in one night. It's a light tableau builder with quick, fun decisions. Less thinking than Castles of Burgundy, more thinking than Machi Koro.

I want to say this will bounce back to an 8, and it may, but the lack of variety in the cards definitely hurts it. BUT we have not been attacking each other much, and that little bit of interaction would probably help the game. Which is our fault, not the games.

[b]-2nd play and 3rd play-[/b] My wife and I played, and about halfway through, I realized how often you will see the same "random"building in the game. This game would have benefitted from more building powers to make the specialization of each board feel more unique. Still good, but obviously lighter for this absence.

[b]-1st play-[/b] went very well. This was a bit of an impulse Christmas gift request. I was looking for a game a bit more advanced than Machi Koro, but lighter and shorter than Imperial Settlers. I think I've hit a home run. Easy to teach, nice graphics. Lots of paths to victory: rush two rows, military for bandit points, military for raiding opponents, shipping points, generating VPs from buildings, quality building, or some hybrid of any two of those above.

Super boring gaming. Nothing wrong mechanically but each person's board is the same and so many spots are the same. Sad because I tend to like light dice rolling/tableau building games

Many of the buildings are the same/samey and you are just going through the motions of rolling and effectively buying stuff. That's a really big problem for a tableo building style game and also the fact that if you buy something cool, that doesn't mean you'll even roll it any time soon.

I can see they put in military to create some interaction but it feels so weak unless you are playing 2p. You don't slow anyone down much with military and since you have to target someone, the other people will get ahead of you. So most of the time you are just killing bandits for max VP

I think the only player count of this game I would play is 2p because there is more paying attention to the other person board. I didn't care at all in 3p what people were doing outside of a few select cases, I was just trying to maximize my turn with the random dice I got. Maybe it shines more in 2p but ultimately for me there are just so many other light dice/tableau building games out there that are way better, this one is a hard pass

I love the look and feel of this game.  The idea of laying out your city strategically and planning ahead always seems like a good idea, but it ends up rarely working as desired.  It tends to be a version of "multi-player solitaire" where you don't really care what your opponent does, except in the odd circumstance where he actually bothers to attack you.  But if you like staring at a board rather than at your friends, you will find this one could be a very good fit.

A dice placement game where you build your city (read: engine) to become the capital (read: churn out the most points, either directly or indirectly).

The building cards are numerous and varied. Players can focus on a type or many types, and be successful if careful and lucky.

The game can end in a few ways, meaning it's either an aimless race or a more focused slog. We prefer the latter.

Strategy is low, as one would imagine due to the dice. The available buildings are cards in the offer, so by the time your turn comes around, the card you wanted may be gone. This is a game about tactically reacting to the situation, especially since the resources generated by your engine -- no matter how plentiful -- have severe limitations as to what can be stored between turns.

Speaking of turns, this game is better with fewer players. We've played with four, and that was a big mistake.

Dice City is a game that isn't quite the sum of its parts, at least for us. It's good, certainly not great, but probably won't stay in our collection for much longer.

Similar to Kingsburg, but better (somewhat).  Roll dice & do what it tells you.  Can discard dice to slide further along for a different action.  Buy cards to gain added powers if you can land on them.

Limited selection of special city cards makes this quite repetitive (no different from your neighbours).  Tends to drag out a fair bit, not very exciting.  Can be quite vindictive if you take the military approach.  Don't know if this is a keeper (plays a bit long for what it gives you and has a fair bit of down time).  Might be a trade soon.

骰子城是一款用骰子構築自己城市的一款遊戲，每回合使用自己的五顆不同顏色的骰子獲取資源、建造建築、攻擊野蠻人、或是攻擊對手，骰運好，combo 連續技發動會很過癮，不過遊戲每回合也有資源限制，讓玩家必須想辦法資源管理，在玩過三人及兩人局後，我發現他也是一款不錯的solo game ，而且遊戲簡單好上手，算還不錯的家庭遊戲～

Solitaire possible.

My rating is based on solitaire play only, which doesn't have the need to defend your city from other players.  The "Normal" difficulty level is a bit easy, so I switched to the "Hard" level which is just a very minor rules change but makes the game more difficult to win.

Seems to occupy an odd niche.  It's too long to be a filler, too complex to be a gateway game, but too random and not deep enough to be a gamer's game.  This is also as close a game to "multiplayer solitaire" as I have yet to play.

2015-10-13 - 7 - Nice city building dice game where you throw your dice to see which building will be activated during your turn. This game had really good start to me, but lost its pace during the middle part to be again faster at the ending. Maybe I was tired - I played only once at Spiel 2015. Good game anyway.

Deck building game with dice rolling with different colors. Kind of another spin on machi koro, but instead of a single solitary die each player has their own dice to use to activate their buildings, depending on what they roll. Some choice in this game, as you can take away actions to get a better chance to do what you want. Still fell flat for me, as there are so many games out there that do this, and this one didn't do it particularly well.

The combination of dice placement and deck/board building makes for an enjoyable time.  Down time between turns is long, though, and the Cathedral tile is absolutely overpowered -- I won by over 40 points using it over and over (which I didn't find that fun, honestly).  No one used the military strategy in our game, which might have shaken things up a bit.  Have All That Glitters, By Royal Decree, and Crossroads.

Dice City is a "dice-crafting" game in which the locations in your city act as the changing faces of your dice each turn. Use tactics and strategy to press your claim!

You each have several ways to promote your city; create strong armies; construct wondrous buildings; or open up trade routes. The secret is to manage your city and its natural resources carefully to make the best of your fortunes.

RATING: 9
A caveat: these are my thoughts on the game plus all the expansions.

Great game, so much fun, love the artwork, easy to teach, & plays great solo. Couple of points worth bearing in mind: this is not a quick game if playing with 4 as there can be quite some downtime; 3 is probably the sweet spot.

Also, whilst it is very easy to play, it can be quite deep & 'brain burnery' when trying to weigh up all the possible choices.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

Played two games in a row and won both. There are opportunities to be somewhat mean to your opponents, but it doesn't feel over the top. Feels a bit like deckbuilding as you seek to build up your city with buildings that fit your strategy no matter what number is rolled. There are several ways to gain points and I'm not certain if there is any imbalance or not. Trade brings a ton of points but if you used those goods to build instead there could be a fair bit of points and actions one could use later. I expect paying attention to what everyone else would be helpful and one can use military or pass tokens to try and slow someone down. However, since this doesn't really provide points, it helps the other players gain on you.

This is a sort of pumped-up Machi Koro, which was a game I didn't care too much for. A little more going on with this one, and several ways to approach it. There's potential for interaction, but it seemed like what you could gain from it you could get a whole lot easier without it, so it barely happened in our game. Goes on a little long, though.

Like the idea. Turned out a bit Meh.. Very multi-player solitaire. there are interactive elements but they dont seem to reward. Without that there is a lot of downtime where you know what you are going to do but cant do it and stare out the window while others um and ah about moves. Also no one is interested in anyone elses move
Never really managed to get a strategy that worked ok and kept missing the things that gave value. The special tiles are not really all that special. Just doesn't work for me. Maybe its the theme that is so non-existant.

First impressions: This was high on my list of games to try at Gencon 2015.  Played a demo and wasn't impressed.  Decided not to purchase in the future.  Over a year goes by and I saw someone compare it to Imperial Settlers (one of my favorite games!), so I check out the comments on the game page....see several more comparisons to Imperial Settlers.  Ok, I'll try it again.  2nd game was much better!  Light, engine building, combo -y sort of game.  Very excited to play it more.

RATING: 6
Fun dice-chucker. Lots of different buildings available with many paths to victory. The military feels a bit tacked on, but you can avoid or house rule it away. It's a bit of a table hog, but it sets up and plays quick and is easy to teach.

The solo variant is an entertaining beat-a-score and gives you a chance to try different strategies. Not worth it as solo-only, but definitely adds value and playtime.

Downtime is a big drawback, but it can be mitigated by house-ruling turn order.

Roll dice, get stuff, spend it for points or tech increase. Where have we seen this before? This game doesn't do anything new, it is a perfectly harmless dice game. Not bad to pass the time, but nothing exciting either. Play is quite solitary. There are some rules that stimulate you to bring some interaction, but using those is nothing efficient. Better do something useful for yourself with your dice. Downtime can be a bit too long when playing with four.

A bit too thinky for a dice chucker for me.  And, the resource management is a bit wonky, as you are supposed to get all the resources and then build, but it feels like you should be able to build as you go.  I'm also afraid there isn't enough variety in the cards.  I'd still like to try this one a few more times and possibly get the expansion.  However, this one has a chance to leave the collection.

I like the game and so does my wife (it has dice!) and it gets better after repeated plays but I think it is best with 2 or 3 players at most because with 4 I think it can turn into something boring as you will need to wait for a long time before doing something. Also, it becomes much more difficult to keep track of your opponents. We both like it and I think we'll appreciate it more the more we play. It's not a very deep game though but just enjoyable to play.

It's simple and fast, it has dice and some mitigation of the dice.

I Like the art of the game, the cards could be a little bit bigger, but that would mean that the player boards would also have to be bigger and they are pretty big already...

Video Review - https://youtu.be/0GBbGbJUNPA

In many ways Dice City sounds a lot like Machi Koro, and it has almost completely replaced Machi Koro for me. Yet there are some differences. 

In Dice city you all have your own board with 6 columns and 5 rows, each row has a colour corresponding to a die. You roll the dice and place them on the location matching the colour and number. You then have a number of options to mitigate luck, and claim resources which allow you to buy better locations for your board. You have a number of strategies to gain victory points and it makes for a varied experience.

The biggest criticism is you spend a lot of time looking down at your own board and that can effect player interaction. 

However my experience has been that most people have enjoyed this as much as I do!

Surprisingly fun! Initially, it seems that you have no decisions about how to use your dice, since they go on a 5 x 6 grid based on color and value. But you can pass, use combinations of resources to buy properties, deactivate and reactivate, fight bandits, steal from each other, etc. Definitely gateway, but plenty of decisions for gamers, too.

I really like this one.  It scratches a similar itch to Kingsburg, a game I really enjoyed but got played out with my group.  My biggest problem with Dice City is that it feels like it overstays its welcome a little.  I feel like we always end up playing it for way longer than the advertised play time of 45-60 minutes.

I also own the All that Glitters and Crossroads expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This game was more fun than I thought it would be. It's definitely a city building game that uses engine building as a core mechanic, but the way the dice and the cards (which are essentially used as tiles are in a lot of other city building games) interact is unique. I thought the dice rolling would make it too random, but it isn't really, since what you build (and what you replace when you build) have a big impact. It's more strategic than tactical, though tactics can play a part.

Overall, it's quick, fun, and allows a lot of choice about strategy. It's not too mean, at all. It played well for us with two players. Also, the art work and design are fun. My one complaint about it is that it can end too quickly, even though a lot of cards only really start to become useful as the game goes on - it sort of felt like I was missing part of the game. But still, a fun, quick city building game that is on the lighter side and definitely worth checking out for fans of the genre.

6 plays in:

Seems a little dull -  I have an issue with the downtime (some don't) and I only would play with 2 players,  the solitaire game is a boring "beat your last score" type of game so that doesn't interest me, there aren't very many interesting combos or plays to make, I do like the direct player conflict as it doesn't feel very harsh; the restriction on keeping resources is also appreciated; strategic options seem a little limited

Dice City did not make a good first impression, that's for sure!  It felt boring, with too much AP and downtime, and few strategies to explore.  I think it is growing on me and might be one of those games that really takes a few plays for me to understand and appreciate.  Or, maybe it just isn't going to work for me.  The expansion "By Royal Decree" may be what this game needs for me to help it shine ...  the problem is that the game gets terribly expensive if you need to buy the expansions to make it fun / interesting.

REALLY clever way of doing a true "dice building," where you change the faces of your dice, without having to draw on the dice, or snap things onto them, etc..  The downtime is a little high, between turns, but it's a very good game.

I appreciated the potential behind having a different power for each of the possible 30 die rolls (5 colors, values 1-6), and building towards that with the options available. It's very much a case of taking advantage of what's presented to you in the draft though, and what resources you roll to begin with, so it feels like you're being led by the nose in the early game. But at least there's different avenues to explore each game which provides some replay. The one issue is that if you know what you're doing, there can be some downtime while people analyse dice manipulations and the 8 powers available in the draft, and as a consequence the game goes longer than it should. For which I'd normally mark it down to a 6, but it gets a higher rating because it generates an itch to explore the viability of the different approaches it offers.

Very cute, but meaty Tableau Builder. Reminds me of a cross between Machi Koro and Kingsburg, but definitely stands on its own. I have not yet tried it solo.

Different from other dice placement games I've played (Kingsburg, Grand Austria Hotel, Garden Dice, etc.).  Certainly fits in the collection along with those others.  Plenty of ways to use the dice for actions and plenty of ways to mitigate them.  You can also focus on different paths to victory (military cards vs. culture cards, etc.).  And the decisions as to which cards to purchase and which spots on your board to cover up give you plenty to think about.  Solid, fun game!!

A comparison between this game and Machi Koro is inevitable as both are dice-rolling city-bulding card games. But where the latter is extremely light, moderately interactive, and highly tactical, Dice City demands prudence and forethought, and lean much more towards the 'multiplayer solitaire' end of things. Both are short and fun though and there sure is place for each of them in a decent-sized collection, even if I would give the Artipia title a slight nod.

I actually quite like this game, my friends didn't, they thought it was kind of slow and clunky. I felt some rules could be better explained on the rulebook.

Really enjoyed it but sold it because it wasn't going to get to the table.

It has a solo mode, which is actually really enjoyable and gives you lots of choices. I would recommend it for players that are patient and don't mind taking some time between turns to talk.

It is a game that i would like to play if a friend tells me to, but in my shelf it takes space and I don't play it, so had to make a decision

I'm normally a bit wary of dice games unless they're very light or the randomness of dice rolls plays into the theme, but I find this one very enjoyable, and MUCH better than Machi Koro. Nice presentation, just enough control, a little bit of interaction, and easy, fluid gameplay. The solo variant is good. Slightly too long with 4 players.

Imagine if Machi Koro and Imperial Settlers had a baby, and again has a conflict between a desire to be simple in exchange for an inability to move the game as fast as it ought to. It feels like Machi Koro combined with deckbuilding, where the only thing slowing down simultaneous play is the ebb and flow of the market. I think it could be fun to try again, but it's also sorta tedious because optimized play is super take-thatty and requires player attacking.

This is a fun little dice game.  It is neat how you use the dice pretty much as randomly placed workers.  You buy cards to upgrade the locations they can land on.  While it is random, there are ways to mitigate that aspect.  It plays well at two players, never actually played it larger.  It does take up a LOT of table space because you each have your own board.

RATING: 5
Feels a lot like Machi Koro, but with a lot more variety in building type and choice about where to place. However, each building will have an equal 1/36 chance of activating (technically higher for 2-5 since these are easier to shift dice to than 1 or 6), but you can choose to place all your best buildings in the same color row to ensure one triggers or spread them out. Gold is interesting but the end game condition of running out of gold pool should be removed. Note the game is very much multiplayer solitaire - players pay little attention to what others are doing. Attacking seems to have been added as an afterthought to add interaction and an alternative to getting points, but it doesn't seem to have been fully play tested and needs some tweaking.

I was a bit meh after my first playthrough (2 player).  After playing with 3, I enjoyed it more since other folks might be going for the same thing as you which might hasten the end game (to your dismay) and also might mean the cards you want are not available by your turn.  It definitely could use some variety in the cards (expansions exist, but are expensive), but it ultimately plays well as a light dice engine builder since there's enough mitigation to provide some strategy.

A fairly quick and fast paced affair with multiple paths and options. The dice steer your turn by turn decisions, but your card purchases are where you engineer your strategy. Go military, or go resources, or find a good little card combination you can use to good effect. The player interaction is fairly light, but a little bit of aggression thrown about keeps things interesting. Plans must be made. Plans must be executed.

I found it light and enjoyable. Easy to remember rules and a quick pace means I'd be happy to see this hit the table from time to time as a sub hour gaming experiment.

A middling mish mash of [thing=143884][/thing] and [thing=154203][/thing]. Each turn, players allocate rolled dice to a personal grid and trigger the corresponding buildings. Players will be gathering resources throughout in order to construct better buildings, or to convert into VP.

The erratic pacing is a major drawback here, as players spend most of the game fiddling with their own dice while waiting for opponents to take their moves. The attack option helps break the solitary mood, but also adds to the downtime as players have to turn their attention to determining key buildings on their opponent's boards. It's an otherwise adequate resource gathering game with a few neat dice manipulation elements.

This is a kind of interesting worker-placement game where the workers are dice and the action spaces are entirely chosen by the roll of the dice: your control is largely in determining (modifying) what those spaces actually do. Since every result on each die is equally probably, you can focus your strategy either by rolling well :) or by filling up a row or two predominantly with whatever buildings your strategy requires. It's interesting in that, unlike most worker placement games, you have fairly little control in what you can do each turn! 

Unfortunately, we were taught the rules incorrectly (the military part, at least) by the second guy who took over for the first demo guy (I got the second guy for a different game later; he sucked!). 

Regardless, I don't think this is going to be my kind of game. I might like it better if you had 2d6 of each color; you'd sum the results, and the columns would be ranges of numbers such that the center were more likely to get hits (bell curve distribution). That way, at least you could play the odds and concentrate key buildings in the central part of each row! I'm just not crazy about the totally random die roll results!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Each player has a large board, their CITY, which is a 6x5 grid: 5 rows of different colors (with a matching die each), 6 columns for rolls 1-6. Each grid space either gives you a resource (wood, stone, or iron), VP (chit), military strength (to attack off board targets, not each other), or some effect (e.g., reroll that die). Everyone rolls their 5d6 at the start of the game, then at the end of each of their turns (so they can plan during other players' turns!). On your turn, use your resources to buy cards on display (6? random cards, as well as a stock of production buildings, are always on display); and your military to attack. You can attack either 3 types of barbarians, with increasing strength requirements and VP rewards; OR another player's building -- you earn some VP and deactivate that building (they can spend any die to reactivate it). Buildings you acquire are placed in your grid, covering whatever is there already (and giving you a better/different power in the future). At the end of your turn, you may keep no more than one of each of the 3 building resources.

The game ends at the end of the round (equal number of turns) when either someone has completely filled 2 rows of their city grid, or the barbarians have been completely defeated. Everyone tallies their VP totals:
- chips won during the game
- buildings worth variable VP
- defeated barbarians
Most VP wins!

tl;dr: fun, fast, mediocre

OK, that might sound a bit harsh, at least the mediocre part. But I don think this game only has one thing going for it, which obviously is that cool dice mechanism. But other than that it is a pretty standard get-resources-build-cards-get-points game. And it works fine, and the game moves along at a pleasant pace and stuff, but it all felt a bit been-there-done-that for me. OK, that dice mechanism is cool, but it's not enough to elevate this game above other similar titles.
Also, this game is mostly multiplayer solitaire. There is some competition for building certain cards before other players do, and there is a mechanism to 'attack' other players, but no one ever saw any reason to actually do that.
Also a word on the graphics: I'm not a fan of the graphic design. The color scheme is a bit all over the place and the font on the rather small cards could have been a bit bigger.
So yeah, pleasant, inoffensive, but not all that special.

Surprise hit of Spiel'15 in Essen for me and my husband! Very addictive game, you instantly want to play again and try something different. I'm glad this game looked so delicious I took the time to read the rules, because otherwise I would have never bought it. I thought it was just excessive dice rolling and luck, but that's not the case here. Interesting decisions on how to expand your city and use your dice. You can always do something, no matter what you roll. Maximizing your benefits is the key and sometimes it is smarter to just pass a die and take a pass token.

A very nice game, I definitely recommend. Not the heaviest game you can play, obviously, but still a bit thinky if you want to do well. I hate games you can play on autopilot and your decisions are always obvious. This is not one of those.

This felt a lot like Machi Koro. With two players, it was pretty quick. I can imagine it being a bit long with more players, so in that sense, it might be worse than MK. As a two-player game, it is what it is -  a fast little engine game with the randomness of dice.

RATING: 6
As a two-player game, I find Dice City enjoyable. There is the potential for massive amounts of downtime, and so I shy away from increased player-counts. This is very much a game in the tradition of optimizing lots and lots of small actions into a chain that sums to something greater. What it also does well is inject a sense of randomness with the dice, as well as some player interaction in the form of attacks. None of this gets away from the combo-building core, but it mixes it up in such a way that the "perfect" combo is elusive. My one complaint is the art and iconography. I'm not a fan. Much like Imperial Settlers, everything is obnoxiously tiny and difficult to read. The cutesy art style also rubs me the wrong way. Not the end of the world, though: just not to my tastes.

Dice City uses one of my favorite mechanics, which is when you roll dice to determine which actions you can take for that round.  You have 5 colored dice and a board with rows of 6 buildings for each dice.  You roll the dice, and whichever buildings they land on determine which action you can take.  You use the actions to upgrade your buildings and acquire victory points, and you have some ability to change which buildings you land on for that turn.  

The mechanics are neat, but it just didn't blow me away.  The ending is somewhat unpredictable and anticlimactic.  Not a bad game.  It feels and looks a lot like [thing=154203][/thing], if you're into that game.

I get the comparisons to Machi Koro (which is an all-timer at our house).  It is a different enough game to keep, even if I am going through the process of shedding more than half of my collection.

Good art, variable gameplay, decent interaction--all good things.  Could suffer from AP players getting locked up on al the choices.

The game is fun enough for the genre, and I would say I have fun playing it. But I feel like, at least within the base game, there is too much repetition and the dice oftentimes bog the game down rather than present interesting options. The expansions might diversify it a bit, but I'll probably never find out.

Dice City is a perfectly balanced game that is well designed and scales to perfection.

There is very little that hasn't been addressed in the design and there are many ways to attain victory,  but most of all,  Dice City is just plain fun.

Replays are endless - as no two games will play out the same because of the numerous different buildings.  I highly recommend this game for those who enjoy light,  but strategic games.

Dice City didn't feel very well playtested. Many of the tile improvements seemed very lackluster while others were clearly hugely powerful. The cost to acquire a clearly bad tile compared to a clearly great one didn't differ much, either.

You roll so few times that you don't get a ton of use out of any given tile improvement, either. That said, the game overstays its welcome by quite a bit.

Can you talk about this game without mentioning Machi Koro? Well obviously I can't because I just did. What you have is a dice rolling city building game. The differences are huge however. The dice in this game really never totally screw you over like happens in MK...quite a lot. You will get to do something with your dice even if that's use one of your dice actions to move another die to a better place. The cards in this game are so much more dynamic. MK was a fine base game for about 3 plays then it got stale. Sure the expansions helped the problem, some...but not enough and at a cost of extremely extending the game. Given I feel that MK is not ll that hot to begin with this leads to problems. DC is a longer game from the get go, but with so many better choices to make, and things to consider you don't mind it one bit. I love this game quite a lot.

While the game is probably best with three, as I feel its a bit too long with four it still plays wonderfully with two.  At first I thought military might be weird but honestly it works just fine too.

It's just not very fun.  Waiting for others to take their turn can be painful, and if you get behind, it's over while you sit there and wait in pain, if they chose to drag it on.

Some Dice manipulation is possible, but you still have to make some rolls to get a good engine started...  

I am guessing a two player game, might be better, but not sure I will ever give it another run, but maybe some day, but not likely.

I've seen a number of BGGers bashing this game for being too luck dependent.  To that I say hogwash.  That's not this game's problem.  There are countless ways to mitigate luck in this game it's ridiculous.  This game has two problems and neither have to do with luck.  

One, it's too solitary.  Players are focusing on their boards and not so much others.  I see that there's an embassy card expansion which allows you to use a building on another player's board.  This card should have been part of the base game.  Period, end of story.  The attack mode in the game does not necessarily lead to player interaction.  I've played three times so far and I think it's been used once.  It's just not an interesting part of the game for us.

Two, and this is more subjective, the game feels like it lacks a story arc.  It's more about creating an engine (e.g. military versus supplies) and getting it humming to a point where you end the game.  As a result it can feel repetitive.  

I'll give this game a few more plays before deciding to keep it not and I might give a slightly higher rating.  But as of right now why play this when there's Kingsburg and its expansion?

Not bad but I really wasn't wildly impressed. It felt a bit weak on design effort. I'm quite happy with many 'multiplayer' solitaire style games but this was a step too far for me, it felt the concept of interaction was added in late but seems generally ineffective, meaning it would feel spiteful to make an effort to go for that aspect.

Dice activate buildings in your city. A bit too random, and the take that elements were not liked in our group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Dice City is for everyone that wanted Machi Koro to be just a little bit more interesting. You are still basically tossing a die and doing what the building that matches the die roll tells you to do. But you are rolling six dice at the same time, generating 3 different resources and then spending them to build more powerful buildings, which is obviously a bit more interesting.

There is also considerably more player interaction here than just funneling a few coins from your neighbors. You can raise an army, steal their resources or simply incapacitate their buildings. There is also a bit more in the way of dice mitigation, so rarely are you stuck with an unusable dice toss. In fact, figuring out a way around bad tosses is almost more interesting than a perfect roll.

If you are someone that absolutely must have a game that fits in the pocket of your backpack, stick with Machi Koro. For everyone else, Dice City is loads better, particularly once you start exploring the expansions.

Great play with 2-3 players.  Definitely gives me a Kingsburg feel without the annoying 'dummy' player and a lot more strategy.  Plenty of ways to mitigate dice and manage resources!

Dice placement city builder. Unique action selection from color dice and value that correspond to individual player boards. Gain resources to purchse upgrades, gain VP's or use military strength to win objective cards or bully other players. Unique mechanic that upgrades can be placed anywhere on the player board. Take-that elements allow for some interaction. I like when games force decisions between helping yourself or impair other player moves. I also like rolling your next round dice at turn end.  This simple twist minimizes down time between player turns quite effectively. Large player boards take up a bit of table space with four. I found this game entertaining and addictive at Essen but I agree with the comments of the other Geeks.

This takes the idea of Machi Koro, and turns it into a good game. Each player has their own board they're trying to build up, but other players can interfere with attacks. Still suffers sometimes because of the amount of the game that relies on dice rolls, so if someone is having a really unlucky day they're probably not going to have a good time.

Dropped rating after a play. Not a bad game at all - I like the dice placement, the artwork, and the playtime. It's a cool cross between dice rolling and engine building. 

All of that said, I felt like the building cards were somewhat limited and struggled to find ways of building interesting strategies beyond making 2-3 tactical decisions (attack some bandits, buy a mine) each turn. Perhaps the expectations were a little high for a 45-60m game. This certainly isn't a bad game...but for my time, I'd likely suggest something else a majority of the time.

Element of luck cleverly paired with good planning makes this a very pleasant game to play. The rules are fairly simple, and while some might scorn its multiplayer solitaire (the PVP usually simply isn't worth it), it's something that we actually enjoy.

Egy solo játék után azt mondom, pontosan azt hozza, amit vártam. Egy könnyed kockapakolgatós-tablóépítős játék, korrekt grafikával. Négyesben kicsit kaotikus és AP-s lehet, de mi ketten esünk majd leginkább neki, így véleményem szerint nem lesz gond.

Nekem tetszett, a feleségemnek eddig semleges (de inkább nem), majd meglátjuk a további sorsát.

Pár játék után már sajnos látom a hibáit. A gyakorlatban hiába gyors a játék, igazából elég lassú lefolyású a hatása, monotonná válik a dolog a felétől. Ezen az interakció sem segít (támadás), unalmas lesz a játék 60+ percben. Nem tudom mi hiányzik belőle, mert összességében továbbra sincs vele semmi bajom, de nem valószínű, hogy sűrűn előkerüljön.

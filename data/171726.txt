Kickstarter. Waiting for an update on the minis, but that's a mere aesthetic issue. When it comes to gameplay, this game shines. Not too long, not too short, not too light, not too heavy, very challenging and a great pleasure to play. A big plus the fact that it plays pretty well as a single player game.

Game seems very fun. Its an upgrade of Escape: Curse of the temple, with more strategy and variable features implemented. The greatest feature, for me, is the different weapons and the way they work. After learning the game properly, every playthrough will probably take around 40 minutes.

+High replayability, through different setups-aliens-bosses-events-maps.
+Planning phase approved
+Weapons and weapon upgrades are great
-Bad rulebook, many rules need clarifications
-Would prefer more different aliens 
-Miniatures are bad, especially if compared to other masterpieces out there. Personally, it didnt bother me that much, but i can understand that most gamers would be bothered.

*Bought it a second time, after doing the mistake to trade it away the first one.

Playtester comment: Very innovative fusion game, combines real time dice rolling with clever action planning, since you are not only weighing your dexterity against time but each of your actions has potential benefits for the alien invasion. My only remark was to limit the tactical micromanagement for the alien horde. The game is satisfying and strategic! good mechanics are in abundance. recommended.

The minis are very ugly but they are very distinct so that they can be handled very well in that game.

The gameplay itself is very fun. It is tense, it allows tactical decisions, it has good replay value and can be modified to your needs as well.

But on the Interstellar Ost (Mountains) and you will have a blast.

And I can see the producer´s point of view here. The weak plastic was used to make them easy to grab and handle without worrying of breaking things but taht costs detail.

Nonetheless - the whole debate over the minis overshadows the fact that we have a fun game here.

Update: After a 6 hour marathon of the game I am totally impressed - my favourite real-time game with great tension. A total blast! According to its gameplay it is a 10. No doubts.

Mix DOOM - the board game with Alien Uprising (and/or Defenders of the realm) with Escape and you have Project: Elite.

The "roll as fast as you can" games haven't worked for me in the past, but this was the most interesting of them for sure.  Great theme in this one, and the mechanisms definitely bring out the theme.  Wouldnt mind playing again, but I think this game just proves I am not a huge fan of the main mechanism all that much.  I can see why people who enjoy that mechanism are going crazy over this game though for sure!

Terrible Kickstarter experience will not buy from Artipia or DrawLabs again.

2016 was not a good year for board gaming - this one made many top ten lists and even topped Tom Vasel's, but for me this is definitely not as good as it sounded. Everyone is doing his or her thing until the action phase ends, so it's not even a real co-op. Components are awful - not my cup of tea.

RATING: 9
Excellent real time game similar in game-play style to Escape:Curse of the Temple.  I very much prefer Project Elite though.  It is fast and it is tense and a lot of fun.  I would have preferred the original 'rubbery' minis to the ones Drawlab eventually produced as the nature of the game means these minis are a bit hard on the hands.  

Sadly, the Kickstarter Illuminati took over and their outrage outweighed common sense not only making the game a year later than it should but leaving us with less appropriate components.

All in all though, this is an excellent game.

Kickstarter edition with expansion

sleeved

Components:
The punchboard is some kind of cheap coated cardboard...which I've seen before on Kickstarters. That is fine with me. Not very sturdy and not what I expected for a game this pricey but ohkay.

The cardstock is a pretty cheap one.
I didn't want to sleeve the game but after I've seen the cards I am really afraid that these won't survive the first game.

And then came the minis: Seriously? I've been waiting so long for this game and all I get is this shapeless blob?
I feel so so sorry for everyone that got his game last year. You must have some really ugly plastic there, if what I got are the "new" models.
These are definitely not "highly detailed".
In fact there are some minis that are that ugly that they are on par with the Parker Brothers' Dungeons & Dragons: The Fantasy Adventure Game from 2003. What the hell, even Dark World from 1992 has the same detail on their minis and that game is from '92. 1992! That is 24 years old! But this game was cheap and mass market.

Gameplay:
The gameplay was what pulled me into this campaign. I like the idea of combining The King's Armory with Escape: Curse of the Temple.
Blablabla long story short:
It works. It really works.

And it works well.
The system is easy to manage. Simple mechanics under a good theme.

I think the difficulty needs to be adjusted.
Easy was too easy. Even in the first game it was no challenge. Medium was pretty easy as well.
And hard was unbeatable. For me it is missing a real medium difficulty. Despite this the game is superb.

The two minute action phase is great. As a spectator you would see the whole plan falling apart but as a player you roll and roll and curse and roll and curse and curse and roll and roll and suddenly the time is over and you realize that everything fell apart.

I love the game.
If only the quality would be what Artipia/Drawlab promised. Closing both eyes over the components it gets the 8 points otherwise it would receive 6.

Enjoyable real-time game that plays out like a first person shooter version of Escape. It's not too stressful and the difficulty seems right (hard). The smaller minis are decent quality but the bosses are pretty terrible. Blobby and difficult to make out details. Luckily the game is so frantic you don't notice much.

Gameplay is engaging and pretty simple, which is good. It gets wild and communication/strategy certainly matter. Losses seem to occur when we get overwhelmed and everything breaks down. The mix of tower defense with pushing for objectives is interesting.

After a few plays I feel like this is a good game but I'm not sure if it's great. I think another board or more interesting missions (as opposed to just go here and do this) would provide what it needs to get over the hump. I wish the structure was more dynamic and less repetitive.

Tom Vasel's review sums it up: don't try to defend the quality of the minis. You can't. But don't let that stop you from enjoying a great game! Because Artipia DID deliver a great game, gameplay wise.

I will say the components are very good quality (boards, cards, dices, and I love the paper they used for the rulebook), and the plastic used for the minis is very, very good. It's a pity the detail isn't there. The potential was there, though.

I know this game has received a lot of flak due to its miniatures, but I play games without miniatures and enjoy them, and I did not get this game through Kickstarter, so why should I care? (Well, I don't, to be honest.) I actually like the colour-coding of the bosses, specials and regular aliens. The minis are functional.

The action is ridiculously enticing for bits of plastic and cardboard! Whereas many games, like Legends of Andor, try to discourage players from reverting to combat all the time, this is all about shooting as much as you can to keep control of the situation long enough to complete your objective.

The objectives may not seem very different, but once you are playing, the difference is notable: get in, roll dice, get out is quite different from roll dice getting in, then get out, not to mention the two mission types where you can get in and out without the continuous dice rolling.

There is enough diversity to keep you interested and you will probably actually find yourself fearing the moment the first boss spawns - especially when playing solo and without a lot of experience.

Apart from all this, it also plays within the time indicated on the box: in 30 minutes, you get a game done, and chances are you want to play again rightaway.

Oh, and I should definitely mention how the rules got rid of the mess that line of sight tends to be in other games (I am looking at Conflict of Heroes here, which revolves 95% around determining line of sight). Kudos for that!

In short: I love it!

Leaving aside the brouhaha surrounding the 'blobby' miniatures which Artipia/Drawlab are hopefully sorting out, this is an immensely fun mash up between 'Escape from the Temple' (real-time dice play) and Space Hulk (combat increasing amounts of unpleasant Aliens).

Enjoyable pre-turn tactical planning and then the manic action section which can generate genuine tension and pressure as you scramble for the last move or 'fire' die roll.

Having played the game with the 'blobby' miniatures they are 'functionally' good for playing the game with - probably better than the harder plastic that will need to be used for any mini's to show more detail. I can see it happening that those of us who have the 'blobby' minis will continue to use them to play with even after we get more detailed replacements - if only the initial KS advertising hadn't blurbed 'highly detailed ' minis everything may have ended up OK - although I doubt they would have raised so much as minis seems to be what sells KS pledges - form over function :shake:

Don't like real time games in which you roll dice like a maniac and then allocate results. To me it just feels lazy design. The minis are some of the worst I have ever seen in a game. The concept of the game is not bad, defending a base from aliens, but I just wish it worked differently. Not for me.

RATING: 7
Easy, fast, light, entertaining and fun game. Overall a great gaming experience.

I do not usually comment on components here but in this case I think it necessary.

The components are in general of average quality. Good but not great cards, good quality tokens,fairly good game board and the timer works as expected. The real problem comes with the miniatures. These are probably the worst detailed miniatures I have ever found in a game (and the ones I received are the final version, the already improved ones).
It is just a pity that these miniatures make an otherwise great filler game a bit worse.
The game would have worked perfectly with tokens instead of miniatures and would have been much less expensive.
Currently, at 80€ it is not worth it, and you should try to get it second hand and cheaper if able.

Anyway, aside from the miniatures quality and the price, it is a really fun game.

'HIGHLY DETAILED MINIATURES'. Are you having a laugh!?

Mechanically I think this will end up being a solid game. Sadly Artipia are ignoring requests from the backers on Kickstarter to deliver high quality pictures of the miniatures. My conclusion until proven wrong is that the quality of the miniatures is ridiculously low and nowhere near the promised HIGHLY DETAILED MINIATURES. Shame on Artipia for ignoring the backers... and secondly for producing af sub-par product.

Artipia and Drawlab did fix the minis regardless of what some ignorants are saying below and the gameplay is loaded with pace and tactics.

Well designed game around the realtime dice rolling. Manageable rules, fast paced and definitely fun. Minis quality is ok - serves the purpose.

Negative side is, items and weapons are not versatile enough, would like to see more of it, but unfortunately it is not included even in Adrenaline expansion.
Setup cards are pretty much useless and are huge. It would fit into 2 pages in the manual. Instead, it takes room in the box which is quite precious (for sleeved cards and even expansions)
Another thing is, that Drawlab used non-standard card sizes, so you have to basically  buy sleeves from them.

Real time alien killing. Has sort of an x-com feel to it as you slaughter aliens trying to reach certain objectives and complete them. The dice rolling feels similar to Escape: Zombie City.

In terms of components the minis are quite blobby and any detail they had was washed out in the casting process. The board looks okay and the cards are decent. The timer the game comes with is nice in case you don't have another way to time each round and is easy to use.

The game itself is pretty fun and there's a good amount of missions and difficulties to select from as you yell at your friends to come help you fight off some aliens.

2016-11-06 - This is a pretty fun tactical strategy game with a real time element. On its own, the gameplay probably doesn't hold up, but with the added pressure of the real time action phase, it can be a pretty fun challenge. The different objectives seem like they might be a little too similar, but I would at least like to play them to decide for sure. The minis are awful, and look a bit like they were just ever so slightly melted, just enough to lose a lot of fine detail.

I backed the Kickstarter to begin with. I know that people have complained about the miniatures (The first batch was pretty atrocious), but the 2nd attempt is acceptable for how this game is. They are durable and beefy and that is what this game needs. There are a few of the green and red alien pieces that are similar in build which is a bit of a nuisance, but a little painting will solve that.

I have played this both solo and with a group. It is chaotic and fun with the group and I prefer to play it as such. The group consists or my girlfriend and her sisters. They seemed to have enjoyed the game a lot. They prefer to play games such as Settlers of Catan and Ticket to Ride, so it was a lot different then what they are used to.

The game plays pretty smooth from what I have experienced. This is my first real-time board game, so I am now looking to expand that part of game collection.

[size=12][b]Why I like Project: ELITE[/b][/size]
+ I like how this game has more depth than other frantic dice rolling games.
+ I like how the miniatures are easy to identify because of the art on each card. On this note, ignore all of the doomsayers, the miniatures are not that bad.
+ The game has great replayability, especially with the expansions with various difficulty levels, scenarios, and different game experiences. 
+ I like the mechanics.
+ There are meaningful decisions to make (for a co-operative game).

[size=12][b]Fixable dislikes in regards to Project: ELITE:[/b][/size]
/ The game is somewhat hard to teach to new players who are unfamiliar with board games or real-time games. I recommend playing a practice first turn and making sure that everybody understands the rules. 
/ Some of the variable player powers seem significantly better than others. I think variants are needed to address this issue.
/ The timer is hard to keep track off. You can make custom audio clips or use the ones on BGG to address this complaint. 
/ The game has some errata that ought to be fixed. The errata is easy to fix.

The gameplay on this is second to none.  Hands down the best action board game on the market. The mini's are kinda blobby, but don't let that deter you. You will be glad they are so solid, because they will be tossed around and treated poorly.  These minis are tanks, and are designed for function over form.  You can still easily tell the enemies apart from one another, and i think that is the most important thing.... No most important is gameplay.. and WOW this gameplay is GREAT!

RATING: N/A
Project: ELITE is a co-operative, real-time, speed-dice, tactical, tower-defense-like game in which players roll dice with symbols as fast as they can allowing them to do various actions with their character on the game board. They move around shooting and cutting through waves of aliens blocking their advance while at the same time they try to complete objectives that will bring them to victory.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Despite the KS debacles (advertised high detail minis but minis were redone a second time to reach acceptable levels - still not level of Cool Mini Or Not AND hangups with shipping as well as poor communication) the game is quite enjoyable. The two minute dice rolling action round at real speed is quite interesting and you'd best plan ahead before going into that frantic action round...and be ready to cover for someone who's not having any luck with the dice. While we lost our first game due to a stupid mistake and unlucky die rolling which moved a fast alien into our stronghold, we were otherwise destroying the aliens easily and should have won easily at the medium level. 

Hoping that Artipia comes out with a solid campaign mode as promised.

I love how, as you are doing things in real time, the aliens are moving up as well.  No other real-time game does anything like that. 

I love how many miniatures I got.  There's tons of variety in the aliens.  Even though they aren't really high quality, it's still a great bang for your buck.

The only thing I'm worried about is extensibility.  I'm going to want new maps and new ways to play.  The four modes in the box are good/fine, but they are too similar to each other.

Also, the timer is really cheap.  Besides that though, the components are of good quality.  The cards have a very nice finish. 

Sometimes it seems annoying to just keep rolling the dice when you need something, if it takes like 10 times.

This game also plays very well solo.  I think it's my favorite solo game thus far.

If you are tired of waiting for your turn and if you don't look for a 10-minutes long paralyses-analyses decision making, this game is for you. In P:E, you don't try to find the optimal solution - you try to do your best as fast as possible, trying to co-op with your friends, fulfilling objectives and killing the never-ending waves of alliens.

If you like real-time pressure, get this game. For me 10/10.

I ran a demo table for Drawlab at Gen Con 2016 and had a great time with the game! Even though I taught/played (only a couple games had room for me but I did play) the game for 8 hours a day 3 days in a row I still played a few games with my personal copy at the con. Since I've introduced several of my friends and family members to it and I've not seen it go over poorly once! I've played a lot of this game and I still can't get enough! The one down side at the moment is that it's sold out currently and anyone who didn't back it on KS or get it at Gen Con or before will have to wait for a second printing. If you get a chance to try it, take it!

This is an action packed real time game that has a lot of my favorite things. Variable player powers, Real time, Cool items and upgradeable weapons, and enemies with abilities. 

The game is also extremely quick to play and the kickstarter all in pledge has given me a lot of content to add to the replayability.

This rating might change as the base game only has so much variation in the setup, but for now we're loving it. Real-time tower defence-like game of taking out waves of aliens (almost FPS video-game style), but with a fair amount of tactical decisions.

Only played it 2 player with my wife on easy, but each game it's come down to the wire on the last round and has always been exhilarating. I like that it's a real-time game, but gives you a break to gather yourself!

Oh, man, this game is the exact definition of fun. Sure, it's not deep, and there's no campaign or character development, but it is pure fun. I do have better games, but they do not achieve this fun level for sure.

The pace of a game is so insane, with everyone shouting, pushing, with their hands all over the map, that it is amazing to see how incredible the design is to make this all work. The rules are, at the same time, simple enough to have in your memory while your adrenaline floods you, and complex enough so it doesn't feel like a kid's game at all.

Still, this is a game for a few matches only. After three scenarios, I will always prefer something meatier (and calmer).

Also, the production value was bad. The minis ended-up ok, but, due to the complete lack of experience of the publisher in this area, they could've been so much better. Some still look like blobs of plastic; others have corners so pointy that you risk hurting yourself for real during the real-time parts.

RATING: 8
The aliens spawn. Plan who's going where, who's going to kill what, and which aliens will move first and in which direction - preferably into the kill zones you're about to set up. Then it's 2 minutes of furious dice-rolling to roll the moves you need to get into position and to roll what you need to fire off your weapons and then to roll to determine if you hit or not. And keep going for the next kill. And again. See how it ends up, and hopefully roll what you need to meet some of the game-win objectives along the way. Repeat over 8 rounds, with various events and boss monsters appearing in different rounds (depending on your difficulty level) to spice things up. There's definitely a learning curve on when to stop rolling (and when to re-start), and hectic communication is required to let people know what you require of them (especially re moving monsters into your kill zone, and not out of them). Fun game. It's a nice mix of co-op planning followed by fast-paced mayhem as you try to implement. It'll probably get a bit repetitive as each round is much the same as the previous, but there's plenty of learning curve to generate replay. It's probably really a 7 long-term, but coolness lurches it upwards to begin with.

Got the kickstarter version base game.  What a freaking surprise!  Yes, the minis do seem blobish, but if you paint them, it's all good.  But the gameplay just compensates for all of that.

A timed cooperative game that has two minute rounds where the players can act interspersed with untimed periods where the game fights back.

Absolutely spectacular game. Unique, requires strategy and planning, but at the same time dynamic with REAL TIME SIMULTANEOUS action phase.

I have no other game that brings 'feelings' like this game, anxiety, tactical and strategical decisions under stress, real cooperation without significant influence of superiority syndrome (no time for that). 

Tons of UNIQUE MINIATURES greatly enhance theme but even more importantly, playability as well. And they look GREAT(I'm definitely not among those complaining about details because I really think they are detailed enough).

And then there is that ALIENish, H.R. GIGERish style art which I think is also very nice and suits the theme perfectly.

I have truly great time with my kids as many other games are too slow for young players requiring action and influenced by action video games. Sometimes they even like this more than to play videogames which is really achievement in the field of boardgames. :-)

Plus, lots of options, variable setup including different maps and expansions grants more than solid replayability.

RATING: 10
One of my latest additions to my collection and already played more than most (if not more than any other). Why? Because it plays in 30 min and it is so smooth and fun and easy to setup that you just go for another one!
Kickstarted it along with the expansion (which I haven't bothered yet to use) and I am more than happy that I did! The new version of the minis are by no means "blobs of plastic", actually they are great. And we are talking about a decent amount of plastic here. Only people that were looking for "amazing highly detailed" ones should have complaints. The rest of the components are top quality. Hmmm, the timer could be better on a second thought.
Gameplay is great, the game is very tense. It is one of the games that manages to drag you in its world and you actually feel you are what you suppose to be! When the timer starts then it's you and the aliens, struggling to get to your goal! You live the game! And how many games can brag that they achieve that?
I give it a 10. I'll probably give it a 10 anyway, but I don't give a 2nd thought on that because there are people that can't see the difference between "I rate the game" and "I rate the company that made the game". Like other gamers care for your little pityful "revenge". Get on with it!
If you want a real time game in your collection, look no further! If you don't like aliens and hesitate, do not. I do not like aliens, that kind of sci-fi was never of my liking, but I have overenjoyed every bit of this game. Even the aliens part. Though you know what? I am thinking of a fantasy-world conversion with all those minis I got from Arcadia Quest or Myth. ;)

Big, dumb, fun, in a big, full, box.

I don't like real-time games and I generally despise randomness in my games. I should hate "Project ELITE" and I don't. I love it. It's great. This is a gamers of every ilk should play.

Gameplay-wise all you're doing is chucking dice, as fast as you can, to roll arbitrary symbols that mostly have the same effect. You're either moving your character, throwing an alien figure off the board, or plunking dice on an objective.

Mechanism-wise the entire game is designed only to slow you down. Once you roll your dice you have to study their symbols, decide what you can use, roll again, physically "load" them onto your weapon card, then grab other dice and roll to hit. 

For some dumb reason it works so well that the 2 minute rounds never feel long enough, yet you're relieved when the real-time phase ends and the alien's turn begins. 

And that's where the meat of this game is. There are so many aliens, with such myriad abilities, and every one affects the game differently.  You will discuss tactics and strategy between rounds as you flood the board with even more aliens. And then there are the Special aliens... And the Boss aliens... Even the MegaBoss aliens... 

It's tense, it's tactical, it's strategic, it's fun, and it doesn't overstay. 30 minutes is quite accurate, and I've never played "Project ELITE" just once when it hits the table.

Component quality is fine... Except for the models. They're atrocious. And inconsistent. They're comparable to dollar store Army Men. The MegaBosses in particular suffer. I've seen better quality plastic dinosaurs in toy stores for a fraction of what Artipia Games is asking.

Project elite is a very good game but could have been an amazing game with a bit more streamlining. Re-rolling dice to achieve a one in six chance of success can occasionally become an exercise in frustration rather than fun. Perhaps giving each character a suitably matched starting equipment and having a wildcard result on the action dice would help make the game a smoother experience. A bit of a flawed masterpiece. Looking forward to more games of this type.

I'm liking this game more and more the more that I play it.  It's exactly what I hoped it would be.  The game modes offer up a fair amount of replayability.  The Medium games that I've played so far all came down to the wire, so I'm looking forward to getting better and working up to hard games.  I love some of the interactions that can happen just from the way cards come out.  You might think everything is going well and then suddenly a spawn point grows legs and starts moving towards your base.  You don't want to spend time hunting it down so you try to wrap up your objectives and get out, but then that spawn point, now at your front door, is pumping out alien runners charging at you and suddenly you're running for you lives.

RATING: 7
Okay co-op with real-time action. Very hard and the gameplay was good. I like escape-like feel in the real-time phases and the weapon/item upgrades. However, the game was too swingy for me. I don't feel like it was fair that we went from almost winning to a total loss in one round just because we had a tiny streak of bad luck. I would much prefer seeing the game state deteriorate over a span of time into a hopeless situation than be blindsided by a sudden defeat that this game seems to distribute more often. Sure you can be under a lot of pressure and see the defeat coming as we saw once, but too often we, or at least I got completely blindsided going from a triumphant mood to total despair and cursing after suddenly losing. It was okay a few times but then it grew to irritate me.

Backed on KS.

Sci-fi real time Escape meets Doom. In contrast, Escape games are flat out real time dice action where Project Elite has real time dice chucking rounds followed by a downtime upkeep used to spawn monsters (perhaps a boss), update events, and give time for players to plan their next action phase. Depending on your mood, Escape is pure adrenaline chaos versus Project Elite allowing for strategy with control doses of chaos. Since it already reminds me of Doom, it would be super cool if they could add random terrain tiles to build more custom and scenario maps. I like the AI path arrows to channel monster movement. I'm yet to spectate a real time dice roller where the players do not accidentally cheat multiple times. And, still more often lose.

This is a great real time game where you have periods of 2 minutes where you rush to do as much as you can, and then the aliens go which isn't timed. I really enjoy that aspect because you don't have to worry about doing things that aren't for your benefit during the timed parts.

Yes the miniatures aren't great by any means, but once you're playing you don't really notice too much. You're just spazzing out trying to do things as fast as possible anyway that you don't have time to admire what the minis look like.

It's sad we'll never see the campaign mode most likely because of the harassment that many of the people involved in kickstarter performed on the designer, but I'll still hold out hope that one day he'll come back to it and it'll be great.

I played this broken game with some of my best gaming buds. Lots of fun but poops out fast. Minis are still super ugly. Nobody offer to take this off my hands unless you're willing to pay 100% what I paid for it. That's right, put your money where your mouth is (mic drops).

This is an amazing high intensity co-op game. The different scenarios all seems fairly similar but the different monsters, events and characters gives this game plenty of replay-ability.

Best filler game of 2015, it sets up in under 2 minutes (if everyone helps in less than a minute) and covers the dice rolling-real time game domain nicely. It does everything that Zombicide does only better with a decent amount of tactical and strategic thinking. It covers nicely the needs of those that enjoy fun games as well as heavy gamers (let them preplan the battle tactic and move the aliens). If it wasn't for the Discoveries I would easily say the game of this year.

I simply love this game!
(I don't care this much about the minis, got the game at Spiel in Essen, no Kickstarter)

The mechanisms in the game work great. It's not too long. Nearly no downtime!!!
The difficulties are well set. Easy can even be won with absolut beginners in the group (which makes it much less frustrating than other Coop-games) and when you get into it you change to medium or hard.

In my opinion the minis don't matter while playing the game. During the Action Phase you just throw them off the board to go on fulfilling your Mission anyway :D

I'll never give this game away!

Backed on KS for Essen Pickup.
The game seems nice and fun (played 3 rounds) but the price is too high for the quality of the miniatures included. They are really the most bad miniatures that I have ever seen!
I got a replacement for red miniatures but the details are the same.
For the moment I don't rate the game, first I want to see what's going on about the new miniatures that should be given to the backers.

I think that I would have liked much more to get some tokens with stand-up (like in Dead of Winter) and a much lower price (this is a filler!), anyway let's see if the new miniature (when the will come) will be good as promised.

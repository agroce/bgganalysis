Gorgeous card game. Is one of the best two players games in my collection! You only play five cards per round, but every decision is important, not only for you to win but also to keep your opponent from winning.

As elegant as the tea ceremony itself, Matcha's a game in which you are trying to put together the tea set by playing cards as closely as you can to those set up on the mats, basically betting off against the other player for those that you need. Lovely little game here, possibly even might appeal to non gamers.

I bought this having watched a short overview and the theme hooked me. However, it's not a particularly satisfying game. Winning the game by going for whisks seems to be easier to do than I had hoped from the rules read through. It is not satisfying to play just to block as it works to the detriment of both players.

The game works, and there are some neat bluffing elements, but didn't have much fun with this one.  The game end conditions seem like they cause the game to end too quickly, and don't give the players enough control.

Artwork and component are all really lovely. I though it'd be be fun for us to try a two-player only bluffing game, and maybe bluffing games just aren't my thing, but bluffing and verbally psyching your opponent out felt forced and unnecessary in our first few games. I also found it very easy to win without lying each time we played. However, we are both keen to play it again, and hope that the gameplay evolves a little with a few more plays.

What to say about Matcha... Its a delicious drink, but a mediocre game. To be completely honest though I got this game for free from a Kickstarter, so I didn't really expect much and that's pretty much what I got. While its not horrible, it leaves me with no desire to play it again.

Playing the game as just focusing on bidding results in a game that feels broken.  Someone wins without necessarily trying within two turns, or maybe even one, on white whisk mismatches.  It needs to be played more as a deduction game, trying to guess what the opponent is doing and particularly playing against white whisk mismatches.  So it is possible to play the game according to the rules but not get the intent ending up with playing a game that does not seem right.

Won this through Play to Win at U-Con in 2015.

SOLD IT! ($7)

Strike one: If you have a deck of cards and some random tokens, you already own the game. Proving the artwork and cool bits is the selling factor here. Strike two: Very little changes between each "mini game" and the game itself is extended by just repeating itself over and over (think Love Letter). Strike three: You can try to out think your opponent and count cards, but in the end winning with 4 of the whisks (gained by losing on purpose) can just make each round a coin flip. Midway through I just played cards at random and did just as well.

I give them props on a great theme and packaging (saving it from a 4 rating), but I can't see ever playing this one again over so many solid 2 player games. I'm also getting tired of the micro game genre.

After 2nd and 3rd play i like the game but i'm not quite as enthusiastic as i initially was. It felt a bit more mechanical and procedural than it was when we were learning the game for the first time. my suspicion is that if we play more we will come to find more depth and strategy.

I wanted to love this game. Blind buy based on the strength of Elevenses. Unfortunately, there is not enough depth here for anyone but casual gamers. Aesthetically, beautiful, so I gave it a 5. Easy rules. The problem is not enough unknown information, so you can (most likely) always play the optimal move quite easily until randomness and turn order pick a winner for you. 

I am NOT a card player, but I do like medium and heavy games. And for me the search tree for this game was trivial. My wife and I enjoy the mechanics and the aesthetics but we realized after a few plays that there are almost no meaningful decisions to be made in most games. This saddens us greatly.

The core issue is that normally there will be one or more guaranteed matches available to each player. If these are pursued without regard to the white whisks, then luck determines the winner, because there is NO BLOCKING these wins, so the only alternative is the white whisk non match.

We have not yet seen a game where both players could not compete equally for white whisks, while the most match winning player could also optimize their decision tree to match the majority of end of game tie breaker tokens, e.g. The most green, red, blue, yellow, or white tokens, in that ranking order. However, luck could disrupt the balance between the white whisk race and the end game tie breaker token majority.

The bluffing aspect was not enough to swing the game because often the non-guaranteed match win player will not have a matching card to even try to win a bluff, so that is a non-starter, and that player again feels helpless. Usually, one suit and one number had two or three members on the mats, so a player knows which matches are guaranteed wins for their hand. So the double-think bluffing is not prevalent enough to compensate for the luck of the draw. Even when bluffing is an option, the decision tree can still be optimized to win, because of the limited number of bluffing opportunities available. This is the core issue that must be fixed. 

I won't call the game broken, but it is extremely light, despite the beautiful illusion of depth. I may try a variant with only two rounds per set and four cards set aside, or perhaps keeping one card face down in the second and third round until those rounds are played, before I relegate this to the category of casual games where the player who makes a simple mistake first becomes the one to lose the game.

 - This is a strange little 2 player game, that feels more like an abstract game than a card game.
 - The first maybe 3-4 games I played of this, I thought it was okay, but not much more.
 - After a couple more, I started to uncovered its subtleties, and now quite like this little game.
 - Fortunately games can be very quick, so it's possible to get into the game properly in one session of half a dozen games or so.
 - This game really benefits from experienced players. Whether it's experience playing this game, or strategic abstracts such as Chess.
 - Like Hanamakoji, this game is all about playing the other player. If both players are on the level, it becomes much less about the cards you're dealt, which at first can seem very random, and more about countering your opponent.
 - Very small package, very little rules, great for travel. 
 - Would be handy if there were cards instead of little wooden pieces to make it easier to play when travelling, however these pieces look great on the table.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I almost picked this up a while ago because of the beautiful artwork and the fact that it was a quick playing 2p game, but eventually decided to pass on it. I enjoyed both plays and there is an interesting combination of a card counting and bluffing which keeps the game engaging in the short term. The artwork is beautiful and the highlight of the game for me. 

I do have two knocks against the game components and replay value. I respect the fact that they went with shaped pieces instead of colored cubes, but the pieces are tiny and the scale is completely off when they are compared to one another. Again this probably won't be an issue for most people, but it was a big part of the reason that I didn't buy the game. I also question the long term replay value of the game, there just isn't enough to going on to keep this game interesting after a few plays. I'd play again, but definitely won't be seeking out a copy.[/i]

Excellent components with all of the elegance in play promised by other commenters/reviewers. Our first game was under 15 minutes, and we both appreciated the opportunities for strategy in a design that prevents any chance of brain burn. 

Despite the speed, I didn't find Matcha compelling enough to play again right away (although an app might be), but this will be a pleasant choice to come back to regularly. 

I do wish the box was smaller; I understand trying to match all the game boxes in this line for aesthetic reasons, but our first copy plated badly in transit, and a tighter box would be more practical and even more thematic.

It was...alright, but I don't see myself getting excited about playing it.  I felt like getting a whisk was too easy, and you could collect four of them without much effort.  I loved the theme, but was hoping for theme to shine through in the mechanics of the game.  Not sure if I'll keep it as it is only 2 player, and my husband didn't care for it at all. (Mostly who I play 2 player games with!)

This seems like a light game and is easily approachable by non-gamers with the Japanese tea ceremony theme, but don't be fooled. For thinker gamers, this can be a burner. Each player can reasonably calculate what cards the other player is holding (2 cards are discarded at the start of the round to prevent a perfect calculation) and that can make for some quite deep gameplay. This is a great little game.

This two player game is a quick play but fun because of how you must think about what you opponent will play with their small hand of just five cards.

The game play is out of the ordinary but plays fine and competitive after you have a couple of plays.

Because it is a bit out of the ordinary the rule book can be a bit hard to grasp but I never rate my games based on the rule book.  The reason is, and I am quoting the "Pair Boys" (this is the name we call Shut up and Sit Down), the designer gives you an idea in the box.  It is your job to find it.

When you discover this hidden jewel you will enjoy the shimmer and quality.

Gift from Matt (Underpowered Secret Santa 2016)

Matcha is a 2P-only set collection and bluffing game. The game is composed of only 18 cards for play as well as five types of wooden components (all items needed to perform the tea ceremony). The game immediately ends when one player either gets one of each of the 5 types of components or gets 4 of one type of component. 

Though the rules are quite straight-forward, we both felt very involved when playing the game. Games can end quite suddenly, so it’s imperative to keep an eye on both your opponent’s collect components as well as the cards that are up for bid in the current round. The game rewards staying a step ahead of your opponent, especially since you’ll only be able to play to 5 out of 6 spots per round and unopposed cards win a corresponding component no matter what they were. We really enjoyed this one. Its small size and quick play-time will probably make it a go-to for a travel game for us.

I got this as an extra on the Kickstarter for the new edition of Medici, which I should have in August with any luck.

It's a small fun filler with an unusual theme (a Japanese tea ceremony) and pretty cards (of which there are only 18 used in actual gameplay, plus 8 "mat" cards for setting things on). Pleasant, but not really a lot to it.

Much cleaner CDG than I expected, no rules issues, plays relatively quickly. Chaotic situation with potentially 3 fronts developing over time. Battles are a high risk affair, as it should be for the period, thus luck plays a big role.

Too early to tell if there is a balance issue, Sertorians won my first ftf game mainly because of Republican's inexperience which made them commit Pompey to Spain early on as opposed to save him for the Lepidus affair in Italy.

Definitely worth replaying. About a long afternoon required for the campaign.

I've had this game collecting dust in my closet for a while, so I was very excited about finally getting the game going. We're only into the second turn and all sorts of rules issues have been cropping up. Seems like the designers just took their favorite parts from Hannibal:RvC, WiWa and a few other games, threw it all in a blender and sloshed it into a rule book. I haven't ever wanted to quit on a game this early in trying to learn it. Perhaps things will improve once we get some of these rules issues answered. We'll see. Right now I'd give this game a 4.

Edit: The game turned into a rout. We ended it early. Not sure a different hand of cards would have made much of a difference. If the Rome player rolls low for his reinforcements a couple of times in a row, he's just going to get run over. I'm very disappointed with this game as I really wanted it to work. It just doesn't. Traded.

Just acquired 5/2009.  Hope to get on the table this weekend!
So far, so good.  Interesting game topic.  I think that this game promotes the spreading out of military units more so than the normal CDG, but I could be wrong.  The raid and pacification rules are good ones for simulating the political struggle to control areas.  Combat system is interesting as well.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
UPDATE: I'm going to take a wild guess here and say that Scenario III, the campaign game, is the problem, and it's possible Scenario II actually works. The Crisis levels seem badly out of whack between the two scenarios, III starts with 25 stability points while II starts at -5, which means somehow the Republican player has managed to lose 30 stability points in 4 turns ... a virtual impossibility if you played the first 4 turns of III. II also takes the whole Lepdius wild card out of the game, something that is insanely swingy in III. Not sure why Lepidus' arrival is so totally random while Spartacus and Mithradates are strictly scheduled.

The battle card system is still in a ridiculous state though, and seems it could not have actually been playtested. That optional rule must be avoided like the plague, and that both Scenario III and the battle cards should be in such a sorry state does not bode well overall.

So, I'm keeping my rating at a 2 even though I definitely get the feeling that Scenarios II with the dice CRT might be better (by better I mean enough to bring my rating up to, say, a 4), just because Scenario III and the battle cards seem so obviously dysfunctional.
---
Wow. Just ... wow. It seems like if you're going to completely rip off Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage, you really ought to be able to do better than this.

Unless I'm missing something, the Crisis track is completely broken. There is simply no way the Sertorians can drive this down because the Republicans have so many provinces. The Romans should spend freely to bring in Pompieus, raise emergency legions, etc., because early on they have such a huge province edge Stability losses are meaningless. We played 5 turns before quitting, deciding either we were missing something huge or the game was dumb, and the Republicans had more Stability points than they started with.

And the Battle Card optional rule seems completely unplaytested. You hit the ceiling of 13 battle cards almost immediately, making force advantage rapidly completely irrelevant. Many generals have 0 tactical ratings and auto-lose when defending. Many more generals have tactical ratings on 1 and are almost worthless under the battle card system. Several battles we fought were lost when one player was dealt both double envelopments plus two reserves, which is an auto-win in three card plays. The whole thing was a disaster and I can't believe anyone would publish it.

This then leaves you with basically the same wholly unsatisfactory combat system used in Sword of Rome, in which you are basically unable to do anything interesting because combat is so coarse, so insensitive to player manipulation. This system was so widely found by players to be unsatisfactory, it's a wonder it was thought to be worth ripping off.

Then, to heap insult upon injury, in 5 turns I think we saw 3 cards played for events, and they were boring. Everything else was activations.

Anyway, first impressions were that this game is a complete mess. I'll go over the rules again one last time to see if there is anything here, but I doubt it (I did, there wasn't).

I really wanted to like this game.  HRvC is one of my favorite games of all time and this game is heavily based on it.  Plus I really like this period of history.  But the game seems to be heavily against the Republican player.  And the battle card system just doesn't work - use the dice based combat system.  A five rating is giving it the benefit of the doubt.

RATING: 9
Game has a good complexity of play. Played Secanrio 1 as a learning game and a full campaign in the second game. The opening seems to be obvious for the Sertorian to place PCs on the neutral tribal areas. The other would be the option to hit the legate in the south. However that might be a wasted move if Pompey comes in. The land grab at the start is important to enable more light units to come in later and force the Republican to spend time converting the spaces.

Concerned with some aspects of game-not sure how the Republic can suffer much stability hits at all!They have many more Provinces in the first 1-5 turns,so the stability will be high in this time. They can by extra Legions,retain good consuls,for no real downside.

I played this game 3 times. The Republicans lost every game. This game has several issues.

The fundamental issue appears to be the reinforcement schedule. While the Sertorians regularly receive reinforcements both at the end of the turn and through cards, the Republicans are limited to a die roll worth of steps at the end of the turn. This forces the Republican player to conserve force, but in doing so give up territory. Even with a fat stack of units, the Sertorians have better leaders, and heaven help the Republicans if they suffer a major route, then roll a 1 for reinforcements.

[EDIT: It appears that they've addressed this to some degree by making one of the optional rules part of the standard ruleset. However, there's still a major recruiting disparity IMO.]

The crisis track does not seem to have any real impact in the campaign game. Despite a fairly solid victory by the Sertorians in one full campaign game, they never got the crisis track below 5. Given that the Crisis Track is supposed to be a rather big focal point of the game, this feels like a major lapse in the game's overall design. Others have reported the same issue.

There's also one card in the deck that could end the game rather abruptly for the Republicans. Gamey tactics, like Sertorian suicide squads (lone Spanish light troops attacking in the hope of causing attrition to the Republicans) are another issue.

On top of all this, the designer's stubborn refusal to publish the rules online has forced players to dig through the forums looking for rules updates and clarifications, and there have been several. Good luck finding them all.

[EDIT: Apparently Compass realized this was a mistake and the rules are now available online.]

I really wanted to like this game. I'm a huge ancients fan and this game covers an interesting period of Roman history that is relatively uncovered by other games. There are some interesting concepts here, but on the whole there are just too many issues to ignore.

Traded.

RATING: 5
Very much rooted in Hannibal RvC with up to three bush fires in distinct theaters (Italy, Asia Minor and Spain). The various enemies all have different unit mixes while the Romans have consistent quality, but are penalized for too many levies at any one time.

Need more plays as this seems to be a significantly longer game than H:RvC with many chained event cards draw from a single deck. My guess is no two full campaigns will play the same. Shorter scenarios assume that history unfolds as documented leaving less to chance and demanding more focused play by each side.

RATING: 6
Good solid game. Anyone who enjoys Hannibal should give this game a try. Just think of it as an advanced version of Hannibal, with raiding, minor leaders, pacification and a crisis track. However, like Hannibal it has its teething problems. So play with the errata handy and avoid the battle card system until it is fixed. Fortunately, the game comes with a Sword of Rome type combat system that can take its place. In my opinion, the Republican forces have way too many zero tactical rated and one tactical rated generals to make the battle card system workable. Hannibal had only Varro and Longus to give you agita (2 out of 7 possible generals). The Republic’s forces in this game have a good 17 out of 25 generals that will guarantee you never obtain the initiative in battle or even survive a strong shouting match. That's just too big a burden for any army to carry.

Update: I dropped this game's rating from 8.5 to 6 on 2 more plays. The more I play this game, the more things I find troubling. I haven't decided how much is too much yet. But I really wanted to like it: it models a very interesting situation, it uses a tried-and-true system and it's a period of history that's never been gamed before. However, this game does have problems. I'd strongly suggest people play it a few times before buying it. In my opinion, it all boils down to not nearly enough development. For example: playing as the Republic I found the cards too restrictive and/or underpowered most of the time, but occasionally we'd come across one that is just devastating (Using card No. 37: Slave Army Enamored With Italy we marched the servile army to its death by taking control of it and forcing it to battle a larger Republican force more than 4 cities from a safe space. When Sparatcus lost his whole army was eliminated - the equivalent of finding tactical nuclear weapons); plus the combat system, the one that works, is too random; the Republic has such difficulties raising troops that it seems to unbalance the game and, in addition, it’s stuck with a pool of generals who all seem to have the same terrible characteristics; the crisis track, which seemed like a great idea, doesn't influence the game to any real extend (why not let it generate in-game rewards and punishments?), etc., etc.

We may try it again, because it does have some great ideas.

RATING: 8.3
Great game! A light ruleset (compared to many other CDGs) makes it easy for players to focus on the card plays without worrying about the rules. But there's a lot of depth here, with one front (Spain) at the beginning and 2 more (Asia Minor and Spartacus in Italy) opening later in the game, giving both players some additional considerations. This also increases replayability, since both players will need a few games to get a feel for what the new fronts will do to the balance of the game.

The combat system is simple, based on the Sword of Rome system, which favors the stronger army but can produce wacky results at any time. Fortunately, there are enough combat rolls that the odds should even out over the course of the game, and a few bad rolls are expected for both sides.

This is a great "gateway" game for new CDG players (due to the light ruleset and short play time). Highly recommended.

You really have to get down on your knees to realize this games full potential. By that I mean clearing up several minor things in the rules, and really getting used to the strategic situation and the potential flow of the cards. Then the highly dicey combat system can blow all your plans into the dust. But along the way there is great fun to be had with this game, if your in the right mood. The only real problem I see is that the game may be too difficult for the Republic to win, I recommend a kind of bidding mechanism to play the favored side (Sertorius and allies),

Much anticipated game on an interesting period of Roman history. Perhaps they should have named it Sertorius, or even Mithridates, but I guess many people would not recognize those names (there being no big Hollywood movies about them).

Hopefully a worthy addition to the canon, in the tradition of the excellent Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage.

So far only tried one partial game, which left us underimpressed.

This is an interesting and very playable game on some vital years in the late Republic when Sulla's reforms were nearly overturned.  I'm not sure if the game actually is loaded against Rome, but the one session I played made it feel that that could be the case.  Then again, that was partly because I as the Sertorian player won all but one of the battles.  Further plays in the coming months should clarify this.

Just one of those games that I wanted to love but it completely fell flat. Totally agree that the 'Crisis Track' is broken. It reminds me of that Supertramp album from the 70's "Crisis, What Crisis".

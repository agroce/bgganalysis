RATING: 9
Certainly a very common Australian/New Zealand game.  In the supermarkets, there are two types of cards, ordinary and 500.  However, the special deck is only used for 6-handed, and 6-handed games seem to be quite unusual.  
I have played many 5-handed games, and we much like following modification: The winner of the bid may not name the Joker, either bower, (as per usual) or any non-trump ace. The holder of the named card speaks up immediately.  
5-handed five hundred always is lighter, less serious than 4 or 6 handed.

Apparently our "National Game" here in Australia (whatever that means!).  A great game that most aussies seem to have played at some point.  I've mainly played two player (same as the three player game but with a dead hand) but the 4 player game shines.  Rating would be higher if I was more familiar with the 4-player game.

Own many 500 decks (with 11s, 12s and 13s for 6-player) mostly Queens Slipper which includes the Australian version of the rules. It is this set of rules which makes 500 more popular in Australia compared to other countries.

500's is a superb 4 or 6 player partnership trick taking game. Six years of Boarding school have given me more plays of this than any other game. Some people regard it as the national game of Australia - unfortunately no longer true as few people play card games any more - I see more Euchre being played in School Common Rooms now as it fits the lunchtime length better. I have read a number of older card books describing this as a good three player game (with a dummy). I have never had a chance to play this way to comment.

Very good trick-taking game.  The number of cards in the hand makes 500 much more complex than Euchre, which is otherwise similar in gameplay.

My favorite thing to do with a standard deck of playing cards. It's unfortunate that you HAVE to have four people, but for Euchre players, this is a natural step up. The deliberation caused by how much to bid coupled with the psychology of figuring out what other people have in their hands, added to the strategy of playing the right cards at the right time make this game an unparalled experience with a simple deck of cards.

Bridge without the pretence and very much the better for it. However, just 5 hands or so are needed to reach the target score of 500, so like Rubber Bridge luck of the deal is a major factor in determining the winners. Plays well in an informal context like a pub and adapts well for 3-5 players (the special 6 player deck is only worth getting if you regularly play this with 6 or Ninety-Nine with 5).

Card Game Trick-taking

RATING: 7
First played June 19th, 2008. Taught in 5min, played in 1hr for 3 players. For a standard deck card game, this plays very well for three players; not certain about more players as of yet. The bidding is competitive and the game has well balananced luck/strategy ratio. 7-A is used along with a joker. Joker is top trump or high card of decided suit in null or no trump hand. Each player is dealt 10 cards in 3,4,3 packs. The kitty is dealt 3 cards in the opening round. Each player starting with the dealer's left has one chance to bid a suit, no trump or nullo. Low bids are 6-Spades(40pts), 6-Clubs(60pts), 6-Diamonds(80pts), 6-Hearts(100pts), 6-No Trump(120pts). Bidding each subsequent additional card adds 100 pts. Example 8-Clubs(260pts). Nullo bid is worth 250pts (between 8 spades and clubs). Each player must bid higher than the previous or pass. The declarer may use any of the three kitty cards (hidden) and discards 3 cards. The declarer leads and a standard trick-taking round of 10 hands begins. The declarer gets their bid if they get they win the number of cards bid. If bid nullo, they must not take any tricks. If the declarer is set, they get negative their bid. The non-declarers get 10pts for each trick they take, plus 10pts for any the declarer takes in a nullo hand. The first to 500 points wins. If for some reason someone hits -500, they are immediatly out of the game. If you bid less that 150 and take all tricks you get 150. A variant is to play with left and right bar jacks as 2nd, 3rd highest card. I'd strongly recommend giving this game a try, especially since you can play with a standard deck of cards.

RATING: 8
500 is easily my favorite public domain card game, and while you can't really "own" a regular card game, I wanted it on my list to show how highly I rate it.

This is a trick-taking game most similar to Euchre or Bridge, but a lot more dynamic than those examples. I find many similar games can be very samey, going from one round to another until someone eventually hits the required score. But with 500 there is a lot more drama and shifting tension as positions change.

The game is played with two teams of two -- learning to signal and read your partner has a whole layer of enjoyment in itself. Together, teams will bid to be the scoring team for that round where achieving their bid will score points, but failure will cause them to lose that same number of points. This mechanic can lead to massive swings in position, a lot of come-from-behind scenarios and some surprise outcomes, making every game fun and unique.

As with most card games, luck of the draw plays a big part, so the real skill is learning how to capitalize on a really big hand and avoid conceding too much when your cards aren't so good. Bluffing also plays a part, like in cases where your cards aren't actually very strong, but you want to push your opponents into going for a bid you know they can't achieve.

The learning curve can be quite steep, especially if you are not familiar with trick taking games or concepts like trumps and following suit, so its best to have someone who knows the game teach you. If you get a chance to learn, I would highly recommend it.

(This game is popular in Australia and New Zealand, but not so much elsewhere. From what I've heard it may be similar to Rook.)

Combined with a strong emphasis on tactics at the expense of strategy, The evaluation skills required to play trick taking games escape me, and I'm not interested in pursuing them. I'd rather play [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/16632/gops]GOPS[/url] or any of it's reimplementations


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
My rating could be a little high, but I really like partnership trick takers.  

Very similar to Spades, with bridge style bidding however, and this could actually be a slight improvement, again HOWEVER, the scoring is missing the aspect where you get penalized for overbidding, something that I really like about Spades and I think 500 suffers for not having this (easy houserule)

UPDATE: 7 => 7.5 I’ve played many more games of this, and I REALLY like the bidding here, you find out what your partner has if they bid (or crap if they don’t presumably) and what opponents have in the first round of bidding, then everyone has to decide whether to up the ante or not by “staying” in the auction and trying to make more tricks thus making it harder on themselves, also once you pass you can not rebid so you do have to weight it carefully, even when partner is winning as you can pass and he gets outbid and may not rebid, its hard to gauge who has the better hand though of course. 

The pressure is on you to up the ante, otherwise you give the other team the reigns, and will likely come out with much less points.  With this in mind, I’m not sure I still miss the “bags” from Spades, as if everyone is bidding aggressively, which they should be, then just making the bid is rewarding enough and thus failing is also penalty enough.  Edit – Actually what is REALLY missing here is the bid of “Nil”, and a way to go alone other than trying to get no tricks, ah, haha, guess you can’t have it all…or can you.... Anyway really like this one, and might have to tweak it for my own groups

RATING: 7
Like Euchre, it's a fun social game. It is similar enough to Euchre that you can use some of the same strategies/tactics while playing out tricks, but the card distribution and bidding make the determination of trump play out quite differently. For normal bidding, you can open with a bid of 6 (or "mention" the suit/NT), but you need a minimum bid of 7 for the hand to be played.

I was taught a variant slightly different from any I saw when I did a quick perusal of a few rules sites. Almost all of the rules appear in one variant or another, but not all together.  We use a 45 card deck (plus Joker, minus 2s/3s) with a 5 card kitty. Maker gets the kitty and then leads after discarding. There are three special bids: Nello (i.e. nullo), for which you get partner's best in addition to the kitty and then play alone. Double Nello, which you can only call in response to your partner calling Nello--you get the kitty, your partner gets your discards, and everybody plays. Patent Nello, which you must play with the cards you are dealt--nobody gets the kitty--then you play alone. There is only one round of bidding. You win if your team gets to +500, you lose if you get to -1000. There are various other minor differences that I haven't noted.

I used to play this all the time with my grandmother when I was little.  We played the two player version which is deal three hands and leave one dead.  We usually played when my sister was in bed and my parents were out (or just weren't interested in playing).  I still have a school made deck somewhere that some friends and I made during physics class at school and played during class and lunchtimes.  Bridge players probably frown at 500 becuase of the Kitty and the random element that it introduces.  However you don't need years to master 500, so that makes it a much more accessible card game to the masses and children.  Also a big plus in 500 is you bid the number of tricks you want to or think you can take, not like bridge where you bid the number of tricks minus six.  I avoided Bridge for years because of that - my mistake in retrospect, but I still think it is a strange convention.

One of the great 4 player partnership card games, providing enough luck to be social and enough skill to reward the better players. As my Father always said, you can rely on their being an Ace and a Bower in the kitty. So bid it up. I've found it's more fun with house rules, such as allowing coming back in to bid after previously passing and no misere call allowed until there's a 7 call. Introduction of some basic bidding conventions using the 6 calls indicating Aces say and you get a consistently entertaining high hand-scoring game.

Nice simple trick-taking game. The Misere and Open Misere bids in particular are fun and interesting, both bidding them and defending.

Only tried this at three players. I suspect that the game is better at four. The bidding space is much smaller than it appears as winning 8-10 tricks in a three player game is on the verge of impossible.

The simplest trick taking game with considerable depth that I know of! Perfect game to learn how to count cards!

=====

Thinking about this game more, I think the auction needs more bids. Perhaps modifiers like winning the last trick with the lowest trump, declining to use the kitty, winning the majority of certain cards in tricks, etc?

Compared to Bridge, a hand size of 10 cards versus 13 is huge. There's a huge jump in difficulty from winning 7 tricks to winning 8. 

Or perhaps I should just play Skat :)

If my family gathers together for any period of time this game will be played.  There's plenty of luck and some skill to make it a good game.

National card game of Australia, and a favourite of both sides of my family for as long as I can remember. 500 is a development of Euchre (= 'joker'), which itself is a  development of Ecarte. So 500 is a contract plain trick game which sits happily between Euchre and Bridge. It's a gentler, more approachable Bridge, without such strict bidding.

See my review for more info:

Played again recently and upped my rating to 8. It would be a 9, but the play time varies unpredictably due to the weird scoring system (which is similar to Tichu).

I've now got a speciality 6P deck and am looking forward to checking out the 6P game... with people who know how to bid.

Prefer Skat or Doppelkopf with their more specific card and bidding valuations. This is kind of a "vanilla" trick taking game to me, but that might be because I grew up on it.

Just showing this one as owned so that it doesn't show up on Friendless' extended stats page for "Most Played Games You Don't Own."  ...And I do have a 6-handed 500 deck.

I've been playing card games for more many many years and I find this one the best by far! Playing with 11 12 and 13s for 5/6 players takes the card brain to another level.

Played endless hands of 500 in my life and is my favourite playing card game.
                                             
Discovered a good way to play 2 hand 500 which works very well and unexpectedly. This is a totally different class of game to Euchre and yet is 600 places below it in the rankings?

All Australians are brought up on cricket , vegemite and 500.

[300+ plays] Fun social cardgame, if not taken too seriously. This is one of the better trump taking card games for 2 teams of 2. The scoring system is a bit more complicated than most similar games, but the rules aren't.

Most recent plays at deercamp 2008.

RATING: 8
My favorite trick taking game with a standard deck of cards.  However, to make the game more challenging, we remove the joker from the deck and require the player to the left of the dealer to always lead.

These "house rules" make no trump calls more difficult (as you don't automatically get the lead and you can't rely on the joker to save you), but more satisfying.

Removing the joker also tends to create tighter and more tense games.

Really a solid bidding game.  It's a nice alternative to spades.  While over and undertricks don't really matter much in this one, the varying trump is a nice addition.  I think I also like that it appeals to my French Canadian roots.

The classic trick taking card game by which all others are judged.  It's still really good and I'm usually up for a game.  Be warned that I'm not going to ever let you win a bid on a six call unless you would otherwise win a nine call!

Aus trick favorite. Can drag.

For a more Bridge like game get everyone to follow some basic bidding conventions and the game deepens a bit more.

I love partnership games. This beats the crap out of Bridge for me because there is enough hidden information to let NGFs in and keep things spicy.

It's either Euchre on steroids or Bridge lite. Either way it's pretty good. The bidding system is goofy in two ways: 1) certain suits are more valuable than others when you make the same bid. That's so not elegant. 2) It's once around bidding which is not interesting; theres no downside to letting it go around as long as people want to raise. We let them come back in if they pass which also adds to the game.  As for why it's not ranked higher: there are any number of card games that compete for attention in this same niche: easy rules, interesting trick play 30-60 minutes, partnership etc. In the old days, this game probably rated an 8.

Nice card game.  Can be intense.  Skill will beat out luck most of the time. I'd only play this with people who refuse to learn new games and understand how to play this.  Not a bad game of these sorts, could do much worse.

A family tradition, and a game that stays entertaining every time I play it.  It's probably my favorite trick-taking game, but that's not as impressive as it sounds, as I'm not a big fan of the genre.  The game has some strange arcane rules that make it a little difficult for newbies to pick up, but it's still one I'll push for if I'm stuck somewhere with nothing other than a standard deck of cards.

A simple trick taking card game that uses a standard deck of playing cards . Each player is dealt ten cards, and bids to take 6-10 tricks with the help of cards in the kitty. With 4 or 6, it's usually played in partnership.

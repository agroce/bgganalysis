Warning! Not a 2 Player Game!!!
Misprint on box!

Now that's out of the way...

I am very fond of Black Spy when in the mood for a traditional card game. Based on Hearts, but with some variations, and allows for 3-6 players (something i really appreciate)

The added rule of being able to play numbers of the same kind is kind of a double edged sword for hearts players. It opens up the options for each player, but makes it harder to work out what each player currently has. 

Overall good game. Like to introduce to people who are fans of traditional card games.

A hearts-style game that I bought when it came out and it sat on the shelf for years, until a girlfriend wanted to try it out one night. We enjoyed it and played it a few times, but then it went back on the shelf again for many years.

It seems to play better with three and four players, with more it takes too long to get to 200 points.

Best for 4 players. 5 minutes to learn. 3 minutes to setup. 20 minutes to play a players game.

This game is a variant of "Hearts" with the cold war spy agent theme. I love the overall game play especially trick taking aspect. It is a great fun to guess how opponents would react on my lead. One thing I don't like about this game is the burden of scoring that at the end of each round I need to write down the score to track to overall score. That is annoying to me. Other than that, it is a very good game to play.

RATING: 6
A fairly average trick taking game, with no real twists to set it apart from the field.

The twists here are:

1) You must follow suit OR number.  So, if a red 3 is led, you must follow with either a red card OR a 3 if you have them.  You can only play off if you have neither.

2) All of the black cards are worth points (which are bad).  The black 7's are especially bad.  On the flip side, the colored 7's are negative points (which is good!).  You are trying to avoid taking tricks with points in them.

Overall, the game is fine and is solid as a trick taking game, but I just didn't find that it differentiated itself enough from the crowd to make me choose it over my favorites in the genre, but still a good game.

Played alot; one of Mom's fav games (she likes Hearts)

RATING: 6
The aim of the game is to score the least points possible, by either taking no black cards or all the black cards, in a way similar to Hearts, with the following exceptions: the worst card as far as points is the Black 7, of which there are 6. There is also 11 cards of each suit (barring black, which there are 16). All the black cards are worth points as well, going from 1 to 5, with the 7s being worth 10. All the other cards are worth 0 points, except for the other 3 7s which are worth -10 points. So, don't take those black 7s. Also, there is no trump suit and you can either follow the suit of the card that was lead or follow the rank of the card, which makes for some confusions sometimes. It also makes it much harder to track who's got what suit. The game is over as soon as one player's score is over the pre-established limit, which varies with the amount of players.  Oh, and don't forget to pass three cards either left or right, depending on the round. We did and it certainly would have made a difference.

Not sure how I feel about Black Spy. It is a fun trick taking game, but you seem to have little control over how a hand will go. It is very easy to be unable to lose control of the game (let someone else take the lead) since there are so many ways to not play in the asked for suit. Would play if someone asked to, but wouldn't be the one proposing it.

Enjoyable variation on Hearts with a 5th suit of point cards and a twist allowing the play of same suit or matching the lead card rank. Strategies require adjustments to standard Hearts trick-taking...seems like "shooting the moon" in this game is near impossible.

Additionally the scoring can throw you off at first, but you'll adjust.

Listless hearts variant. 

The multiple black spy cards somehow kills the drama that you get with the black Maria in hearts.

Pretty sweet hearts variant. The main differences are: 
1)You're allowed to play the suit or match the rank of the lead card.
2)There are SIX "Queen of Spades" type cards for lots of extra pain to go around.
3)The deck is five suits.

I enjoyed it. A nice change from Tichu.

Z-man's production is very nice, though the cards got dirty alarmingly fast.

Nice trick-taker which incorporates mechanics from many traditional games, but mainly Hearts.  I love Hearts so I am a bit biased - but I really like this game.  The fact that you can follow number as well as suit spices it up, and the inclusion of cards which deduct your harmful points are a nice twist.  Highly recommended, but not for 3 player groups - the game simply was not good with 3 which is not surprising considering this game is very similar to Hearts which is a strictly 4-player game.

Interesting Hearts variant.  We got the "points are bad" rule wrong in the first round of the first game, but the game got much more interesting when we got that right.  The "follow suit or follow rank" rule makes a bigger difference than it would seem at first.  There are five suits of 11 cards, with one suit bad, one card in each of the good suits worth negative points (everything else worth zero), and extra "really bad" cards in the bad suit to fill out the deck to 60 cards.

If you like Hearts, you're going to like Black Spy.  That being said, if you're at 3, 5 or 6 players, Black Spy would be your go to if you still want to play a "Hearts-like" game at a different player count.  You could even play it at 4 and have a great time.  I really like the spy cards, both in black and the other colors.  Those black spies destroy you, but it's nice that the other colored spies help you out.  Cool little game!

I have yet to see the light on this one. It seems way harder to shoot the moon in this version, which makes the game a little more dull. When we play Hearts, someone is usually trying every time, which makes it more exciting. 

It is kind of amusing how pasted on the theme is - for extra fun, complement someone on playing their "infiltrator". That said, I really like the idea of this line of games from Z-Man - the packaging and the artwork on the cards really make it look like a quality product. Too bad the coasters make it so that you can't close the box.

I like trick-taking games so this one is fun and interesting for me.  It is a misery trick-taking game that reminds me of Sticheln.  

I think the best theme for this is fantasy or Dungeons & Dragons.  Every player is a Hero/Heroine who starts out with 200 Hit Points.  There are Healers or healing potions (four 7 cards of each color suit) and there are monsters & undead (pain or misery suit) and mercenary heroes (worth zero).

I think a good variant (Suit Majorities) to be added is as follows:  At the end of the hand/round, if you collect the most of any colored (non-misery) suit then you are awarded +5 points for each suit you have plurality in.  Ties are not awarded.  If you collect the "7" of that suit with plurality, you are awarded an additional 5 points.

Black Spy is a twist on the traditional card game "Hearts".  The first player plays a card, each player after that must play either a card of the same suit/colour, or the same number as the card that was lead.  If they can't do that then they play another card of their choice.

The cards of the black suit have positive points.  The 7s of the other suits/colours are -5 points.  If you can capture all the black cards in a hand that player scores no points, and all other players score 60 points.

The game ends when a player reaches a predetermined number of points dependent upon the number of players.  At that point the player with the least number of points wins the game.

The cards are nice, with pictures of 1940's looking characters on them.  The spy theme is totally pasted on, and has nothing to do with gameplay.  There are a number of variants that diverge from the basic game described above.  The game itself is fast and fun though.  I play it at work constantly on lunch break, and it is a huge hit that is requested time and again.  Recommended.

I bought this largely out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised to find a solid trick-taking game.  Like Hearts but you can follow suit or rank and I feel the 5 suits and scoring mechanics trump it.  Plays well with 3 and although the box says it can play 6 my guess would be that the loss of control with more players would greatly hinder enjoyability.

Interesting hearts variant with five suits.  Black suit has six 7 spy cards, each of which is -10 points, other black cards -1 to -5.  Game played to 200, lowest score then wins.  Variant allows -75 to one's score, or +75 to others if all the black suit is captured.  Traded.

RATING: 7
Based on one play: A simple trick taking game, where the object is not to get points. As only the black cards are worth points, you just have to avoid those tricks. There is also no trump, so you simply have to follow suit or number, a variance that adds depth to the game. Easy for new players of the genre to learn and quite fun.

Interesting Hearts variant, but I think I just prefer Hearts.  You have more choices each trick, since it's not all about getting out of a suit because you can match the lead number, but because of that you have a lot less strategic control over the game - even if you know there are other players with a higher card in the suit you are leading, they can avoid taking the trick by matching the number.  This game is all about never winning a trick - trying to get the -5 cards is a trap.

I love trick taking games.  Black Spy isn't too bad as these games go, and the ability / necessity of playing numbers and not just suit can lead to very tactical trick plays.

I have one major issue with this however, and that is shooting the moon.  I realize that it should be very hard to accomplish this, but it should be possible.  I have a lot of experience with trick taking and tried to shoot the moon in my first game.  I came close, but I was playing other seasoned gamers and it wasn't terribly hard to wait me out.  I feel like trick takers should ahve this element or bid elements, so the lack of one and the questionable addition of the other has me feeling a little flat.

Still, its fine for the genre, and I would enjoy other plays.

Have owned this trick-taking card game for more than three decades, haven't played it more than a handful of times and not since the 1980's. Thankfully the art has been vastly improved from the cartoon spies in my version.

This is a good trick-taking game that's easy to learn, teach, and play.  I enjoy the actual game; it's pretty much a variation of the classic "Hearts" card game and uses 5 suits of (4 suits with 11 cards each and 1 suit with 16 cards).  The box cover image and card backs are quite nice, but the pictures on the cards are a bit cheesy.  This doesn't affect the game play, but does created a disjointed and amateur look and feel for the game.  The packaging was clearly not thought out very well; the box itself is about twice the size that it needs to be since this is just a single deck of cards.  A score pad is included, but it's quite obvious that it was an afterthought considering that it's too big to fit down in the space inside the insert and therefore sits on top causing the box lid not to go down all the way.  Also, there is no small pencil included even though there's a score pad and half the box is empty.  Why bother even including a score pad then?  The included coasters are unnecessary and just drive up the cost of the actual game.  Despite the over-sized box with plenty of room, the cards are only Bridge-sized (3.5" x 2.25") rather than the typical poker-sized (3.5" x 2.5") cards; not a big deal, but they could have used the regular-sized cards.  The game itself is good overall, but the large box size and coasters serve no purpose other than inflate the price of what should be game priced at less than $10.

A standard trick-taking game with a few unconventional rules. Players must match the suit led OR lay the same rank in another color...otherwise they can play any card at that point. The player with the fewest points wins- so points are bad in this game. Points only come from the black cards, with the black spies (#7) counting for 10 points. Some relief is available with the 4 colored spies...they subtract 5 points each. A little more strategic than the traditional trick taking game, so I will keep it in my cache.

2 plays.

This is basically a Hearts variant. The main changes are: being able to match suit OR number, variable point values for the pain suit, and different point card distribution. The suit/number thing is the biggest change, and you'd think it would be an interesting one. Actually, it is ... but it sure does make it harder to figure out what's going to be played! I enjoy this one, but not much more than basic Hearts; and I'm a bit tired of that as it is.

--- Summary ---
There are 5 suits, although the only one that matters is black. Suits go from 1-11 but there are 6 7s in black. Each hand starts with each player passing 3 cards (alternate left and right). Then, the player to the left of the dealer leads a card; players follow with a card of matching suit OR RANK (if no such cards in hand, may slough anything). The highest card in the led suit takes the trick and leads next.

At the end of the hand, score points for all black cards taken (1-5 each; 7s are worth 10), unless one player manages to take ALL the black cards; in that case, every other player gets 60(?) points. The deal passes left.

The game ends when any player has at least 200 points; the player with the FEWEST points wins.

Too much things to track, too hard to shoot the moon, too many options to play.

I really didn't enjoyed my 3 player game.  Maybe it's better with more, but It's too late.  I've been burned, I'll probably never play again.

Ok it's a little better with 4, but why would you play this over Tichu with 4...

Great trick-taking game. Clearly inspired by Hearts, but the rule to follow the led card by suit [i]or by value[/i] makes things quite different.

Unremarkable avoiding-tricks game. No trump; twist is that you follow suit or number. Ok, but bland. Would rather play Whist or Oh Hell.

One play, two rounds. Seems like a decent trick-taking game. Five suits, where only one color (black) and one number (all the sevens) give/take points. Rather fast, would like to try again a longer game in order to see how the random is balanced over several draws.

So close to Hearts, it'd hard to really say this is a Moon design. (Reminds me of how Richard Borg "designed" Liar's Dice...) But I would still rather play this than Hearts.

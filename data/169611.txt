I like the game and this is my favorite theme.  Still, it's a bit too simple of a concept to really want to play very often.  Good for when you are waiting for something and only want to play a game up to 5 minutes.

Simple rules, quick turns, a little bit of thinking and a bit of luck. Thats basicly this game. It's really fun and adictive :D
So I changed my rating from 8 to a 10 because the game is perfect. Each card is perfectly balanced and works soooo good.

RATING: 6
I have the sense of a dead horse being flogged here.  This is Love Letter with a couple of small tweaks that don't significantly change the play.  The original's theme of vying for the affections of a princess seemed to suit its light as candy floss game play rather better than The Hobbit.  Production and artwork are both good.

RATING: 6
You are hunting for the Arkenstone. A nice little game. Very fast, easy, (too) soon over. There is not that much of a challenge for the player, but it is nice to look at for any fans who have a couple of minutes to kill in a pleasant way.
Lovely velvet pouch, 17 really good quality cards, pretty gemstones that look almost genuine. 
Somehow one would wish there was a way to win only by getting one's little hobbit handses on the Arkenstone, not by being the last hobbit or dwarf standing or having accumulated 7 gemstones.

RATING: 9
They actually had a couple of new ides for the Hobbit version that give it a neat flavor: splitting the Baron into high and low comparisons, and adding a 0 card that gives you a tiebreaker at the end.  The 0 card doesn't really add much, but the split-Baron makes for a really fun addition to the game.

Perhaps slightly better than LL and all the editions, but it's still not a game I particularly enjoy, mainly because I find it too long for what it is.
What makes this edition slightly better than the others, is mainly the extra 0 card, and probably also the fact that the two 3 cards are slightly different; one compares lower cards, the other higher cards.
I bought it as I want to like LL, and I thought the extra twists might save it, but, alas, it's just too boring and long (again, for what it is).

Terry and Sandy bought this for me for my 50th Birthday, from Dragon's Den.  I had misplaced my original Love Letter game (which I have since found again).  It's a good Love Letter variant.  The main differences are the addition of a 0-value card, and splitting the abilities of the 3-value cards.  It works very well.

LOVE LETTER: THE HOBBIT
Ok I thought this was a stupid idea too, until I played it.  Even if you hated the Hobbit movies the photos on the cards should please any Tolkien fan.  The addition of 'the one ring card' and the slight change to the #3 card make a good game even better.

RATING: 7
Despite my initial "huh?" and subsequent "why?", this actually wasn't too bad.  It is 95% original Love Letter, with two versions of the Bishop, and a new 0 card that becomes a 7 at the end of game showdown.  Silly, but it worked fine, once you learned the new roles.

Good variant on the Love Letter mechanism.  It's only slightly different than the original game, with a 0 card and one of the 3's that wants lower rather than higher cards in the showdown.   I like it.   Not entirely thematic, but then again neither is LL.   I'd tend to pull out this version over the original.

Pretty much Love Letter 2.0 because it expands upon the basic game. The #3 card has to different versions now, one that makes the lower card lose and one that makes the higher card lose. They also added a 17th card which is #0 The One Ring. This plays even better than the original!

A día de hoy, la mejor implementación del sistema Lover Letter.
Solamente agregando el Anillo Único (0), y reemplazando uno de los Barones por Tauriel (aquel que tenga el número más alto queda eliminado), automáticamente la interacción entre las cartas se acentúa, dando lugar a un juego aún más estratégico.

RATING: 3
The 0 value card and the different 3s makes it different, but it's still the same game. I like the 0 value card, I don't like that you need to guess the specific 3. It's the only version of Love Letter that's actually different due to these cards, but I don't think that makes it better.

I have yet to play the Batman Loot letter however, if I had to pick my favorite of the LL's it would be this one.  There are two distinct cards that are big improvements from the base game.

I keep a copy in my car just in case.

I enjoy the theme but this is worse than the original due to how often you end up with 'impossible to win' cards, such as Tariel the 'highest value is out' and the Arkenstone in the same hand. The lose/lose makes it less fun than the original even if the theming is solid.

I have played the original love letter and this version and between the two I prefer this one just one bit better. Considering this game has only 17 cards it is a marvel how much fun can be had and how replayable it is. The most hilarious in-game experience is kicking oneself out of the round with Tauriel and Arkenstone! Very quick to play and learn and very portable (it basically fits in your pocket).

Great game just like love letter with a few new twist.

The big changes here are the split 3 power (one wins against lower numbers, the other against higher) and the "one ring" card (a 0 until the end of the game, when it then becomes an 8).  These change the game up enough that I will always play this over vanilla Love Letter.  The theme certainly helps.

A very basic game; easy to learn, and sometimes hilarious.

It does get repetitive quite quickly once you figure out the strategies, but we've had some ridiculous situations occur that made it worth playing (e.g. having both Tauriel and the Arkenstone in your opening two cards).

Jenn doesn't like it because of the simplicity, but for 15 minutes and as a filler, it's worth bringing out.

Just another reimplementation of Love Letter. Take it or leave it, nothing new, except of having a "low out" and a "high out" Baron now. This can get confusing at start.

Here's the dual value of this version: (1) the Hobbit characters may appeal much better to some than do the original version's princess and her frilly suitors, and (2) the additional card, the Ring (card number "0"), adds a strategic layer. Better than the original.

Basing this review on the ease and price of this game, it is absolutely brilliant.

It is so easy and fast and can be hysterical with 4-5 players. 

At first glance, people will most likely be underwhelmed by the game, but once you are really familiar with each card then strategy, pokerface and deduction skills definitely come into play.

One of my favourite filler games.

Prefer the artwork on the original Love Letter - but prefer the slight rule change in this edition. A classic/favourite.

I like this one a bit more than the original. Additional abilities: Turiel has you compare hands and the lowest wins, and the One Ring is a 0 but counts at 7 at the end. The gems are cooler than the red cubes.

Of all the themes, this theme makes the most sense for my family. We love LOTR, and Love Letter is a great game to play quickly.

Probably the game I've got the most bang for my buck from. The kids are big fans of the movies, so because they like playing Love Letter so much they were very enthusiastic to get this to the table. To my surprise I found myself enjoying it slightly more than the original game. The extra 0 Ring card and the two seperate elf (Baron) abilities just bump it up a notch in the deduction, outthinking and choice of what to play when areas. An excellent travel game that keeps hitting the table even when we're at home. More than 100 plays and we're still having a blast.
-------

Simple, quick and oh so much luck, but fun. There's some fun reading the moves others make and their faces to boot. A good travel game. Easily playable with kids as young as six. Easy to teach to infrequent gamers and we've had a lot of successful sessions introducing it to such players.

-------

The Pegasus German boxed edition is a thing of beauty. Double thickness cards that are 50% bigger than normal gives it a great feel for a micro card game. Add the heart shaped tokens and you feel like you're getting your money's worth.

With just one extra card and a few simple changes this version has freshened Love Letter up for me. No longer do you have to hate the baron when you can admire the lovely Tauriel as she comes to your rescue.

Re themes variant of the original game. Not really into the Hobbit etc, but has enough differenace to merit owning. 

Big issue with having the Arkenstone and Tauriel as it's an instant elimination... which has already come up at least once per game.

Great theme variant on Love Letter! This game introduces a zero-value card (the Ring) that counts as 7 only if the round ends with multiple players, and it changes the ability of one of the elves (barons) to force out the player with the higher card value instead of the lower value.

A good game with an even better theme!

RATING: 3
Not really my game, To play the full game it can take much longer then expected even if each round was 3 minutes (it's not) a full game with four is played to four jewels. So if every player happens to get three jewels it would take 40 minutes to play the game, which would take it well out of the filler range. we only played to three jewels but each round/shuffle and restart took easily 5 minutes. so our game was 45 minutes too long...

RATING: 8.5
The game is the same for the most part but they added a few twists that are quite nice. Legolas and Tauriel are now the "Baron" cards and operate differently from each other. There is also an additional card, The One Ring, which does nothing except that it acts as another "7" card after the deck runs out.

The Princess edition got me into this game, and thanks to the rethemed cards, I don't get strange awkward looks from the men when I take it out on a games night.  My SO who shows very little patience for complicated games adores this because he gets a jewel token at the end, and gets to yell "Arkenstone". Love it when my friends pout upon being called out. Entertaining and easy to teach.

I wasn't planning on buying this version of Love Letter, but it said "New twist on award-winning game" on the box, and I was just too curious. So I did buy it and indeed, there is one new card and the Baron is split with one card like the Baron kicking out the low card and one card of the same value kicking out the HIGH card! Love it, small change but one that does make the game feel differently. Stones are real pretty too ;-)

Another retheming of Love Letter. Doesn't offer too much in the way of changed mechanics, though there are some differences. If you know someone who isn't interested in princesses and love letters but likes LOTR then this would go well with them.

Picked this up for my daughter for helping out with a Soccer Camp.

Very similar to Love Letter, with a couple of minor changes. A quick, simple game to play. Daughter was very happy, so I'm very happy.

it's the same great game as basic LL, but with the Hobbit movie theme, a slight change to the "3" card and a zero card
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The change in 3 cards adds a neat element. In regular Love Letter, the 3 allows a player to compare hands with another player; the person with the lower card is out. In this version, one of the 3s eliminates the player with the lower card, and the other 3 eliminates the player with the higher card. 

I find the new 0 card to be essentially irrelevant, though. I may start removing it.

Simple card-based dungeon crawler.  Great idea and can be fun for those who like take-that mechanics.  The base game has a lot of randomness but there are several variant rules to help with this.  The rules are actually quite confusing, as indicated by the faqs and dozens of official rule variants needed. Also, despite good quality artwork, the game is quite cheap in terms of components (in fact, there are no components and players have to cut the cards to create a cheap mini to move around the dungeon).  Would have been better to make the game cost £5 more and put a bit more in the box.

RATING: 7
A nice pseudo-RPG dungeon crawl.  I really like the glory/peril mechanism.  The combat and test mechanisms are very easy to understand and follow.  A lot of give and take, particularly with opponents spending your peril, usually to play cards (monsters, traps and banes) against you.

Rulebook/pamphlet is a little difficult to follow.  Not organized in the clearest manner.  A little degenerative.  No real catch-up mechanisms.  Those lagging behind still accumulate quantities of peril, but are less equipped to handle them.  Very limited opportunities to heal.  Very dicey and random.  Can be unforgiving.

A very well done game.  Nice flavor and feel to it.  The take-that aspects can make the conclusion difficult, but that's in the nature of the genre so I'd say it comes with the territory.  I enjoyed this one and would like to play it again, though not too often or too soon.  Probably best with RPG-minded folks.

Only played once so far but I like the feel of the game and look forward to getting some expansions. The rule book is inadequate - why not some graphics showing what all of the symbols are? 
Despite that, it's fairly easy to grasp. My only real complaint is that there aren't enough map tiles - it is too easy to get to where you want to go most of the time.

Buy a MtG Jace vs Chandra Duel Deck instead - it's cheaper, a richer experience and fun.

Tactical and really lacking any great skill or challenge. This game and Arkham O The Horror turned me off looking for a fantasy experience/themed game. I love fantasy and rich themes, but after playing these games I just felt empty ... why bother. I guess they exceed my luck threshold, and that of the few people I tortured into playing with me.

RATING: 6
With people who are RPG fans, this game is a blast---a far better way to spend time than with Munchkin.  With people who aren't, however, this might fall through, though I have yet to try.  The game is not entirely bound up with RPG, but understanding those sorts of games helps to get into the mood and to understand what's expected of you. Unlike other adventure games, this has plenty of player interaction due to the dungeonlord cards you can sic on other people, and it's very portable.  Each of the expansions can be standalone, so the game remains portable!  On the other hand, the forementioned RPG barrier keeps this from landing on the table that often for me.

These days, I seem to prefer Descent much more, but Dungeoneer can't be beat for portability.  Not really an adventure game---it's a dungeon crawl where everyone plays the overlord once in a while.

I tried to like it but it did not work... I love dungeoncrawling and games like Dungeonquest, Heroquest and so on, but this one could not impress me... Maybe it is just because we played it wrong (The rulebook is a MESS!) but many mechanics just felt more complicated than they needed to be and too abstract for the theme of the game (For example: Why is a hero able to explore a new area of the dungeon while standing completely somewhere else? And many more things like this...

Very enjoyable dungeoncrawler where everybody gets to be the dungeonmaster and the hero all in once. The race elements and the abundant luck may scare of a lot of people. But the glory/peril system seems to even things out to a satisfactory level for me. Does not overstay it's welcome like so many fantasy level building games do.

Did not get enough plays out of this. Traded it away to give it a better home.

Played this twice now, and apart from the somewhat fiddly rules I enjoy the game. I think I will like it even more when I know the rules better, as it is now we spend a bit too much time looking at the rules which slow down the game. Very cheap, very portable, and quite fun dungeon crawl.

Update 080308: Lowered to 7. I still like the game, and there is no dungeon crawl that manages to fit this much game play into a short playing time, but it is too easy to lose to bad dice rolls. I like dice, but just 2-3 bad rolls could lose you the game, and that is a bit too harsh I tink.

RATING: 4
A great idea that doesn't always work. The cards are nicely done. There are a lot of things I really like about this game, but it definitely has some problems.

The real problem is that it is far too complex for a game that is supposed to be simple - there is just too much to keep track of.

If you only buy one Dungeoneer deck, buy this one - it is the most basic/generic of the lot.

After many attempts of eeking a good game out of this, I have given up. The game is just too unbalanced and complex for what it is.

I had originally rated this at a 9, but I've enjoyed it less and less on every play.  Some balance issues, rules could be clearer, the game can be brutally difficult at the beginning but too easy after a quest or two is solved.  Our group really wanted to like it, but just felt like something wasn't clicking.  Played it some with my daughter at home until I just couldn't do it anymore.  Eventually, I had to toss it when a cat puked on it.  Seriously.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Thought I wouldn't like this game - as on first play it feels like a total luckfest, luck of the dice, luck of the draw and problems of a runaway leader. But the optional rules make it great (3 action points rather than based on movement, stack the map deck or play with the map in play first, play with your own deck etc). Much quicker than other RPG-type games (like Descent) and more fun IMHO. Rating might change if/when I try the expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is the generic fantasy dungeon set (which isn't a bad thing) and I believe the first set, so there isn't anything too outrageous. If you like lots of undead, this is the set for you. If you don't care for undead so much, one of the other sets may be more to your liking.

RATING: 4
I've primarily played this solitaire and as a solitaire game, it is a light dungeon crawl.  I've played once two-player and that was more fun with lots of screw-you in it.  What bugs me the most about this, and prevents it from coming out more are (1) the limited # of locations that make the game feel a bit repetitive and (2) the need to find bits from other games to play.  These two limitations are offset by (1) expansions and (2) the ability to travel easily with it.  

Not my favorite but worth playing on occasion

I have to Say for a card game the mechanics behind this are great in theory, but a little sluggish  to play. but if your playing with experienced players this game is immense fun. Love the dungeon master mechanic where you generate the points other players get to spend against you.

RATING: 4
The artwork is brilliant, but cannot make up for what I consider to be a broken game.  The mechanics are rather unwieldy and uninteresting, and some of the rules and map cards are needlessly complicated seeing as all we're doing is rolling dice.  I enjoy a good dungeon crawler (GW's DungeonQuest, or Dungeon or Talisman or such), but this game takes much of the fun out of random encounters and exploration that those systems offer.  Combat, particularly, is frustrating and uninteresting.

I enjoyed this game.  I like the Glory / Peril rules; they're very reminiscent of the old ICE  Middle Earth: The Wizards  CCG.  Overall, good storytelling and strategy elements; it's certainly better than  Runebound ! On the other hand, it's not without its own flaws: principally, for a player elimination game, it takes far too long.  Our 4-player game lasted 3 hours and, for most of that, two of the players spent their entire game trying frantically to get healing.  Had they been knocked out of it early, they'd have been very pissed off waiting for the game to end ... not that they weren't annoyed at being on 1 HP for most of the game!

RATING: 6
Too long and too random.  It would be better played with separate boon/treasure and bane/encounter decks so that you have some control over what type of cards you draw.  Even so, there are still so many random elements that it feels like you are just along for the ride rather than making things happen.

3 players is the sweet spot.  2 players does not have enough peril available for interesting combinations and 4 players just takes way too long.

The box says 20-30 minutes per player but I've never finished a game that quickly unless it was a lucky blowout.  Most games last 45-60 minutes per player, which is too long for this king of game -- it gets boring.

I love the glory/peril mechanism, but everything else about the game is just average.

Oveall a fun dungeon crawl that scratches that old "ex-D&D player" itch...my major complaint is that once you start increasing levels the game becomes too easy (unless the other player has some kick a$$ encounters stashed away).  Good concepts, unfortunatley it's just not very engaging and very repetitive after a game or two.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Hmm..tough to rate. I enjoy the game, but (at least with two players) it has a runaway leader problem. Since you need to finish three quests to win, and finishing quests is the only way to gain levels, the winning player becomes more powerful and will likely continue to win.

That said, I've played six or seven games in the last two days and still enjoy it. We've started playing a variant with three global quests instead of two personal and one global. This reduces the luck factor a lot, since everyone needs the same map tiles. The game seems to work better with three players, though it's an elimination game, so early losers have nothing to do.

It was fun the first game or two while I was learning it, and the Peril mechanic that solves the "Screw the Guy in the Lead" is interesting. It's basically a shorter game of Talisman, but with individual turns that seem very long, possibly because each time I've played included new players learning the game. Still, it felt like one needed to be overly fussy to try to remember all the little, obvious things that need to be done each turn. Grab it for those that like Talisman and want to try something new.

Updated my rating after a few more plays - it is fun, but gets old after awhile, there's not enough variety in the basic deck to really hold long-term interest.  It's too fiddly for a filler and too lucky for a real adventure game.

RECOMANACIONS:
- El reglament és horrible i incomprensible. Descarregar aquest arxiu d'ajuda "cómo jugar a Dungeoneer": http://www.edgeent.com/v2/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=40&esem=4
- També recomanen (per millorar la immersió) substituir les figuretes de cartró per miniatures D&D
- Una cosa que molesta a cierta gente es que el azar se nota mucho en las cartas de misiones que coge cada personaje. Para mitigar esto un poco, lo que nosotros hacemos es que en lugar de dar 3 misiones secretas a cada personaje, ponemos 3 misiones boca arriba que son públicas y cualquiera puede intentar, y luego se da una secreta a cada personaje; igual que el reglamento original, el primero que cumpla 3 misiones, públicas o secretas, gana el juego.

(L'expansió La Guarida de los Dragones no és necessària, la qual és, a més, un joc independent. Aporta varietat per si jugues molt)

Isn't what I'd hoped for in a dungeon crawler.  This sounds idiotic, but I thought I could pay a lot less than Descent and get a similar experience.  Too tough to survive initial encounters.  I need more chrome, and this minimalist's dungeon wasn't right for me.  Could be better as a competitive take-that style of game, but I couldn't run it that way with my kids.  I'd hoped to house rule it into a cooperative game, and it didn't work well.

A dungeon hack game that works quite well.  The comes with around 100 cards, divided into Heros, Quests, Rooms and Encounters.  To win you must be the last alive, or the first to complete 3 quests.  As you roam the dungeon you accumulate Glory and Peril.  Glory lets you play good stuff on yourself.  Peril lets others play bad stuff on you - spending YOUR Peril.  Some great ideas in a very elegant package, but still rather chaotic and Talisman-esque.  Interesting to see where this game goes with expansions.

A great value, but certainly not the ultimate dungeon crawl (whatever that is). Still, pretty impessive that a card game can pull off everything it does. Runaway leader can be a major problem in 2 player games. There are a lot of interesting ideas here... not necessarily unique, but combined in a way that's never been done before (and especially so for a card game). Thomas Denmark, who both designed and illustrated the game, is a force to be reckoned with!

A portable dungeon crawl with reasonable game length and beautifully artwork. I used Dungeons & Dragons miniatures instead of the paper figures & glass beads as tokens which added some to the visual. 

I like nthe fact that all players act as DungeonMaster and the high screw-you factor. But combat is unengaging and once a person takes the lead he has pretty much won the game atleast in the two player variant. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A well produced and interesting little game which uses some ideas of CCG's (the peril/glory tokens for example), without being annoyingly collectible. It will be very interesting what the future expansions will bring, but it seems that this is a good solid concept that should enjoy a long gaming life. The artwork is very atmospheric and the layout of the cards is convincing. Right now the luck factor is very high, but this might change when "building decks".

RATING: 7
Played once. Fun game, best played by pre-building the dungeon (although you lose some of the 'exploration' aspect if you do this). Otherwise, a player can get lucky with card draws. The rules are definately written with a CCG mentality, which makes them a little obtuse. Even has a cooperative variant, where it's a group of players against a single player (the 'Dungeonlord').

There are several nifty mechanics in this card-based dungeon crawler. One of the most interesting is that Dungeoneer doesn't require a GM. Instead, at the start of each player's turn, he or she plays monsters and "bane" cards on other heroes. 

How this is done is the second great thing about Dungeoneer: as you move through the dungeon you collect both Glory (which can be used to pay for treasures, boons and the like) and Peril. The trick with Peril tokens is that they are used by [b]other[/b] players to attack you with monsters. The more Peril you have, the more powerful the monsters you're going to run into (courtesy of the other players).Playing monsters on someone uses up their Peril, however. It's a brilliant balancing technique: if you don't have a lot of Peril accumulated, you can't be attacked with a huge monster. This helps keep the game tense; it's very difficult to run away with the lead since you've very likely put yourself in greater danger by doing so. 

On the downside, gameplay can be a bit random. Each player has to complete three quests (drawn randomly from a quest deck), but their difficulty can vary. And since each quest usually requires you to travel to a specific location before attempting to complete it, you're out of luck if that particular map card hasn't been played yet.

Dungeoneer also has a bit of a learning curve, mostly due to some unintuitive card symbols and some difficult-to-read rules. Once you get the hang of the game, though, the entire thing should take about an hour or so with four players. There is also a fair amount of downtime since each player has to GM, move, buy cards, battle monsters, and try to complete quests. But that's to be expected with a dungeon crawler.

And I can't forget to mention that Dungeoneer has really nice artwork--even though it's standard fantasy-based stuff, the art isn't bland at all; it's quite creepy and evocative of an unknown dungeon filled with various treasures and horrors.

It's possible to combine different sets with each other to create mega games, but I've never had any interest in doing that. Each setting has a distinct flavor, and I'm quite happy doing standalone dungeon crawls.

A fast and simple, yet fun card game that mimics the traditional dungeon crawl.

Played this last night and it feels like it needs the expansions. The dungeon deck and the quest deck are a little small for a four player game and all the monster being of the same few types makes some items very powerful.

I quite like this game, similar to Talisman but a card game. Can be rather frustrating, particularly if none of your quests match the map cards (we had one player hang about until the last 2 turns before his map cards came up), probably would be better with some house rules and expansions. Having face up Quest cards seems odd.

Buying additional decks might help and make the game more interesting though.

I like fantasy-themed games and dungeon crawls, and this is a CCG-esque crawl game with all the trimmings: levelling up, fighting nasties, surviving room challenges, fufilling quests, getting cool stuff.

Interesting "bank" mechanic of acquiring peril - an evil "currency" of sorts which is deposited into your account when encountering map locations and are withdrawn by other players so they can sic creature cards/curses/etc. on you (this sets it apart from lots of other crawl games with zero player interaction).  

Games like this are all about the theme and the lite-RPG feel - you either like it or you don't.  What I dislike is the rules - in all it's incarnations, they've been aggressively non-intuitive and difficult to read or parse for rules-questions and the like.  

The first edition (pre-Atlas) was shelved after one grueling play based on our misunderstanding and frustration of the rules, which still haven't really improved much.  The rating of "6" reflects this, as well as it's pace.  Hard to quantify, but there's kind of a high "more-fiddly-than-it-should-for-what's-going-on-in-the-game" factor.  Having said all that, I love this game.

Played twice. The rules were a bit vague. The encounters were taking a very long time on each persons turn, so by consensus we stopped doing them in the first game. The game staggered on until someone finally got the dice rolls needed to put us out of our misery. Played a bit more strictly the second time, the encounters were still dull. The game seems broken, the glory/peril didn&#039;t seem to work, there was never any life or death tension, just some movement, some dice rolls and &#039;oh I&#039;ve won&#039; now. So, it was boring and I&#039;ll not willingly bring it out again unless a real enthusiast insists.

2-4 players.  I really like the Dungeoneer games as a 2-player RPG.  House/custom rules make it even better.

See http://www.fantasticdiversions.com/2010/10/shackling-demigods.html  for a way to deal with Peril...

[q]At the beginning of any turn, before the current player takes action, any player holding a Peril-type card may play it face down atop the Peril Stack. If during the current player’s turn, its character’s Peril points total changes in any way (up and/or down) at any time, it must immediately draw the top card if there are any cards on the Peril Stack. 
If the character does not have enough Peril points to pay the card’s cost, that card is place facedown on the bottom of the Peril stack. All Peril cards once played will remain in the stack until resolved by a character. 
If the character does have enough Peril points to pay the card’s cost, it does so immediately and resolves the Peril card. Once a Peril card is resolved, if it cannot be kept for some benefit, it is placed face up next to the Peril Stack in a discard pile for potential later use.[/q]

Some problems with the rules, but a few house rules sorted them out. I mostly play this with the epic expansion or another dungeoneer deck, though the latter requires even more house rules..

Decent fantasy game in which you level up your character, gather equipment and skills, face monsters and complete quests.

It's not an overly long game and aimed mainly at delivering fun.
The mechanics is not sophisticated, but gets the job done.

I wouldn't recommend joining different parts of the Dungeoneer series as the game would be too long and random (you can mix adventure cards for more variety, but not map/mission cards).

EDIT: The first and the best entry in the whole 'Dungeoneer' series.

Sold.

RATING: 5
This CAN be a fun little dungeon crawl depending on what you expect, how you play and who and how many players there are. Not sure why anyone not liking RPG would even try this.

We implemented some house rules first game that worked great! Played with 2 people the double deck starter, 2 characters each instead of one, 5 quests to win instead of 3. This eliminated waiting for quests as there were more of them and allowed characters to level up more. Yes the rules are kinda broken, yes there is dice and some luck(which RPG doesn't have dice....), yes a few more map cards would be nice but expansions will fix that and yep there is a little bit too much upkeep maybe, but underneath all that is a good little game for your money.

Scratches the RPG itch nicely with no DM needed and was fun to play once we downloaded a TURN summary. Turn actions do seem somewhat unintuitive and not smooth which is the biggest knock on the game IMO. More than 3 people would be big downtime I suspect. Some great artwork I think and we liked the exploring aspect of the game, for those that think it's too random, build the dungeon first, some say this adds more strategy. 

Update: game feels too convoluted for what it is dropping desire to play, down slightly again to 5.75. Still a good little crawl but the turn action order just seems off and could use an overhaul

I don't know about this game.  In theory, I like it - dungeon trappings, reasonable flavor, plays pretty quick.  But, the mechanics for playing monsters on one another seem artificial to me, and the character arc seems really truncated.

2nd edition. A fast and fun game, relatively easy to pick up, and quick if you don't have that much time (can be played in 1 hour). The rules were initially a little difficult to get through, but with help from the "How to play" (http://www.atlas-games.com/pdf_storage/HowtoPlayDgr.pdf). 
Excellent artwork. The most portable dungeoncrawler. They didn't give enough counters, dices and plastic miniatures though. I have the spanish version called Dungeoneer: La Tumba de Lord Liche (Edge Entertainment).

RATING: 4
A real yawner.  I would not recommend it for 2 players.  (Or 3 to 4 for that matter.)  So far though my reaction is similar to the one I had when playing Talisman, a feeling of being trapped in a dice driven game that was trying to entertain me but was failing.  Slow to develop with just two players, it quickly becomes a contest to see who can kill off the other with Encounters first.  Woe to the Warrior who fails to draw any supplemental Magic skill since so many of the Encounters, especially the more powerful ones, utilyze Magic attacks.  Get a couple of them early on and you can quickly beat that dwarf into submission.  Too much fiddling with cards and counters, and zero roleplaying.  Had much more fun playing Piratenbucht and going "argh, ye thievin' pirate!"...  It was somewhat better with 4 players (played x3), but game still seemed too fiddly and too long for the low level of decision-making and mild amount of fun derived from it.  And there were a couple of gamers with a long, rich backgrounds in rpg's playing who I thought might really get a kick out of this game but it was a concensus "5", might play it again if someone else wants to but feel the time could be better spent playing a good European board game. In fact we went on to play Keythedral for the first time and Pampas Railways, both of which we all enjoyed immensely. I have to recommend you play this before you buy it.  It is good for what it is; the Glory/Peril system is an excellent concept that virtually eliminates that bring down the leader problem that can plague games like this.  It just didn't live up to all the hype this page is giving it.

When it comes to dungeonbashing, this is the best of the pack. The best comparision I can give, is blending Dragon Quest with cardgames like Vampire or Werewolf. You have a hero, equip and level him while walking through a dungeon created during play. To win the game you must solve 3 quests, drawn random each game. The cards are beautifully drawn, and often with a humourus comment that brings out laughter during the game. The game only grows in fun when expansions are added. One of my favorites of all time.

Sadly I cannot recommend this game.  Adventure board games need to tackle four questions, and Dungeoneer falls on all:

1.  Where do the monsters come from?  Randomly plopping monsters onto people is a not good game mechanic - theme-wise or gameplay wise.  Monsters should come from 'somewhere'.

2.  Player interaction.  This is a BIG problem with adventure games.  There are three options:  players compete as individuals - like Return Of The Heroes - which makes it multiplayer solitaire (this is not inherently a bad thing but the rest of the game needs to be VERY strong to make up for it);  players work together - like Arkham Horror - with all of the co-op game strengths and weaknesses;  players compete directly against each other - which as far as I know has not been tried seriously.  Dungeoneer is multiplayer solitaire.  The only interaction is making monsters appear from nowhere to attack someone - whoopeee!

3.  Combat system.  As far as I know, adventure board games have NEVER come up with a good combat system (WoW:TBG is the best), and most simply have dull dice rolling with modifiers.  Someone needs to come up with a combat system where you actually 'feel' like you are fighting!  Dungeoneer has a simplistic one dice combat.  Bleah.

4.  Downtime.  What do the other players do when it is not their turn?  Nothing.  That stinks.

So, I have to give Dungeoneer zero out of four on the criteria.  That said, most adventure board games suffer from the same problems.  Dungeoneer is most fun when it plays fast and people get on with it.  If it drags then it is pretty dull - the problem is that this happens most of the time.

A dungeon hack game that is solely composed of cards. The dungeon is randomly created and players compete to be the first to complete 3 quests. This game uses an interesting mechanic to keep players on an even footing. Peril and glory are gained for moving and other actions. Peril is used by opposing players to hurt you and glory is used by yourself to gain equipment and spells/effects. There is a little downtime between turns, but the game is enjoyable. There is player decent player interaction as well. This game comes in a very small package, but lacks some components (dice and tokens).

Dungeoneer is a dungeon crawler with some very innovative ideas. In an attempt of removing the need of a game master and without recurring to random encounters, players not only build the dungeon as they are exploring it but also amass peril points. Said points can be spent by the other players to lay traps, summon monsters and so forth.

The basic premise of Dungeoneer is simple: pick your adventure, wander around the dungeon, defeat monsters, complete quests and level up. The idea of everybody being the game master, as everyone has the potential of setting up encounters and building the dungeon is cool but, in practice, doesn't work very well. Why? Because encounters are designed to be defeated quite easily, even the hard ones, so you really can't slow down your opponents nor affect them dramatically. What does that mean? That a pile of random encounters would have done the exact same job, so we have that the strongest and more innovative element of the game is, indeed, quite forgettable.

I would have loved like this one but I can't. The superfluousness of encounters makes games extremely repetitive and boring. Maybe adding other Dungeoneer titles to the mix might work, but the life span of the original is reduced to two or three games, not to mention that for the prize of two Dungeoneers you can buy a good dungeon crawler or a freakin' good one for the prize of three. So we have that the good & cheap dungeon crawler isn't really good and trying to make it better neglects the cheap factor. Result? Better aim for something else as, in the long run, it will a better investment.

Call of the Lich Lord is a two- to four-player Dungeoneer card game. Your character explores a dungeon that you build with map cards, while fighting monsters, completing quests, and leveling up along the way. Each Dungeoneer set can be played as a stand-alone card game, or combined with other decks for more dungeon-delving fun. Call of the Lich Lord is the first Epic set for Dungeoneer, which lets you advance your favorite heroes from previous sets to higher levels, or play just with the new characters from this set who begin at 4th level!

It took us a while to get over the rules and then we found the gameplay to be very random and luck-filled, which overwhelmed the hand management aspect of the game.  Since you build the dungeon as you go by just drawing cards, I got lucky as my destinations were drawn and I was able to complete my quests very quickly.  In contrast, my wife was able to really bulk up her character, but since her required map cards weren't drawn yet, she just couldn't complete any quests and there really wasn't anything that she could do about it.  I've seen some  variants where you build the whole dungeon in the beginning to avoid this type of problem, so maybe we'll try that, but there are also other unbalanced issues such as some quests being significantly easier than the others or some being just a lucky/unlucky roll of a die.  We may try this again or its sequel [thing=8207][/thing], but it may be a while.

Despite that, it did give us one of our more memorable sessions, particularly as our faithful kitty friend of many years has been very sick and doesn't have a lot of time left:

Dungeoneer is still one of my favourite RPG dungeon crawls, with plenty of interaction. It can be played 2 players or more but the more the merrier.More perilous I should say, as each play can send Monsters at your Hero.

The above comment was made a couple of years ago when I didn't mind a bit more luck. My tastes have changed and as such I find my self drawn to Euros with little to  no luck.

This Game is very dependent upon dice rolls and takes a very long time to play.

Interesting mechanics, but would gain significant appeal with the addition of an actual board or tiles.  Many alternate titles with similar feel, yet better components.  Inexpensive, relatively quick-playing dungeon crawler that may rely too much on drawing the one specific card needed.

In Dungeoneer', you take up the mantle of a great Hero set out to prove your valor in the Tomb of the Lich Lord. To triumph over your rivals, you will need to explore the labyrinth of corridors, defeat the heinous monsters, overcome nefarious traps and be the first to complete all your Quests. But beware, the gods are fickle and to test their Heroes even further, they often bestow upon them Banes as well as Boons.

RATING: 8
Beautiful cards, but the elegant Glory/Peril mechanism is a bit muddied by a lot of fiddly rules (i.e. 5 or six quest types for a total of 16 quests in the game). Nevertheless, the first games have been a lot of fun, and I think that there is actually quite a lot of strategy beyond the very nice veneer.
Played 5 times.

Good... my opinion of it is worsening slightly as time goes on.  It seems a little less balanced every game. The quest to kill the assassin is extremely easy, for instance, as a last quest.  We always lay the board out ahead of time, however, so maybe that's a problem.

I owned this game and traded it away.

The art work of Dungeoneer is gorgeous, the gameplay reads fine but once I started to play there wasn't much I could do to influence where the quest rooms popped up; leading to games where the lucky won, not the best player.

There is a good game in there trying to break out but I'm not going to hang onto this game until the rules are cleaned up enough to show all its brilliance

Good and, most importantly, FAST dungeon crawl. I think, however, that characters are too weak at the start. It's hard to accomlish anything if your best attribute is a 1, especially if you face the lich lord himself. I own a Polish version.

RATING: 6
Fun game, though I feel like players rack up threat too quickly just by moving.  Other players may not have cheap monsters, then after a room or two play something giant and kill off the character.  Otherwise, great concept, right price, right size.

Note: I think a good variant would be to put a penny on each room as it comes out.  If you enter, take it off.  Players do not gain threat by moving into rooms that don't have pennies.

I really wanted to like this game, since the concept and artwork are fantastic. However, the rulebook (2nd edition) is the most ambigiously written collection of intentions I have seen in a long time. The "official" FAQ at the Atlas Games site does not correspond with the FAQ at the Yahoo-group, and the Yahoo-group itself covers 1600 questions alone(mostly about gameplay). In addition ,there is also the ATlas Games forum, AND an official "how to play the game" sheet.

Decent dungeon-crawl, but in the three or four times I've played, the draw of the map cards played an enormous role in determining the winner. I have not yet tried the tournament rules which supposedly alleviate this problem. 

The glory and peril system is probably the coolest and most unique feature that sets it apart from other dungeon crawlers (or Talisman and the like).

Intriguing dungeon-crawl style game played with cards. We sort of liked it, but there are many other games in the same vein that we play more. I like the exploration portion of the game, BUT the randomness of the layout can lend itself to losing the game through no fault of your own. If you do the layout before the game begins, it would remove that element, but I like the exploration element. That conundrum is mostly what keeps us from pulling out the game more often.

RATING: 4
It has very good ideas, like the Peril system that will prevent your enemies joining their forces against you and makes the time between turns much more bearable.

But it has 2 big issues:
·) Missions can be very easy or impossible to complete: you cannot complete them until the location card appears, and that might not happen before the game is over. There's a common mission, but it doesn't solve a lot, because it can be impossible to. The problem is not luck deciding who the winner is, the problem is that knowing since midgame that you're not going to win and having no goal is not nearly as fun.
·) Extreme characters (all Magic or all Melee) are very weak against opposite enemies. An all Magic character will be unable to defeat a powerful Melee creature; since undefeated creatures can be saved, this creature will do 1-2 damage per turn to that player. This can be very frustrating.

All this creates a very random game, which is not a problem per se, because dungeon games MUST have some randomness. But they should also have other qualities that make them appealing (ie: strategy/tactic, decisions with visible consequences, a push your luck element, etc.). But Dungeoneer has none of this.

This is a lightish dungeon crawler game.  I have played three times - first game was 4 players, lasted about 2.5 hours, including reviewing the rules together.  The second game was the same 4 players, used the "campaign variant" and lasted 3 hours.  Dungeoneer involves a lot of luck, but since the players play the monsters/encounters on each other there is more player choice/strategy involved than say Talisman.  Still, not enough for a gamer.

The rules were a little more work to learn than I expected - several ambiguities and some unanswered questions - the rule book should be revised (I played the 2nd edition).  If you love fantasy/adventure theme, get it.  If you could care less about theme, avoid the game - there isn't a lot of strategy or depth to this one and the rules will make you pull your hair out at times.

It was a fun game but I felt it was very unbalanced. Most of the monsters were undead and then one person get the hero to control undead buy using this good points.  Well the rest of the game we had to kill his good points before we could even attack him.  Between that and a getting something to increase his movement he just ran right over us and kept entering rooms and the parel meant nothing to him. Maybe it was just me. There were only 2 guys you could have that had magic mine was not one of them and it every monster that attacked had a magic attack and there was nothing I could do. I had a one time gained a lv and got some   to my magic but that was taken a way with in the next turn making it just a matter of time.

The original set of Dungeonner is very nice adventure game and probably the best set of the serie. It has the least goofy cards and boring counting modifiers. I like Tomb of the Lichlord because of the very thematic setting (classic dungeon), rather serious characters and quite fast gameplay (comparing to other sets). After dozens of plays it seems to have well balanced adventure cards. 
I love adventure board games so why not to rate this game 10? First of all it has to much downtime and only little serious strategy (choises are rather obvious). Because the gameplay doesn`t last to long I enjoy playing Dungeoneer from time to time... but mostly as a solo or 3-players game. As a 2-players game it`s rather dull and to random. As a 4-players game it has to much downtime.

The best dungeon-crawler for trips with limited space (like backpacking).

Who can play?  Uber-geeks.  2-4 players.

Take a classic role playing game like D&D or WFRP and remove the role-playing and math.  Put everything on a bunch of cards that you can randomly draw.  You have a varied, modular dungeon crawl with all of the fantasy and questing, a bit of character building, a chance for some quick campaigns, and none of the ridiculous preparation time, acting, and math.  This game is a lot of fun.

Fun inexpensive dungeon crawl.  Feels a lot like Talisman-lite and has more strategy.

The rules are kind of confusing and I don't like that the game ends as soon as you hit level 4.  Maybe the level 4 stats are used in the Dungeon Lord variant.

RATING: 7
If you'd like a light rpg-style boardgame get this game. First, the game is beautiful...the artwork is top-notch.  I also like that it is quest-driven...you have 3 quests to complete, of a nice variety of types. This keeps game time in check as well...this is no Descent 4-6 hour marathon.  The glory/peril system works well, and there's plenty of player-player interaction, as each player plays the role of the hero and the monsters.  That being said, combat is relatively random, and is essentially borrowed from Talisman (roll a single 6-sided die for each side and add modifiers; winner has the higher number).  However, I've found that it works quite well, and above all keeps it simple.  With all of the expansions, there's plenty of "themes" to choose from, and each brings it's own flavor to the game.  For example, Tomb has a great "undead" theme.

A nice, pick up and play dungeoncrawl.  Learning curve is a bit high, but once you play it a couple of times, it becomes much easier.  Hits that "Dungeoncrawl" and "card game" spot quite nicely.  The ability to compile the other sets into one giant adventure is just icing on the cake.

this was an underwhelming experience with two players.  It seems more likely that someone will die rather than someone completing three quests.  The directions are very clunky which doesn't help either. Perhaps we'll split the deck and play again.

RATING: 4
Great concept, but lacking in execution.  The artwork is great, but somehow this game fails to deliver the type of atmosphere that a good dungeon crawler should.  I think that the amount of book-keeping just overwhelms any sense of adventure you might get from the game.  Stick with the classics of the genre - Dungeon, DungeonQuest, and Sorcerer's Cave to name a few.

Nice art, and has a good amount of theme. However, it's fairly difficult in the beginning of the game, and if you make it past that, then it becomes too easy. I haven't found the gem in here that other people have; it just feels too mechanical given the theme.

Probably the best of the series. The dungeon setting works best for me. I did not have too much trouble with the rules and just applied common sense.

Dropped from an 8 to 7. While this is not a knock on the game, I think it just shows my lower drive for this kind of game. The cards only approach, while nice and compact leave a bit to be desired.

RATING: 7.5
The directions for this one (at least at first printing) were murky at best.  They seem to have improved with the second edition.  It seems difficult for some players to get rolling—I recall one character *never* gets any magical ability for instance, without special items (which is largely luck-based).  The economy of points, how to spend them, and how to gain them, is *EXTREMELY* cryptic and counter-intuitive.  It is quite fun, however; the artwork is splendid, and the mechanics are rich for a card game.  The counters are ridiculous--just use pen & paper, bits from another game, or some other method.

RATING: 6.1
Un dungeoncrawler algo infravalorado sobre todo por el lastre de unas reglas mal redactadas y explicadas.

Lots of potential here. The clever peril/glory mechanics do a reasonably good job of balancing things.
The biggest thing holding it back is the horribly written rule sheet. Also, there are a number of card effects that are not covered in the rules that can confound players. Read the play introduction on the Atlas Web site before trying to read the rules and you'll be happier.

Dungeoneer is a card-driven "dungeon" delving role playing game where players build the map, complete quests, and accumulate glory and peril as they traverse the map.  Glory is spent by the player to gain items and abilities for their own hero, while peril is spent by their opponents to cause them to overcome traps and face monsters.  Players always know how much peril and glory they have accumulated, thus they can know how much opposition they may face.  Each game is a standalone game but they can be combined.

Tomb of the Lich Lord is set in a dungeon and the heroes and items are tune to go up against the undead.

Dungeoneer has a great theme, and an interesting mechanic of characters accumulating points in glory and peril. Not bad for a quick fantasy RPG fix. Then again, the game is marred by a fiddly and poorly written rulebook, not to mention a high luck factor. Lame flavor text on the cards.

In theory I have a weak spot for dungeon crawlers. Firstly Dungeoneer has some very nice artwork. The game itself has some potential, but also problems. The rules are badly written and not very clear. The game mechanics are clumsy and  unintuitive. I have had some fun playing this game, but there are many better out there, so why bother..

Being a card game Dungeoneer doesn't take much storage space making Dungeoneer the easiest dungeon crawler to take with you while traveling. For those on the road a point worth considering.

Dungeoneer is fun for the first few games, but the flaws begin to grate on you.  It is repetetive.  The movement system is unbalanced (movement is arguably the most important aspect of the game).  You quickly run out of cards when playing with one deck.

RATING: N/A
good game, good design, but not for our family.  Neither of my boys like "take that" games, so the choice of playing monsters on the other person's hero was not a good mechanic for our family.  We often let each other heroes run around trying to complete their quests on their own, while we all had a lot of unused danger tokens that other players were supposed to "spend" against us - definitely not how the game is supposed to be played.

The dice based combat system is quite weak IMO and it took quite a lot away from the game. This game can however be very fun when playing in the correct mood with the correct people. The artwork and the theme are great.

The mechanics are very CCG-like. I just hope that this game won't become a CCG but will only get well balanced preconstructed expansions. As it is now it's easy to approach as it's quite simple and everyone can play from the same deck. The deckbuilding part can be interesting but it's good that it's not a must (which it basically is with CCG:s).

Ok Dungeon adventure.  Lacks the variety of Talisman or Dungeon Quest but quicker play and set-up than either.  Lots more fun with more than 2 people.  Biggest problem is really slow period at start of game.  Artwork is totally unremarkable and dull.  Another problem is that 2 characters have nearly useless special abilities; the dwarf and sorceress can re-roll one type of combat, but since its their strong point to begin with no one plays that sort of monster on them!

A dungeon-crawler in card game format - although you do build up a game board with location cards.
I like the glory/peril mechanic, and the interaction between players you have thanks to the curse & monster cards you use against other players (thereby making a DungeonMaster/Overlord player redundant).
The illustrations look beautiful - which they need to, as they are the only medium in this game (no miniatures but thick paper foldups instead).

Miss Rhodes says: This is a card game in which each player must complete a number of quests in the dungeon without getting killed in order to win. Each player also is the dungeon master and in this role trys to kill off the other heroes. This is a tactical game which, to start with, can seem a little complex, but is really enjoyable when you get into it and you learn as you go along. A balance must be struck between taking risks to complete your quests and not losing too many life points. One to make you think.

Update: After playing a few more games, Dungeoneer's appeal has risen for me and my wife.  We play with the map preconstructed.
When preconstructing the map, split the map cards amongst the players, and they can look at their map hand, deciding what to play where from their hand.  The maps come out extremely well designed and alot more fun.  We can't wait for the expansion.

Woo hoo! Go Secret Santa 2007! Included with the game were D&D miniatures, small dice and glass beads to mark whatever it is you mark in the game. Haven't had a chance to play, but very exited to!

The rules could be clearer, and the design could be more accessible (hint: more symbols isn't necessarily better). The illustrations are solid, but nothing to write home about.

The game itself is very nice. A clean design, smooth flow of the game, interaction without bad-blood level conflict, good amount of luck, but not without strategy and planning. Complex enough to be interesting, but simple enough not to bog down. I like.

I'm not sure what all the hype was about.  The game is...okay, but if I'm going to do a dungeon crawl, I'd prefer a board.

After my first playtest of the 2nd edition, I could never have dreamed that it could score more than a 5. This is mainly due to the (very!) poorly written rulebook. The version 2.1 rules, however, have made the last two sessions utterly enjoyable. And it works wonderfully with both 3 and 4 players. Special praise for the atmosphere (thanks to the outstanding artwork) and the commitment of the games designer to make this game work.

Played:  Several times.  This game has some interesting ideas.  However, I don't think that the diferences between the characters is really significant.  Also, the choices during your turn aren't very interesting.

RATING: 5
One play, with 4, for all of us the first time.  Mixed feelings: enjoyed the dungeon crawling, found the game system fiddly and the rules poorly laid out.  Went on too long, but turns did go faster once we'd got a handle on the rules.  One player was eliminated near the end, which contributed to the speed-up, but I think it a black mark against the game system that such a thing might happen early on. I'd like to try the game 2-player, to go through it quicker and to avoid the multiplayer take-that dynamic.

RATING: 6
The game lacks the conciseness of German games.Dungeoneer: Tomb of The Lich Lord almost makes up for it with good interaction, clear goals,and good presentation. The random elements increase the replayabilty. Not to mention, it plays well with two players.
I wish the rules were better written. The impercise and fiddly nature of them really hurts the game. It doesn't feel customizable so much as murky.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun little game, very much like a card game version of Talisman. High luck factor, but in a fun way.  Quick enough, but not too short, about 15-20 minutes per player (after rule learning)

RATING: 1
The rulebook is pretty short but very messy. Gives lots of special rules without providing a general overview of how the game is supposed to work. It doesnt come with everything needed to play but suggests you should use 'pennies' for this and that. Geez - what did I pay for ?

Used to love it deeply... Used to play it every evening after work. the smell of the cards, the magic of the corridors, the sense of adventure. but not all pics nice though. moreover, always played only 1vs1. too much text to remember. would have to play hundred times to get the play go faster (checkicg all these numbers, comparing symbols, reading the tasks). unfortunately I don't want to wait anymore... But I'd like to play with more people one day. maybe it would make my love be back?

In Dungeoneer', you take up the mantle of a great Hero set out to prove your valor in the Tomb of the Lich Lord. To triumph over your rivals, you will need to explore the labyrinth of corridors, defeat the heinous monsters, overcome nefarious traps and be the first to complete all your Quests. But beware, the gods are fickle and to test their Heroes even further, they often bestow upon them Banes as well as Boons.
\13\\13\
Players attempt various quests (some are simple die rolls in a certain room, some are tough combat and some a series of things to do), with each completed quest having your Hero "go up a level" which increases his abilities.

The dungeon map is different each time as it is made up of cards played one at time onto the table by each player.

I cant put my finger on it, but the game doesn't really work for me.  This is a game I want to like, but cant recommend.  I think I really like the peril and fame system, but dislike the fact that you have to hang around waiting for the rooms you need for your quests to be drawn.  I know its a card game, but bah.

RATING: 6
Played this combined with Vault of the Fiends with my gaming group of 5 people.   There were pretty severe downtime issues,  and definitely issues with waiting for critical quest locations coming up.   Also played the combined set in a 2 player game and a 3 player game - these are much better,  downtime-wise.  

My big gaming group showed the potentially wrong kind of mentality for this kind of game - with strategic long-term thinking kicking in,  people didn't want to be the aggressor,  and peril was usually used in the "I'll burn off your peril with this weak monster if you burn off mine with that weak monster" kinds of deals.

The playboard never looks the same and there's so many different (artistically well done) cards you can draw, so you never get bored with it!
But I dislike that there are no dice or tokens included... :(

I have all the expansions too and like this game a lot. The only problem I see in it is that the locations are not as immersive as the roads and that tends to be confusing, maybe if they were from an 'above' sight that will do it. Anyway, the artwork is fantastic and is very easy to learn. A sure fun stuff when you have to go somewhere and cannot carry board games with you. It has a very cool adventure component but still not as much as 'Return of the Heroes' yet the compact flexibility makes it a great choice to collect.

I bought it second hand. I need to test it now. 

As far as I can tell Polish translation is not so great but the games includes nice counters (which might be not the case in the original edition from what I read here on the Geek)

So far I will say: "Not great, not bad ...". There are some interesting things going on here but nothing that will captivate me for longer time.

It does not seem to be too much different than the other set I own so I am willing to trade one of them away.

Sometime in 2012:
Damn... To much to say...
1st the rules:... for the french édition ar'nt quite easy to understand. Lacks of everything and to much information about other things that don't need to be explain that much.
2nd the rules:... yep rules again... for a player of D&D type of game, the game as so much potential, but just way to badly ruled.
3rd the matérial:... I don't quite understand a compagny that produce matrerial that as to be cut (destroyed) before being abble to play. I had to use a scalpel to cut a nice cards that contain the heroes and then fold them. Why not simply print those heroes properly  for the meant of the gam.. or else, print some little sticker that can be put on little wooden pieces as in some other games. it would'nt had been a difference in the price of production for them but for us, the quality would have been really enhanced.
4th: I put a 6 as note for this game but if we change the rules, it might become an 8.

This is a cool game but a little clunky. I really like the idea behind it and some of the mechanics. The double sided track and method of obtaining peril/glory is pretty cool. I also like how the players play as the dungeon. I think it could have been cleaned up a bit, the dungeon cards even simplified a lot. Expansions might bump this up a little. The problem is the rules are a mess and we typically have to stumble through it, never really sure if we played the same way as last time or even 100% correctly.

Good dungeon crawl. It feels like it is easy to exploit the rules, so it is necessary to play it in the right spirit. Or at least to win while not exploring the dungeons. I like the building of the map and glory/peril system.

I think this game is very mediocre.  The game play is relatively dull and has some flaws preventing it from being more enjoyable.

The components are what one would expect - cards.  Even the character pawns are cut from playing cards and I think miniatures would really take this game to the next level.  

Maybe a revision could really do a lot in terms of improving this game, but as it currently stands... it is too bland.

For such a small footprint it packs a mighty wallop. Easily more thematic than either Talisman, Dungeonquest, Heroquest, or Dungeons & Dragons the Fantasy Adventure Boardgame.

This was the first Dungeoneer set that I purchased many years ago, and, since then, I've found all the others.  It's a game I will gladly play at any time, and my only lament is that I haven't played it enough over the years.

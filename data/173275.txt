This is just a slog, every time we've played it. Slow moving, hard to make a difference on the board, samey actions every round. 'Healing' slime is too slow. Ugh. We were so excited for this and it's such a disappointment.

Fun, scenario-based board gaming which makes a solid use of the Ghostbusters theme. Pick characters, take actions, and the board and ghosts will react to you through events or if you fail to attack them. The figures are nice, though I do regret that some of the KS stuff might never be available to us lowly scrubs who bought it retail. Another thing I dug here is how you begin with only so many actions, but can 'level up' to gain more, the feel of progression only enhances the entertainment value.

The Box says 15+ ... My 5 year old son loves playing this with me and my wife.  Its not terrible, but its begging for an Expansion to beef up the Strategy, and the ghosts can just be bypassed on most missions.... but as a base set, a nice expansion with beefy content and this could be a real winner!

In agreement with the masses here - simple, basic, tactical game with mechanics a few notches below Zombicide, or even the D&D Adventure System. Will keep this around as a family game.

RATING: 6.5
This game gets a lot of play because it is quite easy to learn and it looks nice on the table.  I just love to play it with my seven year old nephew.  The game is quite easy, so we usually win, which suits us just fine.  Though there are better cooperative miniatures combat games on the market and in my collection, Ghostbusters is the selection that works best with families.  As such, it has a permanent spot in my collection.  

I do not have any of the Kickstarter stuff, which is fine by me as I prefer to keep the game simple with the crowds I play it with.  

If someone is looking for a family level cooperative combat game, I do not know of a better one on the Market.

RATING: 6
Pretty simple hybrid board/minis game. I still found there were a lot of rules oddities, maybe it's just how its laid out in the rulebook, but I had to check the rulebook constantly despite it being a very simple game at its core.

Having said that, any rules ambiguities are for minor points and you could probably just make up a solution on the spot and the game is robust enough to still work.

Updated Feb 2017: An interesting perspective I've received, playing Ghostbusters before Zombicide.

Zombicide is the earlier, and definitely better, game. Ghostbusters seems to be going for a more casual ride with shorter sessions, and on the face of it I support that. But the gameplay is somehow unsatisfying, and also uninspired, now that I can compare it to Zombicide and see how they more or less copied it.

Zombicide definitely has a better arc, even if it's quite a bit longer.

My original comments about this game where mostly negative and only raved about thematic appeal of this game. After playing this with my kids, 6 & 9, over the weekend my review has changed.

This is a great game, no, it is an amazing game for kids. They really love the appeal and they find it easy to understand. The whole co-op element also appeals to them.

My personal issue still remains that the game takes too long to pack out and up. I will need to invest in battle foam for the figurines and a new container to store the game.

Extremely simple dungeon crawler with little variety in mechanisms.  You move and shoot, repeat ad nauseum.

The scenarios do ramp up a bit and the difficulty becomes appropriate.  I also like the variety found here and how the gates function differently in each scenario.

The variety in ghosts is terrible though.  Kickstarter backers received tons of options while retail has no choices, with only 1 ghost per level.  So when a scenario says 5 level 2 ghosts, you can only use the Gruesome Twosome as that's all that comes in the base game.  Gets old quickly.

I do dig the thematic way that ghosts are deposited into the Ecto-1.  The artwork is also very good and the feel of the game isn't bad.  It just needs a little more variety and maybe another layer of mechanisms, like equipment perhaps.  I think the high price tag doesn't mesh well with a game intended for mass market success, which makes no sense for me.  Should have been a gamer's game for this price.

RATING: 6
Initial concerns regarding the shallow gameplay (particularly the automatic trapping of ghosts) bore out to the end, the variety of abilities offered by the expanded collection of spirits unlocked throughout the campaign has shown how versatile the game *could* have been. Rather annoying CZE purposefully dumbed everything down to appeal specifically to non-gamers... Even things like mutli-leveled maps could make a hell of a difference in strategies. A very simple experience (the designers couldn't even figure out any interesting trap mechanics... which should tell potential buyers something). Provide each character a set amount, limiting the number of ghosts that can be trapped at any one point (and have some creatures just destroyed rather than require trapping). *boom* instant and easy integration, that they apparently couldn't figure out after months of work.

Severely disappointed in CZE's lackluster efforts at shipping out to backers, and terrible communication. I hope they never undertake another KS campaign again - obviously far beyond their capabilities. Stick with easy standard retail releases.

I find this better than some reviews suggested: for playing this as a cooperative family game with my kids, it's great. We love the theme. Made me kickstart the Ghostbusters II game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I give this game a 4 because it is really one of those "Not so good games, but would play again".

The game play is typically set up in 4 rounds, where the first 2 rounds are almost a pointless waist of time.  If you get slimed in the early rounds other players get to gain experience much faster than you, leaving you stuck in a sad slime of dis-pare.   

If anyone wants to play this game I always start in the 3rd round with random experience points allocated for each player.  Otherwise it takes far too long to get to the "Fun" part of the game.. Lots of set up for busting ghosts.  

Some aspects of the game are still confusing after playing several times, so going back to the rule book is a common thing.

All in all, Not so good, but would play again...  Wish I wouldn't have spent as much as I did on it ;)

See you gaming,

Reasonable game backed on Kickstarter.  Comes with plenty of different miniatures to change up ghost activities/behaviour on board.

Certain Ghostbusters have distinct advantage over others, and some require specific group setups to perform better.

Ghostbusters
Board game review
The miniatures are well sculpted especially the ghosts and I don’t feel like these need painting. 
In the box are 10 double sided tiles about 13 ½ x 13 ½ Centimetres, 1 Spirit world tile, 1 PKE Meter tile, 20 proton stream tokens, 16 slime tokens, 5 gate tokens, 4 Ghostbusters character cards, 6 Ghost cards, 15 Scenario cards, 4 Ghostbusters figures, 40 ghost figures including 3 ghost boss figures these are translucent and 1 Ecto-1 car figure with corresponding tile, 1 eight sided dice 1 six sided event die and four six sided die.

Setup time varies depending on the scenario but is usually pretty quick, game length also depends on the scenario. The box says 30 -120 minuets but id say add at least 30 minuets for your first game and at least 15 to 20 from then on. 

This is a cooperative game that uses dice; players have levels and a limited number of actions. The player goes then the ghosts react to what the players do, the ghosts follow a pattern of if hit do “action” if missed do “action” style of play, there is also an end of round mechanic that can differ depending on the scenario you are playing, you also roll an event die which can cause more ghosts appear or all ghosts to go into a frenzy this makes ghost actions had to predict.    
This game is fairly easy to play the hardest part is remembering to use the special abilities of your character, and the ghosts forgetting these can mean the difference between winning and loosing.  
Each scenario has a level and its best to play them in order, a single play through one level will teach you the rules, I don’t think once you play through all the scenarios (although there are 15) you would go back and play them again, Cryptozoic does have a random scenario generator on their web site and some Expansion Packs, overall though the game is fun to play and I believe it would be a good one for families.

RATING: 7
Ghostbusters is my jam, but this game is really missing something. The ghosts usually only move if you attack them, so it's a bit lifeless; LoS is only 3 spaces, so most advanced ghosts are constantly getting away when you're trying to wrangle them; there are no objectives or anything to collect so the game is just closing gates and catching ghosts--it really could've used a money/equipment system.

Still, it's quick to set up and pretty fun for what it is. The ghost minis are kinda shoddy though.

This wasn't bad, but it also didn't knock my socks off. It was obviously a Zombicide clone but does enough different to make it a little more interesting such as a much wider variety of enemies and giving them reactions that makes each feel unique. Also, not being pursued, where your characters are largely free to do what they want and not get chased after, feels odd at first...Strolling through enemies that don't react to you unless you poke them first. I also like that the game plays over mini-campaigns allowing a little character development. Glad I have the KS version though because there's just so much more content and this is a game where more content the better.

This game definitely relies on scenarios to keep the interest up - it also includes a scenario generator to make sure you don't run out.
I love the figures!
In order to succeed in this game, the players need to figure out early what the winning strategy for the scenario is going to be. There's little hope of succeeding otherwise, and little hope of recovering from a wrongheaded attempt. Luckily, the scenarios don't take a huge amount of time to play, so this is not a problem.

I played the first three missions and I was underwhelmed.  Much simpler then for instance Zombicide.  No equipment to deal with, just roll a single die once to catch a slimey. Either you will succeed or fail, simple as that. Therefore the game felt more as a family game then a gamers game.  Hopefully later missions will bring on more tactical decisions to consider. The slime tokens just slow the game down adding nothing but boredom.

Picked this up on a whim at a board game sale. We've played it once with my sister, who does not play many board games. She had a blast with it, as a first-time cooperative game experience.

For my sake, I found the stakes low in the first campaign. Nothing can kill you. "Damage" (getting slimed) just slows you down, which makes sense as a mechanic. Cooperative games have you working against some clock, so a game like Shadows Over Camelot feel like a race against time.

Here, though, getting slimed means everyone on your team is running faster than you. So it ends up being annoying more than anything else. There's quite a lot of fiddling with components, too. 

On top of that, the progression of the characters feels almost too quick. It uses the Zombicide "deal with an enemy, get 1 point" system that might have you at maxed level in scenario 2 of 4 in the campaign. And there are no choices in terms of what you'll get when you level up.

There's also no equipment to flesh out your characters more, so you are railroaded depending on which of the 4 busters you pick. So there's not much variety at all, in my opinion. Unless you kickstarted the gamed, that is, which I did not. 

So all in all this is an aggressively mediocre but expensive cooperative game. If someone wanted to try it, I'd bring it out, but I don't have any cause to allocate precious space in my game bin to take this huge box to game day.

The way the game is described in the reviews reminds me of existing hack'n'slash games with scenarios. Does not really have the Ghostbusters feel to what people can tell in those videos. Feels more like a dungeon crawl with ghost minis rather than your typical monsters.

Ghostbusters is about investigation and figuring out what is going on. The busting of ghost is just something at the surface, a reaction to something's actions.

It starts off rather dull, but soon ramps up and becomes tactical in a somewhat refreshing way. You're not charging at foes and blasting them until they die; you're managing their movement (and yours) alongside their "respawns" and a larger objective.

The different Ghostbuster XP bonuses and abilities give each one a welcome little flavour too.

That said, it feels a little too pared back in order to be accessible and so it doesn't truly capture the spirit of it (I'm so funny). Something with a little more of the ghost-wrangling and collateral damage elements would've been highly entertaining. It would make a great family game, I imagine.

Of course, it does become rather punishing towards the end, and even failing just a few of those 50/50 die rolls can really ruin you.

I feel a bit bad rating this game a 6, because it's perfect at what it sets out to do.  Ghostbusters is a brilliant gateway game for introducing people to more complicated games.  It introduces a number of important concepts: turn order; action points; special abilities; levelling up and basic strategy.  It uses a very simple mechanic for doing so.  And it captures the theme very well.  The campaigns are fun to play and don't take long; I think you could probably finish a game in half an hour.  It's not very challenging though, and I couldn't imagine it being a first-choice game for my group.  It's one I'll play to wean people off of Settlers, or as the third game in a day-long session, reserved for when everyone's a bit tired and needs a break from the more complicated games.

KS Mass Hysteria Collector's Edition.  I've played through the first two mission blocks so far and it's fun.  We've only played standard difficulty and so far.  The first two campaigns were easy, but we lost the first try on the third.  I like the RPG part of it, though from what I hear Gloomhaven will have this game beat in that regard.  I just haven't been able to get a copy of that one yet.  Still, if you like the Ghostbusters theme, this is a fun light "dungeon" crawler kind of game.  The whole system uses dice (no cards), which I don't mind, but if you hate dice then stay away.  I will likely keep this on my shelf at least until I play all the way through.  Not sure yet if it's good enough to keep beyond a full play through, but that's what I say about most campaign style games.  (Example, I love LOTR LCG, but now that I've played through the ~20 missions I own I do not really go back and play it much.)

Decent co-operative game that offers a series of challenges based on the ultimate ghost. Once the players deduce the way to catch them, it's down to the dice... which makes it more of a puzzle game than random, but works very well.

Needs house rules for rolling.

Ghostbusters: The Board Game II- (Homebrewed IcyDuff variant)

Please refer to the general rule book for most rules as they will mainly remain the same, with the exception of the following changes.

Turn Order: This comes from the online variant rules from the first game. The turn order changes each round. At the start of each round you may decide, as a team, who should go first, and decide who should take subsequent turns. Use a marker to show that a player has completed their turn that round. Turn order is not locked in at the start of the game, nor does it have to move in a set order around the table. 

Combat Rolls:
Combat rolls are no longer done by rolling a single die and attempting to reach a set #, but rather through combat dice, creating a stronger chance of rolling hits but allowing the ghost to have a more dynamic defense.

There are two types of combat die: 
Proton Die (Ghostbusters)- These dice represent the accuracy, strength and duration of a successful proton stream. They have three proton icons and 1 “No Ghost” icon. Proton icons are avoidable, while the “No Ghost” symbol indicates an unavoidable hit. Blank sides have no effect. When targeting a ghost, a Ghostbuster will roll a standard of 3 combat proton dice. (The same dice are used for both proton attacks and slime blowers). When an ability, equipment or other modifier indicates +1 or -1 to attack rolls (such as the -1 hit slime), this will add or subtract a combat die. [We chose the -1 hit slime would cause 1 less die to be rolled, rather than removing one of your successes, so receiving three -1 hit slimes would make you unable to perform combat rolls.]

Ghost Maneuver Die (Entities)- These dice represent the entity’s ability to avoid proton streams. These die have 2 dodge icons and 4 blank sides. A ghost will roll their “To Hit” rating on their card (from now on referred to as their defense stat). Example: an entity that requires a “to hit” of 3 will roll three maneuver dice. Any modifiers that refer to changing the “to hit” of a ghost will add or subtract defense dice from this base number.

After rolling combat (or at the same time if you prefer), another player will roll the ghost maneuver die to see if the proton stream has landed. 
Any dodge symbols rolled will cancel out 1 proton symbol. Remember “No Ghost” symbols are unavoidable. 

For every “no ghost” symbol and un-avoided proton symbol, add a proton stream (or mood slime) token to the entity.
If one or more streams/mood slime are placed on the entity- activate the entity’s “When Hit” ability. If enough streams have been placed to trap/extract the entity, the entity has been defeated (with the exception of Resist foes, see below.) You do not rank up for excess streams, but only as much as the “To trap” allows for that ghost.

If no tokens are placed- activate the entity’s “When Missed” ability.

Resist: When required to roll against Resist to trap an entity. Roll your combat dice (including +/- modifiers), count the successes and add the # of streams/slimes on the entity. “No ghost” and stream icons count as 1 success when rolling against resist. Roll the entities’ defense stat (including any +/- modifiers) and add the # of maneuver icons to their Resist stat (on the ghost card). If the total attack value is greater than or equal to the total defense value, the entity is successfully trapped/extracted.

Entity Defense Stat (# of dice): for standard Entities- decrease this value by 1 for each proton stream attached to the entity, in addition to modifiers. (The more streams they have on them, the harder it is for them to move around)
For Gates, mini-boss, and Boss entities- this value will remain the same regardless of stream tokens, unless otherwise effected by modifiers.

Wrangling/ Trapping (Optional Rule)- (initial idea borrowed from BGG user LastSocratic in thread https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1804940/combat-variant) -When using the optional trap mechanics, wrangling can occur during combat and not only required to occur afterwards. After resolving combat a combat roll, you may use your un-avoided hits to either add streams/ mood slime, or to wrangle the ghost to another space within line of site. You may mix/match this (ex. I rolled two un-avoided hits so I add 1 stream and wrangle one space towards the trap.) When wrangling, do not resolve the ghost’s “When Hit” ability, but you still resolve this when adding any stream/slime token, therefor you should always resolve the “when hit” ability prior to wrangling a space. A maneuver is still required to drop, pick up, and activate the trap. Any Ghostbuster may activate a trap they are adjacent to, but may only pick up and drop their own trap. 
[Turn example- A class 2 ghost is within Ray’s LOS at the start of his turn and already has one stream on it from another GB. Ray want’s to attempt to trap the ghost. He uses a maneuver to drop the trap in an adjacent space between him and the ghost. He then uses a combat action to roll his 3 combat dice against the entity’s 4 defense stat. Ray rolls a “No ghost” symbol and 2 proton streams, while the ghost rolls only 1 “maneuver icon”, cancelling one of his proton stream icons. This result give’s Ray 2 successes. Ray adds the final stream needed to the ghost, who resolve’s its “To Hit” by charging 1 space towards and randomly slimes him and the other GB (just using a random ghost defense here). Ray uses his second success to wrangle the ghost onto the space with the trap. He uses his second maneuver to open the trap and catch the ghost, gaining 1 XP a piece for himself and the other player. Finally, Ray converts one of his actions into another maneuver so he can pick up the trap. He has one action left to do with as he pleases.]


“Removing Slime” Action- When using an action to remove slime from another Ghostbuster, you may remove all slime of a single type. (Except caustic slime)
When removing slime from yourself, you may forfeit your turn to remove all slime tokens from your character. (Except caustic slime) 

Driving the Car- If a Ghostbuster is driving the ECTO-1/1A/2 and ends a movement next to 1 or more Ghostbuster next to a legal entry point, you may spend a maneuver to “pick up” those Ghostbusters. You cannot split a single move action, but can pick up fellow Ghostbusters in between two move actions by using a maneuver.

Switching Your Pack- 

Switching between your own Proton and Slime blower packs costs 1 action, not all. 

Switching another Ghostbuster’s pack costs 1 maneuver, not 1 action.

 made house rules to use the new game's rules in GB1. I use slime tokens as "goo piles". 

During setup, I point to a gate on the map, I roll a d8 and a d6. The D8 tells me which direction to start moving in, and the d6 is how many spaces away I move to. Where my finger stops, that's where I place a slime token. Do this for all the gates. 

A GB can use a maneuver to investigate the slime token and gain equipment/event.

For the setup of ghosts, that's easy. In GB 1, they just say to use "Class X" ghosts, so just pick any ghost randomly from what you have available in that class.

If using a GB2 character in GB1, give him only 2 actions a turn, and replace his "plasm" ability by a "gain +1 action" ability, like the GB1 characters.

Use Ecto-1 instead of Ecto-1A, since there is no "goo" to load into Ecto1A. 

Remove any event cards that have to do with "plasms" or "goo". 

Once I get the actual GB2 game in hand, these might be tweaked a little.

If you are a Ghostbusters fan, proceed to my next paragraph.  If you are not a Ghostbusters fan, steer clear of this game.  

Now, Ghostbusters fans, if you have always wanted a tactical Ghostbusters board game with a modular board and for each player to have special attributes, and you don't mind a heavy dose of luck, get it.  But if it bothers you that so much that happens in this game is controlled by random die rolls, perhaps don't get it.

Granted, many of the xp advantages have to do with mitigating die rolls, but I still wish more strategy had been involved in the game design here.  Cryptozoic refused my request to post a rule book when the game initially hit KS, and now I see why.  

For me, I do like this game because I'm a Ghostbusters fan who can look past this game's shortcomings.  I'm hopeful that the next expansion introduces some better gameplay ideas to the game as a whole.

Terribly underwhelming gameplay, and the video demos will put you to sleep, but the Kickstarter campaign has lots of minis, many which are exclusive so you won't be able to get them later.  A great license with very dull mechanics. It's just TOO simple, but the fact they it was marketed to Ghostbuster fans and not boardgame fans tells me they aimed for that. It worked great for the KS campaign but I *think* many here on BGG may feel similar.

I had high hopes for this one early on.

Probably the worst "dungeon crawl" yet produced. I guess it'd be okay for teaching a 7 or 9 year old the concepts of what a dungeon crawl is, but I really don't think the game should have been created that way, as most fans I know are in their 30's or older... doesn't make sense to me. Minis are pretty cool, and I suppose you could design your own game using the decent components, but even then I'd say it's only worth it if you got the KS exclusives.

Hoo boy, what can I say about this game that I’m sure hasn’t been reiterated dozens of times already?

So, yeah... it’s the Ghostbusters... basically, so there’s some points right there. I mean, who doesn’t love the nostalgia of the 80’s right? It’s a co-op game, great! It’s episodic, okay that’s cool. Oh hey, there’s character progression, awesome! There’s dozens of (fairly) good miniatures (including a large Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man), great! The level layouts are really neat, I like the double-sided tiles. Aaaaaaaaand, there’s a very practical insert included (something that far too many games don’t include these days).

Sounds great, right? No... no no no no no no no no!

Unfortunately this game relies HEAVILY on dice rolls. In fact, almost all of the mechanics of the game revolve around probability.

Example: I played this game with my brother over Christmas break. We played Scenario 1, Episode 1 and we fucking CRUSHED it! We were zapping ghosts and closing gates like... like uh... I don’t know, something funny that does those things. So, yay, we were having a ball. We got some food, made a couple of brandy and egg-nogs, and dove into Scenario 1, Episode 2. And in the course of about... twenty-five to thirty rolls, we rolled a 3+ maybe two or three times...

BULL...

     FUCKING...

             SHIT!

That’s not fun... that’s... that’s... just gambling! I would give this game a 7 or 8, easily, if they included some cards you could play. Like an “add +2 to all dice rolls this round” or something. They did include that in the Ghostbusters 2 game, but that is not this.

Lastly, as much fun as it is playing as the Ghostbusters, this game only works with 2 or 4 people. Yes, it’s designed for 1-4, but one player is just fucking boring, and three means one person is left controlling two characters... and I don’t like that.

Own this version, and left notes on the Mass Hysteria edition.  The game is listed at 15+, but we play as a family and have seen the one-shot scenarios and scenarios #1 /2 of most Campaigns are tuned to level 0 stats fairly well, which lets my 7-year-old get in the game as well.  Relatively quick to start up, selecting from the KS exclusives takes the most time.  Highly recommend if you can get a discount copy, you'll be able to find some of the expansion material for increased replay after 3-4 sessions.

This game simply does not offer strategic choices. You fire at whatever is within range, hope you hit it and remove slime.

Although the game includes variable player powers, you don't really play any differently with any of the characters, which renders the former pointless.

The game does however include nice miniatures and decent art. This, and the nostalgic theme improves my rating of the game to "it's okay-ish".

I want to love this game. I love the Ghostbusters and I love tactical boardgames. In the end I only like this game. The gameplay can be exciting and the character abilities are unique to the Ghostbuster. The variety of characters to choose from is impressive too. 
That said, the character design is based off the comic books which is probably the least followed of all the media. The game lacks the variety of equipment the Ghostbusters have access to like the Slime Blower or PKE meters. The premise of the game misses the mark too. The Ghostbusters normally go from haunted location to haunted location, busting ghosts while some larger threat looms. In this game you go around a single location closing portals while catching ghosts just extends the time you have to close portals. 
Ghostbusters is such a great property to mine but I feel like Cryptozoic missed the mark with this one.

It seems difficult to get an honest opinion about Ghostbusters on the Geek because people a) over hyped it leading to disappointed expectations and b) were embittered by the high amount of awesome components that was declared 'Kickstarter Exclusive' only (I'm was one of the b crowd, and held off buying the game because of it).

Ghostbusters is a light, pretty quick and very dicey Ameritrash game that successfully mashes bits from the whole GBs universe together (art from comic series, characters and references from both the movies and 80s/90s cartoons) with the help of lots of sexy transparent plastic! 

Other then the level up/experience system and being a coop dudes on a board game it is NOTHING like Zombicide at all so ignore anyone comparing the two!

Players take turns moving and blasting Ghosts and spirit world gates whilst trying to complete scenario driven objectives. The scenarios can be played individually although several are grouped together into mini-campaigns that are intended to be played back to back. As they each take only about 30-45 minutes you can easily do a whole campaign in an evening, really giving you a sense of quick progression that I really liked.

The rules are pretty streamlined, and aside from a couple of minor quips there's very little to check the rulebook for once you have the basics down, especially as most information is laid out on nice big reference cards.

The real strategy of the game seems to be in careful positioning to help manage ghosts when they undoubtedly move, and managing your actions as efficiently as possible- especially when they start to get shut down by all the slime flying about! Sure its random as hell, but there's plenty of mitigation for a strategic mind.

Once you've cleared all the included scenarios there's  not only rules for making your own but an excellent scenario generator on the Cryptozoic website that does all the work for you! This helps to expand the lifespan of the base game materials considerably.

The sad news is that if you want anything other then Slimer, Stay Puft and a bunch of generic ghosts to blast you are going to want to track down one or more of those Kickstarter exclusives. Several of the iconic ghosts and characters from both the movies and cartoons are only available in this way, but be prepared to pay through your nose for any you want to grab!

Does it have item decks and complicated combat? No.
Does it cover all the Ghostbusters equipment in detail? No.
Do you get to cooperatively drive Ecto-1, blast a bunch of ghosts (including Slimer and Stay Puft Marshmallow Man) and get totally slimed? Hell yes!

After playing 2 full campaigns I'm still at an unexpectedly pleasant 7, but more plays may see this rating change.

It was so unexpectedly successful with my group that I've tracked down and secured the Kickstarter Exclusive version with all the extra trimmings. Its amazing with piles of extra content. I can totally see why people were so bitter about not having general access to this stuff! Did Crytozoic shoot themselves in the foot by making all this stuff exclusive and not releasing it in expansions? Yes, I believe they really did.

Ghostbusters II is now imminent, and once again there's a stack of exclusive stuff- I'm not missing out this time!

This game looks so weak. Why do people put money into such stuff. I love Ghostbusters and I don't want to yuck other people's yum but this game hardly looks developed. The stretch goals are greedy. Like the second or third one are pay add ons. Not a stretch goal really unless you go for the $125 version. You know how many awesome games you can get for that and not have to wait forever? I get it Kickstarter is the front lines and I am just as much of a sucker as anyone but the mechanics look sloppy and untested like a slapped on theme to Zombicide along with every crappy game from the 80's.

Especially for fans of the old movie classic, this game is hard to resist. This game is similar in some mechanics to Zombicide, but unique enough to hold it's own. The game really catches the mood of the Ghostbusters very well. The missions are challenging and the ghosts are tough to beat.

The characters level up similar to Zombicide in that as they kill more and more ghosts more powers open up to them. Catching ghosts by using streams is fun. Battles with ghosts are good, but a bit frustrating. All you do is roll one die...every time. At least in Zombicide you usually begin the game with a low grade weapon that allows you to roll one die, but you gradually acquire more weapons that allow you to roll 2 dice or 5 dice, etc. This mitigates bad die rolls with more balance and fun. In Ghostbusters, the game can last longer than it should simply due to bad die rolling. It has that frustration that you get in  games like Monopoly where you roll a die and never land on the space you need to. Talisman can have this same feel too, but at least you choose which direction around the board you get to go giving you some options. I feel this same kind of frustration in Ghostbusters but all due to a die roll when killing ghosts.

The models are wonderful and have an eerie blue transparency. Everything stores perfectly inside the game box.

The production value is good on this one. Who doesn't like a giant Stay-Puft Man figure? The only thing I don't like about the production is the plastic XP sliders on the Ghostbusters cards. I'm hoping they don't wear the cards like older games in the past did. 

Gameplay is fairly light but fun. There are plenty of scenarios and modular boards to mix things up. Most of the time you are running around to close gates (keeping more ghosts from appearing) while trying to complete your scenario. Getting slimed can really slow you down and sometimes the ghosts overwhelm you with that.

I've been a huge Ghostbusters fan for all of my life, so I can be a little biased when it comes to the theme.  The miniatures are great and the game looks really good. It's not hard to learn and get new players into,set up is fairly easy, but at times the game can struggle.

It is very player dependent, but I know we had times when we got split up and there were players that did nothing for large periods of time because they had there actions reduced and no one was close enough to help out.  It also lends itself to the alpha gamer, as we had one individual almost playing two turns for one of the weaker players.

First off I'm gonna say I haven't played it yet so I'm not going to give it a full rating till I do so.  Ghostbuster board game transforms the ghostbuster story into a fun co operative game.  Using small boards, mini's and dice with character boards ,campaign cards and tokens.
Now I can tell you now I like how the rules are set up they have a breakdown of everything the print is big and the pictures and diagrams are really helpful and easy to understand. The small map boards are a nice thickness and there all double sided for different boards. The miniatures are good I kinda worried about the gruesome tosome mini's because how thin they are in the middle but there still good. Now I would've liked to see other than slimmer and state puff more familiar characters when it comes to the ghosts that are more common in the game and not just them, either from the movies or cartoon series. The Ghostbuster character cards are really great easy to read and I love the fact that on the back of the cards there's a little information about the characters . In the game there's 15 campaign cards, I like the fact that they have these cards instead of having to refer to the rule book for setup . There easy to read and they have a diagram on the back to show how to set up the game board for that particular campaign. There's 6 different ghost cards going from class 1 to 7 the cards have a nice setup as we'll, but like I said I kinda wished they would've have put more familiar characters in the lower class ghosts. But so far this game has a really nice setup and understandable look. Plus I like the art for the game it very much reminds me of the comic books! I would give it a 8 in till I play it.

There is barely a game here, and the theme is very loosely fit to the game mechanics. The characters' unique powers are barely differentiated and entirely bland. The gameplay is extremely repetitive, and there is little to make one "campaign" different from another.

This game was such a disappointment.  It drops the ball on a delivering a narrative experience and the co-op mechanisms are a mixture of frustrating and boring.

If your a ghostbusters fan it's really a must have. The minis are great and the mechanics while not perfect are good and entertaining. My kids like the game and we usually enjoy a good family playthrough. while not a perfect game it's a very good one and the plus being: It's a ghostbusters game!!

Disclaimer:  I do have the Kickstarter version, which may affect my opinion of the game (positively!)

This game is way better than I thought it was going to be, to be very honest.  I love the fact that the game gets a lot of it's material from the Ghostbusters cartoon from way back in the day. Also, the campaign play is really excellent, there are so many great bosses to fight and if you are not up to doing a whole campaign there are really good one off missions as well.

Finally, this game is REALLY easy to get to the table as the name is so well known and loved!

Upon opening the box, one can't help but notice the most terrible box insert of all time...literally. Upon further inspection of the components, one can't help but be disappointed in the quality of the molds. Upon reading the rulebook, one can't help but notice that the "designers" obviously weren't in love with the Ghostbusters as some of us are.

A missed opportunity for the GB license for sure. 

Received this in a trade and while I KNOW I will have fun playing this (I've watched the videos), I still can be sad about those other things.   

Ok, the gameplay...is..Ok.  I DEFINITELY need to be in the mood to play this. I love the D&D series that this game closely resembles but this is just slightly more chaotic so its rating will suffer slightly.

The Deluxe edition is the only edition worth owning as the base game/retail edition is lacking almost ALL the components that make it replayable.

Mediocre at best.  From what I played it lacks true decision making, and see almost no way for the difficulty to increase.  The only thing that can increase the difficulty is to reduce the time you have to win (either by needing more streams or having less ghosts to add) in which case it is only leaving things even more up to the roll of the die.  Which by the way, nit-picky thing, but why is the d6 using symbols rather than just numbering 1-6?

We found it entertaining at first, but despite the scenario variety it wore thin pretty quickly. Lots of sitting around hoping to roll well.

I would not recommend buying it retail. So much of the game was KS extras it just doesn't seem worth it.
The intro text also seems to really miss the theme, going for gruesome and dark rather than comedy.

I'd actually like to give this a higher rating.  All things considered it's a pretty quick and lite co-op game, which is to be honest kind of nice.  The 15 and up age limit is a complete and utter joke however, the game is easily 8 plus.  It has a ton of potential and could use use more depth, but do you really want an overly complicated Ghostbusters game?  I wouldn't really say that's a strike against it, as it's as luck driven yet well designed, easy playin' as a Ghostbusters game should be.  Even as a heavy gamer theres something enjoyable about just being able to learn and teach it quickly.  Out of the gate, the scenarios get more challenging and add new twists just like any other Dungeon crawl game out there, things slowly ramp up.  It's perfectly serviceable as it is.

Minis are great, art assets are great, components are great (I love the little rings you can hang on the ghosts for proton tags).  

What's not great is their Kickstarter, everything about it came off as a sleazy mess.  Reward levels, the exclusives, the unlocks, the completed state of it in the initial video.  This was a company that made a game in full and then turned to Kickstarter for presales and extra money for exclusives they charged for in the price.  Then, in the end, the retail copies hit the shelves while the backers for the exclusives they paid for are currently still waiting.  It's hard to justify kickstarting large companies like this that are abusing what should be a tool for people to get their games out there and not a platform to gouge customers who want a complete game.  All round docked 2 points for that alone.

Love Ghostbusters; film, cartoon, and comic.

Can't rap my head around the lack of retail content. Where's Zuul? Where's Janine? KSE. The game is lacking content. All the exclusive items really took away from something that could have fulfilled your dreams of being a ghostbuster.

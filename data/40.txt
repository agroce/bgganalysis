My rating is more for the Lords of Conquest computer game than the board game.  They're both good games, but having the computer do all those little calculations for you... it's a Godsend.  I'm not sure I could ever go back and play this one "old school."  Also, the computer version makes this a very viable 2-player game.

I like the simplicity of units and resources.  Sometimes it's nice not to have to worry about a tech tree, too.  The only thing that might have hurt it (and every other negotiation game) for me is when negotiations seem to drag on.  The combat is luck less, not really a plus or a minus for me, just more simplicity (which is a plus in my book).All in all, a neat little game.  Not the best, but I wouldn't pass up another play or two of this one.

This was the first boardgame that I ever played in my dreams after staying up until 4 in the morning playing "Just one more game."  I haven't played it in years, as my current gaming group is more into non-confrontational games. (And I always kick their butts at it!)  
Once you figure out the 'sweet spots' on the map, it loses some replay value, although the expansions do somewhat help that problem.  I have always wished I had time and inclination to make a new board for it.

RATING: 6
I very much like this game, which combines the best features of Settlers, Diplomacy, and Risk.  Has all the brain burn one wants, combined with the amusement of conflict and some backstabbing. The one downside is that there always seems to be someone who, at least at some point in the game, is in a demoralizing position. Would rate it higher if it could be played quicker.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Home-made copy.  A rotating bash-the-leader game with negotiation and simple skuldugery used to position for the win.   The continuous influx of resources dictates an arms race.  The challenge is to ride that maelstrom.  Excellent with the right players, players who will turn and connive for every advantage while encouraging the others to do likewise.  Not so good with those who won't.

I owned the Ascalion version of this game.  My one attempt to play this was a total disaster.  One of our players was painfully slow, and we quit after several hours with no one anywhere near winning.  Nonetheless, I had some fun despite the problems.   I would have liked to try it again, but I got a good trade offer on it (Le Passe-Trappe) and took it.

This game combines the abstracted warfare and negotiation of Diplomacy, the resource management and trading of Settlers of Catan, together with just a few elements of a lightweight civilization game. It's rare to find a game that achieves a balance of complexity and playability as well as Borderlands does.

RATING: 5
Based on one play - In our four-player game, the two players in the middle could clearly see (by the end of the second turn) the squeeze play headed their way. They were out of the running from the start. Once the Red player captured all three gold mines, it seemed a foregone conclusion. I suppose that a different resource configuration would have ameliorated this disparity somewhat, but we couldn't help feeling that this early shut-out is a problem.

RATING: 7
Great game from way back, and one I realize I am lucky to have gotten to play.  I thought it had similarities to both Settlers and Antike, but I like it more than both of them.  The fluidity of provincial ownership is interesting - you have to get over the instinctive fear of losing territory and understand that you can gain by losing ground and reordering your power for a more useful thrust on the next turn.

The dings to my rating come from two issues.  Like Settlers, this game has runaway leadership because of the compounding returns of city growth.  However, it is not as bad as Settlers because you can directly attack the leaders.  I am also not a fan of the deterministic combat both because it removes the drama of battle (see Wallenstein) and makes planning too calculable.  I have been told by the world's leading Borderlands player that this problem can be lessened with more players and some of the additional units.  I would love to try this again with a larger group.

Good game.  Simple mechanics and phases system that help the flow of the game.  A few fiddly rules with movement of resources and troops.  Once you play a few rounds it is fairly straight foward.  After seeing some of the dynamic plays near the end of the game, it made me want to try and play again.  

It is very clever with the temporary alliances, trading resources, and deals .  The diplomacy parts give the game a lot of flavor.  

Battles are very mathy and take the longest to play out.  They do offer interesting choice to take.

I do feel it could be rough and dull for new players if they don't calculate or play the first few moves right. getting hosed in the first couple of rounds would not be fun at all.  

Rating after one play is a solid 8, will update after more plays.  Borderlands is a game that needs multiple plays to see how the endgame is triggered and how the first few turns of actions really have an impact over the course of the game.

This is a fantastic strategic game that I have always enjoyed playing. I have the two expansions. One problem is that I no longer have the map. Found a person with the map. Have had it copied and laminated. Looks just like my old one now. Still haven't got it to the table to play but - Wow am I happy to have the whole game again. Of course this didn't stop me from getting the FFG reprint when it happened [which was a disappointment in graphics and rules]. 
Note: It appears I have never understood this game - people keep telling me it is Diplomacy light - I never got that feeling and have never played it that way. To me it is a light fun puzzle solving game.

RATING: 7
A groundbreaking game that's very much like a vastly improved Diplomacy with added elements reminiscent of Roads & Boats and Settlers of Catan.  Of course, Borderlands predates the latter two games by more than a decade.  Pretty amazing game for 1982, and still somewhat enjoyable today.  The riverboat rules could probably benefit from some tweaking.  A few of the other rules are a bit weird, such as rolling a die to see whether a phase happens, or the way that trading resources (even identical ones) allows players to break the normal transportation restraints.  If Borderlands were a new game, I would rate it about a 6, but it gets a bonus point for "impressiveness" within its historical context.

Amazing unknown/underrated strategic/negociation/management game. Clearly the ancester of Settlers of Catan and all its followers. But a Catan without dice, more negociation and as much trade. The only downturn is that players have to make sure that the game stays balanced, otherwise a little territory advantage can grow very fast. Certainly the reason why the game doesn't seem to work really well with 3 players -> 4 players is greatly recommended.

Building the template for Die Siedler von Catan and thus pretty much of what flooded the gaming market the following decade, Borderlands merged elements from other games that at the time still seemed disparate: negotiation and territorial fights on one side (as in Diplomacy), resource management and trading on the other (a reference point is the then recent Civilization). For the first time, though, these elements were waived together into a format just as nutritious as the two aforementioned games but way more manageable: a duration of a "mere" two hours, rules as trim as they could be and perfect scaling from the heady, strategic two-player game to the orgiastic interaction of the four-player game.

Less iconoclastic but more solid and every bit as dynamic as the Eon team's previous designs, Borderlands is a majestic and very fitting end to their classic run of games.

Despite its promise and potential, it unfortunately wasn't a good vibe game. Perhaps it would be a better game by email where you didn't care so much about the enjoyment of the other players. I suspect it's better with 4 players, although each player would grab their corner, consolidate it, and build to expand into the middle making the game somewhat more structured than it was with 5. The fluidity with which the leader bashing caused the game to turn around was frightening at times. 

There is strategy required (what to build when) and diplomacy (what to attack when) but your success in this game will depend on your deal making capability.

Maybe one of the most misunderstood games on this site. Brilliant zero luck combat system, once realization blooms on what is possible in this game it becomes one of the most intense experiences I know. I played with someone who was literally clenching his fists the entire time, the suspense was so agonizing. Nothing is safe here. Thanks to the power of boats, you can swoop in on anything by a river or the coast (which is everywhere). 

This game gives so many advantages to the attacker, it becomes not about whether you will win a battle, but *which* territory you will attack. Those two battles each turn are very limiting, and you also want to probably use one for transport! Because transport is key. The logistics of having to get all of the resources in a territory to build something makes for a beautiful melding of concerns. And you transport all of those resources somewhere, but don't get to build until next turn, which gives everyone else on the map a chance to descend on those precious goods...

Combine that with the potential for alliances and the cooperation/competition during the all-powerful trading phase make this a mind bending exercise in anxiety. Oh, and some of those phases might not happen this turn! So... I hope you have a backup plan : )

Swift and brutal, with all gameplay totally emergent from some simple rules. Now one of my all time favorites.

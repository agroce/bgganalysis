If you like Smash Up then you'll like this expansion. It doesn't unbalance the game and adds a really cool Bear Cavalry faction. I've rated it so low because I do not enjoy the game at all, but I realize that some people do and I have played it enough times to understand this expansions nuances.

RATING: 8
Great expansion!  Gives you enough factions to have more variety in 4-player (so some don't get picked), reprints the tiny-text base cards, adds point trackers, the works.  Also gives you a new portable box to throw everything into.  I will never play without this expansion, even if the factions don't get picked.

A good expansion for Smash Up.

I like playing with Ghosts and Bear Cavalry and they seem to win quite often. Killer Plants have a few good cards, but they run out of minions easily (unless you play with Robots) and usually lose. I like playing with Steampunks, too, they have great actions you can play on the base, but they keep losing anyway.

A solid expansion to the base game. The core game of Smash Up benefits from a little extra variety after a few plays. I'm not sure you need more than one expansion, but if you're going to pick one, this is a very safe choice. After one play, the killer plants, the ghosts, the bear cavalry all add some new mechanics that stand on their own but at the same time maintain the smooth gameplay.

No-brainer 1st expansion for the game and still worthwhile as a 2nd expansion.

I didn't think the Steampunk faction was as awesome when I first started playing, since I only pulled the minions.  Once I started getting the base actions, it became awesome!

And the bear riders are awesome too!  So far there aren't any factions from this that I dislike.

A very simple addition to the base game. Killer plants are super powerful and play well with a lots of other factions. Ghosts have a cool concept, but don't seem to integrate well with many factions.

I LOVE the Ghost faction, but since many of their effects only work when your hand is empty (or nearly empty), have only been able to have them work well/best with Robots.

RATING: 5
This expansion simply adds some new faction decks. "Steampunks" which are really action heavy. "Plants" which GROW stronger as the game goes by. "Ghosts" this one is interesting, they are stronger when you have fewer cards in your hand. And finally, "Bear Cavalry" which is giant bears being ridden by disgruntled Russians....a force to be reckoned with.

Smash-Up suffers from having too many cards in play at the same time. The more players, the worse the problem. It's somewhat fun to play, but keeping up with all of the ongoing rule effects can be tiresome. At some point, it just feels like busy work. I might play again if the mood strikes me right, but it's definitely not at the top of my list. On the plus side, the art is very fun and pretty to look at. I also like the ability to choose which two factions to mix together. It adds a fair amount of variety to the game play.

First played this with the base game on April 13th, 2013.  I don't typically like having to draw cards and read some text and try to decide what to play and this game was all about that. Would be more fun if you already had pre-read the cards.

Will have to try the option of being able to play 2x3 players at the same time - so basically a 6 player game.  Think you could play slightly differently to integrate those two games - use a communal stack of bases, play continues until they run out, and player with most vps at that stage wins.
Steampunks are good now for the rest.

Adds 4 more distinct factions to the base game, making for even more deck variety.  Adds several new bases with their own unique powers.

This expansion adds more if what's great about the core game without mudding the rules with more mechanics to remember.

The issue of unbalanced faction combinations from the core game us still there, but It's less prevalent due to the higher faction numbers and combinations.

If you like the core game, this is a must buy.

Replayability definitely seems like a problem, so I can see why this expansion came out. Still, I don't like the base game, so adding more races is not really going to change my opinion.

This is the first Expansion I've gotten for the game.  I enjoy the added variety of deck combinations.  The new decks, however, are a little harder to play than the core game.  The ghosts: the fewer cards in your hand, the better.  Smash them up with the wrong deck and it's tough. 

I appreciate the attempt to give these new decks different strategies of play, though.  My favorite so far are the Steam Punks, followed most likely by the Bear Cavalry!

This was a bright shiny thing that I bought when I first got really into boardgaming, and I appreciate the role that it served. But now that my horizons have broadened, I'm not sure I ever see myself playing Smash Up again. People that know their decks strengths and how they fit together will always have an advantage, and there can be too much kingmaking.

RATING: 6
I loved Smash Up, but this expansion really threw off the balance of the game when combined with the original factions. Steampunks especially are COMPLETELY overpowered (for example, they have an action that gives +2 to all the player's minions on a base, and they have at least 4 different ways to reclaim that action from the discard pile and use it again). I think Killer Plants and Bear Cavalry are balanced well enough (though I've heard others complain about Plants also being OP). I really enjoyed playing Ghosts, but they are only good when paired with a select few other factions, when they will do VERY well. If you pick factions randomly, you can lose horribly if you get Ghosts paired with the wrong faction. I want to like this expansion more than I do, but the (lack of) balance that these new factions bring to the game disappointed me. I haven't had a chance to play with all these factions in a 4-player game, but this is my experience from 2- and 3-person games.

While there are no new overall rules here the decks add some new ways to play the game. The Killer Plants, Ghosts and Steampunks all provide new mechanics that could combo in interesting ways with the other themes. The black sheep is the Bear Cavalry which is an odd choice and doesn't really do anything interesting other than hard hitting minions.

In my opinion this is a must have expansion for the game. All of the new factions are awesome and look well featuring new abilities with the Bear Rider faction being one of the greatest. Combine them with the ninja and - uh oh - you control the only faction that is literally indestructible, which chases away enemies to other bases nearly every time, which has the second strongest unit in game and the strongest weaker units, which can send in troops to already destroyed bases in the last second, score points this way and which also easily destroys any enemies of any strength. Definitely recommended!

I have to asume they have playtested thoroughly and the new factions are balanced, but it's hard to believe:
-> The bears are quite powerful creatures and cool actions to be left alone.
-> The actions of the steampunk faction are great.
-> The ghosts are very weak, while other factions have cool abilities that benefit them, many of their abilities are just "discard cards". But only a very few ghost cards provide benefits when having very few cards... plus, having few or no cards is a GREAT disadvantage (and the benefits are very small). I know they have to be played in a special way, but this "special way" won't mix well with your second faction.

In the best case, it is just 4 new factions, with no new rules, just some more diversity.

Overall, a very poor expansion. If the ghosts don't show to be a bit more consistent in further plays, I will probably drop my initial rating of 5.

The extra VP-tokens are nice, so you don't have to write down scores anymore, and also the base-cards with extra large text are a good thing. And off course the extra factions give more variety to your base game. So all inn, a very good expansion, whom could have been cheaper imho if they didn't made such a unnecessary hugue box, which you don't need at all as you can put everything in the box of your base game.

The new factions add some nice new strategies to the game. I also noticed you have to be particularly careful about which two factions you mix now, as certain minions/actions really don't play nice with others, or require a much better understanding of the decks to manage. I imagine this will only get better over time as my fellow gamers and I try more variations.

More of everything you love about Smash Up, this expansion adds a few new factions to the game without changing any of the core rules. No need to check the manual for chances, etc, just pick up and play.

The four factions added are plants, the Russian bear Calvary, steampunks, and ghosts, each of which, just like in the original, play completely differently.

A very good expansion.  Does exactly what it says on the tin.  All of the factions are useful and well thought out.  I especially like that they've tried to bring in a very tactical deck in the Ghosts.  The problem is though that they're a slow burn in a fast paced game.  The Bear Cavalry are awesome.

Overall I like this expansion, although it brings absolutely no new mechanics to the base game.

In fact, this expansion changes nothing. It only adds more playable factions to the game and a few more scoring bases.

While each faction brings different abilities, nothing is changed in the game overall.

With that, I do not view this expansion as good, nor bad. I view this expansion as completely neutral. However, I do like the new factions just for the variety and new possible combinations.

Due to the that, I think the original scoring of the game holds and does not change.

This was an impulse buy, which coincidentally so was the base game.  I bought the base game because it was inexpensive, looked interesting, I had heard positive things, and it seemed like a quicker/simpler game that I could add to my collection of mostly heavier stuff.  I didn't know much about it and was just not grabbed by it after playing.

I saw this on sale and bought it up thinking "new content for Smash Up might help the game out!"  It doesn't.  It's only 4 new factions and they feel the same as the ones we already had.  There are literally no new rules.  The rulebook for the expansion is a carbon copy of the old one right down to recommending you buy 2 copies so two players can play with the same faction!

I think Smash Up is dead in my eyes, it reminds me a lot of Quarriors.  Both games were so close to being good in my opinion and I bought expansions for both in search of that but neither company seems interested in doing anything new with the formula.

[-]I'm honestly surprised there hasn't been an expansion to this game with an entire deck of Sonic. Zombie Sonic, Wizard Sonic, Robot Sonic, Princess Sonic -- it practically writes itself! If you can't get the IP, just play it coy and have a "Blue Hedgehogs" faction instead.

The theme of the half-deck is "gotta go fast"; you can take extra actions or something, or have interrupt cards that can be played on others' turns. They all come with a draw at the end, and if you interrupt every other person in a single turn cycle you get some bonus. Is it balanced? Who cares! Raise the power level (what's the power level, guys? XD XD lelz *spork*) on the other factions and rely on randomness and chaos to level things out for you.[/-]

Expansion

Why we culled it: It left with the base game. See my more comprehensive comments on the base game entry for details. In general, all of the expansions are fairly similar from the standpoint that if they add a trope that excites you, it is probably worth adding to your collection if you're interested. Mechanically, they do differ and add new things, but they do a good job trying to keep it thematic, so you aren't missing much if the theme of an expansion doesn't grab you.

A must for Smash Up, and the only expansion that really keeps to spirit of the game, although they are already starting to lose it a little in this one.  Concepts like each faction being able to work as a noun or an adjective (of which the Bear Cavalry and Killer Plants are hard to wedge together), still intact though is the idea of combining ridiculous things together, which AEG quickly loses in subsequent expansions.

To write an entirely honest comment, I don't feel like the expansion is very balanced. Before the expansion I felt like there weren't too many combinations that were unstoppable. Certainly no single deck was a power house over the others.

With the addition of Steampunk I no longer feel this way. You can combine Steampunk's action manipulation with any race and it seems nearly unstoppable. I've seen several first time players that are still learning the rules win with Steampunk handily.

The problem is they are self-contained power. They do not rely on the other deck to boost them into competitive power. Instead, by boosting all of their (arguably) weak minions with all their action cards, and making those action cards and minions untouchable, I fail to see how this set was playtested more than just a handful of times.

Other than that it rocks though. I love the Killer Plants especially. And it's nice to get VP tokens. Not sure why they weren't in the base set.

A good expansion to the smash up core game.  It includes the factions of Bear calvary, killer plants, ghosts, and steampunks.

RATING: N/A
Incorporated into the game forever, all of the factions are fun to play with (maybe ghosts less so, but if last player is experienced and goes with ghost/something that cycles cards quickly, better watch out) and the art is suitable.

Awesome exapnsion (dare I say over 9000?). The decks offer unique gameplay styles and really add to the base game.

Base game is cool. I bought this due to the amazing art on the box.  It's just more of the same.

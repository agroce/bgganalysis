Picked up at Origins 2007, with PAINTED MINIs!!!  It IS missing six orc spearmen, and three of the skaven and three of the snotlings are unpainted, but still...what a great deal.  

Just finished playing with my brother, and what a game!  We had to bend the rules a little bit to keep our characters alive, but then we started on a random dungeon, not the beginner's one.  Can't wait to continue the adventures of Baramorn, Elrick, Rhododendron, and Comstock the Strange!  

[update] After many great adventures in the summer of 2007 with Tex, Gimley, Hero, and Tsuro, I have packed up the game.  With Jeremy in Kenya, I figured it was time to clean up the boards from the last unfinished battle.  In a few years, when he gets back, maybe we'll look at old character sheets and chuckle over how completely frickin' broken Jeremy's character was!

My first love. So many hours spent under the Old World as a teenager, so many memorable moments that stick with me to this day.

This is a game I'd be afraid to ever get out again for fear of it just being a bit crap by today's standards. The memories alone earn it a permanent place on my shelf though.

A game I searched for many years before finding my copy. I've had a lot of fun with this game, the randomness of the game can cause some extremly funny moments. Played it both as a classic boardgame and as a Roleplaying game. It truley shines with some house rules.

I'd rate this a 10 except there are some minor rules quibbles. It's an older game, but it still looks great, plays great and has some of the best campaign rules for games of this genre. Well worth tracking down, but probably expensive to pick up. I thought I had lost my copy for 5 years and was incredibly surprised to find it at the bottom of the closet. Yay me!

This is out of print, and costs too much to buy second hand. So I decided to make my own copy with Hirst arts plaster tiles and printed cards. I also include the grey mountains online expansion which makes it a more coop game. 

I really like this game, but I´ve heard it can be brutal to the players, TPK are frequent, especially in the lower levels.

RATING: 5
Really got into it due to the old 3d dungeon crawler theme, unfortunately GW stuffed it with  not properly supporting the game with expansion packs after the first two and too many extra characters (an extra character one per expansion packs would have been the way to go)... where are the cards to generate chaos demons etc.....

a good remake of Advanced Heroquest, only partially limited by the need to use only some given pieces of the boards. But the ample space for custom rules makes this game THE definitive dungeon crawl. Very nice playabilty even in solo games!

Along with Blood Bowl perhaps the best of the specalist games spin offs. The original is far superior in almost every way over the bland and cut down Age of Sigmar version.

Best played customised rather than simply out of the box. Combine with a vast quantity of citadel miniatures and Warhammer RolePlay for the ultimate dungeon crawler.

+ Fun mindless random dungeon bash. Has a predetermined random dungeon setup with exploration, lots of dungeon games lack this. Easy to add to and modify the game.
- Extremely luck based, lacks tactical play. Leveling doesn't scale well and each character ends up with '50' attacks that bogs the game down. Wizard seems more like a healer.

RATING: 9
Old school Dungeon Crawl game. Can be played with 1-4 players and, if someone acts as a GM, a few more could join in the mayhem. Lots of expansion material and the ability to have A GM to create additional quests/rules, points to a ton 'o gaming fun beyond the base set. Oh, yes; as it is set in the Warhammer universe players have ALL that material to draw on....conceivably creating the best Lite RPG ever. I've played about 10 solo and 2-player games - and ALL characters were killed every time!! Still would play again, but I must paint those figures; in my opinion nicely painted figures contribute greatly to the appeal (and let one look kindly on any perceived flaws in the game itself) of GW tabletop games.

I liked this game and played with my friends for quite some time.  It fit well into the gap left when we lost our copy of Hero Quest.  With the expansions the game made for a nice RPG light game.  Unfortunately we played it so much that we reached the extent of the repalyability of the game.  I have not been able to find my copy of the game and have no desire to give Games Workshop anymore money even if they decided to reprint it again.

Nice looking hack'n slash romp of a dungeon crawler with minis and beautiful tiles. Have to be in the right mood because it's fiddly. I find the two combat phases per turn VERY tedious... Roll for this , roll for that, add, substract... 

A typical level takes 1-2 evenings. Without a Dungeon Master I'd rate it much lower.

This is the perfect game for all your dungeon crawling, character advancement, spiky bit, min maxing, RPG Lite, needs.  I have had so much fun playing this one over the years.  Super deadly, overly eventful, dumb looking character art, silly mechanics, but oh so very fun.  It's as if Dungeonquest and Advanced Heroquest got married and had a kid, this would be thir offspring.  Deadly, raucus, fun, and always quite memorable, even the time my "badass" Trollslayer was killed in the first room by rats.  It's STILL fun. Only drawback is that it is OOP and really hard to find the ridiculously overpriced character packs and expansions sets, of which I have 2 characters and no more.  Wait, I do have all the item packs, and those are pretty cool.  A must puchase.  Do it!

RATING: 6
Role play lite, dungeon hack heavy.  I have to admit of all the GW games this one is pretty fun.  Of course, they always seem to drop their best games.  Lots of expansions true to the GW creedo of not giving you the whole game at once.  I bought them all and owned them all.  Kids love to play it, and I've gotten the adults to play the role-playing version which works pretty well.  You could never get enough miniatures to reflect all the monsters in the book.  Random dungeon generation is cool, you don't need a game-master, really improves on the old Hero Quest/Advanced Hero Quest idea, actual advancement for your characters.  One problem the game has after a while is that the game doesn't adjust well to higher level characters.  Traps against say a 6th level character are nothing more than a nusience, it starts falling apart at higher levels.  Probably because they never actually thought anyone would play that high.  Typical poor GW play-testing...if they even play-test.  It gets a 6 cause it's kind of fun, but mostly cause it comes with a TON of cool stuff.  I read an article one time where a guy actually calculated the cost to be able to field all the miniatures in the monster charts in the back of the role-play book.  It totaled $22,000 and that didn't duplicate any miniatures.  Hows that for expensive?  Prices are high on Ebay these days, too high.  Save your money and spend it on many much better board games that cost a lot less.  By the way, this doesn't even come CLOSE to Avalon Hill's Magic Realm.  Got tired of the limited replay action.  Sold on eBay and made like a $500 profit.  Go figure.

I have played this game many, many times and have liked it every time.  I played a home-brewed variant of this with a bunch of friends as a Role-play-lite.  It was a blast, some of my favorite gaming moments over a long life of gaming.  

My wife and I have played the normal rule version many times and we painted the doorways together in our early years of marriage.  I would like to think that she liked dungeon crawling, but looking back I think that it had more to do with being together than slaying rats, bats, Orcs and Goblins.

Tremendous dungeon-hack game aims right for the hearts of the "roll-player" crowd.  Kill stuff.  Collect loot to make it easier to kill more stuff.Original rule set the typical mess of inconsistency and lack of cohesion from this publisher.Never have I seen a game-EVER-with better production values.Requires real dedication, done right, from the players.  Expect a big time sink.  (Expect to spend time fiddling with/compiling/interpreting rules to achieve real balance).

It's a mystery to me that this game hasn't seen a new edition.  It's wildly popular on the secondary market.

Mediocre dungeon crawl.  The monster placement rules (pop out next to the party, evenly assigned) mean the game is nothing more than a dice-fest - minimal opportunity for tactics.  The game can also take way too long if you roll a bunch of 1's for power rolls.  It's fun if the game lasts 90 minutes, but it often drags out to 2 - 3 hours.

The RPG rules are interesting in that they start by adding a campaign system to the basic game with leveling up characters, adding equipment, increased monster difficulty, etc. and eventually expand the game out into a full-blown RPG.  I've never played the full RPG game, so I don't know how it compares to something like D&D.

It may have been remarkable in its day, but more modern games like Descent: Journeys in the Dark and Castle Ravenloft have improved upon WHQ in every way.  I can't see myself playing WHQ anymore.

Fun game that caught the fire of my youth. We played the hell out of this and my favorite elements were the vicious town (with an event deck that felt like we lived in Compton) and all those charts of enemies in the adventure book. Game felt limitless.

However, the regular dungeon crawl gameplay was not fantastic. It was pretty basic and sloggy, with enemies following simple and bland AI of charge right at you. The dungeons didn't quite feel mysterious or evocative and the experience is heavily propped up on nostalgia.

A good solid game but not the be-all end-all everyone makes it out to be.

Great components but the gameplay is utterly atrocious. A skirmish level adventure game where the characters essentially never manoeuvre = ridiculous.

There are many far better fantasy Dungeoncrawl games out there. They range from pretty complex ([gameid=17226]) to simple ([gameid=699], [gameid=6366]).  

Pretty much all of them will probably suit your needs better than this hilariously overpriced and wildly over-rated garbage.

I rate it as "4" because of the good components, nothing else.

Avoid.

Great fun in the style of Heroquest and Talisman.  While "Dungeons & Dragons" got me into role-playing, Warhammer Quest got me into miniatures and renewed my love of the game many years later.  A fairly simple system, but the charts for travelling and staying in town are a blast!  Great for the overworked GM who needs a break or wants to be a player for a while.

As a side note, I've had luck converting non-gamers into gamers using games like this.  My wife is living proof!  She was very skeptical of my role-playing ways prior to trying this game.  The fact that it was more like a boardgame made it easier to grasp... and before she knew it, she was hooked!  Since then she has become at least the role-player I am!  I freely admit that it's a "roll" playing game, but it's one of the best at what it does, and is one of the better gateway games to RPGs that I know of.

As well, this game *can* be played as a regular role-playing game, and in fact the rules are constructed such that they are an intro to role-playing games in general.  There are sections for monsters, GMing, and even an adventure to be run by a GM.  Very similar in style and function to the older D&D sets (like the Red Box, near to my heart).  Of course, the system is more like Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay than D&D, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

This is in response to GW's request to have most of their player aids and rules references pulled from BGG. While I understand that it is within their rights to do so, I also believe that their is such a thing as being NICE. That is, as long as someone isn't hurting you, you should be good to them, even if it is with in your rights to be a grade A jerk. I find people that are jerks in these situations to be extremely, extremely annoying. So annoying, in fact, that the annoyingness transcends all rules, game types, and genres. Needless to say, Warhammer Quest falls within this category and therefore gets a "2" rating, as it is 'extremely annoying". On the bright side, it is still not as bad as You Can't Check Me, not that I would ever buy either one or ever suggest to anyone one else ever to do the same.

Warhammer Quest can be played by 4 or more people and with or without a Game Master, however I find this game to be at its best when playing with a GM and 4 players that each control one character.

An old classic, but also overrated. What most fans don't mention on the forums is that to get the most out of this game you need to buy hundreds of dollars worth of extra Games Workshop (or similar) miniatures so that your characters can progress through their levels over various games (not absolutely necessary, but its the only way to get the "whole" experience the game is meant to deliver). The minis that come with the game only cover the basic gameplay levels.

RATING: 9
This is a great game. I have not played a better dungeon crawl style game. I love the fact that there is no GM, yet the rules on how the game flows, how to place monsters, etc are excellent. There is tremendous depth with random campaign style adventures.

I love that you can play solo without having to play both sides, but the game really shines if you are lucky enough to have 3 other people to play with. Some of my best gaming memories are me, three friends and this game.

Yes, as you progress it gets a bit more clunky as you gain more abilities, and there is a bit more bookkeeping with the monsters as they start to have randomly generated equipment at higher levels (hence the one star knocked off). But, the replay value is through the roof as no dungeon is ever the same. Great game - if only GW could see their way to allow it to be reprinted/relicensed! I know I'd be one of the first in line!

The best thing about this game is that it is a fully self generating dungeon crawl,
DO not try to RPG this game, there are better options if RPG is your thing.  If you just want to throw some dice, kill some monsters, find a magic sword and level up, without any need for planning or preparation, this is your game.

Biggest complaint extra characters weren't balanced very well.

RATING: 6
Rating based on 1 play. Somehow it didn;t appeal to me as I much as I anticipated. It certainly didn;t feel like playing an advanced version of Heroquest. Actually, the added complexity of Warhammer Quest seemed irrelevant compared to HQ. The possible actions are the same as in HQ. Move, Attack, Cast a spell. So why make it more difficult?

Enorme juego de games workshop que, aun a dia de hoy, podria estar vigente por su excelente mecanica en el modo (todos contra el juego). El modo de juego con MASTER, le otorga el privilegio de no tener rival como rol/juego de mesa basado en la fantasia medieval.

Way too random, and I love talisman.  Too many opportunities for characters to instantly die if you roll a 1 on a d6.  Never saw a character make second level.  However, this game might work if it there were a gamemaster, and the the magic system was tweaked a bit.

Good for a laugh.  The masterless and random dungeon actually works.  The treasure cards are cool.  On the downside, WQ has a long set up time, requires a lot of space and constant fiddling, is repetitive, dicey, and very very difficult.  Your enjoyment will depend on your tolerance of these issues.

My copy of this game is missing quite a few pieces eg. no character tokens, missing dwarf, elf, and wizard, and orc miniatures. The roleplay book is also missing some pages from the end and the L2 monster table. I do have the Imperial Noble, Chaos Warrior, and Pit Fighter expansions as well as all the treasure card expansions. 

I played it a lot in my adolescence. I remembered it being a lot of fun and playing with a slew of house rules. I decided to try it again on my girlfriend with the rules as written because she liked pandemic's co-op aspect. 

She wasn't all that into it because she didn't care for the fantasy theme, and I had to proxy a lot of things using my other Warhammer miniatures. It may have helped if I had the appropriate miniatures to represent the characters and monsters. I don't see this getting played much in the future.

I got my copy back when it first came out, which was a steal at $60 for what it came with. The Roleplay Book remains the master-stroke for this type of dungeon-crawl game, offering incredible areas for expansion, new modes of play, and just a treasure trove of ideas. 

The base game is incredibly punishing for the players, due almost entirely to the power-die roll and the encounter system. It can be impossible to get out of the first room as new monsters continuously spawn, even as you're battling with the old ones. 

The modular board and DM-less system was dazzling when it was first released. Many games have copied this system. Advanced Heroquest did some of it first, but that was practically an unreleased game in the States. 

The hero packs are expensive, but help balance the game. The heroes from Deathblow and Citadel Journal are also a ton of fun, although not always balanced. 

The Roleplay book has rules for almost every Warhammer creature and monster that was being made at the time. Lizardmen were added with the first Deathblow magazine. 

Hugely nostalgic for me. Sometimes fun to play.

I bought this game for 40% off because it was the store display copy, and it was the best dollar value for any game I've owned.  I played it all the time in high school and college.  It's a great way for getting your D&D fix.  Even if you survive the gamut of terrors the dungeon throws at you, it's likely you'll lose all your money on the trip home through no fault of your own.  Ah, good times.

One of the best dungeon crawls ever slapped in a box...and what a box it was.  Fluffy rulebooks crammed with gorgeous art, loads of floor tiles, heaps of treasure, and enough plastic miniatures to choke a...thing that eats plastic miniatures--a cat, maybe.

This is one of the few Games Workshop games that truly deserves its hefty price tag; if anything, its original MSRP of $60 was an absolute steal.  The miniatures alone were worth over $60 bucks, considering it came with what was essentially a starter greenskin army's worth of orcs and gobbos.  It's all the fun of a dungeon crawl, without the need of a dungeon master!

I wish GW would reprint this gaming masterpiece, whose only flaw is that it didn't come with miniatures for all of the hundreds of different threats listed in the Quest Book.

The system isn't perfect.  In fact, I HATE that the monsters just 'leap out of the shadows' but I've got to say that this game gets a LOT of play.

If you do the campaign stuff and try to build up characters it's even more fun.  The best thing about this system is that the mortality rate for your characters is so high.  We would lose at least one character per dungeon and some nights we'd see weeks worth of work swallowed by a nurgle demon.  But when a game is this tough on you, survival really feels great.  You EARN it.

Perhaps the most underrated of the minis-quest genre. Games Workshop's neglected stepsibling to its Warhammer minis lines, this game is a d6-based monster-fighting game with a bunch of expansions and a lot of fan site support back when it was available (an all-too-brief period in the mid-to-late 1990s). I have two sets' worth of the base game in one box, and all the expansion character boxes. Part of why this didn't last, imho, was the high price ($80 for the boxed game with character add-ons for $15), but, hey, it's Games Workshop. You looking for something cheap from THEM?

This game is really the best dungeon game of all time.  I can't believe I got rid of this when I stopped games during my post high school "cool" phase.  This game, from recollection, is really good.  It's certainly better than Heroquest and better than most GW efforts.  The kind of production that went into this game is, IMHO, even more than FFG could possibly do and it shows.  The full quest angle is, particularly, unmatched.

Wish I still had this game, though I know I probably wouldn't use it.

I have finally secured myself a copy of this treasure. It's been years since I've played, but I enjoyed the game greatly. I'm certain the Lady would like this as well, as she's a big fan of adventure/dungeon crawlers. Just don't tell her how much it cost me to get nearly everything on eBay. It's far more than anyone should ever have to spend on a single board game, but it's SO worth it.

The purely co-op aspect is what really got me pining to get my hands on a copy of the game again. I had it years ago, and gave it away (stupid me!), but now I have it again and I'm a happy man!

This was THE definitive dungeon crawler; No DM, and campaign play, with an easy (if a bit unbalanced) combat system. Even with the limited number of expansions available, you'll never tire of this game if you seek a well-rounded dungeon crawler with character development and campaign-style play.

Like the usual Games Workshop fare, it's meant to sell minis. In order to actually play with all the monsters on the tables in the Roleplay book, I'd estimate you'd have to spend over $1000 to get everything. That said, if you have minis collecting dust, this game helps get that dust off of them and get some use.
If you want a dungeon crawler, spring for a copy on eBay. It's worth every penny.

It had to be sold to finance my unemployment. Ah well, it didn't make it to the table much because of the length anyways. A fine game for sure.

Now that it's on iOS devices, I can still get my fix, and avoid the ridiculous set up time and tear down. The only bad mark on the iOS version is that it's usual GW fare; soak your fans for as much as possible.
To get the 'full' experience, all of the IAP's will add up to over $40; a bit much for an app TBH.

One other thing to note; once you reach level 6 or 7, expect to run out of gold, and only be able to level up one character in your party for every 6 dungeons or so. It seems that the app was designed to force you to buy gold with IAP's so you can level your doods.

That said, it's still fun, but when 3 out of 4 members of your party are almost to the next level before you can afford to level them up (and by this I mean all 4 of your guys will have enough XP to get them halfway to level 8 before you can afford to level ONE of them up to level 7), there might be a problem with how the app is designed - then again, this is GW, and the licensing fees are probably ridiculous. So, Rodeo Games has to pay for it some how.....

A worthy successor, or rather a revamp, of Advanced Heroquest. They fixed most of the issues, and the sheer amount of custom, fan-made characters out there should make this one of the best dungeon-crawlers out there. At least in terms of variability and RPG'esque elements, but the rules for fighting, in addition to the lacking customization of any particular class, is somewhat simpler and less intense than, for instance, Descent:JitD

A very good game. It is both deep and replayable unlike many other games. Meaning that you can play again and the game will not be the same twice. Also, unlike games like Descent and the like, it is not based on a scenario making it highly replayable. Also, you can make a campaign, which is highly recommended since heroes get stronger each time, in the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay world.

There was also a way to transform your game into a role playing one within the same box!

Quite underrated by the community.

RATING: 6
I generally like Games Workshop and the Warhammer Universe, and the nice thing about this one is that it's self-contained and more affordable than those miniatures battles games.

But tabletop battlegaming this is not (unfortunately).  Basically, it's HeroQuest (which I also owned), a little more advanced and set in the Warhammer setting.

It's not really a role-playing game, more of a hack-and-slash dungeon crawl. I found it fun for a while as a teen, but now I don't think I could bring myself to play it, due to the lack of strategy and tactics involved. Like most co-op games I have played, it really seems to lack any tension, and no thinking or planning required.

It does have a campaign element, in which you can advance levels and experience bonuses (or major setbacks) "between adventures", which is kind of fun but also can be infuriating (you can die instantly, just by rolling a couple dice. "We're going to need another Timmy!") 

A good game for 13-year-olds, maybe, who are fascinated by the medieval fantasy theme and figurines but who are not fond of actual RPGs (I personally prefer actual role-playing much more than rolling dice over and over and seeing what happens.)

Played as one-off dungeons, without any expansions, I'd say the game rates about a six.
But if you play with the full "RPG" (read: campaign) rules, you bloody well don't need any expansions--everything's in the massive 190+ page book. And then, this still rates a six. You see, it all hinges on what you get in the objective room--roll badly once on 3+ rolls and you'll be swamped. And the thing is still a dicefest. 
So there's Descent, an overlong slogfest, and WQ, of a reasonable length but flukey as all get out. It could be house-ruled, I suppose, but I can't be bothered. Such a waste!

When I moved to do uni, ('98), I left my stuff (and the WHQ players) 800km behind, and so had to find a new game...and DnD was it.  Now I use some of the figures from this (and HQ) and their expansions, as well as ideas etc, in my games od DnD.

Again, a good game, more complex (and thus rewarding) than HQ, but no where as detailed or full of options as DnD.

RATING: 9
WHQ was a grail game for me for many years, as something I always longed for was to relive the ole' days of D&D playing youth, and this seemed like the closest way to do that, especially if you only had 2 players and still wanted too have the experience.  

Sometimes games held in this kind of regard and on this kind of pedestal disappoint, happy to say not this time. An incredible amount of work went into this game, and as much as I loathe GW for the horrible way they treat fans, they really created something extra special here and really went the extra mile to do so it really shows. 

In 2014, STILL nothing has surpassed the amount of content and awesomeness this game has. Shadows of Brimstone is pretty much WHQ 2.0 as a TON was lifted straight out this to create it, but there is a LOT of cool stuff in the WHQ 175 page Roleplay book and the SoB book does not come close to it, though the main elements were taken. 

Descent is good but is not on the same level and you also need a DM, D&D adventure games not even close, don't even get me started on the fluffy flip a card then roll Pathfinder card game, nope, I've pretty much played or reviewed them all and there just are no others that do what this game has done, WHQ is still the king, and the closest thing to playing D&D without actually doing it. 

Note though, Kingdom Death Monster is a wild card here, it is also heavily influenced by WHQ and it "could" be an amazing adaptation (not a 2.0, something slightly similar but with many many differences) and a huge hit, or it could also fall completely flat, trouble is rules have not been released so no one knows for sure, but I bought into it so will know soon. 

Tidbit - becareful about judging a game like this based on the iOS version, its going to feel completely different playing with a couple of friends in person

Another curious 10 for me, but this is easy.  This is just about a perfect game for me.  Dungeon crawling with tons of variety, infinite capacity for personalization and no GM.  And it works!  I suspect that this is probably #2 on the "time I've spent playing" list, behind Magic:  The Gathering and ahead of Space Marine/Epic 40K.

Great game, especially suitable for solo play.  Dungeon crawler with good depth and feel.  Don't always like the way the rules/cards are depicted (mostly in the descriptions, to be fair; and I feel that the magic points system results in either feast (with appropriate magic items) or famine (without them!)but you know what's great about solo games - change it if you don't like it!  :)

Note:  I got this with all the expansions at the same time (a sweet eBay deal at the time, if I remember right) so I really don't know about the game without the expansions...

This is a decent dungeon crawl game.  There are lots of characters, mosters to fight, and treasure to gain.  The campaign rules are simply terrible though.  You often LOSE EVERYTHING you fought to gain in your last dungeon, at the whim of a random die roll.

Despite a few faults, I still think this is probably the best game Games Workshop ever put out.

The components for this game are great and if you're into RPGs they're probably worth getting your hands on. Unfortunately however, this game does not have much replay value unless you use a DM.

RATING: 7
If I rated a game on components alone this would get a 20. WOW! was this game packed. It had it all, "Heroquest" but better. Full of minis, rules for solo play, rules for one off games, rules for campaign games, rules for play without a DM, rules for play with a DM. I played it again about a year ago with my son and it seemed to lack a bit. We were both feeling a bit like "is that it?". I really need to play this again but I have a feeling it will be hard to stack this against "Descent". Especially for the money it tends to fetch.

UPDATE:I've tried this a couple of times after my initial rating and have dropped it 3 points. There really isn't much of a game here. There are no strategic or tactical decisions. A monster pops out at you and you roll to hit it. Some of the cards are broken witout house rules. And I think the stupidist part is a one causes an event, when your wizard is at his weakest, that's when the monsters come, and if you get 2 or 3 of them in a row "say goodnight Gracie". It's not the worst game in the world but it's not worth the price it's getting.

Updating the update: Raised it back up a few points. I have been playing it solo lately and while there is not much depth to a one off game. A one off game is still O.K. And if you manage to survive you can try out the roleplay.

Wow, I played this game so much in the late 90's!

Actually, this one's heading for revival as soon as possible, either as a "beer & pretzels game" or as a wannabe RPG again - but in RPG form we never got past level 7, since at that level the game becomes too demanding regarding rules and amendments, if I remember correctly.

It was all about endless rules checking and  rolling multiple dices for this single monster with 30 attacks per turn, adding slime, vomit, infections, bad breath and cracking whip attacks, making it feel less like a game and more like a straining 2 hours session with your favourite SM dominatrix!

For sheer playability no matter whether you want to play a one-off dungeon or a campaign lasting several months, this is the game for you.  Not only is it fun to play, but it has some of the best plastic minis to ever come out on the market.  If you can find a copy, buy and love it.

A modular fantasy adventure game in the Warhammer world. Players cooperate to accomplish a mission. The vast majority of time is spent fighting monsters and exploring the dungeon. Unfortunately, games tend to drag on for a long time when dice results are unfavorable and players usually have a great deal of difficulty surviving. There is a diverse set of available characters and monsters (though you'll need a good supply of miniatures). The game truly shines in campaign mode where the characters travel to towns and improve their stats, skills, and equipment.

I played the crud out of this game when it game out but then two things started to bother me so bad I had to shelve it.  First, I just couldn't get over the basic d6 combat system.  It was too simplistic and just left me craving for something a bit more involved.  Second,  I'm one of those people that has to have a miniature for every monster when I'm playing dungeon-crawls.  The idea of having to mortgage my house in order to flesh out the miniatures needed to advance my heroes to battle-level 10 was beyond astounding.  That pretty much sunk the last nail in the coffin for me buying Games Workshop miniature games.  I've since sold all of my Warhammer Quest stuff for a ton of money :)  I now play a house-ruled version of Descent to get my dungeon-crawl itch scratched......waaaaay better IMO.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This seems to have become something of a collector's item in recent years, and I can't fathom why. It's distinctly a mid-90's Games Workshop "squad-building game" from the same stable as Blood Bowl, Necromunda and Gorkamorka, and is worse than two of those. The randomness that can make those three entertainingly brutal doesn't work when you have a single character each rather than a team. Having 1 character out of 11  killed by a random event is galling but you can laugh about it; when it's 1 out of 1 it becomes rage-inducing.

It's OK for running one-off dungeons rather than campaigns, but even then there are better dungeon crawls available. There just isn't enough variety in either monsters or dungeons here.

Still, I'm glad it's made a name for itself, because it meant I could sell it on at a decent price! :D

I loved this game to death when I first got it, and in many ways it is still the leader in its genre, but...

There is too much luck in the combat system, and not enough differentiation between classes. This is due a single D6 being used to determine chances of hitting. Since a 1 always misses, and a 6 always hits, the difference between the weapon skill of different characters rarely amounts to much difference. A 20-sided die would allow for more consistency, and would make incremental improvements to character stats more apparent.

The system for generating random dungeons (so that all players are cooperating) is disappointing. Monsters don't have an AI script like they do in, say, Wrath of Ashardalon; instead monsters either have a single attack (random target), or a dice roll determines a random event. It's hard to formulate any sort of strategy.

Played with a GM, the game is considerably better, but then it's in a far more prolific genre of dungeoncrawlers, with many better alternatives.

I'll always keep my copy of Warhammer Quest for the sheer nostalgia, but there are better games that I would choose to play.

WHQ is full-bore fun, despite some flaws. The sheer amount of awesome goodies in the box, the pleasure of the self-contained character expansion packs, the "automated GM" aspect, the atmospheric tiles, the over-the-top scenarios, and the fun of dungeon crawling all add up to one hell of a game.

There's some sloppiness in the rules, and the town element tends to get repetitive, but both are easy enough to resolve with a bit of tinkering. This is a game I miss playing regularly -- to get the full experience, you really need to play a bunch of sessions in a row.

I have a full set minus a goblin and a bat.  I have my eye on ebay to get another just in case.  This is my favorite board game by far.  The best way to describe it is halfway between Dungeon and Dungeons & Dragons.  Also, it was probably the first game to have randomized board sections.  The downside to it is that to play it to level 10, you have to buy about a thousand minatures and paint them.  However, it's enjoyable right out of the box to play a level 1 dungeon.  Another thing that I must mention is that it is really a hard game to win.  Even if you have a good grasp of the rules and strategy, the water wagon will eat you.

I enjoyed that Games Workshop remade this game, but I would be more excited if they just rereleased the classic game and added warscrolls and physical cards to their website.

Yes, it's the dungeon crawl daddy.  Only because no one before or since has put in as much effort and/or theme.  The campaign system is just brilliant, even if the whole thing is completely random as hell.  The game itself is clunky, fiddly and repetitive and can become easier at the higher levels, but because of the depth and scope of the campaign rules and levelling up to epic scale, nothing quite touches it yet.  Even if there are other games that play more smoothly...

Can't sell. I like a lot of elements of this. I wouldn't mind blending this and AHQ a bit. Secret door searches, the AHQ matrixes made into WHQ style cards. 
 I would like to play a D-Crawl that is vast yet really tight with no GM, cards to generate maps on the fly with elegant possiblies for individual class co-op interaction. I am sure there is a better solution to what I have seen so far but it is all subjective and different games bring different stuff.

With its Dungeonless Master system its still the ultimate
Duengon crawl game.

Still it was more of a game kit than a game.The base game suffered from
a Monty Hall Dunegon (3 goblins one ecounter-6 skeletons the next).
The two expansions helped to give it some focus & of course you had
the entire GW Old World to brew your own dunegons.

The Campaign system was a nice touch & gave an overall rational
for crawling around all those duengons.

My very favorite hack and slash dungeon crawling game. It can be played almost as well solo as with other players. I say almost as well, because at higher levels the characters have a lot to keep track of AND the monsters become more and more complex as well.

Also, I enjoy GMing for other players of the game in a private online gaming community.

There are some difficulties in the rules, but if this kind of game is for you, then you probably do not mind tweaking the rules or creating some house rules to help.

If you like creating and/or using custom characters in your games, Warhammer Quest is a great game in which to do so. I have created a goodly number of fairly (or even greatly) complex characters -- one of my favorites is the Friendly Giant. The Martial Artist was the first of my Warhammer Quest creations. Anyone wanting to see many of the custom things available (by me and by many others) may visit [url=http://www.goodsandgoodies.com/WQ/][b]Old Warrior's Stronghold[/b][/url]. Many Warhammer Quest custom things are found there -- all totally free for all. :)

I am thinking of uploading my own custom creations here at BGG for quick access for all my future WHQ custom stuff fans. ;) (pending approval by BGG of course)

... But, remember that most of my custom characters are a bit more complicated than most of the original WHQ warriors (Warrior Packs included), though the Outlaw, Bounty Hunter, and the Chaos Warrior characters are probably more on my level of complication.

Some of my custom characters are definitely [b]not[/b] from the Warhammer World, but I have some flavor text to explain how they arrived, or how they could have arrived, to be adventuring in the Warhammer World.

Also, I highly recommend [url=http://wquest.free.fr/][b]The Museum[/b][/url]. A site dedicated to Warhammer Quest which hosts many custom creations for the game.  That site inspired me to start my own site while The Museum was temporarily unavailable.

I can't tell you how many hours I have wasted on this game.  Luckily, we always make new characters, because I fear the game may be lacking once you get to higher levels.  

Edit:  As I feared, the game is a little lacking once your characters develop.  With lvl 3/4 characters, the players just breeze through the dungeon.  Guess its time to paint those ogres and dragons I have sitting around.

I wanted this for Christmas one year and I kept opening presents and I didn't get it.  My parents said they couldn't find it and I think I went to the Sword and the Phoenix? later on and picked it up.  This is a great dungeon crawler put together with a really crappy RPG system.  If you forget the RPG system and just play it as a board game it's great.

I still use the miniatures and the tiles for this game for my D&D sessions.

RATING: N/A
Classic dungeoncrawler. Lots of characters to choose from, lots of monsters to fight.

Note: I haven't played the game in over a decade, so bear in mind that these comments are based on unreliable memories.

Random dungeon generation. Each time featuring a randomly picked objective room, each of which has several possible quests connected to it. Lots of replayability, but it also means that there's a lack of overall direction and storyline, the campaign being linked only by the continuing involvement of the heroes (some improvement in the expansions).

Basic rules are solid. Advanced rules are sometimes confusing and unclear on how they are intended to integrate.

Realism takes the occasional holiday, as does fidelity to the Warhammer background. For instance, multiple copies of supposedly unique magic items are frequent, but only one item gets a special rule making it unique in the game. And there are no encumbrance rules, so we ended up with characters collecting dozens of (supposedly unique) Frostblades (once per dungeon, good thing I brought a spare), dozens of (supposedly unique) Crowns Of Sorcery (each can cast a random set of spells, collect 'em all!) and an almost complete set of Bane Swords (elfbane, skavenbane, orcbane, etc), but only ever found a single Hammer Of Sigmar. It became a running joke that we were followed around by 'sword caddies' handing us the appropriate weapon for whichever monster we encountered. "A Bloodthirster! Would sir prefer the Daemonbane, or a Frostblade?"

We also felt that the power-level scaled too generously. We lost plenty of level 1 characters, and a few level 2-3. By the time we reached level 4, we seemed to be in very little danger. Sure, the occasional monster might rough us up a bit, but we'd always have enough tricks up our sleeves to pull through. Literally the only level 10 warrior we ever lost was to a random event from staying in town too long.

Overall, I had fun with it back in the day, but I don't particularly miss it. If I was to rate (which I've decided not to do based on such a distant memory), I'd probably give it a 6-7.

I do miss Quarg hunting.

I sold my original copy of this years ago to fund myself through university. Unbeliveably, I have just been gifted a copy of this game by a fellow BGGer. I won't say who, but he knows who he is. 

I can assure you this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me and not something I will forget. Considering there are people on ebay trying to sell single figures for £15 each, I almost have to pinch myself that someone who I have never met in real life would do something so genuinely nice.

The copy I was given is now pride of place in my collection of vintage heavily themed board games. I would still buy a reprint in a heartbeat though.

As a grown-up I still play this game, guiding my group of Warriors through dungeons of my design as a long-suffering Games Master.

No other game has inspired me to create my own expansions, no other game has inspired me to create custom cards, and no other game has inspired me to create a website to document the adventures it has created.

This is the best that Games Workshop ever did. Once upon a time GW rolled a natural D20. Then shoved everything good and awesome they ever did into a big box and closed the lid.

Unfortunaly they have never done anything even remotely this good since. Even Spacehulk 3rd, for all it is - can't compete. This game is mucho expensive to pick up nowwa days and theres a reason for that (beside GreedBay)
This game is solid gold.

An insanely fun game when I and my friends were much younger.  Having busted it out recently and replaced all the minis, we had a blast with this for about a month then it lost all luster.  Suffered from the "Superman Syndrome," in which the dungeons and luck could obliterate starting parties (~75% of starting parties wiped out) [Kryptonite], but then once you level up and buy some stuff from town you become effectively invincible, especially after finding some of the better treasures [Invincibility].

I like WHQ. It's an oldie, but so much improved over HeroQuest that it is almost beyond belief.

In the game you select one of a couple of heroes. You use the heroes to move (up to speed) and attack. Moving is simple, until you are adjacent to a door with an unexplored edge. You can then explore and draw a room + event-card for the room. Sometimes monsters appear. 
Players place these monsters adjacent to the heroes. To attack, you roll a die in which you compare weaponskill. The better your fighter, and the weaker your opponent's weaponskill the more likely you are to hit (lower target number). After you hit, you roll D6 for damage and add a certain amount of damage. You then substract your opponent's toughness. If the damage is larger than thoughness+wounds the defender dies. If it was a melee attack, you may attack an other adjacent enemy. 
Ranged works a bit different (no additional attacks) and you are not allowed to be engaged in combat.

I liked WHQ. It is not very complicated and maybe with today's standards not top of the line anymore. But for the time period it's an excellent game I think. The miniatures are quite pretty, even by today's standards. 

My copy misses 1 door, 3 power tokens and apparently all of a sudden 2 orcs (1 fighter, 1 archer). Otherwise almost as new.

Great hero game and one of the few you can play without some one running it alone.  This one gets lots of play.  Compared to the recent crop of similar games like Descent, this one really holds it's ground.  This game was released with campaign play rules, which immediatedly raises it above the others that promise such a thing.  Even with only two hard to find expansions, this game was a real joy.  In my opinion, this game sets the high bar for mechanics and play.  Not only are the scenarios EASY to play with out a Game-Master, but adding a Game Master adds even more.

One of the few games that I will give a 10.  A coop game years before Pandemic and the like took off.  Great minis, pieces, and rule set.  It really shines in the campaign mode where you can take your character from game to game and level them up.  Very hard to find that even today.  Combat is fun straight-forward and role-playing can be as much or as little (none!) as you want.  I had spent many hours in high school playing this game with friends.  I'd kill for a re-release as I do not want to pay $400 for a used version!  And from what I've seen of the iOS app, that does not scratch the same itch as the physical game.

After 1 play. I think this is a game that is as fun as what one puts into it. I thought there'd be more strategy or tactics but it's basically a min-max hack 'n slash.

A fantastic fantasy game.  You get an amazing amount of stuff in the box!  Although the number of "mission types" is limited, the random nature of the game play makes them different each time you play.

RATING: 6
Fun game, easy for the kids to learn.  Teaches your kids the value of not rolling a 1 in GW games!  Have most all the expanded character packs.  Would still play the game, but it's difficult to survive if the party keeps rolling 1's in the magic phase.  Encounters can be a bit unbalanced too, in these situations.  Other than that, not a bad GW game.

Not quite as ruthless as Dungeonquest, but brace yourself--your character WILL die.  A lot of components for this game. Add to this the fact that it is so easy to modify this game to your tastes (add a table, create a character/monster)and you have a great game.

If you enjoy a sense of despair and hopelessness in a dungeon environment, this is the game for you.  Every scenario may as well be called the Alamo, because there is absolutely no rest from the continuous onslaught that awaits.  Playing with special characters may change the equation.  Playing with 4 is a must for even a shot at survival.

This game has probably consumed more of my free time than any other boardgame...not only in playing, but in writing up new characters and house rules.  We always play full cooperative; splitting the gold evenly instead of it being hogged by the person that killed the monster.  Random town events are annoying, and the game falls apart at higher levels.  My rating is a '8' with our house rules.

It's a very interesting, unique game. Some elements of D&D and Warhammer with a quick combat system.At this point, it's not worth the money it goes for, in my opinion. Buy Descent and hunt up a copy of old D&D and you'll have everything you want.

Like Talisman, great nostalgic value about this one, but it's SO bad compared to today's games.  Although we're yet to see any modern COOPERATIVE dungeon crawler that doesn't requiere some sort of DM.  That's something that worked well with WQ.

RATING: 1
Overly blatent cash grab. Owning all of the correct models to put in the dungeon would have cost hundreds of dollars.
Even worse it's just a really unbalanced game. Want to survive a brutal dungeon only to die in a city? It could happen. Want to fight a Bloodthirster in a level 1 dungeon? Possible. Want to never wound a monster after level 2? Play the elf.

I used to love this game. We downloaded and printed a huge book of random dungeon and world events that shot the replayability up to eleven. Of course somehow my Wizard got the same result, out of hundreds of possibilities, three times in a row - struck by lightning! Good memories with this one.

RATING: N/A
A very fun game, but requires quite a lot of components and optimal players is 5. Makes it hard to get sessions in on this game. On the other hand, it *is* easy enough to play with 2, 3, 4 or even solitaire versions without changing the rules at all. It's just at its best with 5 players.

A great little dungeon crawl for when your Roleplaying group is tired of thinking.  This one is so random you cannot help but laugh when the world caves in on you.  The adventures you have just getting to town from the dungeon are worthy of tall tales themselves.

My wife and I worked pretty hard to get this game and ALL of its official expansions several years ago. It doesn't get to the table as often as I wish it would but it always entertains when it does. Just a wonderful balance of dice-rolling, adventuring, monster-smashing and mystery. Great fun. Tons of awesome chrome makes it look great on the table as well.

Fantastic components, best visual quality of any game of its genre. Great batch of mini's. Difficulty levels excellent and brilliant system for when you don't have/want a GM. Some clever rules. Not enough supplementary material to take it to the level of playing regularily. To play more regularily you will need to collect hordes of miniatures and create new cards.

I have great memories of this from my teenage years. I've since gone back to it and discovered that much of the gameplay is random and arbitrary. When your level 40 million character can die without reaction due to a single event on the way back to town, you know that an aspect of a game is truly broken.

This is the best dungeon crawler out there. Period. The main advantage over other games in this category, is that you do not need a Game-/Dungeon Master to play it, but it still retains all the atmosphere of the games in which you do. Another advantage is that the quality of its components (miniatures, boards, cards, everything really) has never been matched by similar games. Not even by the recent FFG games. It is also a game that can be played by everyone -- gamers and nongamers alike. And the roleplay book makes it incredibly expandable. Really, the only drawback to this game is that is very expensive nowadays, just as it was when it was released. But my advice would be to buy it anyway when you have the chance (and like this sort of game).

While HeroQuest was the game of choice for dungeon plunging in my early teens, Warhammer Quest quickly took over as our go to game when it was released.  I remember a mate of mine had a job where he opened the changing rooms at one of the local sports facilities, and basically sat around until it was time to lock up, all the time getting paid by the hour.  We would turn up to play this in the kitchen at the site meaning he was getting paid while he played.  I’m sure he must have made thousands this way, given by how many hours we sunk into this.

Edit:  Due to GW's current lack of goodwill regarding the erasure of many fan made play aids on BGG I am lowering my want level of this game from "Love to have" to "Thinking about it".  Hopefully, GW will see the errors of their ways at that point I would raise my desire for their games.

RATING: 7
An old school dungeon crawl, this one is super dicey. The heroes tend to go through the monsters like a hot knife through butter, until they don't, because the dice say so. Still, despite the randomness and wssh, rinse, repeat nature of the encounters, it ends up being a lot of fun. There are some clever mechanics in the exploration system and although it is, again, dicey...I love the magic system. Not knowing whether or not you will be able to channel enough magic to cast your spells until the start of the next turn makes playing a mage tricky, but the system limits the power of the mage without requiring any tedious book keeping and a side benefit, adds a bit of excitement as well.

I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to track it down, but if you get a chance to play someone else's copy, it's a fun way to blow an afternoon. Or alternatively, just download the electronic version as iOS or Steam Apps,as they are near perfect translations.

i do not know why i didnt buy this when it was avaliable, but now i snagged a near  perfect and unused copy form e-bay for £50 which seems pretty god, excellent GW bits some what marred by simplistic game play, thoguh i am hopeing my as yet unread role play  book will make this opinion change.
 the way we are playing it at the moment seems to be almost impossibole for teh heros to get pass teh 2nd room! we may be  playing wrongly or it may just be teh profusion of 1's teh wizard rolls in the power phase! in a 6 game turn  he rolled 5 last time we played!

When I first got this years ago I was all excited about the figures and potential for dungeon questing.  For me it was too much effort for what I was hoping was more boardgame than RPG.  Games such as Descent have since far outpaced games such as this.  I think I have a few expansion for this as well but never got into it.

Very light roleplay game.  The base rules are very simple and can be played without a games master.  There are advanced rules, which I've had a lot of fun with, but which feel more like a stepping stone onto proper roleplay games.  This game may tempt you to buy huge amounts of miniatures in order to represent different dungeons.

My favorite dungeon-delving game. I liked the roleplay aspect of it and the variety in the gear. A bit messy to implement considering the figures the game required. I would also say that the game loses a lot of steam the more powerful the heroes get. It's about one-shotting the big guys before they one-shot you, and even if they do you have this piece of equipement that makes you insta-teleport to town with no damage done. A bit broken in that sense.

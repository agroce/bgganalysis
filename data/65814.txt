Fun.  That's it.  Just plain fun.  The rules are simple.  It's quick.  And the artwork is cute.  My 13 year old fell in love with it on the first game.  It's mostly the luck of the draw, but you can have a little strategy since there are symbols on each card that tell you the frequency of that card.  So, if you keep track of what's still out there, a little deductive logic could win the game.  I like it.  And I am certain I could teach it to my younger kids which was kind of the point.

It's very hard to come by well made games that my youngest kids can play and I can also enjoy.

RATING: 7
Plays out similar to Othello in terms of having similar cards at each end lets you capture those cards, but instead of just flipping colors you take the cards off the board.  Very quick and fun family game which adds in some strategy and a bit of memory by telling you how many of each card is in the deck so you can know if the other card will show up or not.

Decent game for younger kids.  My kids love many of the Gamewright games -- this is another good one, though it doesn't quite match the popularity of Rat A Tat Cat, Sleeping Queens or Duck Duck Bruce.  The cards are good quality and the artwork is terrific for kids, very typical for Gamewright.
Gameplay involves a bit of press your luck with a splash of memory thrown in.  There's a bit of strategy involved in deciding where to place your cards to attempt to minimize points gathered by other players, but for the most part, choices seem relatively obvious. Younger kids will be engaged, though, and the artwork draws them in (my kids always want to try to collect their favorite Dweebies).
Have played 2p and 4p and this seemed to work better as a 2p game.  My 5 y.o. daughter enjoys playing, my 8 y.o. son a bit less so.

The box says for 8 and up, but 8 would almost be the maximum age. I would recommend it for ages 5-14. 

My first couple of plays I thought I was missing something because there is little to no room for any sort of strategy. After a few more plays I realise it is pretty much all luck and would certainly dispute some of the reviewers saying there is room for strategy.

The artwork is cute and I like it, the game plays quick and is easy to learn. A nice game for kids, but even teenagers may find it a bit empty.

Unfortunately the boardgamer "expansion card" I got, I can't use. The colour of the back is slightly different, not to mention it is a slightly different size. No big deal though.

This is a great game for kids.  It is VERY simple and has wonderful cartoons.  I played several games with a 7 year old but I suspect it would work fine with a 6 year old.

Simple game aimed at children, you have a hand of dweebies and you play one each turn to a row or column of your choice. If the dweebie you placed matches the dweebie at the other end you pick up the entire row/column scoring one point for each card collected.

Simple and highly luck dependent.... they why do I consistently suck so badly at this game?!

Normally, I don't consider cuteness a reason to buy a game.  I bought this one because the graphics are sooo cute!

My daughter loves this game.  We played 3 games of it the first night we had it, she wants to make her own "Dweebie" to send in to Gamewright (they included a sheet for drawing and submitting your own).  I'd much rather play this with the younger kids, than play Chutes and Ladders, Candyland, and the lame yahtzee jr editions (Spongebob, Disney Princess, etc.).  There is some probability and reasoning/planning involved.

The art for the eponymous characters on the cards is really cute and entertaining. The game is kind of the opposite.  Dweebies player strategies are based on push your luck mechanics that are often disrupted due to heavy reliance on the luck of cards drawn.

Rating based on playing with children.  The kids really enjoy the game, probably because of the delightful artwork.  Still, the game is almost completely random based on luck of the draw, so it is a little frustrating.  Luckily, it is short so it doesn't really matter.  I'm happy to play it whenever the kids request it.

Super simple game, solid for the young crowd but otherwise a luck fest. Play a card orthogonally adjacent to another and then claim all the cards in that row or column if the card you played matches a card at the end of the row/column. Fantastic art!

In some ways [gameid=128554] took this idea to the next level. By adding powers and strengths to the cards along with scoring rather than removing cards from the "board".

The best thing about Dweebies was the art, which seems inspired by Maurice Sendak. It is a very simple game- there is a large deck of cards, showing various Dweebies. Some cards come in pairs, others are represented three or four times. Cards are added, one at a time, to a rectangular array: whenever two matching Dweebies appear at opposite ends of a row or column, the player who placed the second Dweebie takes all the cards in that line. Most cards at the end will win.

Dweebies is utterly simple, very much a game for younger children. But the art is very attractive.

You're trying to collect cards off the table by playing the match of a card already sitting at one end of a row, claiming the two matches plus all the cards in between. Most cards captured wins. There's 1 to 4 of each different type of card, so memorising what's been captured and recognising that holding onto these same types might not get you future matches is key. Or you can just play on a wing and a prayer, keep the cards that have 3 or 4 in their set and hope to get lucky. If you can't match anything on the table, play small-set cards so as not to create big long rows / columns that others might be able to capture (must be orthoganally adjacent to already played cards). Lastly, hope that you have exactly the same cards as the player on your right, because then, no matter how slack or good you've been, you'll win the game. There's no drama or tension in the game, it's just an average collecting game with no catch or real reason to seek out.

My youngest kids really like this game, but I just don't. The rules imply that there should be some strategy in how you play the cards, but in practice (at least with small kids) you just play a match if you have it. Maybe with older kids/adults the choices would actually happen, but then why would they want to play this?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.05
Not sure about this one.  It's obviously for kids, as the strategy (step pattern) is pretty simple and obvious.  But it's got three things going against it for young kids (e.g. 5 or 6 years old): holding a hand of cards, conflict (someone takes 'your' set), and the kludgey rule about filling in blank spaces when the mass gets separated.

Dweebies is a card game, which is perfect present for every child under his christmas tree. It allows him to have lots of fun with his parents, while playing. And therefore, you will make your children happy, even if you buy it another time. There are cute monsters hiding inside the metal box and they make you laugh. You are trying to make lines, which start and end with the same character. In that situation, you get to pick up the whole line and score it for points. Game has really easy principle, but is still entertaining and quick. Yes, it is often decided by chance, but that is compensated with a fact, that you will not find here any alphabet letter. Game is suitable for children even in preschool age from five and for small players all around the world without exception. Beautiful illustrations and family fun make Dweebies an excellent buy for any parent..

simple, fun for kids.  melody vasel likes.

Melody was right!  this is getting a lot of play with the 4 of us.  as usual for Gamewright, the game is beautiful.  Simple mechanics, and quite fun.  Our 4 year old wins as often as anyone, so fun for all.  Some limited strategy what with knowing the frequency of the cards in the deck - the 7 year old is picking up on that fast (with some nice bluffing... "well, i don't really have a good move, so i guess i will just put this card here.")

8 plays already and counting...

A cute quick game. Good to teach 'strategy' & 'probability'.

Actually, as these things go, not a bad kid's game (and one the adults won't mind playing along with them). Light and fast playing. The card art is masterfully charming and humorous. [The] Package resembles a "Marlboro" cigarette pack, on first glance. *phew* Guess I should chew on a piece of gum. SOLD..

I'm quite impatient my daughter grow up so I can burn it.

It's nice, easy but so hasardous. You have no control on the game. Just sometimes, you get the good card ... So it may be ok to play with my daughter for her first games, but it will be really soon replaced by good games.

If you look at the gameplay you might not give this game a high review, but the reason I give this a high review is  the fun factor. The people I have pulled this out with have all had a great time playing this. Rge art work is fun, people laugh while playing and it is a simple wuick game that although isn't a main game on game night it is great for non gamers and is a good in between game. An added bonus is it comes in a really nice tin case. I don't have kids but I would imagine children would really like this as well.

Rating is from child perspective. My 4.5 years boy LOVES this game. It is easy enough for a 4 year old to be able to learn, and it packs a decent amount of tactical decisions for such seemingly simple game. Like, cards have to be played differently based on number available in deck, you can block your opponent if you think he's trying to grab something good, you need to look how to position cards on table to maximize your gains or minimize potential losses etc. For 4 year old, that's a lot to track. And there's enough of luck so children can sometimes win against adults - that's very good because they need to win. And when they see that they won by themselves, they feel proud and have more confidence.
Plus, this game is beautiful - though my boy seems to pay little attention to that.

This is a quick and easy filler game. It is somewhat childish, but all of the adults I have played it with so far have enjoyed playing it.

Lekker luchtig, lekker kort en erg schattig.

De opdracht in dit spel is zoveel mogelijk dweebies te verzamelen. Dit doe je door een rij in te sluiten met twee identieke dweebies. Deze rij kan zowel horizontal als verticaal zijn.

Dit spel is simpel en snel en daarmee een luchtige filler voor tussendoor.

My wife loves this game and we play it often.   It's quick and there's a bit going on but it's not beefy enough for gamers which is okay cause it's a family game.

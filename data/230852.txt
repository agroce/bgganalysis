GAME: BONK
RANK: 4861
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
BONK is about speed and dexterity. Definitely practice makes you better in the game but the question is whether it is worth investing that much time in it. I reckon BONK has more potential as a party game. 

Personally I found the board a bit too small, because too often just connecting the target ball very lightly sent it spiralling down to the opponents goal. Ok, this guarantees fast action but I would have liked scoring to take a bit more skill (or luck) and seiing the ball going back and forth on the board. Now it was to much about the speed, i.e., who hits the ball first and no one had time to react.

Such a fun game to play with non board gaming friends and family. Everyone I've introduced this to has had so much fun and we have even had our own tournaments with it.

Great fun dexterity game, especially with four.

RATING: 7.6
From the makers of Klask, this is a fast playing, energetic game for 4 players (could be played with 2, but awkwardly). Each person rolls metal balls from their corner ramp, trying to strike the wooden ball into the opposite goal area. Great fun, shouting, bursts of tension, chaotic, but good team work can make the difference. My only critique is that I wonder if the field would be better if it was an inch longer. Things move so quickly that it's often over before you know it.

This is essentially the same game as Rollet, which I loved!  See my review of Rollet here: http://gjjgames.blogspot.com/2016/01/gjjg-game-reviews-rollet-by-et-games.html

Would recommend actually reading the 1 minute rules in this one (although it seems easy enough to skip).  Using the starting "Bonk" rule (where you have to high five your neighbor) and some of the recommended shots will help in having fun with this one.  After a game or two this becomes a great battle between teams. Only reco with 4.  A little too much coordination for our younger kids this has been best with adults.

木のボールとボードの形状や質が奇跡的なバランスで成り立っていて、鉄球と比較した時のスピード感が抜群に良く出来ている。コントールの利き具合が絶妙。
ただやることは一つなので飽きやすいかも。

Ganz nett, aber Klask ist deutlich besser und meiner Meinung nach müsste wahlweise das Spielfeld länger sein oder weniger angeschrägt. In vielen Spielen hatten wir das Gefühl, dass bereits ein oder zwei gute Treffer, die nicht direkt gekontert wurden, dazu führen, dass die Holzkugel bereits das Ziel erreicht.

I prefer KLASK and Crokinole, but this is better than both for 4 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
With 4 players, it does pretty well - a nicely made team dexterity game. It's in no way complex, and those with faster reflexes will obviously have an upper hand. I wouldn't pay MSRP ($60) for it, but if you'd get it out regularly at a game night or have a family and want to have a nice 'table presence' dexterity game, it's worth taking a look at.

RATING: 5
Definitely better with 4 players than less. Not for everyone. Not sure whether we'll get the value out of it or not, as it gets old fast.

Not same kind of "instant hit" like Klask! was. Bonk sounds far more interesting than it actually was. Pushing the wooden ball to the goal with metal balls could be extremely fun, but when you play Bonk, you'll see some major problems. The biggest issue is, that you can score right from the beginning with just one good hit and that's a bit annoying. And in most cases when there are beginners playing, it's one or at most two hits and one of the teams wins a round - and that's why you'll miss all the fun and excitement. The idea is great, but I think they should but this back to the designing table. In a meanwhile I'll go back to have fun with the Klask!

This is awesome,  takes a few minutes to get the hang of it but then you get very exciting rallies. The teamwork factor makes this one shine.

RATING: 6
Nice idea and fun to play, but the game is slightly too fast. Sliding the marbles to hit the ball is fun and makes for a frantic game, but I'd prefer slightly more time to react. I see original Rollet was larger, which could mean slower, and more interesting play. But for a little session of crazy fun, why not. Wouldn't say no, even though I suck at this.

Indifferent.

Dexterity! You can play 1v1 but is probably best with 2v2. Nostalgic for [thing=2816][/thing]. Same idea to get the ball into the other goal. Great quality and fun fast team game. Would gladly play this anytime.

I like dexterity games of this sort, but this just seems broken; too easy to score and too hard to defend at least if players are beginners -- which is exactly what one should expect with this kind of game

RATING: 6
Upgrade version of Crossfire with teams.
A smaller version of Rollet at half the cost (interior playing area: 22" x 14 1/2")

I remember playing Crossfire and my fingers getting tired from pulling the trigger; it was a game of attrition and endurance. I like this version of "metal balls hitting an object" better because there is a team effort with offense and defense. The game also balances the trigger-happy with resource management since you don't have a zillon of them but start with three.

.:Best 4:.

My Notes
No sharing, though your teammate may shoot it over.

Fantastic game! Instant hit for our family of 4. I was worried it would be a bit too tough for our kids (6 and 8) but they picked it up fast and play well. Fast paced and exciting dexterity game, and the low ball count adds a nice strategic dimension. Very thrilling to get long rallies.

Another winner in the series -- definitely best with 4.  Takes a couple rounds to figure out and then it becomes quite competitive!

Played at Spiel '17. A very fast dexterity game, in the same line as Klask. Like Klask quite a bit more because you have a bit more control over the game. This one is sometimes a bit too fast, a point is scored before you could do anything about it. But we laughed a lot, which is the most important thing!

This is just fun.  Awesome 4 players,  great action, skill, and strategy with your teammate.  It's hard to stop playing once you get going.   Crokinole, Klask, piratebillards, all in one room for a game night....  stupid fun.   Just buy this while you can,  its's awesome.

Throw in Loopin' Louie, maybe Tublin dice,  darts,  you could set up an entire game olympics.

The more I play, the more I enjoy the game! For the first couple of rounds, the game felt very fast and it seemed to be very difficult to defend. But give it a little bit of time and practice and you will see how you improve your accuracy, timing and become faster with the balls. When I got a hang of it, the game turned out to be very competitive with tons of laughter and fun. Plays best with 4 players with a nice team-play element. This also gives you more possibilities for rewarding scoring using risky shots when you can count on your partner to defend after a missed shot..at least sometimes :).

RATING: 9
Seriously fun. It's Crossfire with more strategy and skill involved, thanks to fewer balls and 2 extra players. 

Crossfire was a war of attrition, shooting ball after ball to stop the "puck" while scooping up more load. Bonk is all about timing. I found myself waiting, seeing if I really needed to let that precious metal ball roll down the ramp. 

It's silly and fun, with a high five required to start each round and a scramble to grab the awaiting metal balls. It reminds me of KLASK (not surprisingly, it's brought to us from the same company, I believe) in that finesse and a bit of strategic thinking will win more often than not.

Dexterity game for exactly four players. Perhaps too fast. Teams should designate one player as defender.

RATING: 7.5
Scoring is a little too fast and the intensity of play makes this game not something to play for a long period of time.  Mandatory 4 players needed to play.  Not as good as Klask or Crokinole.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a very, very fun — let's be honest — sport for two teams of two. Aim, careful timing, and clever choices are all crucial skills, lest you find yourself without "ammunition" to use in defense — forget about offense! It's so easy to play this dozens of times in a row.

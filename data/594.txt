1-5 plays. A 'thinking man's Cluedo'. Important to work out an efficient way to record/process information quickly. Potentially prone to analysis/paralysis but this didn't happen in our game

Very interesting game. Exactly what I like about Clue with none of the annoyances. I love the thinking involved but this game is not for everyone.

Suggested with a lower number of players or the game can take too long and be very difficult.

RATING: 8
Not sure how I feel about this after one play.  The puzzle is interesting, but the need to develop a good note-taking system isn't particularly enjoyable.  More plays needed to determine how much I like it.  I could see this going way up or way down...

Second play was quite enjoyable, so bumped up to an 8.  I had a better note-taking system and I focused on finding out the missing gem rather than figuring out what everyone had in their hands (should have been obvious, but during my first play I was so caught up in note-taking and deducing what players had in their hands that I mostly forgot to focus on the missing gem).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Now, here we have a deduction game that really requires concentration. Or at least this is the case with six players. There are so many threads you have to tie together. 

The key to success is that you have an efficient system for writing the clues down. I guess that if you cannot devise one, there is no chance you will enjoy a game of Sleuth. On the other hand, creating your own marking system is a part of the charm.

RATING: 6
A logic puzzle in game form.  Pure deduction done very well.  It's a fine enough game but after playing it once I now know how I would play it every other time I do.  Set out my logic puzzle grid of options, cross off the bad ones, mark the good ones, take note of the clues that I'm not wholly done with, and that's it.  It would come down to whether or not other people's questions/clues mesh well enough with my known information to enable me to arrive at the correct answer first.  For me, that's reductive.

Still, if I'm going to play a pure deduction game then I suppose this might as well be it.

RATING: 6
Brainburner. Probably the worst game in my collection in that sense. Maybe my problem was that I did not have idea how to take notes. The game took several hours which indicates that we were doing something seriousy wrong (I mean that we were playing badly, but according to the rules).

3-7. A real hidden gem (haha, punny!). After playing it a few times, found that there's quite a bit of strategy and psychology and metagaming. Sooooo much better than Clue.

Gryphon version looks MUCH nicer than F2F edition.

An old Sackson classic deduction game. If you like logic puzzles this one is right up your alley. It can drag a bit as players analyze their notes trying to figure out which question (card) to play - or maybe just trying to figure out what they wrote in their notes!

Only one play, and people in the group got bored.  I like the concept, but it became really difficult to try to pinpoint what everyone had and what the mystery cards were.  Some players just made a guess at one point to either blindly win or be out and go do something else.  Game went a bit long (hence why random calling was tried by all players).

I'd like to revisit it though, see if another play will show more brilliance, or more boredom.

I love a good deduction game now and again, and this is the best one I've ever played. The gameplay creates a very thick atmosphere of thought as players try and figure out which is the missing Gem out of a deck of 36. Great game, I can see why it's been around for so long. Easy to teach and learn. Anyone can play. Good game to plan a get-together around.

I don't like deduction games. I often mess up my information somehow - just like I do with Sudokus.

But every well rounded games collection must have at least one deduction game, and this is supposedly one of the best of that genre.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
My dislike of this game is mostly down to the dry, tedious nature of collecting information (NB: per-player information grids would make this easier). Its not a social game as people dont talk other than to ask questions, it doesnt come across as being especially competative with other players as it boils down to pure logic/deduction. Ironically I actually enjoy doing those Logic puzzle books (which are very similar in nature to this game), but those are for solo play and I simply dont like this multi-player random card game equivalent.

Its been said that I like RR, and thats true. Although RR is a puzzle/logic game, the difference is the highly competative nature of RR as you desperately try to find a solution before someone else does. Down time in RR simply does not exist, down time in Sleuth is compounded by the limited number of questions you can ask plus waiting for others to decide what questions they will ask.

Basically, if you want to sit for 90 minutes in relative silence giving yourself a headache as you try to collate your notes, do yourself a favor - read a book instead.

My brain hurts.  I'm willing to try this one again, but after playing one five player game of this, I'm sure I don't want to right away.  Much better than Mystery of the Abbey, but still a real brain burner.

We also had the situation where one player screwed up an marked the WRONG gem down.  Then proceeded to answer the questions wrong on it...

RATING: 5
A classic deduction game where players are trying to find out what card is missing by asking questions to others. Be carefull because if a player makes a mistake and gives a wrong answer the whole game can propably break up.

Of all the deduction games, this may be the best.  I prefer the brain burning in Code 777 and Black Vienna, but the deduction is just as good here and this game&#039;s more accessable.  Plus, unlike those other two, if someone makes a record-keeping error here, they&#039;ll only screw themselves up, as opposed to messing up the entire game:)  We occasionally play a Black Vienna variant in which the person that gets asked for information gets the next turn, etc... rather than just going clockwise around the table.

it does seem like developing some sort of perfect note-taking system would be huge for this game, but that would take a ton of plays and the development of technique is fun in itself.  even if you get to that level, you can start considering stuff like what a given opponent might be holding based on their questions or asking better questions to avoid overtipping savvy opponents.  a surprisingly good game although very sensitive to anyone's mistakes.

This game is a brainburning sudoku. I like such puzzle solving, but I feel that the luck in this game can be decisive which is very disturbing in such brainburning game when you need to put a lot of effort to find that one hidden card. What's more, the player who's asked the most questions has least information and thus significantly less chance to win. I think that there should be a rule, that none of the players can be asked 3 questions more than others. But this is only my feeling, I didn't test this variant.

For some reason this half-hour game ends up taking my group 2 or 3 to finish.  We like it despite that fact.  A great, stripped-down deduction game.

One thing i will say.  The newer edition is a great example of terrible graphic design.  The cards are cluttered and confusing.  The gems (which sort of act as suits) are represented on every card.  So that means that a card that is meant to represent only a pearl, also hS a picture of a diamond and sapphire on it. Crazy!

I like deduction games, but this one includes far too many elements to deduce.  If you like games like clue and you are looking for something VERY challenging, you would probably like this game.

The game is too long for what it is, but it is a very solid deduction game.

RATING: 7.5
This game endures in my mind as the game that never ends, due to one terrible session with 5 people. No one could get it. We started to guess to end the game. The winner was the last player that didn't guess.

Since that time, we've replayed it and it has gone well. Don't take this game lightly. It will burn you. Also, don't play with 5 or more.

Pure, elegant deduction game. Not everyone will enjoy this since it has no real theme and is very thinky but if you like deduction games, you need to give this one a shot.

UPDATE: With experience, the game improves. Playing against other people that also know what they are doing makes things more tense. It plays relatively quick (30-45 mins) and there's essentially no downtime since other player's clues give you crucial information. Definitely a game that takes 1-2 plays to grok. Having a solid note-taking system is essential. Those last two points might turn some people off but once you get over the hump the game is elegant in it's simplicity.

First playing was with seven people and it was an excruciating, boring exercise which ended when people started guessing just to try and end the game, not because they knew the missing gem.  I did enjoy it more with four players, but I need to play it on a regular basis to develop some kind of strategy for asking questions.  Otherwise, I suspect it will just sit on the shelf for a long, long time.  The components from Face 2 Face Games are very nice and well worth the cost.

Deduction game - one of 36 cards is removed and you have to work out which one. Sort of like the puzzles in the newspaper "Fred has a green house, the owner of the red house has a dog, who owns the canary?". Quite a slow game as each move involves a load of feverish writing and deducing and seemed to be quite luck orientated - seems to depend on who hits on the right question fastest.

OK, if you like those sorts of puzzles, but I wont be rushing to play this one again.

Do you have any diamond pairs?  Do I care if you have any diamond pairs?  Nope!  I find this to be a very boring deduction game.  There's no killer, no weapon, and no location.  I'd rather play Clue, and I don't even LIKE Clue.

I was surprised that I liked this.  I give it a 7 but I think I might like it more if I can play it more.  Wasn't a real fan of Clue when I was a kid but I did forget I did really enjoy the logic puzzles.  I just need to figure out how to take notes and deduct better.  

I imagine my rating will go up the more I play.  This was what my brain needed, or even, craved.

Excellent family game & my favorite deduction game.  Better than Clue because there's more meat to the game & no dice rolling for movement.  A good record-keeping system is essential... in particular, you need to worry about confusing your notes on pearls & pairs as well as opals & zeroes.  Unfortunately, the gem cards are not color-blind friendly... not even in the new F2F edition. (#plays=12)

RATING: 10
Finally, after all these years, I get why people like deduction games. The first game is not likely to blow you away, but it's maddeningly addictive as you figure out ways to tweak your system and your strategy. I think the reason Sleuth is so great is because a) it's short, and b) it's fairly easily to grasp. You don't need a complicated note-taking scheme to feel like things are under control, and the basics of how a good scheme should work are fairly easily apprehended; but once you've got the basics, there is a lot of scope for tweaking how you track things and pursuing different questioning strategies.

The new Face2Face edition has some graphic design issues that, while not show-stoppers, are nonetheless irritating (the gems are not sufficiently distinct and the card design on the gem cards can be confusing).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It'll burn your brain if you let it and you should if you want to win.  This is not a game I'd like to play regularly as it would become trivial and boring after repeat plays, it seems.  But it is a good induction game if you're into that sort of thing.  Also, do not, under any circumstances, play this game with more than four people.  Whoa nelly.

RATING: 2
While I can see the appeal for those that like solving puzzles, I am definitely not a fan of such activities.  This game in particular seems to be a game about whichever player has the best system of taking notes.  I'm sure anyone could learn the optimal note taking system if they thought this sort of game was fun and wanted to play it more.  However, games like this feel much more like work than fun for me and I do not enjoy them at all, so I will actively avoid ever playing this again.

I didn’t know about this game until 2013 when I bought it via the marketplace on BGG, and boy was it good I did! It has become one of my wife’s favorite games as she generally digs deduction games. It is sort of like Clue(do), but it’s deduction in its purest form as the roll-and-move has been removed – and this is a great improvement! I like how you can adjust the difficulty if playing with fewer players; something I always do after my first couple of plays, as the first card might be easy to deduce, but the game plays much better if you need to find two. 

I think I prefer the game with 4, but 5 is great too. 6 and 7 players make the game drag a bit too much. When playing with 3, it feels like a quite different game, but it’s still very good. 
The only negative about this game is when you cannot really use your cards to ask any meaningful questions and you have to use your turn to discard them; and the new cards might be bad too, especially as late in the game you need some specific cards. Still, this is a minor quible.

This is a game I am absolutely sure I will keep in my collection as it fills a niche which no other game really does (I own but haven’t played Mystery Express; I look forward to playing this too, but it plays in around 1½-2 hours while Sleuth is around 20 minutes or so). Most of my non-gamer and gamer friends like Sleuth which shows its merits.

RATING: 7.5
The new edition from Face 2 Face is beautiful.  My only quibble is that it takes a while to get used to the new gem cards; since the "frame" for the gem setting contains an image of each gem, it can be hard to determine which gem is which.  Also, it's not as easy to distinguish the gem icons as in the original 3M version.

One minor problem with gameplay: if one or more players just don't "get it", it will ruin the game for the others.  My mother-in-law kept inadvertently giving away 'bonus' information about her hand...

If everyone does get it, though, this is one of my favorite deduction games.

The best of them all; the game I&#039;d save from a burning building.  Classic game of deduction. A tip:  play with three cards missing.  With one, a player can &quot;luck&quot; into the answer.  Almost impossible to happen with three, and the logic problem is much more interesting.  We&#039;ve played it this way so long that I&#039;d forgotten one could play it with one card missing until I read some of the session reports.

Clue with less death, more jewels, and on steroids.  If I play this again, it'll have to be while I'm more awake (I *always* seem to play it right after dinner) and with a better recordkeeping system in mind.  I tried keeping records along the same lines as the records I keep while playing Clue, and it didn't work out too well.  One incorrect record, or one accidentally incorrect piece of information given by another player, kills other players' logic.

RATING: 6
A classic deduction game in the spirit of Cluedo. But this time its not about a murder but the theft of some gems.
Its a simple and beautiful game for evenings with the children. But the theme strikes me as a little odd, since the goal isn't to find the thief, but to find out which gem was stolen in the first place! ^_^
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This game of deduction is absolutely brilliant.  My only flaw is the theme could use an update/change.  I would have preferred something playing a private investigator/consulting detective attempting to solve a murder by discovering the location of the murderer.  Or maybe a Lovecraftain theme attempting to determine where a cult is located to stop them from raising an Old One a la Arkham Horror.

RATING: 2
A very well crafted and even elegant deduction game which falls flat for me as a primary problem turns out to be forming an effective enough notation format for the various data so that you can most easily logical demonstrate the missing card.  Once you have such a notation worked out, the rest becomes a question of most effective elimination questions.  Good, but rather too mechanical for my tastes.

This is THE deduction game. While I enjoy games like Mystery of the Abbey, there is a lot of extra chance mixed in with its rich theme.  Sleuth sacrifices a little in the theme department to deliver a pure distilled deduction game.  

You can ask questions that benefit only (or mostly) yourself. You have to be cagey to succeed.  There is constantly the chance to gain info from everyone else's actions.  Finally, it plays very quickly and satisfyingly.  Thanks Sid.

RATING: N/A
Though I have not played Sleuth, from what I know of it, it would rate at least a full point or two lower than its progenitor, The Case of the Elusive Assassin. This is because of the "questions deck" present in Sleuth, which restricts what a player can ask. The board present in The Elusive Assassin does the same thing, but one does not have to pray for the right combination to come up, one can simply walk there. I rate the board game a 6, and would probably rate Sleuth at least 1 or 2 points lower based on this annoying choice restriction.

My wife's favorite game of all time. I believe this is the best pure deduction game out there. There are 36 unique cards. One is placed in the box. Which one is it?

There are not that many pure deduction games out there. This makes the game to stand out. Unfortunately, luck plays too important role. (I have seen a 4 player game won in turn 1 because of favourable hand of gem cards and "right" questions by other players.) The game really needs a better system (sheet) to record the answers.

I think this is one of those games that's fun once. After the game, we compared notes, decided which is the best notation, and of course the winner used the best notation. Figuring out how to track the data is really the game. Once you've optimized that, there's not much game left.

Really great pure deduction game. Playing super sleuth mode (players don't get to see the two-element cards they ask about) is thrilling, as you constantly flip between notes and mark things off with every new piece of information, desperately trying to get to the answer first. Just perfect. 

A player might occasionally get a quick answer from a lucky hand and convenient questions, but this can easily be mitigated by having multiple missing cards.

Production: Great quality cards.  The gem type is not as easy to recognize as are the color and quantity.  Play: My one playing thus far has been with six players: a disaster.  Too many players; too many conflicting notations; too many questions with 'zero' as the answer.  There's enough here that I'll want to try it again with fewer players, but it seems much more like a logic problem I'd like to sit down with and quietly solve than a thematic game in which I wish to participate with other players.  (2+1+2) (1 play)

This game is less about strategy as it is about solving a puzzle before the other players.  Problem is, after playing once or twice, it feels like I'm solving the same puzzle over again.

Hard to believe this game was created well before the modern board game era (over 40 years ago!). Saw some reviews and had to try it out. We played it so much we ran out of the player sheets in a few weeks. What a great deduction game! 4 player is great and 5 makes it quite a bit more challenging.

Based on two plays; rating may go up, I doubt it will go down. 

Great deduction exercise. If you come to an erroneous conclusion early you will never be able to untangle the ramifications. I think it's very important to make sure all players are aware of that. In our first game the winner was by default - everyone else had made an incorrect guess.

Clearly a game that requires and rewards multiple plays.

Logic-puzzle game.  These type of games usually come down to note-taking skill.  This one is no exception.  A bad note here or there, and you could wind up eliminating the missing gem.  I have always enjoyed these kind of puzzles, but they are not for everyone.

RATING: 7
A Cluedo-like deduction game where players are trying to identify the missing gem card in a 36 pack deck.  Questions are asked by playing "Suspect" cards against another player, who must answer the question (either a number of cards or reveal the cards).  Other players are always gleaning information, so a good notation system is essential.    The trick is using the correct question card on the correct opponent.  Good game.

When I was a kid I would play Clue with the family and I thought that was cool.  But later in life I stumbled upon Sleuth and my brain loved it.  It learned of a possible new dimension in thinking.  No more static decisions of just one type of item.  Now it needed to calculate the items color and how many?  Along with which question is the best to ask to answer my problem.  My brain has never been the same again!

As Clue was always one of my favorites before I was exposed to the "wide world of 'real' board games," I was thrilled when I discovered this gem (pun intended). Less randomness than Clue, and far deeper strategy and ways to apply deductive reasoning.

Along with Acquire, Bazaar, and Can't Stop, Sid Sackson designed a few games that really are perfect examples of their genre. Decades later, Acquire, Bazaar, and Can't Stop are still usually the first games mentioned in their respective genres. Sleuth is exactly the same for the deduction genre. With Sleuth, Sackson perfected the missing card system pioneered by Clue. Where Sackson has surpassed Clue is with the addition of the interrogation cards. Quite a bit of information is obtained when it's not your turn, which makes the entire play experience a fun time. Highly recommended! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
[34 plays] This is a fabulous game of pure logic and deduction, which I love.  If you're looking for a theme-rich game, this is absolutely not it.  Sleuth is a card game with a weak jewel-theft theme, but it's decidedly less themelicious than, say, classic Clue.  I like a deduction game with a good mystery/espionage theme also, but I don't miss that in Sleuth because I love it for different reasons.  Of all the deduction games I've tried (and mostly liked), Sleuth is the closest to pure distilled essence of deduction.  
  It's a really fast-paced game; the information flow can be so fast it's all one can do to keep up with recording and analyzing it.  A powerful note-taking system is essential, and mine has gone through a number of refinements.  Sleuth comes as close to zero downtime as any game I can think of.  
The game is best with more players; though I have played some enjoyable 3-player games, with only 3 the game is a bit more random, as it's possible to win very quickly if you just happen to ask the right questions. Because each player has more cards, it's more frequent to get big swings of information.  
Like most games of this type, Sleuth is vulnerable to (usually inadvertent) sabotage; if a player gives wrong information, it can ruin the game for everyone.  My strong recommendation, and invariable practice, to prevent this is to insist that everyone answer questions by LOOKING at their CARDS, not just referring to their deduction sheet.  I also caution new players about the decorative frame on the cards, which is a definite design fail; it shows all the jewel types, and thus one can accidentally look at it and think the card is a different type of jewel.

RATING: 1
While this is not a broken game, it is simply not a game at all. I can see why this is on BGG: it has cards, there are rules, you can play with more than one person, and there are winning conditions. However, this is nothing more than a multi player puzzle where organizational skills and excellent note taking will win the day. 

Remember that this entire exercise is a single game mechanic. In what other context does this make sense? Roll and move only? Drafting only? Hand management only? Secret unit deployment only? Area control only? It doesn't make sense. This needs another element to become a game...oh wait they did that - it's called Clue. I will admit that the mechanic is strong enough to produce some enjoyment in some people but, not enough to qualify this being a game. 

If you like doing puzzles with your friends you will like this. If you like playing games, you might want to avoid.

Pure deduction.  Clue without the board.

Having a good notation system is key, but you also need to think about it like Sudoku, in that you need to quickly understand that if person A has X that means that when person B showed you Y, person C has to then have Z, etc.

I would propose a house rule where the same person can't be asked a question 2 turns in a row.  Without this, everyone just asks the same person stuff which really narrows things down quickly.  Doing that works well if your cards mesh well with the person being asked, but if they don't, you are at a disadvantage.

Here is maybe one of the purest deduction games out there. Very 1960s-70s in its design approach - classic Sackson. It was hard to warm up to this one, because it is a crushing brain burner that penalizes the shit out of you if you make even one error on how you notate the clues being given. If you are playing with people (including me!) who aren't keeping excellent notes, it just comes down to the process of slloowww elimination. The game rewards those who keep amazing notes and for those who just keep standard notes will find themselves playing a slow, somewhat tedious game of reducing options one-by-one. That being said, the game is almost like the Go of deduction games. You will be absolutely crushed unless you have a very exacting plan to make the game work for you. I am intrigued to try and figure out a system that works. As long as a system of note-taking is sort of discussed beforehand, this is a very interesting game for those who want to deal with the logic challenge it presents. My least enjoyed game of Sackson out of his Collector Series that was released.

RATING: 6
A fun little game of deduction.  All cards have three traits and one has to solve which of the many are missing by asking predetermined questions.  The fact that questions are not free form, makes the game trickier as you are limited to what you can inquire about on any given turn.  Note taking is key, and some people don't like the constant jotting, or listening exercises involved in playing this game effectively.  If one can find the right group of players, this game works well - otherwise it can be lackluster.  I also like theme with deduction games and this has none.

Sleuth is a classic, and a very good, smooth-playing game of deduction and note-taking.  Like most of these deduction card games (Black Vienna, Code 777, Clue, What's That On My Head, etc.),  winning often depends upon being in the right place (figuratively) at the right time.  When playing Sleuth, a player will sometimes stumble upon the missing gem quite early in the game.  This is especially likely to happen in games with few (3 or 4) players.  These early-ending games usually feature little to no "deduction" except at the simplest level.  That's actually a problem with Sleuth in general: there's typically very little opportunity to make tricky, twisty conclusions.  Others will think this is a good feature, but I wish the game were a little tougher.  Sleuth's middling difficulty does give it a broad appeal.  It's just one step up from Clue, and I've had great success playing Sleuth with friends and family who don't usually like games that are too intense or too taxing on the old noggin.  I recommend removing two or three gem cards (instead of one) for those who want a tougher, more intense game.

One play with four, two with five. I think I liked it better with four.

I thought I would like this game more, because I enjoy logic puzzles. The problem, I guess, is that when I want to play a game with other people, I want it to be something that engages those people with each other more than this; Sleuth is really just competitive puzzle-solving. 

Additionally, I once had the lousy experience of misinterpreting an answer early on, which made the game one long hell of confusion for me. Now, of course you'll say that the problem is with my play rather than with the game itself, but I feel like the potential of a player having a [i]negative[/i] experience playing a game is a strike against that game. 

Overall I would play Sleuth again, and I might even enjoy it, but I probably won't be the one pushing to get it to the table.

Originally released in 1967 by the 3M Game Company, Sleuth is a masterful deduction game from master designer Sid Sackson.  Players must deduce the identity of a missing gem by skillful questioning of their opponents, using logic and the powers of deduction.   
Only one will prove to possess the skills to earn the title "master sleuth".

I must confess that I am absolutely HORRIBLE at this game.  I played it numerous over the decades and have always lost.  Always.  I’m fairly certain that there are police forces that are very thankful that I never pursued by childhood dream of becoming a detective!
Still, in spite of my clear lack of deductive skills, I admire the purity of the game’s design.

Sleuth is direct, pure and simple to play.  While players are limited in the questions they can ask by the search cards they possess, deductive reasoning and logic will prevail over any luck factors.  While the game can accommodate up to seven players, it last far too long with that many involved.  It truly shines with 3 or 4 players.

While deductive games are not my forte, Sleuth is one of the best -- if not THE best -- of the genre.  Fans of deduction and logic puzzles should  certainly investigate this gem of a game.

I really enjoyed this deduction game. We played the new Face 2 Face edition and this being my first time playing, I didn't have a problem with the cards. One in the group preferred the 3M version cards because it is very explicit what you have. It really comes down to great note taking. I would like to get a copy of this one eventually.

Update: Got the old 3M version of the game as a prize table pick. The art is not spectacular but it is very clear what your have in your hand. I do love the box art for the 3M version though. I'm way into the 60's design esthetic.

[Initial Impression: 5]
(Warning: This is less of a game comment and more a commentary on what makes games interesting to me.)  Sleuth is an excellent example of a game genre that I'm good at but just don't really enjoy: deduction games.  At the risk of making a sweeping over-generalization, I find deduction games as a class to be a rote exercise in trying to find the optimal path toward determining the missing item in a set, with each player given limitations (usually different depending on card draws or die rolls) imposed by the game.  More specifically, in Sleuth, there is an optimal search strategy, yet the game doesn't let you use it because you are limited to asking questions by the randomly drawn question cards in front of you. Hence, each player must attempt to find the most optimal of several sub-optimal solutions.  Given perfect play, the winner will be determined by the random limitations of the question cards.  Usually, every player is not perfect, and therefore it is possible to win even if you aren't lucky enough to draw the most optimal set of question cards.  Any game or mental exercise where I know I can find the predefined solution if I simply work at it long enough ultimately becomes boring to me (Sudoku puzzles are another good example of such logic exercises).  To me, a good game needs to have the possibility of surprise, of having your own limits of knowledge and/or foresight work against you, and of having an opponent be able to best you not because of differential limits imposed by the game structure, but because they were better able to act within the same set of game constraints.

Sleuth is Sid Sackson's reduction/improvement on the classic Cluedo/Clue murder mystery game.

He removes the board and the characters, reduces the game to 2 decks of cards, scorepads and pencils, and imporves the lot in a classic Sackson manner.

Instead of solving for the murderer, weapon and room, or locating the Secret spy, this game asks the players to carefully identify the the missing gems by the reduction methods used in the previous games.

I like it lot- and because of the Clue roots this is a small game one can take out with non-gamers and both introduce and play easily.

Sackson is a classic- and this game is a great example why he is reckoned one of the greatest game designers ever.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (November 2011)

I love deduction games. Deduction has become one of my favorite game mechanism if not THE favorite game mechanism, so I naturally like Sleuth.

It’s been over 5 years since I last played Sleuth, so I don’t remember much about the game, however I remember I liked it a lot. It is very reminiscent of Black Vienna (or perhaps it is the other way around as Sleuth is almost 3 decades older). I´m not sure if it is worth to have both games in the game collection.

The rules are very easy, but the gameplay is very interesting to me. Basically, you have to deduce which gem was stolen before your opponents do so. I dislike that it was just ONE gem that was stolen and not more. A player can easily get lucky and guess the correct answer. I’m not sure if the game is played this way or not, a friend taught it to me, I haven’t read the rules.

Bottom line, my desire to play Sleuth again is very high. I will probably buy it in the near future. It is a tremendous game if you have into account that it was designed on 1971. Pure deduction game.

Current Rating: 7.0

RATING: 7
Very good deduction game.  I find tracking information boring, so I don't care for it that much, but I recognize Sleuth as just about the best example of this out there.  One of those games that frustrates me whenever I play it, as I'm constantly jumping two steps ahead in logic without examining my assumptions.

My dad picked this up because he likes clue and is good at deduction games.... or so he thought. The cards are great quality and you can feel that when playing. The rules were clear and easy to follow and it wasn't long before we were playing the game. After a few leaning runs my dad and I were ready to play and with expectation high for both of us we commenced the battle of deduction... my wife, who made up the third (as the game requires three min to play), quietly and patiently let us boys talk the talk while she walked the walk. Before we knew it she had won 4 times to our 1 each. Last night we played with 4 inviting my wife's mum to join us. She ask all the wrong questions and some of them twice.... or did she? As she came out the novice winner!! I must say I love this game and can't rave about it enough!!! A true gem of a game!! :)

RATING: 8
Excellent production quality by F2F.  A very clever game of pure deduction and logic which requires keeping accurate accounts of opponents responses to selective questions.  We prefer on occasion using the variant (from Black Vienna): the player that answers the current question gets to ask the next question.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Clue-like game in which you try to determine which card has been pulled out of the deck by asking to see other players' cards. The catch? You can only ask the questions another deck of cards gives you. Simple, requires thought and a system... a good starter game or if you want to teach logic deduction.

PLUS: easy to learn, challenging
MINUS: not for all players

I love this game to death!  Such a simple concept, but all the more fun for its simplicity.  I'm not thrilled with the latest version of it, from Face-2-Face games; it's more the graphics than the quality (the quality is very good).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Yea, a deduction game that I think I can get the group to play. I like that the questions a player may ask are on cards and once asked that question is discarded and replaced by another. I've always enjoyed trying to not only sort out the info that I get but also the info that the other players are gettting on their turns(which is where I think you win the game).

RATING: 6
Deduction game with the usual airtight Sackson mechanics, but dry, dry, dry. Normally a game's moisture content doesn't bother me very much, but the chosen variables of gems, clusters and colors are difficult to differentiate and can breed unnecessary confusion. The deduction aspect is fun, it is less fun when folks start confusing opals for pearls and marking things incorrectly. This is a rare case (for me) where I think the theming and artwork (in the Face2Face reprint) detract from the design. I'd like to play the original 3M version to see if this aspect improves any. Even with my criticism, I can safely say that if you love deduction games, this is a pretty safe bet.

RATING: 7
A more focused and abstract take on deduction. I enjoyed this. 

Players are trying to identify the missing gem card. There are three types of gems (pearls, opals, and diamonds), four colors, and three amounts (singles, doubles, triples) for a total of 36 cards. Each player has a hand of four cards with specific questions about the other players' gems. They choose one question to ask on their turn, and mark information on a small chart. Light, quick, fun, makes you think without being overwhelming. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like this game and I want to rate it higher, but there is too much potential for user error.  Why they decided to use both "opals" and "pearls" is beyond me.  I cannot count how many times the whole game was scewed because these two gems were flip-flopped by some player or players.  It may be safe to say that the decision to use opals instead of, say, rubies is the difference between a 6 and a 7/7.5 rating.

Once upon a time, there was a poor damaged game called Clue.  All along the Strand, one could find attempted to solve the mystery of who would deface this lovely little deduction game by spraying on a terrible roll-and-move board.  Some went so far as to attempt to scrub off the damage and find the beauty beneath, but many of these disappeared quietly, chasing the trail of the Great Designer and finding Sleuth - Clue reborn 40+ years ago in all it's deductive glory.

RATING: 7
You definitely have to be in the mood for something like this.  It also requires a very detailed and systematic notetaking system.  For those unfamiliar with the game, it can seem difficult to figure out how to deduce different facts.  However, the high popularity of stuff like Sudoku makes me think that there's really a large audience for a game like this.  I still have no idea how to play well, but I find that I really enjoy deduction games and look forward to playing them more.

Deduction game of finding the missing gem by asking what kind of gems people have in their hands. Make sure to be taking lots of notes about what people are asking. This game is not for everyone because it is very "thinky." First time I played I didn't take notes that was a mistake and had a huge headache memorizing what people had and ended up not liking it. Well played it multiple times since with note-taking and absolutely love this fast, filler game.

Reminds me the boardgame Clue (in finnish Cluedo), but Sleuth is much more harder. A very challenging card game and takes too long if there are a lot of players. If you like Black Vienna, but you want more challenge this is for you! Although... big minus because the cards are a bit confusing. I really like Sleuth, but it's a bit too hardcore game to teach other non-gamer deduction game lovers. So for me Tricoda, Black Vienna & Timbuktu is enough, which why I sold my copy.

I'm usually a fan of Sackson games.  I'm usually not a fan of deduction games so they don't generally appeal to me much.  If you like logical deductive, deep concentration game (which card/gem is missing from the deck? while using search cards to ask  questions to players), then this may be your cup of tea.

RATING: 6
Solid little deduction card game.  After one play, still not sure of the value of the one item search cards, particularly early on in the game.  Just don't forget to write down every little item of information like who has what card so those later one item search cards can become of value.

Excellent deduction game.  As many have said, it plays like an advanced form of Clue.  It really does involve quite a bit of notetaking.  I am accustomed to taking a lot of time to sort things out when trying to figure out this type of logic puzzle so it is difficult for me to keep track of everyone's questions and answers while also trying to analyze the potential benefits of their responses.

This game is hard for me to rate right now.  I don't "get" the strategy behind it, and that frustrates me, making me want to play more.  But the Face to Face Games edition is awful!  Graphically, the cards are confusing, and overall I find it too hard to keep track of "blue diamonds", "red opals", and so on.  Erik and I are talking of doing a complete homebrew re-theme of this.  Our idea is to replace the Jewels with Men's faces... almost Guess Who style.

Having played it once, I have to say WOW.  A lot to like about the deduction. I wish opal wasn't one of the gems, I feel like i got it confused with pearl a little often in the beginning and Blue is one of the card colors, so it would've been less confusing if they chose something else.  Still a lot of fun, easy to get to the table.

Sid Sackson created a deductive masterpiece with this game.  It takes everything that was fun in Clue and distilled it down to its essence.  No roll and move in this game!  You have a starting hand of gems and can play cards which allow you ask questions about other people's hands.  And you gain information from the answers.  At times, you get specific numbers of cards at times you can see how many cards are passed.  Once you determine what card remains, you win.  

The only issue with the game is this game really comes down to how well you can account for the answers given to you and other players.  If you have a better system than others you will win.  But that is true for most deduction games.

Seems like a great, simple-to-teach deduction game with a wide range of number of players.  But it's a little long for what it is.  And it's bit of a brain-burner that makes my head hurt.  I need to figure out how to take better notes perhaps. More of a group-effort logic puzzle than a game.

What a horrible game.  The dead-slow pacing and confusing cards and rules really bog down the potential for any fun from this loser card game.  Not to mention the need for better deduction sheets.

NEVER, EVER PLAY WITH MORE THAN 4 PEOPLE.  An hour into this I was practically begging the five other players to play anything else.  I finally laid my cards down and walked away from the table.  NEVER AGAIN.

Sleuth scratches my deduction itch, and does so in less than 30 minutes. Really gives you that Clue vibe, but without the suck. It's subject to a little luck of the draw, but not really a big deal. This game leaves you feeling satisfied and wanting another round, even if you didn't win. The player sheets where you keep track of the clues is a little small, and can be a little challenging if you play with the higher player counts, as you find yourself running out of room. But this game is a classic. Previously Letters From Whitechapel was my go to deduction game, but Sleuth just hits the table more often because it gives me a quick fix without leaving me brain dead after two hours.

This is a purely deductive game. If you're not willing to put in a little mental work then don't bring it to the table. The key to this game is your notation system. It's vital to have a compact but comprehensive system of recording every scrap of information revealed. See my session report for a description of the notation system that has worked well for me: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/viewitem.php3?gameid=594 My concern about the game is that experienced players will always crush newbies. Yet when players of equal experience play I have a feeling that luck (in the form of search cards) becomes dominant, not what you want from a deduction game. My bottom line is that I greaty enjoy playing Sleuth and reccommend it to anyone even remotely interested in deductive games.

It’s nice because it’s quick with 3 or 4 people. But really, you’d have as much fun doing a normal logic puzzle from any game magazine. The real key isn’t he game itself, it’s the info sheet. Download the elaborate one here on BGG and take good notes on question responses. The example in the rulebook is misleading (when it shows putting an “X” over something), as you really need to know who had it. Anyway, everyone probably has a different method but the point is it’s not exciting as a game. Portable and simple enough though.

This is a little less "fun" than mystery of the abbey but is more controlled and precise.

RATING: 8
Game in a Nutshell: A deduction game where one card is taken from the deck and all others dealt to the players. Now you must figure out which card is missing using random cards that let you ask specific questions.

Played as: 3,4,5 player

Pros: It's a fast paced deduction game in a style that seems would translate well with eather people who have fond memories of Clue or get a get a kick out of a good logical brain buster. Really has a similar feel to solving a sudoku puzzle and should translate well to fans of that 'puzzle-y' interest group.

Cons: Haven't quite played enough to determine whether or not the random question cards add too significant amount of luck. If so, that could be the games only big let-down.

Other: It really feels like playing Clue combined with Sudoku in card game form. I played once with a newer version as taught by a friend and once with the old 3M version. I'm not sure if the rules on how you ask questions were different (the plays were a long way in between) or the question cards were tweaked, but I felt more restricted -in a good way- with the older version. The questions felt more vague which required more deduction, or maybe I just don't remember all that well.

Best Use: A fun easy logic puzzle game for almost anyone.

I had high hopes for this game: Clue without the roll and move? Sign me up! I did enjoy it, but it went longer than I expected and although I won, the fact that everyone was within one or two questions of the solution left me wondering if the difference is luck of the card draw, a measure of accuracy, or truly a reflection of superior deduction skill. I admit that so many of my questions were randomly directed than I am uncertain. Future plays may help me determine. Additionally it takes longer than expected and the fact that the whole game revolves around asking questions, it sort of kills table talk: You can't discuss the game itself without giving away information and it's hard to shoot the breeze without interrupting the game. Nonetheless, we all had a fun time playing it.

Straight-up deduction of the purest and most mathematical kind.  On every single turn, questions and answers give you important clues.  Properly deducing the information, accurately recording it and drawing valid conclusions from it presents a protracted, tight and challenging puzzle of the first order.  It hardly feels like a game to me - it's more like a pop-quiz in formal logic.

A deductive game where there are 36 gems (diamonds, pearls or opals, they can be solitaire, pair or cluster, and they can be colored green, yellow, blue or red), one gem is hidden and the rest of the gems are distributed among the players. Players use cards to query any opponent about their hands to get information about the missing gem. First person to correctly identify the missing gem wins. It's a fun deductive game. Like Clue, the trick is to record the information in a format that you can use to find the answer. I'm not real good in these deductive games, but this one is fun. The new edition of this game had gem cards which confused a couple of players, since all gems are on the border, resulting in wrong cards being passed to the person doing the query.

This is essentially the logic puzzle card game. Once you have a system down, you just have to race the other people for the most "useful" information. Thankfully, not all the same information is available to every player at the beginning. Otherwise, "smarter" people would be done in a flash. The question cards also help with that problem. (Not that I really know anyone who falls into that category. Nope, no geniuses. No, seriously.)

RATING: 8
When I first received Sleuth, with foreknowledge of what the games components consisted of (2 decks of cards and a notepad), my initial thought was, 'What an unnecessarily large box!'.

Sleuth is Clue without the board and roll-for-movement. Is it better than Clue? Yes.

The game itself is kinda abstract. Whose gems are they? If they wanted we sleuths to discover which were missing, why not let us share information more freely? (Obviously, the answer is because there would be no game then, but it is strange.) And why opals? Diamonds, pearls, and... opals? Just an odd choice. I can only assume that those gems were chosen as they were color neutral to avoid the confusion that colored gems would have caused.

For best play results, players should devise a system for logging clues learned onto their info sheets. I find that treating it like a roulette betting table works well.

Graphically, the game has improved over the years, the 2012 version looks the best.

Not a 'fun' game, but a good one.

Sleuth is Clue without the board and roll-for-movement. Is it better than Clue? Yes.

The graphical update in this Gryphon Games edition makes the game more accessible for modern players and reduces confusion between Opals and Pearls.

Thematically, one might think that Sleuth is a bunch of detectives trying to solve a robbery, but its more like some kinda highbrow dinner party game of mystery from Poirot's era.

For best play results, players should devise a system for logging clues learned onto their info sheets. I find that treating it like a roulette betting table works well.

Initial rating.  Interesting deduction game and far more trying than Clue.  Will probably go up with a few more plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A deduction game as bare as it can be - the materials and the rules are kept to a minimum. All the complexity stems from asking each of the other players about three different variables of the missing gem (kind, amount, colour), single or combined, and especially from recording it properly. If so, any answer (not just the ones to your question) delivers information. This one-to-one questioning means that reaching a solution is much more complicated than for instance in Clue (with lots of die rolling, but in which inquiries are single accusations where all players can respond, taking less time and brain cells).

Sleuth is a very well designed game, but its format brings an inherent flaw: until a player polishes his notation he/she's very possibly going to get squashed by a more experienced one, and in a match with equally skilled players luck can be decisive in the outcome, forcing a player to wait for turns either with unnecessary questions or changing his question cards.

RATING: 7
You're trying to identify the missing card. Cards are unique based on gem, colour and quantity, and your turn is to use question cards that use these characteristics to interrogate another player on what cards they have. Which all works fine and the game rolls along, crossing off card after card. And then suddenly the game ends because someone has by chance stumbled onto the 1 card that's missing earlier than everyone else - like Cluedo you don't need to cross off everything to find the winner. Unlike Cluedo where you need to get lucky over 3 cards, here you just need to get lucky with 1 card. So the game is interesting to play but the reward is flaky.

Missing one gem card
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In this deduction card game, each player is dealt out a hand of gem cards, and must try to guess which one card is not in anyone's hand.  You can ask questions to other players, and they must answer in such a way that gives you more information and the rest of the table some information.  Useful tracking sheets are included to help players keep track of information.  It's clever and it really does succeed as a deduction game--it falls in the "happy zone" between too much information to effectively organize and inane simplicity.

Deduction games are rarely my thing. So when I first sat down to play this, I was extremely hesitant. Little did I know, I would find this one to be very pleasant. It basically strips down the deductive element into its most basic form and gives you the questions to use to help figure it out. I've always hated coming up with my own questions in deductive style games. Game plays reasonably quick and although it does play 7, I probably would never do that again. Too much downtime and far too much to remember.

On a side note, every single time I break this out, I completely forget how I took notes last time. If you play it a second time in a row, you drastically fix how you take notes. It becomes almost a secondary game learning how to do it.

OWN Nov/07.  Unplayed, but did a puzzle based on this last winter.

Nov 18/07: tried this yesterday, with 7, using the scoring sheets provided.  Nobody was able to devise a working system quickly enough, and we ended up with nobody guessing the correct answer after about 2 hours.  I believe a new scoring sheet would help a LOT, and I like the look of the Sleuth_v2.pdf file.  I'll probably try to make something similar myself, with lighter boxes for the red & blue.

Dec/07: new scoresheet helped immensely, but my wife still made a mistake and was hopelessly unable to stay in the game then.  Almost seems like you'd need to 'practice' recording information with this sheet, and then play for real.

Ehhhh...well, it isn't that I don't like it.  Deduction games are kind of hit and miss in my group.  It isn't very dynamic in terms of art or theme (that is to say, there really isn't any theme, and the art could be clip art circa 1995).  The components are high quality (although you'll burn through the note book pretty quickly after a couple of games).  
The game is sort of Clue, minus the board, plus an additional factor to consider.  Shrug.  Not very compelling stuff.  I like the high player count, but it still really isn't amazing.  Guess games have come a long way since this was released.

I picked up the Sid Sackson reissues box set of Sleuth, Monad and Venture at Essen but didn't have time to play any of them. Sleuth was the one I was most excited about, and it didn't disappoint. As one player commented when I taught it today, "It's just like Clue, but without all the stupid walking around!". 

This is indeed a pure deduction game, with all of Sackson's hallmark elegance. It also plays a bit like my recent obsession, Hanabi in reverse: instead of trying to push information out to other players and hope they use everything at their disposal to make clever inferences, in Sleuth you're trying to suck all that information in for your own benefit. I'm still working on my notation system, but it seems quite similar to what is required to solve a Sudoku puzzle.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is the classic deduction game.  Subtract all the annoying aspects of Clue (ie. Roll and Move), and what you get is Sleuth.  I think the true genius is in the "Search" cards.  They prevent the players from simply choosing the question that yields the most information, and instead it is usually necessary to choose between less than optimal queries.  On the other hand, it is fairly uncommon for a player to be so severely hamstrung by their Search cards that they cannot make any useful queries at all.

Deduction card game, distilled to its essence.
You are trying to determine the missing card by querying other players using suspect cards that limit what type of information you can ask. You also need to keep the track of what the others are asking to help drive what you know about about the cards. A good notation system is a requirement. 

Shows the lasting power of a classic.

Face 2 Face Edition. Wow. This beats the living hell outta Clue. It doesn't compare with Mystery of the Abbey's atmosphere, but it's a far better game on the whole. So, if you're looking for fun and theme and atmosphere, go with Mystery. If you're looking for the most solid deduction game you're likely to find, go with Sleuth. It's cool.

Conceptually this is a genius game. If you like Math problems that go one for an hour or so than this is for you.  Unfortunately for me it's just too much work to be a lot of fun. One miss writing on your sheet can lose this for you and you stuck watching others play for an hour.  Can really be bogged down by down time and can give analysis paralysis.

If you've taken the GRE or LSAT, you will remember the 'analytical' section of the test, where you have 5 people seated at a table, and are told that person A doesn't sit next to persons C or D, and B sits across from D, etc etc.  This is like that--one big fat single question involving 36 'people at a table,' with information slowly being revealed as the game goes on.  I actually enjoy these kinds of problems when i see them presented in some random magazine; however, my enjoyment of the activity as a game is slightly lacking.  It reminds me of a high school math contest, which i also enjoy at some level (i was always pretty good at those contests).  but staring at a piece of paper trying to solve math problems doesn't seem like the best way to spend time with your buddies.  that being said, somehow the group i play with always manages to throw in sooo many interesting innuendos while playing.  i guess they're creative or just gutterminded.  i can't tell.

--Oct2004-- Excellent little deduction game.  Opportunities for bluff & misdirection exist.  Very nice. Easy with 3; a bit of a brain burner (and worthy of a lower ranking) with 6 or 7.
--Dec2006-- Like Black Vienna or Mystery of the Abbey, this suffers from the possibility of false information resulting in a ruined game.  With 3 or 4 playing, the game is short enough that one can forgive;  but with 6 the game is too long and too fragile.

My favorite deduction game.  The biggest challenge is how to take notes from the questions.  I will say I don't like the reprint as much as the original.  In order to make it more thematic, the publishers used graphics that are easily confusing.  Plus the new note pads SUCK. It's still a favorite though.

Finally played this classic. I liked it, but it went on awfully long. It's important to have a note system in place before you start, or you'll be hosed.

Many would say this is superior to Clue. I don't dispute that since Sleuth eliminates that frustrating need to roll dice to reach a certain room. Sleuth also has far more choices and moments for deduction.
I still rate Clue higher simply because I can always find someone to play Clue, where I need to sell people on Sleuth.

Tedious, abstract, mystery-solving game. New players easily confuse the gem types meaning that bad information gets given and the game often is forced to end early.

Clever Sackson deduction game. There are 4 suits of 3 gem types in 3 configurations. 1 is removed from the game, 2 are revealed and the rest are distributed to players. Players are then dealt 4 question cards. These form the heart of the questioning and usually consist of either a single item or double items. Each turn, a player chooses a card and directs a question to an opponent who must answer. EG: A search card might allow you to ask how many yellow pearls a player owns.

Players can make a guess at any point in the game and the first player to guess the identity of the missing gem wins!

Game length makes for a fairly meaty filler.

RATING: 8
I may cool to this game as I play it more, but I like the [mostly] pure logic of it. The more players you have, the longer the game will go; also, it's almost an anti-social game, because you have to devote so much mental energy to putting all the evidence together and figuring out your next question for another player.

quite difficult to identify the missing gem for first-timers. our first game with 7 people took over an hour and that after modifying the rules to speed it up, i.e. revealing a gem each after each round. i think it's a very good deductive game, but much harder than the mystery of the abbey or code 777. you need to be vigilant in taking info (and sometimes even negative info) to help you in winning.

Effective design.  In some ways it is Soduku. This game is mostly systematic elimination, with a little bit of awareness to try not to give too much info out to other players.  Drawing appropriate question cards will help your game more than anything you can do for yourself.  Your game is even stronger when other people are asking each other questions getting information for you.

Don't screw up, the game can be fragile.  

It's a bit dry and dull. The Case of the Elusive Assassin did it best the first time around.  Taking the board and movement out deflates much of the fun out for me and the question cards increase the luck.  enh.

RATING: 6.5
[F2F 2004 edition] {Agent; deduction; optimal 4-6p} A very challenging and brain-teasing deduction game I ever played. Sleuth is a pure deduction game. I don't think Sleuth is accessible for all kinds of players because it is boring if one does not know how to deduce and what information should he explore. It's necessary to find a group of interested players to play Sleuth. It's more challenging if players don't use papers.

Sleuth can run long and is dry. It still has certain level of interaction because questions and answers can help each player to deduce the missing gem. Players have to ask smartly to uncover hints while not leaking too many hints for others; or even, deliberately ask 'decoy' questions to disturb others.

Kudos to Face2Face Games for bringing this classic back into print.  Write off your first game or so to learning how to best record information on your sheet.

I can easily envision a higher rating for Sleuth.

This is a very clean deduction game, uncluttered by the die rolls of Clue, for example.  Every player has to develop a notation system that works for them to capture the huge amount of information that comes flying in every turn.  A good system can easily make the difference of several turns in figuring out the targets card or cards.

If you like logic puzzles, and find Clue to have a bit too much luck and too little deduction for your senses, this is the game you should be playing.  It shares with Clue that a fair portion of the game is figuring out how to record information, but once you get that, you can actually have cascading solutions.  One time playing this was solved by negative information (i.e. no one has the blue diamond solitaire), but the other times I've played it used positive information (i.e. Player B or C has the blue diamond solitaire, but I've determined all the cards in both their hands (or at least determined a subset of options for each), so neither of them could have it).

By contrast Clue was almost always solved by negative information: i.e. no one has the wrench.

First Impression:
A very different game - definately a brainburner.

Pros: A very deterministic and engaging game that rewards clever and dutifull notes and a bit of hunch.

Cons: It can be extremelly frustrating to gamers who want to relax to their games, or those who are just not used into solving problems.

I really liked this game, and I'm looking forward to play it more, provided that the group is up to it.

Fortunately there are more than enough games for me, and I have the hundreds of games to prove it, so never fear I should still find something to play despite ruling out a genre or two. As with other deduction games, there was no there there for Sleuth. It all seemed rote and mechanical. I didn't see any game in the game, let alone fun. Maybe this type of game is too much like the logic games on the LSAT for me to be able to enjoy it.

[thing=594][/thing] is a deduction game, and just this. No add-ons or mini-games. [thing=594][/thing] is a game from a time when games were designed to do one thing, and there are some that do that pretty well. This is such a case.

In [thing=594][/thing] players are trying to zero-in on the one card of the deck that is taken out. For instance, in a 4-player game, everyone receives 8 cards, 3 are placed face-up in the middle of the table, and 1 is removed – finding which card this is, is the goal.

To do this, players have 4 cards in front of them that allow them to ask questions, limited by the card. So a Green 3 allows the player to ask another player how many Green cards with 3 gems she has. Say the player answers, "Two". Now, everyone at the table knows that this player has 2 green cards with 3 gems. The player that asks, however, receives the two cards and looks at them. Therefore, everyone gains a clue, but the one asking knows for sure which cards they are. There are some cards that allow for a general question such as, "How many yellow cards do you have?" In this case, everyone will receive the same amount of information, since the player who answered doesn't need to show the yellow cards she has, she only needs to tell how many.

Everyone has a player aid in which to take notes regarding the information they receive. Still, memory can play a big part in the game, especially if your notes (like mine) become too confusing and can't really help you much.

[thing=594][/thing] is all about player interaction - though that is capped at asking and answering. There is no screwing your opponents, no king-making, no bluffing (players must always answer truthfully). Also, the game won't hold your hand if you lag behind - there is no catch up mechanism, except a wild guess if you think someone else is near to winning and you aren't. You can still try to win, and going by probability alone, you will hit the mark once in a while.

[thing=594][/thing] is deduction distilled to its core. It is indeed a mental exercise. It isn't a thematic experience in investigation, as you will find in [thing=20963][/thing], or in [thing=2511][/thing] or in [thing=39339][/thing]. I would say that [thing=594][/thing] is akin to a group Sudoku, where the each person in the group has just a few numbers and positions, and you need to learn what the others have in order to find the number/column of the missing piece in the grid.

Therefore, [thing=594][/thing] can be too dry for some tastes, and even frustrating, as a single wrong annotation can mean that you already have no chance of winning. And, if a player fumbles in one answer, it can screw the game for someone else irreparably, or even for the whole table, and it can be as simple as, "I have only one yellow," when you are actually thinking about red.

In the end, [thing=594][/thing] isn't the sort of game I'm thrilled about it - it requires more attention than I am usually able to gather late on a Friday night, and I like my games dripping with theme. Still, it is good enough to play occasionally, but I can see it becoming a favorite in some groups, especially those keen for puzzles.

A fine, underappreciated little deduction game. Like many Sackson designs, it takes one idea (deduction) and strips out as many other competing mechanics as possible. What's left is a tight, approachable game that provokes a lot of good thinking without a lot of components, rules, or time. There's not enough depth or variation here for a hardcore game group to replay week after week. But it's still a notch above a "filler game", and one of my favorites when I want a thoughtful game for a group or occasion where the time and effort explaining a heavier Euro isn't feasible.

I really enjoy this game but the people I play with don't like it as much as I do. They would much rather play Mystery of the Abbey. One main reason why they don't like is that I have the Face2Face version and the artwork on both the gem cards and the question cards are somewhat confusing. These were my fellow gamer's complaints however, I don't experience the same problems with the artwork as they do. I tried making it easier on them by giving them some pointers on how to read the cards, but they still didn't seem to enjoy. Pity, I would of given it an 8 otherwise.

Sort of a distilled "best essence" of Clue. Use logical deduction to determine the hidden card, without all that silly traipsing around on a game board. This game rewards methodical and accurate bookkeeping, and can be torturous if the players aren't prepared to concentrate.

Absolutely requires a large enough group to make it interesting.  The best deduction game I've played, probably because it is pure, and players have access to very similar, but not identical information.  Easy to get non-gamers or light gamers to play this by comparing it to [gameid=1294].  It's a more complicated puzzle, but the gameplay supports it much better than Clue does.  For best effect, organize your notes by opposing player, and then only record the information relevant to their hand under their name.  Much easier to track that way.

 The graphic interface in the recent face-to-face games edition is a nightmare.. how hard was it to get right?? The major issue mechanically is that compared to Black Vienna, the category distribution of cards in a player's hand can be intrinsically more or less advantageous to that player off the bat, whereas in BV there is no such issue because of the existence of only one category- letters. As a result, I feel that Black Vienna makes this game obsolete.

RATING: 5
Deduction games aren't my forte, but this one is short, and fairly simple.  The use of the cards in asking questions would keep the game from growing stale, I think, but the real key is knowing when to ask which question.  Not bad; would like to play more.

A deduction game. Three types of gems (diamond, opal, pearl), three quantities (solitaire, pair, cluster), four colors (red, blue, green, yellow). One card is removed from play, this is the combination that needs to be guessed. All other cards are dealt out evenly to all players with leftovers exposed for all to see. By questioning opponents, learn what they hold and deduce the missing card. However, you can only ask the questions suggested by your 4-card question hand (Two variable questions include: "How many green solitaires?" or "How many opal clusters?"; One variable questions include: "How many green items?"). A turn consists of playing a question card to ask that question to one opponent, making notes about what you learn, then drawing a replacement question card as the signal to the next player to begin. Deduction games introduce randomness into the cross-examination process in different ways (otherwise the game boils down to a set of optimal questions to generate maximum information each turn). In Clue, you can only question an opponent to reveal facts about a case that takes place in the room where your token rests. In Mystery of the Abbey, you can only question the opponent whose token rests in the same space your token resides for that turn. With Sleuth, the cards limit which questions you can ask. Of the three, Sleuth may be our favorite.

My brain! It hurts! (and that's a good thing)

Sleuth is a heavy game in a small box.  This one's been a hit so far and half the fun is discussing your notation system after the game.  Lots of deduction, which is good, but the game can also really drag as people get into deep-think mode.  We play exclusively with the no-card-passing rules, which probably contributes to this somewhat.

Such a simple deduction game yet it will have you scratching your heads. Unlike other similar games (Mystery of the Abbey) we had a harder time tracking what we "knew" because you see less cards and work harder to infer knowledge through answers given to the table. Our single play thus far had 3-players in a tense race to the finish with 2-players simply scratching their heads "not getting it."

I had enormous expectations for this game and i was quite disappointed. It seems almost unplayable, boring and repetitive. It takes a lot of all similar actions to gain just a little information and you need some luck to ask the correct question to the correct opponent. When it's reaching the end you also need the right card to ask the right question.

Probably the deduction game of choice for me at the moment.  I liked it better than Code 777 and Black Vienna.  Appeared daunting at first, especially having to accustom myself to the quantity terminology (solitaire, pair, cluster).  My only reservation for Sleuth is whether or not it can stand up to repeated plays, especially after one has figured out an effective yet simple tracking system.  I guess this is applicable to all games of this genre.

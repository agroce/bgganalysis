Recently updated to a 10. This game has it all for me. This game got me back into painting minis after a 10 year hiatus. I love the leveling up mechanic, the large variety of Other Worlds, and the wonderful RPG feel. LOVE IT!!!

Completely obsessed!!!

Fun atmosphere and theme, with a smooth, easy play sequence.  The minis are a big roadblock to getting started as they take a lot of work to put together.  Once you're through that process, it's easy to get to the table.

RATING: 10
So I gave in to the amazing deals with the Kickstarter campaign and bought this - and it was worth every penny!  I bought both base boxes plus a lot of nice shiny perks that come with being an Outlaw.  

My husband loves the game, and is pretty attached to his character - Wally the Outlaw.  All our friends love the game too.

We've printed off the fan-made character sheets and have most of our characters at level 2, if not level 3!  

Yes, a lot of the game is fighting, but there is exploration, and of course, loot!  Oh, the loot is awesome!  

We have played all the base characters, and have played various scenarios from the game, and are eagerly awaiting all the other Kickstarter goodies to arrive!

RATING: 10
Incredibly fun game!  Thoroughly enjoyed myself from character creation to the epic final battle of our first quest.  Theme is magnificent, and the mechanics were enjoyable.  Component quality is very high.  Using 6-sided dice exclusively does feel very 'Cthulhu-esque' as so many games based on that theme use the same.  Looking forward to the town phase!

RATING: 6
Pros:
+ Really nice theme
+ Beautiful artwork
+ OK narrative
+ Character building has some fun; town is a strong point in this game
+ Beautiful and good quality boards; no tile warping
+ BGG's member Hexacrawl expansion shows some promise; haven't played it so not sure how good it is

Cons:
- Too many dice; roll dice for everything (really!); veteran RPG players probably wont bother; but for a modern tabletop game it seems as old as the old west (and boring as hell)
- Artificial enemy placement; stupid AI ((c'mon, monsters awaiting in queue?!?); poor monsters level up. Following roll dice, monster AI is certainly the most negative and boring aspect of this game
- Exploration is just a lame excuse for killing monsters
- Travelling to other world doesn't mean too much; just a different board color, different deck but same mechanics
- Excessive text everywhere; lacks a better graphic/symbolic representation in order to speed up things
- Hard work to control character building; town is fun but you need some sheets of paper, good organization and careful notes
- Miniatures are low quality/cheap plastic; won't fit properly; it sucks to assembly those

Neutral:
* Sold as a fast-paced game which is not true
* Cards quality is on the low side; sleeves are not an option but a necessity here

Verdict:
* This is a game on the retard side of dungeon crawls. I mean, there is no room for strategy, no tactical decisions to be made. When creatures spawn, kill them as fast as you can (monsters act in the same way). When exhausted, go back to town, buy some fancy clothes, play poker in saloon and when drunk enough go back to the mines for killing more monsters.
* Too big and complex for something that is basically a dice game. But for an occasional game play it can be fun (not for me).
* Have some fun while learning the game. After a couple days it become repetitive and absolutely boring.

To expand on this; I really like the roleplay aspect. The syetem makes it effortless to roleplay without a doubt, but also limits you in ways that are puzzling. A so so game, a great experience.

Kickstarted - Deliver Estimated August 2014 - Delivered October 2014 - For me... it just doesn't get much more fun than this. I have just played once but can't wait to play again and build my character up. The mix of game play (I like Flying Frogs mechanics) and theme is perfect. Put on some old western movie sound tracks and get the guns a blazin! Definitely looking forward to the future stuff from the Kickstarter and the obvious many expansions to come.As a side note... my wife loved it also.

RATING: 9
The best dungeon crawl I've ever played. Fully co-op, amazing theme [and I dont even like the whole western genre!], unbelievable amount of content. 

No two games will ever be the same. I do agree with the criticism that its a lot of dice rolling to decide everything and it doesnt require deep tactical thought [not to say it isnt devoid of interesting decisions!. If you are trying to survive an unlucky sequence of attacks you will be discussing character placement and which items to use during a fight, it does matter]. 

What it does provide is fun! It tells an amazing story, has you wanted to play more and more to get that cool bit of gear to level up to get your next skill. 

It takes a lot from Warhammer Quest and as much as i loved that classic it has aged and does feel dated now. This is a modern version of Quest, with less of its drawbacks and all of its good points.

My favorite game.

RATING: 7
Very cool western meets horror dungeon-crawly RPG adventure game. Campaign system works great. Just wish they'd have actually included character sheets with the game instead of relying on player-created ones as the game REALLY needs it. We both really enjoy this game but feel that it's something we'll never play again; it's great but you need to play it often to remember the rules and keep your campaign going but is not something that we want to play often enough. As a result, we keep having to re-learn the rules and restarting a campaign each time we play which just makes us play even less. Sold as it just wasn't working for us.

Kickstarted.
Great components, OK miniatures (expansion mini's have got much better).
Closest boardgame I have found that gives an rpg dungeon crawl feel.
Open ended campaign.
Good selection of western archetypes with multiple builds so you should find a character for everyone.
Rules are fairly simple though the rule book is not great (typical of flying frog).

Excellent horror western dungeon crawler without the need of a DM. Great "campaign phase" in between crawls which can be just as rewarding/damaging as facing baddies in the dungeons (mines). Not as tactical as a game like Descent but completely enjoyable! Lots of dice rolling!

This requires a serious amount of work to put the models together. I used to be a Wargamer and still enjoy modelling so I loved it, but be warned it is a lot of work and not beginner level either.

The board pieces are beautiful and the way the map tiles connect is even better than Fantasy Flights map tiles in Imperial assault and Descent.

One from my game group called this "The best game we've played so far". Now that is high praise (personally I think TI3 is the best we've played s far), but I got to admit the game is quite addictive. I'm quite happy that I'm getting everything for this game (through the KS).
Will it keep same level of fun, time will tell...  but I'm looking forward to playing it again.

Now I'm not gonna rate it yet, but if I should rate it after the first play, I'd say around 8 - 8.5 would be my rating.

The worst game I have ever played in my life, repetitive, expensive, boring, so much boring .... The AI is very poor, the characters don't have many options or decisions to make, the tiles only changes the shape but they dont have any interest (including Other worlds tiles), upgrading is very limited and random, there is only one strategy against the monsters, the town phase is the worst part of the game (throwing dice again to see a chart and see what the fuck happens with your character, repetitive, boring, very long), the exploring system of tiles is awful: take a card and search the fucking tile with nothing special, to much cards in the game, too much overproduced, too much of everything and nothing, expensive, ... 

I have played this game 10 times, only in the first game I enjoyed some, bout nothing later... Don't buy this game, if only you want to waste your money....

Best fully coop dungeon crawler campaign game currently out there.  It is so expandable it is awesome!  This is just a great adventure game.  Take it as that and you won't be dissappointed.  This game is not a strategy game.  This is an experience that you get to share with your family and friends.  

A few things that the game lost points for:
- Game is not very balanced.  It gets a lot easier at later levels.
- The game only has 1 combat strategy: bottleneck.
- Miniatures require assembly and tools.



Give me more expansions!

RATING: 9.4
This game could have been awesome!!  But some very poor choices in production and missing so many tracking counters and useful cards (the game says just write it all down on paper!!), kept it from obtaining my higher marks.

It's an attempt to combine role playing with a board game set in a fantasy/western world.  My problems started when I got the game.  All the mini's had to be assembled by me...  Exacto, and glue and any hours later, they were all built.  I didn't want to buy a model kit... I wanted a game!!!  JUST GIVE ME PRE-BUILT MINIS!!! 

My next problem was the lack of monsters, again due to the cost of the minis... A game doesn't need minis to be good... This game sacrificed game-play for looks!  That's a no no in my book!! If they had made 10x the number of monsters and had everything counters instead of minis, I would have rated the game much higher!

Also, there are items to buy in the game that have no representation, no cards, no chits, nothing but the old stand-by write it on paper that you have the item!  Again Poor choice by Flying Frog!  End users have come out with home-made cards to correct some of those omissions. I even made a slider to track money and experience... again to eliminate the paper and pencil tracking.

The rules and design seem to be a bit lacking too. You're about to die, level up and start fresh with 100% health and sanity (provided you just banked and held you experience).  Then.... it's die roll, die roll, die roll.... repeat repeat repeat!!

When in town, roll on this chart...  (1-12 [or less] things can happen...  They could have easily made it over 100 possible things happening (a bigger chart cost no more money!!). The game would keep fresh and no so repetitive with new and exciting events each time you play!

As with most FF productions, then include a soundtrack.... WHY???  Who told them this is a good idea?  Fire that person!!!  Nobody uses the soundtrack!!  Put that money into the game to add the cards you left out!!

The game allows you to play each character male or female, but only give you the mini (and cards) for one of them!! A piano player is the same as the saloon girl, but all your cards and items say saloon girl on them.  Not even a chit for the piano player... and this is the same for every character!

Now on the flip-side... the game can be fun (with home made add-ons to remove the fiddliness).  It does bridge the gap between role playing and board gaming pretty well.  The universe in great. the stories (scenarios) are good (but they duplicate 1/2 of them in both core game boxes ARRRGGHHHH!!!  WHY!!!

This game makes me so sad!!  I could have been SO great...  but instead it's just ok.

Initial Impression: This is a nicely designed "run and gun" game with well-constructed components which drip theme. Although I've only played once so far, I believe that most characters use different mechanisms and play differently. Randomness keeps each mission feeling fresh but ultimately each mission is identical, with the largest differences being in length of the mission. The town portion of the game is a wonderful system for linking the missions together and enables the feeling of continuity.

RATING: 1
This is the ultimate dungeon crawl. 

Things that I really love:

1.) Level up system. Best in a board game yet.
2.) Wonderful exploration in the dungeon with darkness cards, growing dread cards, the exploration tokens...perfect.
3.) Combat system - the combination of defense and armor is great.
4.) The town visits are fantastic - encounters in the city, thousand of things you have to buy or spend your dark stones/money for. Wonderful.
5.) The whole campaign system - aborted or failed missions affect the town visit.
6.) Hadrcore mode is there. Fantastic!

The only down side:
- Maybe there are not enough cards for 100+ hours to play. We need more heroes. Four heroes are not enough for 75$.

Nonetheless I was very sceptical that this game could deliver. But man - it is a blast. This is the best dungeon crawl out there easily. Descent (2.0) - pff...no comparison by any means, the D&D games as well. Even the second best Machina Arcana will have a tough time against it.

This is the biggest game FFP have produced yet. It is a classic. Right now.

BUT: FFP´s KS service is horrific. Retail customers get stuff before the backers do. An absolute NO-GO!!! Shame on you, Frogs!

EDIT Feb 2018: Still no info when EU backers will receive their pledges...my worst KS experience so far. Time to rate this!

Kickstarter has created an environment where game designers can express their visionary games, free of publishers, distributors, and their restraints. However, restraint isn't a bad thing in a board game. Shadows of Brimstone has a hundred things going on, dozens of monsters available, a detailed system for spending time in town and leveling up, and just a fascinating number of ways that your character could grow. But it also has so many things that don't need to be there, and should have been eliminated in playtesting. There are three or four different dice systems; you might be rolling a die pool looking for a target number, rolling a single die to generate a number, rolling the number of successes that a monster rolled to eliminate those successes, rolling the number of dice that the non-eliminated successes produced to eliminate those successes, rolling two or three dice against a target number, rolling to determine a random character, rolling on a chart...it would be effortless to condense all these die mechanics into a single system, but because of Kickstarter, there was no pressure on them to do so.
These big boxes are very exciting, and the toy factor is significantly high, but I really don't expect Shadows of Brimstone to be of any significance in 2015.

More than one Flying Frog game is in my top 10. I love their art style, how the card play flows with the theme, and becoming immersed in every environment they bring to the table. I'm not quite sure where my experience with Shadows of Brimstone went wrong, but, at least with just the base game, it felt sorely lacking. Our group seemed to level up and recover all the worthwhile loot very early on, and combined with a very vague and uninspired concept of a "campaign" system, it felt like we we had no reason to continue playing after maybe 5 or 6 sessions. There seems to be this sense of an IDEA of something truly interesting and grand to experience with Shadows of Brimstone, but until I can find some enjoyment in the base game, I can't justify spending hundreds of dollars on expansions to make the game feel less "bare bones".

Wife and I love playing this as a campaign. Combat is light and quick, the feeling of exploration is fun, and you grow in power from gear and talents as you level. The game very story/theme driven from the cards, injuries, and mutations you can gather.  We think of Shadows as a mix between a co-op Descent and Betrayal at House on the Hill.  Don't come in expecting a deep strategic combat system.  Come for the fun co-op, character building, exploration, light role playing experience. Also, expect lots of dice rolling. Lots and lots of dice rolling!

For a dungeon crawler, it's freakin awesome. It's kind of like a faster DnD; as events, injury, mutations, and gear affect your character's play style. The game is really tough though if you don't lose to dying or madness, the darkness track has a good chance of getting your posse. The new big negatives are set-up plus put-away and it will not fit back into its box.

2014. Co-op, RPG-like dice-fest, Ameri-trash dungeon crawl game.

Others say: it's an experience game... the only reason to buy or play it is if you're going to play the campaign game in order to enjoy the story that unfolds from all of the dice rolling and random events... there's not even much in the way of tactics (let alone strategy) for battles, etc.  Dice rolls ontop of dice rolls... every time you do anything (even the start and end of the day).  Combat dice rolls can be quick or can become sloggy... back and forth and back and forth.  Construction of the plastic miniatures (lots of gluing) is tedious and annoying, and the end result can be a bit ugly with seams and extra glue showing on the figures.

RATING: 8.5
Really great ameritrash game! Tons of cards and minis and awesome map tiles. The various missions can prove quite challenging and the procedurally generated map always creates an interesting dungeon-delving experience.

But the thing this game does best is in it's campaign (and character advancement) rules. It really stops feeling like a board game sometimes and borders on the RPG experience. Tons of random tables and options in town, tons of things your character can do, or ways he/she can advance... it's awesome.

I will likely never own this game though for one huge reason. I hate assembling mini's and this is one where you need some super glue and some sprue cutters and a ton of time before you can get it to the table. Still a great game however, and worth checking out!

This is one of the biggest disappointments in my gaming carrier mainly because of this offending Kickstarter policy. After now about three years, I still don´t have all my stuff. $%$§"&%/§!!!
Gameplay is pretty stupid although sometimes fun...little tactical decisions to make...just dice rolling. Components, including minis are of a disappointing quality for me, compared to what I´m used to from the company. 
The rulebook is a mess. 
The artwork of the map tiles is beautiful...gotta give them that.

I guess I just don't like dungeon crawlers.  I think if I'm going to play with miniatures, I should just play a miniatures game...  Thinking about selling my KS, but I could also just repurpose the minis for other games--maybe a home-brew wild west miniatures game, since I have a lot of lead cowboys lying around...

If the the miniatures were single mold, or pre-assembled, they'd be fine...  But I think multi-part models are a real barrier for board gamers and not quite up to snuff to compare with other minis...

I do see a lot of theme in Flying Frog Games, but I didn't find the gameplay that engaging.  I'd previously sold my copy of Fortune and Glory.  I've heard good things about Touch of Evil, but I think maybe I'm just not on the same wavelength here.

RATING: 7
2016  Initial thoughts. I love the theme, the components, the gear and artifact cards, the leveling up system, and the ease of gameplay.  Lack of AI and lack of meaningful choices while exploring the mines take what could have been a really great game and makes it just good.  Still need to play the campaign more to make a definitive verdict.
***Also own swamps of death.

Man oh man this game has a lot I like.  Great minis.  Changeable maps. Leveling up characters.  Recouping in town. Other worlds.

But...

This game is stuck in the middle of what it wants to be.  It comes with tons of cardboard pieces, yet you need pencil and paper to track character changes and basic gold and XP.  Why couldn't they create a character card with spinning dials to track changes?  

I like this game, will definitely keep playing, but I'm struggling with "what could have been"

Discovering the Hexcrawl Campaign has made me really excited to keep playing this.

A really good dungeon crawler with a unique western theme crossed with Cthulu like monsters. Monsters controlled by dice rolls and tables. The only issue is that the game can "pile on" to the heroes creating situations that can't be overcome or indeed just murdering all the characters in town while they're resting! One has to watch the "DM Robot" and ignore anything too ridiculous. That said, it's a lot of fun and very much worth playing.

Simple, mundane, repetitive, and expensive.  No idea why this is so highly rated.  Monsters have no intelligence.  Missions have no purpose.  Heroes have no decisions to make, just walk in and shoot away.  Disappointing.  The expansions undoubtedly help relieve some of the boredom of seeing the same monsters over and over again, but there's no way I'm dumping more money into this expensive game when there is little hope that any kind of meaningful decisions actually get added in.

Assembly is a pain in the ass.  The miniatures could have been way better and pale in comparison to Myth.  Game does look interesting although a huge dice fest.  Haven't played yet.

-----------------------------

Played 2 missions, I'm a fan.  I am worried about the longevity due to the tactical nature of the game seeming somewhat simple/straightforward (move the team into the entry way choke point and repeatedly fire until everything is dead).  I love the Encounters and the level up system.  Items/gear are great too although possibly very swingy.

Wow. This is fun. It seemed like it took forever for this to be ready and shipped, but it did finally arrive, and it was everything I had hoped. While my girlfriend and I aren't used to putting together our miniatures, it was a pleasant enough activity that took up a few of our nights. Then our heroes descended into the hellish mines and fought their way through the introductory campaign listening to Ennio Morricone's western soundtracks. Very much looking forward to playing this again, and again, and again.

Shadows of Brimstone is a western/cthulhu-styled dungeon crawler.  Unlike other dungeon-crawler games, like Doom for instance, it's fully co-operative.  I'm a big fan of the map deck mechanic; playing the same scenario objectives still feels fresh after a few replays because the board layout is always different.

Of the two base game boxes I prefer City of the Ancients (hence the 0.5 higher score).  The Cowboys and Aliens meets Lovecraft vibe is really fun.

Cooperative Dungeon Crawl RPG style boardgame with Old West setting mixed with C'thulu horror theme.

 +++ Great components (except Miniatures)
 +++ Campaign
 +++ Hero leveling
 +++ Good scaling amongst player count
 +++ Fun, Fun, Fun
 +++ Very thematic
 ++ Many RGP Elements
 ++ Characters with different feel 
 ++ Great AI logic for enemies
 ++ Playable Solo (and it is fun though)
 ++ Stunning artwork 

 --- Inconsistent Keyword usage on some cards
 -- Rules are somtimes not 100% clear.
 - Miniatures delivered unassambles and not that detailed
 - duration of one adventure differs much

 o Very luck dependent 
 o Feels like "analog diablo"
 o Tons of components 

A game I always want to play - even with it's few flaws it is still an outstanding game for me

Kickstarter Impressions:

I have played Flying Frog Productions games before and even own Last Night on Earth and have not been very impressed. Decent games but I felt their rules and production quality were a bit shoddy.

I went into the Kickstarter skeptical, but in the end the setting really drew me in. So unique and interesting. I backed it and backed enough to get just about everything they offered.

Intial Impressions:

The two starter boxes were huge! Everything seemed fairly good quality and well packaged. No damages and no immediate quality issues.

The Components:

Models - The models were plentiful but a bit low quality compared to what I'm used to. I would say they are higher quality than the average board game but lower quality than the average miniatures game. The decisions for the sprues and how models were cut were pretty amature. Many places are difficult to clean and the models require a lot of extra work as multiple pieces must be glued at the same time because many limbs need to be placed inside the joining torso. The models once built have many gaps that require filling and sometimes don't even fit together right. Very frustrating.

Tokens and map tiles - Excellent! All tiles and tokens feel good in your hand and appear that they can be used without fear of utter destruction.

Cards - A little thin (similiar to their other cards in games) with a coating that leaves a bit of texture, but overall very usable. The art is all nicely done and cards convey theme and information without issue.

Odds and ends - Rulebooks are paper books and work just fine. The dice are very average as well.The character boards are a little lack luster, but they get the job done.

Da Rulez - Pretty good. I would say 90% of the game is accounted for with very little question. A couple clear ups here and there would have been nice and some term consistency would have gone a long way, but I do think the game can be learned, played and taught using only the rulebook.

Gameplay - Very impressive. They managed to create a dungeon crawler that works with the Old American West setting and the Cthulhu Mythos feel. The game is not only about combat (while it is a large component) and a lot of memorable scenes come from the non-combat encounters.

As long as one person has read the rulebook thoroughly, up to five (with both sets) others can sit down fairly ignorant to the game and pick it up fast. A lot of team work is invovled and there is a bit of a learning curve that can punish a team that doesn't take the game at the right pace.

Bottom Line - This is an impressive game that, while not perfect, shows that with a good idea, passionate, skilled people and the drive to make it fun, any idea can be a great board game.

I'm really looking forward to this game.

Love A Touch of Evil, Fortune and Glory, Conquest of Planet Earth, Invasion from Outer Space and Last Night on Earth games from FFP.
So I'm confident this will be just as amazing.  I'm certain it will become one of my favorites.


The rating may change eventually, but I don't see it changing much.

This game is a strange bastard between a board-game and and a Pen and Paper RPG-System. As far as dungeon crawlers go, this one is most akin to action-RPGs a la Diablo. There's no "campaign" out of the box, but an abundance of randomizers lends a lot of "grindy" replayability to the missions (as someone who has s played more than 800 hours of Diablo 3, thats certainly a good thing), character advancement is very satisfying, the theme is great and almost perfectly realized, the miniatures look good when painted (though they're very much mediocre quality wise) and I expect this game to be both very expandable and customizable. Almost perfect.

Disclaimer: Not a kickstarter backer, bought both base games at retail, so no extras (yet).

COMPLETE MINECART pledge plus the add-ons to round out the incomplete expansions, all of the available card packs, as well as the promo red sprues and the promo Outlaw class (possibly a few other things I'm forgetting). The two base games have been opened and played (miniatures assembled, some of them painted), very good condition. Frontier Town was opened and played once, but is otherwise like new (minis still unassembled). Everything else is "new", unopened, still shrink-wrapped if applicable.

Interesting, thematic, and fun. Everyone has something to do (even if multiple people are playing as the same class), and I have yet to come across a rule I dislike. Bonus points for the amazing soundtrack!
Note that, while a single core set technically only supports up to four players, the total can easily be brought up to six with a little extra paperwork and mini substitution. My playgroup currently has two Heroscape lawmen pulling double-duty as Brimstone characters.

Pros: Cool miniatures but not a fan of having to glue them. Great character leveling and customization through chosen skill trees and equipment. Cool soundtrack, great cards and cardboard components. Tons of cards and components.

Cons: Combat is lacking in tactics so far. Fights can be a long slog of misses or back and forth healing and damage. Not much variation to battles so far. I dislike having to write down character inventory and stats.

More of an adventure game than tactical game with random dice rolls to determine outcomes of travel, combat, and character development. Story is emergent through gameplay though there is some story text and a comic in the rules.

Really cool character building but the game mechanics are super shallow. There's exactly 1 strategy for every mission and it's simply not interesting. I like to think at least some when I play board games...and there's none of that here. Even party games are bigger brain burners than Shadows of Brimstone (other than the rules that are overly convoluted).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of the best “dungeon crawler” games, the rules are quite easy to learn even for 10 years old kids. If you like cooperative game, you will really enjoy this one. The campaign mode will give you a good idea of how you can improve the capacity of your hero. This game scales very well between 2 and 4 players, but solo game is also available. The pace is good and you never face the same enemies and encounters. You also have many add-on available (cards, enemy-packs) to enhance the game, but the core game content is really sufficient for outstanding time of mines and “other worlds” investigations.
The mixture of cowboys with monster/demon and travel to other worlds through portals is a really good mixture! Multiple missions are available (12 in one core game) and with the addition of other world, the game possibilities seem limitless.
I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes action cooperative game!

Here in City of ancient core set, you have 4 different classes of hero with their own assets and specialties. All classes enable a very interesting game and can be played without being dependent on another one. This core set includes a world that represent a city from outer space that is completely frozen and may enable you to find alien artifact like plasma gun. 3 specific missions are included for this world. The quality of the figurines are really good and you will enjoy painting them if this is one of your hobby (all mine are now painted and this really improve the game play).

Another originality is the hero you play can improve with the experience you get from your adventure and becomes stronger with time, but the good point is that characteristics of the enemies evaluate also depending on the level of your hero posse! So you never become too strong and you can also get some injuries or madness that you will keep if you do not heal them between each mission. In fact the system introduces rules for sanity loss if you encounter horrors and your hero may also may suffer of mutations due to corruption damage (I will let you the surprise). A “time counter” is also introduced to keep you hero posse under stress with possible failure if you take too much time to visit and scavenge instead of focusing on your goals! The only problem you may face is that this game need a lot of space to set up an play and it is good to have a dedicated place for playing this game.

All in all, this is of the greatest game I ever played.

Amazing game... Component quality is lacking. Thematically, this is my sort of game... Lovecraftian old western horror... wowie. Tons of replayability, great artwork and gameplay!  The negatives...  Both core sets can be pricey and the component quality in the minis is just very disappointing.  You have to assemble them which has been troublesome for some people that consider this as a purchase (I didn't mind) but the detail within the minis is not up to contemporary gaming standards.

My enjoyment and love for the game have grown over the last couple of months and plays. As far as RPGs in a box go, SoB is at the top of its game. There is a ton of adventure and fun to have here. It's just a shame that it really does require a lot of expansions to make that so.

*****

I own so much SoB stuff. Too much. Love the theme and all the stuff. However, it all deserves to be in a much better game. With enough house rules and fan supplements, it's very fun, but out of the box it is far too basic.

Juegazo mazmorrero con un tema original y que rezuma molonidad.

-- Tras varias partidas
Lo mejor del juego su tema y rápido setup, lo peor que a veces las misiones se vuelven imposibles/incontrolables. El clérigo está completamente roto, gana demasiada XP con sermones. Igualmente y aunque las minis de la 1a edición sean malas (especialmente los héroes), el juego sigue rezumando tema y molonidad.

Only one play, yes. And with six people, yes. So far I don't know what the hype is all about. To me it was boring, long and unnecessarily overproduced. For some reason, a Wild West dungeon crawler sounded better on paper. I just don't see the theme and, for my taste, there are too many dice rolls to deal with. I prefer more direct dice resolution like in Doom, Descent, Gears of War or Level 7: Omega Protocol.

[u]The Good[/u]: With a focus on character progression that's rare among board games, combined with an impressive loot system and a solid exploration system - this game has many of the key traits one might look for in a dungeon crawl.

[u]The Bad[/u]: 1) The ruleset came up well short in the tactics and decision-making department, and the further you get into the game, the more imbalanced certain parts of the game become. 2) The game has no ending. This may not be an issue for some, but I need a purpose to my game sessions - not just a mindless (but juicy) frolic. It *is* fun, as it stands. But it could be oh so much more..

[u]The Bottomline[/u]: If you're partial to dungeoncrawls, even with its substantial drawbacks, this game is a pretty good one. And it could end up being exceptional, after all the expansion content is released - we'll have to wait and see.

*My set up for trade. All minis assembled but not painted.*

There's a lot of rules that seem to need clarification, but I've printed out a flow chart I got from another user which has been really handy. I can't wait to get the town expansion. One thing I didn't like was having to glue my models together for this one. Had I realized that, I might not have backed it.

Disclaimer: I am not a fan of this type of game. My complaints are always the same: the terrain is too similar, there are too few enemies and the enemies are too similar, there's too much luck and too little strategy and the game is too long to hold my interest without sufficient strategy.  All of this is true for this game.

RATING: 10
If your a fan of big table top games with an enormous amount of customization Shadows of Brimstone is a good choice. Like Arkham Horror or Fortune and glory there is a lot of dice rolling.

SoB uses some great role playing aspects including rolling for hits first then rolling for damage which is fun, and also implements a leveling system and character creation for multiple campaigns. 

If you like to play games that tell a story jump in feet first and roll to survive. 

You do have to assemble your characters and monsters, this was my first time ever assembling miniatures. It was definitely a learning curve but not altogether time consuming.

Yikes. I used to love Flying Frog games, but I traded every one I bought over time. They are addicted to theme and lots of cards, but don't design great games mechanically. This is a clear example of that. Tons of cards, tons of miniatures, for a mindless, poorly balanced slog that takes far too long. And they basically stole the Deadlands theme... real classy guys.

Whoa! Amazing, amazing, amerithrash goodness! The theme hits all the right buttons for me...western/horror and a bit of scifi, too. If you can get into the theme even just a bit, you're in for a wonderful story that builds along with character players that do as well. This is an excellent example of an RPG in a box. In fact, my 11 & 12-year old sons are absolutely mesmerized by all the options and upgrading...they literally ask to play this every day. Loving this game!

The game is created with love and it definitely shows! It's dripping with theme, the artwork is evocative, the flavor text is rich and well written. It's not a very tight design though. It's rather fiddly, not very tactical and it requires time, table space and involvement to be enjoyed thoroughly. If you let go though, prepare for quite a ride!

My absolute favorite "dungeon crawl" game, for both theme and mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Way, way too much model assembly required. I have done my share of miniature assembly and painting in the past. To me, it's often a necessity but I really don't enjoy the process. In this case after my fifth hour of trimming, filing and gluing, I expected to see the "Testors" logo on the box. Plus, who thought it was a good idea to make miniatures with 3mm long feet and bases without attachment holes or grooves? Now, I'm drilling feet and bases so I can pin the miniatures to the bases. Attention Flying Frog: Not all serious board gamers have the time or enjoy modelling and painting. When can I start reading the rules, let alone start playing the game? 
As I start reading the rules, I find a very limited monster selection. Six monster types and one of them is not represented by the plethora of monster models I just assembled. I will likely get pretty tired of shooting spiders and snakes (I mean tentacles).
The game is a luck-driven dungeon crawl with lots of dice chucking. Just go into the game expecting as much. I do, however, like the character development and campaign play.
Maybe my expectations were too high, but a large box game with only four character types and six different monsters was a bit of a let-down. In the end, play seems rote and limited to a very light experience.

RATING: 7
The game has too many useless steps. Like rolling for movement is not only useless, it is completely stupid. Rolling for attack, protection and then getting damage makes combat way too long, should be attack and damage only. Many other features makes the game a lesser form of Warhammer Quest.

It is still fun if you remove the stupid movement die and if you could remove the defense die and just go with armour that reduces damage taken or something like that, it would remove a step in the game which would hasten each games. They would be much shorter and you would be able to play more games within an evening. Just watched a video about a solo game and the game lasted for an hour (if you remove the instructions part of the video, included it's about 90 min), way too long, it's solo, should take like 20 min with setup to finish a scenario.

The artwork is sometimes nice sometimes poor or bland, I prefer WQ's. The other mechanics are pleasant, not too cumbersome or time consuming... but I would remove some dice rolls that I think are useless like the Town Board for example, not only is it useless for me but it also increases game price a little (shipping costs for weight), especially if you remove the other items that I find useless.

Gave it only a 7 out of 10 because it has too many useless things and is takes way too much time to play compared to WQ. 

Warhammer Quest remains king in this genre of game.

Pales in comparison to the great evolution of the genre, namely Kingdom Death. It's a little too reliant on unmodified (and unmodifiable) d6 rolls, which is rather tedious and occasionally frustrating.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: no he llegit les regles en profunditat, només per sobre. Dungeoncrawler ambientat al Far West i amb temes de Lovecraft. Mecàniques simples, diuen que similars al Warhammer Quest. Purament cooperatiu, els monstres inclouen IA. Es juga per campanyes, els personatges guanyen PX durant les aventures i es poden millorar (tenen un full de personatge, al estil rol).

Potser té massa atzar, i el tema de la IA dels enemics acostuma a ser complicat que funcioni bé al 100% (es fan molt predictibles). M'agradaria probarlo abans de jutjar, però serà difícil...

RATING: 9.3
Outlaw Pledge + Everything that goes with targa & jargano, minus the xxl figure, plus all the coolest extra hero minis

Think the Swamps box edges it over the City set, but only by a gnats cock, and only through personal preference.

The game is a carbon copy of warhammer quest, but with more fun, theme and randomness added. Thinking the other worlds and levelling, will lift it to another level. Won't be long now, as I have managed to get some old westerners through the first few missions! Theme comes over in spades. Not enough ranged beasts, and being tied to moving before attacking means fights are too static, otherwise an awesome game

Swamps of death mixed in. All the other bits coming in wave 2.

This game is absolutely stellar. I really believe that is the best campaign system I've ever seen. I think it's just the right balance between self-contained modular adventures and ongoing story. It punishes you for failing and rewards you for succeeding, but does so without ever tilting the game horribly towards one side or the other. The ridiculous amount of assembly for flimsy minis, the lack of sensible methods for tracking statistics and items, and the shallowness of the item decks (which can often be run through fully in a single 6-player adventure) are all complaints that simply fade away as the experience of the game itself coalesces. I won't say you've never played anything like it, because you have. But what a delightful experience it is.

Really liked this dungeon-crawler and it fulfilled my expectations for a dungeon crawler quite well (skill trees, unexplored maps, unknown monster locations, etc.). For me and my group it's a plus that it plays without a keeper. It really has (almost) all of those RPG-elements that I hoped to see in Descent 2nd edition, didn't find them there and was badly disappointed. Right now, this is my favorite dungeon-crawler and atm I don't see any contender for this spot. I am also a fan of the Cthulhu mythos and cthulhuesque settings, so that hepls. =)

RATING: 7.5
I like this game, it is a good way of expending an evening with friends without having to be competitive or thinking all the time about how to win the round. You just enjoy the cooperative planning, the events and killing and looting, that's it. If you are the kind of player that doesn't like cooperative games and do not like a game primarily driven by luck (up to certain point), this is not your game, otherwise, you should try this one.
Positive:
1. The game is actually fun
2. The torch/light mechanic
3. As almost every cooperative game, recommendable for new players
4. The village mechanic: the longer you are in, the higher the risk
Negative:
1. Easy game
2. The characters are not well balanced. If you have the character that rolls dice massively each time you shoot, probably you will have a better experience than that player that just has a Derringer and rolls 1 or 2 dice

Finally a real stab at a WHQ successor, though it is almost 2.0 as SO much was lifted.  A real godsend to anyone who always wanted but never could afford WHQ, but to someone who has that game and is not burnt out on it I'm not sure how much new it really offers, lots of little differences to be sure, but it is largely the exact same game (so if just looking for a new re-themed version with different characters and monsters this will fit the bill). 

Note though that WHQ has the 175 page roleplay book which SoB does not come close to, and there is a LOT of neat D&D stuff (and well, much more roleplaying stuff and theme) in there that did not port over to SoB (main concepts are all mostly there though, albeit many things have been simplified [like WHQ skills are MUCH cooler], which will suit the masses better actually). WHQ is still the closest thing to playing D&D w/o a GM, w/o actually doing it, and therefore still the best game in this genre (with a couple of small tweaks to well-known unbalances) This would be like an 8 for me, WHQ is a 9, Ravenloft is a 6 as is the Pathfinder card game

I really love this game.  It first of all is a blast, any way you play it (whether you mod the game or play it as directed).  

I was afraid that this might be a game that I would like less and less the more I played it.  However, quite the opposite has proven true.  The more I have gotten this game to the table, the more it has sparked my imagination and left me wanting to play more. 

The story it tells is fantastic. The characters, components, artifacts, encounters and items drive the story to endless and interesting places.  This is especially true if you take a time to elaborate, develop and make connections with the ongoing story being told by your party throughout your adventures!  

If you are a more "euro" gamer looking for depth, I can admittedly say the design of this game really isn't much to celebrate.  That said, if you want a meatier experience, this game easily integrates whatever mods you want to make.  Our group shamelessly has and ultimately we have designed a smoother, more "choosier" gaming experience. And dang is it fun!

If you will allow me, as a fellow gamer and friend I must endearingly say this--get over the "I have to put these minis together" complaint/excuse and buy this excellent game! :-D.  IT IS WORTH IT.

EDIT: After having recieved wave 1.5 I have come to appreciate the design much more!  A lot of the new enemies are pretty amazing and it makes the choices of the posse really interesting.  Loving this game right now!

Initial Rating: 6.0 (July 2015)

Gorgeous game!!! The art and game components are top notch and I also greatly enjoy the theme. Upon a time I would have loved the game, but nowadays I almost always prefer to play heavy thinky games. In Shadows of Brimstone: City of the Ancients the decisions are (more or less) obvious and straightforward so it is luck that decides if  we succeed or fail. Still I like the game a lot and with correct game group it is a blast to play.

I would like to read the rules because I’m sure we made some mistakes, but I had a good time playing it. Its strongest point for me is the campaign mode. I love games in which one can advance the same character over many scenarios (I´m the gunslinger :D).

I dislike the way the movement is handled, you can try to plan the best way to approach a tile or some enemies, but if you rolled poorly all your plans crumble, besides it doesn’t make thematic sense, why would I move differently each turn? I would have preferred a fix value for this stat but this is a staple from Flying Frog. To summarize, I feel this aspect diminish the game tactics for me and it makes me rate it a 6.0. Also the monster AI is a bit wonky.

I love the game variety, it comes with many characters (I think but perhaps some were from an expansion) with a full-fledged tech tree, this adds a lot of fun to me when I’m leveling up and it also adds lots of replay value. The theme is awesome!

Bottom line, I enjoy the game and would like to finish a campaign. I don’t think I will buy it as a close friend has it all. I still like Myth a bit more. I would have liked it more if a player managed the bad guys.

A bit of a dice fest and has some tricky little rules dotted in here and there but the end product is an engaging story with some excellent character development.  The game can range from ridiculously hard to relatively easy depending on how you are rolling.  The minis are a pain to assemble, mostly because of where they are attached to the sprue and being small and fiddly.

Good co-op dungeon crawl with a wild-west/horror (of the Cthulu flavor) that feels like a cross between Arkham Horror and Castle Ravenloft.  The graphics and flavor text do a good job imparting the western theme.  It moves quickly and some of the character abilities allow you to make up for the swings of luck.  There's a lot of dice rolling in the game, so you need to take advantage of those abilities to avoid a quick death.

It's my personal holy grail: great setting, always different events, even the part between the missions is managed very well. The character's progression is consistent, with some random features and other features chosen by the player, thus making the game experience different every time.

Some flaws are in the assembly difficulty of the miniatures (especially for those who haven't ever done before like myself, they require time and patience) and in the rules that have scattered informations divided between the generic rulebook and the adventures rulebook. However this has no impact on the gameplay which is addictive and super fun.

Lots of dice, lots of cards. But the atmosphere is superb and I like the theme and style of the game. We will test campaign mode this week, I'm really excited!
Update: Campagne Play makes it even more dicey but more funny. Seeing your characters grow and getting better at killing those monsters is a really cool experience.

Unfortunately, there is no real balancing and in the end, it was almost too easy killing all the swarms of monsters and manglers. But there's some cool fan made stuff out there, have a look at it!

This is an amazing game, I loved painting the minis, different world mean different style and colours,and stargating (our slag for other world) to other worlds is wot sold it to me. my only problem is the difficulty of obtaining any of the range with in the UK. And some of the expansions just seemed a bit (I shrug my shoulders ).

Love it, very thematic. However, far to much bits and pieces: it takes forever to set up and break down, so it will only ever hit the table when we play at my place, and I'll only solo-play when I have lots of free time.
After two plays, I'd say the City of Ancients heroes are slightly more interesting than the Swamps of Death ones.
The Artifacts from Targa Plateau however, are much, much more interesting than those of the Swamps
EDIT: Thanks to a bit of organising, setup- and breakdown time have been reduced to more manageable levels.

Shadows of Brimstone: City of the Ancients is a fast-paced, fully cooperative, dungeon-crawl board game set in the Old West, with a heavy dose of unspeakable horror! Players create characters, taking on the role of a classic Western Hero Archetype, such as the Law Man, Gunslinger, or Saloon Girl. Forming an adventuring posse, the Heroes venture down into the dark mines, overrun with all manner of ancient demons and foul creatures from another world. With tactical gameplay, lots of dice, and a robust card-driven exploration system, no two games are ever the same as the heroes explore the mines finding new enemies to fight, new loot to collect, and new dangers to overcome. Players can even find portals to other worlds, stepping through to continue their adventures on the other side!

Here is why I should really love [b]Shadows of Brimstone[/b]:

Lovecraftian horror + Wild West as an interesting mix of theme, dungeon crawling, different characters with different abilities, characters gaining experience which lets them grow, equipment and loot, the right amount self-aware humour, miniatures, storytelling elements, roleplaying elements and a modular board system for exploration.

Yet, what brings this game so much down from a potential 9 or even 10 is the game's glaring game design imbalances and boring combat system. The combat system is hopelessly outdated and appears amateurish in design, especially when compared to other modern dungeon crawlers like [b][thing=104162][/thing][/b] or [b][thing=36932][/thing][/b].

Positioning does not matter most of the time in combat and the heroes are usually trying to make a stand between the narrow part that connects two map tiles to give the enemies less room and opportunities to attack, as most monsters can only attack in melee combat and will directly charge at the players' characters. Outrunning the enemies does not work, as most enemies are equally fast or even faster with a fixed movement value, while all players need to roll for movement with a 6-sided die -- so there is a always a high variance present in movement for the players.

This high variance also applies to wounds caused in combat or by events, which can be [b]extremely[/b] frustrating. The randomness of a D6 with results between 1-6 are already swingy enough, but the game often even goes beyond that. One event card even deals D6 (1-6) hits with [b]each[/b] of them dealing 3 damage -- that a random variance span of 3-36 potential damage !

The fixed movement and defense values for enemies are beneficial to the flow of the game and a good design decision, as it streamlines the game a lot, but sadly, the good and clever game design decisions for combat already end here.

Another huge problem is that the damage dealt by the players is again determined by rolling D6s or D8s, which again results in a [i][b]way[/b][/i] too high variance span and dependency on pure luck. In the end, the game boils down to one huge, brainless and boring dice fest.

The roll for movement aspect for the players is a huge step backwards in modern game design. Granted, there is an optional rule which allows players to work with a fixed movement value, but they still need to roll a die to determine if they get 1 Grit (which is one of the game's resources) at the beginning of their turn.

Speaking of optional rules, this game deserves praise for offering a few indeed nice modular optional rules, which can make the game a bit more thematic, complex and difficult.

What is less appealing to most board game players is the fact that this game requires a lot of time for the miniature assembly. Veteran miniature game players won't have any problems with that, as they have the routine, patience and the required tools at hand, but this can be a real problem for pure board game players. In fact, I have heard from many players that they immediately ignored or even resold the game the moment they realised that the miniatures are not preassembled. This is arguably an overreaction, as the miniatures are relatively easy to assemble and the publisher even released miniature assembly tutorial videos for every miniature on YouTube. Still, it requires some tools and quite some time.

Each starter box features 4 different heroes and each of them has 4 unique skill trees with a total of 16 skills. Every hero also starts with one random unique personal item and one out of three unique starting skills, so the replay value and possibilities for character customisations are really great.

Still, it's disappointing that a game for 1-4 players offers [i]exactly[/i] 4 characters, which means that all heroes are always present in a game with 4 players without giving the players some freedom to choose. An additional 5th character would have been really great here.

Some players might also have a problem with the necessary book keeping of this game, as every player is required to have a piece of paper and a pencil at hand, writing most of the character's progress down (experience points, gained abilities, collected gold, ect.). The fan community of this game started to solve this problem by creating and printing their own cards for gold values, experience points and abilities, which can be a great addition to this game, but it also results in more costs to an already expensive game.

The game's difficulty scaling is handled very well in a very streamlined way, but the game suffers like most heavily thematic and dice-focused games from an imperfect balance, which players are probably even expecting from a game like this.

The game has without question heart, but sadly no brains. Most artworks are hand-drawn and really great. The miniature quality is...okay. The amount of cards and tokens is great. The adventure book offers enough to keep the players busy for a long time. The soundtrack could have been left out to lower the price of the game.

The components and details for a good game are all present, but they don't connect in an interesting and exciting way which could impress, as the game design is too naive and the rules are too messy.

The most common positive comment about this game by reviewers and player is, that the town visit phase right [i]after[/i] the dungeon crawling is the best part -- and this is arguably true, but also a statement which clearly highlights this game's huge problem.
If players are more interested and are having more fun in the game's indeed very nicely detailed shopping phase (which has parallels to pen & paper roleplaying games) instead of actually exploring the mines and other worlds while fighting enemies, then something went wrong during the development of this game, especially because players are of course spending most of their time [i]outside[/i] of towns.

I was expecting this game would at least earn an 8/10 from me, but it's sadly just too messy and random -- and as a result: boring and frustrating.

The art is top notch and the theme is extremely strong. I love the Weird West flavor! 10 points for theme.

However, the gameplay is way to fiddly and the missions are not a challenge at all, just a long 90 minute session of rolling hundreds of dice. 2 points for gameplay.

RATING: 6
My rating has a somewhat low confidence, but I think this game shares similar problems that I had with Castle Ravenloft, in that there isn't enough differentiation between each scenario, so it just feels like you're just delving into some random, non-important map with a slew of monsters that feels the same ach time, instead of feeling like it's a story.

Combat-wise there is much less tactical movement as I'd like since it's often usually good to bunch up into a tight ball so only a few monsters can attack players at a time, so at least until you get a ton of abilities it's just basically a lot of mostly mindless dice rolling.

I don't like how wide a range of ill or positive effects you can have in this game. Yes it probably evens out in the long run cause there are so many dice rolls, but the difference in any game play of 1 of a certain monster or 3 can be large.

The customization options of characters is vast with the tech trees and possible mutations. However, since you get more XP from killing things I think this game probably runs into the issue where the strong become stronger and the weak become weaker.

Minis are not as detailed and feel flimsier as I'm used to, but that just because I'm spoiled with Descent, Mice and Mystics, and Castle Ravenloft, and perhaps the quality is pretty standard for kickstarter games.

This is just a silly, fun dice-rolling retro-dungeon hack.  Or it should be.  The one thing that's starting to really annoy me about the game is the amount of book-keeping. Every character has multiple abilities and so too does every monster type...and the two elite abilities of the monsters changes every time they are encountered anew. It bugs me still more that only the starting player abilities have cards and the abilities from levelling up have to be tracked with paper and pen along with items bought in town. I want cards for everything or no cards at all.

Best RPG board game experience when you include the excellent HexCrawl variant rules.  I also own the expansions: Frontier Town & Custodians of Targa.  I have more fun actually playing this than Descent Second Edition

On the other hand, the game has a very do-it-yourself quality to it, that is both a good and bad thing.  Like the D&D Adv board games, the game is pretty shallow out of the box.  It's up to you to add some story and more depth to the world.  For me, this isn't much a problem, but it does present a LOT of fiddliness.  I wish that the designers had added some sort of branching campaign story-line to follow up the great introductory comic-book introduction.

Shadows of Brimstone is the best dungeon-crawling board game I've ever played. I expected to kind of like it -- a 6, maybe a 7. I didn't expect to love it.

Yes, it has a million tiny rules and pieces and things to keep track of, but unlike some games it actually makes good use of all its bits and bobs. It's an immersive, near-RPG experience, with characters that grow, change, and take on a life of their own.

Combat, the core of the game, is solid and engaging. Every character I've seen has fun things to do, and there don't seem to be any duds. The variety of encounters is good, and the many little tweaks that the game applies keeps them fresh.

The town component is also excellent, particularly once you've got a bit of dungeon time under your belt. It all hangs together beautifully.

It's definitely a game that benefits from a knowledgeable guide. So far I've only played it with a "super-player," who streamlined how he taught us the game and used his experience to make ours smoother and devoid of the learning curve that otherwise would have been present.

It also seems like a game that really shines with its many expansions in place. We played with all of them (I think), and even though we didn't see everything -- the amount of content in the game is staggering -- we used bits from many of them at any given time.

Over the course of four games, with two levels gained by fiat since we weren't going to see each other again for a long time, my nun acquired several mutations: a scorpion tail, tentacle fingers, and Child of the Void, which caused her to grow a child's upper torso out of her stomach. I named it Kuato, of course, and my first question was, "Can it use a gun?!"

So we looked it up. And it could! We took up a collection, pooling our funds so I could afford the special Void Child Pistol on our next trip to town. And in the next dungeon, the player who would have struck the death blow on the final boss pulled his punch juuust enough to let me deal the final shot with Kuato's tiny pistol.

I love this game.

I usually don't like these type of monotonous dice rollers, but this one does it right. The theme grabs you from the start. The travelling and town visits add just enough to break up the dungeon crawling. My group has been having a blast with this one.

RATING: 9.25
Woah! I have played Flying Frog games before and they always seemed better than average, but with loads of dice rolling and thin game mechanisms. SoB has LOADS of dice rolling for everything, but for some reason it doesn't bother me in the slightest. The theme really comes out and attacks the player! Very rarely do themes in games feel so alive and gratifying, and that's from a person who doesn't care for westerns or Cthulhu.

While combat itself is rather simple, character development is done very well. Visiting the town in between adventures is done so well, I have never seen it done quite to this level in any other game! Descent 2.0 towns seem lame and crippled compared to the living, changing towns of SoB. Another excellent feature of SoB is the way exciting stories emerge while playing the game. This never feels forced, but rather "just happens" much like in Blood Bowl, my all-time favorite board game.

The price is steep for both the base games and expansions, but I believe I will happily dump my savings into this monster for a long time to come. I can not recommend this enough!

Was hesitant to play another Western-themed game, but decided to try anyway.  Really enjoyed it.  The encounter tokes flipped led to what is, apparently, a very short session at just the starting tile (mine entrance), T-junction tile, room with a load of monsters and a portal to another world, and finally a room filled with dynamite and gunpowder - as well as more monsters.  The only thing I found fiddly was the fact that virtually any decision made during the game, combat or not, required rolling dice to see if anything happened instead of or in addition to one's action.

This game accomplishes exactly what I want in a cooperative game. By using persistent characters with deep development potential and promoting role-playing, the game causes players to look out for the well-being of their characters as well as that of the group. This makes for a coop that feels like a group of people working together, rather than a hive-mind controlling a number of pawns.

The theme is very rich and both well thought out and developed in the mechanics. The artwork is gorgeous, and the miniatures are very decent (great sculpts/less great plastic). This is [i]finally[/i] the perfect cooperative dungeon crawler I have been looking for.

This lately has been my most played game. On one hand it's very addictive and immensely fun. The game does tend to breakdown over time mechanically. There are a lot of moving parts and lots of little things to track and remember that really can take you out of the experience.

I had initially rated it 9.5, but I am downgrading it after extensive playing. Our group loves it and it is fun.

Wow, this game is just NOT for me.  Lets roll dice endlessly and see if our die rolls net us what we need.

Went from must have to avoid entirely when I saw their frankly disgusting pledge structure.

UPDATE - Dec 2014.  And then totally back-tracked and went full retard on the Mine Cart pledge because the game looked too fricking awesome to miss out on.  Turns out it is very good, once you've spent the 8+ hours assembling all the minis...

Huge letdown.  Game has content for days, but is a game that lives and dies on dice luck.  Would have been a smash hit in 1990, but today gets left behind by more interesting systems.  It's a shame too as I loved the theme and the crazy worlds you could explore.

By far my favorite board game to date. Super in-depth gameplay within an immersive and rich Lovecraftian-western atmosphere. I own and have played many, many hours of City of Ancients, Swamps of Death, Caverns of Cinder, and the Frontier Town. I can't WAIT for the release of Trederra! Painting all of the minis has become one of my favorite hobbies and I have countless priceless memories with friends as we've gotten into role-playing with our characters. This is a great one-shot game, but is truly rewarding played as a persistent campaign. Can't recommend this game enough.

There's a LOT going on in this game (and more than a billion dice rolls per play). This one could easily be converted into a videogame but I like it on the board better (by now).

1- Rules check game, incomplete (say the bandido ran away). (Bandido & US Marshal)

2- Only 2 rooms and a long passage explored and a ambush attack (make it two) on a snake eyes roll for the Hold Back the Darkness got the US Marshal KOed (twice) and  the bandido ran away. (Bandido & US Marshal)

3- On the third try the gunslinger joined the posse just to get himself KOed on the last combat. Quick game, no bullets on the sixshooter were used, entrance and two rooms explored, basic game. (Bandido & US Marshal & Gunslinger). On the next one (the first on the adventures book) the saloon girl might join the posse.

4- First scenario of the basic game with 4 characters. I chose the quick play version (small storage) and the game was over in less than 3 hours -set up and putting everything back in the box and all-. The bandido leveled up!!

5- Going back to the "tutorial" scenario for a 4 players game. People enjoyed the game a lot.

OK. Pretty much what I expected it to be - D&D without the roleplaying or the creativity of a DM. Soooo much dice rolling and fiddling about. First session (played to completion) took almost 10 straight hours. The mixed theme does little for me.

Do not want.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The SoB 'system' is a fairly bland set of rules that relies heavily on dice rolls, random events.  Heavily thematic, but ultimately a pretty boring design that isn't going to scratch the puzzle-solving itch.

Combat doesn't involve very many tactical decisions - line of sight, facing and terrain don't really exist.  Combat is also largely a matter of rolling, rolling, rolling ... The monsters don't really have any interesting attacks, like area of effect, mind control, etc. Basically, they move as close as they can, then swat at you. Most of the scenarios included in the base sets are samey and dull.

Scenarios usually have a built in timer - but that timer may or may not advance, randomly.  That means scenarios can easily be too hard or too easy.  A pretty lazy design.

I guess the plus side is, that given how loose the system is, you can easily add house-rules and it wont disrupt what is ultimately a pretty unbalanced game system anyhow.  Want to make your own equipment?  Go for it.  Want to make your own monsters?  Go for it.  Want to trash the "hold back the darkness" rolls and use a deck of cards, go for it ... you get the idea.

The reason I like the game is that developing your characters over the course of several missions is fun and engaging.  You level them up, get new abilities and acquire new equipment.  There is a sense of adventure always wondering what you are going to come across next.

I also like the various miniatures/monsters - I like to paint them (and even have a couple on display) - and they look cool on the table.

The game is also a good platform for "role-playing", in the traditional sense where you take on a persona and act it out.  Lots of strange and wacky things can happen to your character, like growing a tail, so there is plenty of inspiring material to work with.

Expansions also come and help save the day a bit.  Expansion monsters like the Void Sorcerers add a spell deck and special abilities not seen before.  Some monsters also act in more interesting and tactically challenging ways.  The 'other worlds' like Cynder and Treddera add all kinds of other tactical considerations, like terrain and area of effect weapons.

RATING: 6
Captivating game. 

Initially, I thought this a 8 or 9. The play time was long, but I thought it would dramatically get shorter. It has not.

At first, when we played a 2P 3x (using 1 character each) without winning even one battle even, let alone the scenario. 

But when we played 2P with 2 characters each. It felt like a real game and we finally won the 1st scenario. So I think the game is really meant for exactly 4 characters to be played.

Update Dec 16 - Subsequent plays very long still. Like 4-5 hours for a scenario. I need to get this time down or get rid of this. if this was do-able in the 120 minutes that FFP advertises, I would love it. 

But at 5 hours(!) play time, I start to loathe the idea of playing this.

Perhaps the ultimate sandbox game in my collection.  I have always enjoyed the games FFP has put out in the past.  In fact, Last Night on Earth is one of my favorite games, period.  That said, their rulebooks have always been poorly written, and their game systems too simple and/or mired in older conventions like using a D6 to determine everything from movement to combat.  Brimstone fixes none of those issues, but I love it despite them.

The reason for this is because the theme is SO strong, and stories the game tells SO immersive, that any negative aspects can be overlooked with ease.  This is a co-op RPG board game.  Taking your characters from level 1, and scraping through a series of fairly randomized missions, gaining experience, gear, mutations, madness, and injuries, is just an incredible experience.  

The miniatures are awful (though they get better as expansions come out and FFP learns how to make decent ones), the rules are awful and will almost certainly require you to house rule the inevitable questions that arise, and the game systems revolve around rolling a billion D6's each turn.  And it doesn't matter.  None of that matters in the face of the excellent stories and endless replayability the game provides.

RATING: 8.5
Really fun dungeon crawler with a cowboys vs. Cthulhu theme.  As for drawbacks - the game is fiddly and needs a large table as well as you have to assemble the minatures.  Character advancement adds progression.  (I use the fan made Companion app to keep track of purchased items). 

From a gameplay standpoint, after playing a lot of the scenarios (in order, not randomly), I felt like I could kick some butt and take names but bad rolls could still doom me.  Besides the base game I purchased the Enemies of the Void pack, which adds a tough melee monster and a ranged monster.

I play solo with 2 characters and there's a lot of management of inventory.  The number of monsters on the board sometimes borders on silly with 12 spiders, 6 tentacles, etc.  

If you like thematic dungeon crawlers, this is a good one.  If you're looking for a gateway game, this probably isn't it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a fun dungeon crawl game with Cthulhu style monsters and a wild west setting. In general the game is all about making your die rolls. There are some luck mitigation tokens which helps a little, and as you level your character more options are available to you. The game is fully co-op, which I love, and the board is built randomly from a deck of tile cards which is an interesting if messy concept. Player turns are quick, and player abilities are different and interesting. I love how the dungeon populates through random card draws as you explore, so you really never know what lurks behind the next corner.

In terms of components this game leaves something to be desired. The minis are creepy looking, but don't hold up in comparison to similar games. This game also doesn't come with alternate gender hero minis even though you can pick the gender of your character. It also doesn't come with tokens for gold or experience, asking you to write that stuff down on a sheet. There aren't many monster types, and in a single scenario, you will likely see all of them. In terms of playing a campaign, players only get exp when they hit something, which means by the end of a level, different characters will level at different rates depending on how effective they are. The game also asks you to write down your new, leveled up abilities rather than give you cards representing those abilities. While the campaign scenarios themselves flow nicely, the book-keeping step at the end of going to town to spend your stuff is a bit over-complicated. It might not sound like it, but I actually like this game a lot.  Getting some expansions helps a lot in terms of getting the game the replayability it's clearly built for.

An odd shortcoming of the game appears to be player turn order. Players who go earlier in the turn have a big advantage in terms of getting more exp points and being able to kill monsters with fun moves. Since it's fully co-op this is perhaps forgivable, but it seems a pity to have players with slow characters watch the fast characters pull off incredible feats and then just do a movement action. The bookkeeping phase when getting back to town is where I wound up losing my enthusiasm for the game. The town has lots of steps and places to go with things to do, which is cute, but it takes a long time, and works out being less fun than a map that would take maybe part of that time. It's also a bad feeling way to start or wind down the night of crawling.

A superb, if surprisingly long-overdue retheming of Warhammer Quest.  The main mechanics of this game are a little old fashioned (roll to move, roll to hit, etc.) but fans of the GW classic will see the similarities.  Like WQ, it can be fiddly and table hogging, but the core of the game is still really fun.  
Fair warning: the game can be brutal if you play on hardcore mode.  People will die.  That can be a drag to see your character die, but that's part of the fun.  
Overall, it's a great game.  It shows its age despite being brand new, but still really, really fun.

For those who have played Warhammer Quest, this is a re-skinned version with a hundred little improvements.  If you haven't, once you have the mechanics down smooth, this game is a wagonload of fun.  Campaigns are great, because players can come in and out and the monsters level-set.  The different growth paths and the Other Worlds give this game immense replayability. 

However, if you don't want to assemble models, you might have an issue with this out of the box.

Probably my favorite dungeon crawler. Love the old west/horror theme. Would give it a 9.5 if the miniatures at the very least came assembled. I actually delayed getting this game for that very reason, and as I am a gamer who typically will buy all expansions for a game I love, I'm a little hesitant to spend tons of money on the expansions because of all the work required with assembly just to play. But if you can get over that, the game itself is great. I took another .5 off for semi-clunky instructions. Nothing terrible, but just a little clunky in parts.

[b]RO[/b]: [i]12/17/2015[/i]

Staggering in it's scope and interesting in it's concept (wild west mixed with H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos). But pretty 'meh' in it's execution. To sum it up, I guess I'd say Shadows is "messy". There is a lot going on, town exploration is actually my favorite part of the game and has actually resulted in the death of one of my characters, and the disfigurement of another (permanent injuries are both intriguing and annoying). The dungeons are [i]very[/i] samey and combat goes from ball-bustingly difficult, to (from what I understand) pathetically easy with character growth. To me, this feels like one of those board games that would have been better as a video game (but still presented as a board game). I don't regret buying it, but I doubt it will get played any more than it has considering the lackluster reception it got from my group. 

Also of note, if you don't like the idea of de-spruing and gluing together the miniatures, [i]do not[/i] get this.

One of the two core sets. Great game. If you are teaching the game to non-dungeon crawl experts this game can become tedious with you directing play at all times.

Like the other SoB base set, this one is a theme-heavy cooperative fiddly dice fests with huge setup time and high production value.  Normally, I have no tolerance for such games, but this one clicked (so my rating is quite high, given my disposition).

As with the other SoB base set, the 3-4 player game functions well, but the 1-2 player game is poorly balanced.  They just didn't think very hard about how to scale difficulty properly.  I think the optimal number or players is probably 3, but I'm not sure.

RATING: 6
08-12-2014. Rated after 1 play. Dungeon crawler in which you are a cowboy fighing cthulhu-like weirdness in caves. Basically the game is a cooperative dungeon crawler. 

It's not bad, many people like it a lot. I have several issues with the game so far that annoy me a little bit, call me petty but unfortunately that's what I am.

I do not fully enjoy the setting. I think the spawning rules, in which the baddies start in a chess-like grid formation and the d6 for movement annoying. Also, beware of guns. Choose something with high chance of hitting because it'll be annoying if you don't.

So, while I do like the game to play it more, several small things change it from a great game to an 'ok' game for me. One I'll play, but certainly do not have to own.

Also, the miniatures are kind of subpar I think. They have to be assembled but are not that much better than those of say, Descent.

Miniatures are horrible. Boardgamers will hate the assembly and gluing -- remember to dry-fit and trim excess plastic before gluing. Hobbyists will hate the ill-fitting parts, lack of detail, and time that could be better spent with other miniatures. Miniatures have a harder plastic than the soft boardgame plastics of FFG and CMON, so are easier to remove the mold lines from, but that's the only thing positive I can say about them.

RATING: 10
Shadows of Brimstone is - by far - the best board game that I have ever had the pleasure of owning and playing. Literally, my only gripe is the relatively slow speed with which new content is publicly made available for purchase on FFP's store. While it's fully comprehensible why KS backers receive the most immediate compensation for their early backing, I just sincerely wish that the content that was released to those folks did not require several additional months before being made available to the general public. 

I own all of the content that has thus far been made available and constantly find myself itching for more. It's just a bummer that I have to consider whether to throw down $140 on three unreleased hero minis being sold on eBay or whether to wait another 6 - 12 months before they are made readily available for $15 a pop.

Anyway, the game plays splendidly in small and large groups and practically never gets dull. The new expansions consistently feel as though they broaden the general horizons of the gameplay, both from a mechanical and narrative perspective. I would highly suggest picking up Frontier Towns expansion, as it significantly improves upon the town-visiting mechanic in between adventures. 

Also, be ready to shell out for a massive table - you'll need all of the space and card-shuffling-friends you can afford.

Great sandbox game with lots of dice chucking. Requires a lot of time and table space though, so it doesn't get out often. Theme is a bit different from my usual preferences not not too objectionable, though it might be a while if ever that my kids might want to play.

Also requires some creativity to track each character in a reasonable way without taking up half the table - had to come up with something on my own. Nothing was provided in the game.

Overall, it's a good, light game without much strategic depth unless you adopt some house rules.

Guess it's simplicity (mainly players turn and the lack of any 'complex' gaming options) make it rather fast and streamlined multiplayer experience.. Great fun in 6p, also it creates nice RPGish micro tales.. And the campaign mode seems promising..cannot wait for it!
However, some serious "all of those dzilions dice rolls procedures aid chart or what" would be of much help, not only for beginners ehm.. :P

E> It'a a blasting fun!!  Constant  crazy luck and narrative effects makes it a nice coop adventure. 
Most of minis are okay, some are not, but it matters not. pimping a character and exping up is very okay (expected a greater variety in level-up abilities as they repeat among the chars spectrum, yet have checked at a glance only, wont be studying it I guess)

Problems we see with the game itself:
1. initiative cycle stays the same, in 6 the last players gather much less XPs than those at the first positions.. (patch(?): cards with ini# rotate from starting players positions, at the beb. of a turn each passes current IniCard to the player on the left e.g. with no reset..)
2. hard to outguess the difficulty.. so far quite easy even if tension was great
3. rules could have been written better ehm, tough job for game keeper (the one that executes, manages or is supervising all of those tiny procedures)
4. not sure we did get the money engine right. Prices in a town are insanely high and we see no way to get any better gun as all is spent for a hotel, healing, token-items.. so where to gather that much ehm?

(in 6p we've started the campaign in the mines, 3 missions 2 town visits so far, and shall continue at the next con, cannot wait to, addictive stuff for all, we spent 14 hrs in a row in that game, even the third one ended like "okay, let's roll another one, shall we?" ..that says something if said by bunch of picky geeks :P)

The loot and scavenge cards can yield some useful and interesting stuff.  Game includes a an OK campaign mode, which levels up characters and allows for play in 'Town' in between adventures.  Components are average - thick cardboard modular boards, thick tokens, plastic playing pieces, cardstock character sheets, somewhat durable cards.  Core game is missing tokens which would greatly improve functionality.  The plastic playing pieces require careful assembly.  Artwork on cards and character sheets is average.  Artwork on modular boards is fairly dark which makes the boards tough to read.  The rule book is not well organized and is unclear on some aspects of the game.  Game play is long at about 3.5 hours and can drag.

RATING: 6
Great atmosphere, got sucked in by it in the first couple of playthroughs, but unfortunately the game starts to feel too samey after some time. There is just too few options what to do in the dungeon - you enter a room, get swarmed by monsters, kill them and move on. Sometimes you get to roll an ability but there's no choice in that, the game just tell you to roll something and you do that.
There is also no "role" playing really - there are some gear restrictions for different characters but other than that they do the same - they fight (doesn't even really matter whether it's melee or ranged as the monsters swarm you quickly anyway) and when they level up they get better at fighting.

I've wanted this since they first announced it. Got in at MC5. Hearing a lot of negativity and sour grapes from people over price, but $400-$500 for $700+ worth of stuff strikes me as a good deal. I own and play most of their other games, so I trust FFP to deliver a good product.

Neat looking game. Fun to play, but balance is awful and it needs a ton of home-made components to be playable.

The balance is truly awful; its quite easy to wind up with a party for one or two characters never even get turns in fights.

Not at all happy with how FFP is handling their KS and treating their backers.

It was just too much "meh".  It felt like I was playing a much less fun of dungeons and dragons.  I kept on feeling that I wish we were just playing that instead of this.  

I cannot quite understand why it was boring, but it just didn't click with me.  Possibly because it felt very similar to D&D, but then the character selection and customization was extremely limited compared to what you can do in an RPG.  I understand that they were trying to make a board game and selection must be limited, but I kept thinking "Well, why am I playing this then?"

Great Dungeon Crawling, everything is good just some minor problem like minis/bottleneck/monster variation. It could be too repetitive in combats...

The best part is the town visiting event, and character progression.

Some trouble in balancing, like gunslinger initiative too OP and rulebook kinda a bit too much, some asset doesnt have their own cards can make things quite difficult to track down, im lowering my score for this game, but still a good dungeon crawling with char progression.

Becoming more and more convinced that despite the fact that it fixes some of the issues in Warhammer Quest, it's still an inferior game.

In particular, the manuals are some of the worst I've seen in a game.

I like this game a lot. Again only played it a little thus far, but I can see the potential. The RPG like feel as well as the dungeon creation is a lot of fun. There are variable players powers, it's co-operative, and there is combat, it's something that I enjoy a lot. I also really like the theme of the weird west. I wish that the miniatures came already together, but they aren't bad to put together, just make sure you have the right glue.

My feelings about SoB have evolved as the game has. Now with Frontier towns, Caverns of Cynder and a few extra baddies, many of my earlier issues have been addressed.

Supremely ridiculous, over-the-top Weird West 'dungeon' crawler. Throw lots of dice, probably get murdered, have a blast trying to destroy the evil. Almost zero strategy, tons of luck, and a mine cart laden with fun.

RATING: N/A
Mine Cart level. Boxes tossed and minis assembled (although I can't keep the axe heads on the undead miners.) Red minis still on sprues.

Combined in one tackle box. Wave 1.5 shipping purchased.

Includes gold and xp cards...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
+ Cool theme
+ Fairly simple to play.
+ Can be played solo.

- The minis are a bit poor looking and way more painful to assemble than they needed to be. 
- The rule book has a really bad layout. While things are generally well explained. I found myself constantly flipping pages, in an attempt to find what I was looking for.
- You need to keep track of gold and XP on a piece of paper like an old school RPG.
- You have to create your own campaign stories.
- With just one core-set there's not a lot of variety here.

!This game should be played like it's an adventure. You win or loose by the roll of the dice. There is no sure strategy for winning.

Great co-op dungeon...err... mine-crawling adventure game with solid solo-playability.  Miniatures are not quite up to par with GW, PP or other 'mainstream', but are just fine for what they are and paint up quickly.  Balance seems to break down with higher-level characters, but the KS-driven expansion list is very deep.  Lots of good fan-made content available here on the BGG forums as well.

Fun, thematic, immersive, vast, what's not to like ?

Careful, the game can be long and fights aren't the most tactical thing you've ever seen. It's a game of story, ambiance, character leveling. It's THE dungeon crawler you were waiting for, if that's your sort of thing.

Cowboys encounter a variety of Cthulhu-like winged, tentacled and spidery aliens in the Old West. A scenario/campaign based RPBG on shaped tiles set in a mine, swamp, and ancient city. Scavenge, loot, and get gear cards.  Tons of tokens for dynamite, whiskey, and bandages. Lots of minis assembly required which I lack the patience (that's why I buy prepainted for D&D). The dread counter formula is a clever mechanic based on the heroes current progress level. Dice combat can be a little drawn out. Card driven threats and tile exploring and dice driven event charts for encounters in town. They should have left them daggum Dark Stones be.

Ah shadows....what to say, well anyone who knows me well.. knows Im a mechanics first kind of gamer. Never been much of a role player (A little too loose for me.) I have role players in my group though, and this game worked for them.
On the theme and story basis...I agree, but....Rolling dice a billion times and looking on charts to see what happens, to me is like roll and move, pass me the chuck bucket. I will play the game but I will NEVER admin it or run it, mechanically it is everything that I despise, but it keeps this rating for its theme and story, so this number is my fair shake. Its not a game I should like guilty pleasure I guess.

RATING: 8
Great theming combined with lots of laughs elevates this cooperative dungeon crawl. The combat itself devolves to lots of dice rolling. You roll to hit and damage. You roll saves. You roll each result with either D6's or a D8 if you have a specific weapon. That is pretty much what combat boils down to in this game. That being said, the game is almost always a blast, if a little too random even for my tastes. The objectives for the scenarios typically involve revealing tokens that may or may not be placed each time you explore and reveal a new tile. Games could be as short as 45 minutes or almost 2 1/2 hours if you are unlucky.

I had much higher hopes, but then I am usually disappointed with Flying Frog games. 
Assembling the miniatures is a royal pain - I would have been happy with FFG quality minis without all the cutting and gluing.  
The game is a mediocre dungeon crawl and pales in comparison to several FFG games.  The narrative was minimal and the rooms are generic.  Mostly just seemed to be fighting random monsters until found enough clues.  Very limited tactical decisions as compared to first edition Descent.  Lots of dice rolling since you get a save roll for every hit.  
It would have been much nicer if they gave you something to track XP, gold, upgrades, stuff you bought in town, and permanent adjustments to stats - FFG routinely finds an easy way to do all of this.
AI is moronic - mostly ends up bunching monsters so you can throw dynamite.
I like the permanent injuries and madness, town encounters, etc.  It's ironic, while there are lots of rules, I found the game surprisingly shallow.

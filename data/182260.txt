I enjoyed this little deckbuilder more than I thought I would. I think what bugs me about the luck inherent in deck-builders is the competition between players. But when the challenge is against the game itself, I don't seem to mind the luck as much. Plus, Agent Decker has a fairly slim deck of cards, so you know basically what you're getting, and then your challenge is how to manage the row in the middle to avoid making noise. 

I had a copy of this one, gave it away, and I'm crafting another copy with the new artwork since the game wouldn't let me forget it!

This is one of my favourite print-and-play solitaire games. It's a 54-card deckbuilder in which you play a secret agent straight out of spy school attempting to complete your first assignment. You've got to complete five missions of increasing difficulty and as you progress you improve your skills and tools. I really like the clean graphic design and the way the theme is integrated into gameplay. Definitely worth printing out!

One of my first PnP game (excluding expansions). Got me to see the potential PnP games can have. Hard to believe 54 cards game can be quite rich

For the game itself, it is hard and quite punishing for beginners. I like to play with variants to make the game easier.

RATING: 5.25
The idea is really great, even though the game shows some similarities with Friday (another solitaire deck building).

The theme is wonderfully rendered by the game mechanics which also has some great features (no dead card in the starting deck, chronological missions)

But, because of the mission cards, there is only one way to play the game and it makes it almost impossible to lose, apart from being very unlucky.
So, you play it twice and then you start winning.

note to self: Solitaire deck building game.
After a video review: Innovation in applying the theme to the mechanics, but will have to play or look more deeply into the game as it looks very simplistic.

God the rule book is awful. It formats sections together to make you think two separate procedures are interrelated, it tells you information in an illogical order, and it is not immediately clear that you win the game when you complete a mission. If I didn't already know how deck builders work I would not know how to play this. Furthermore, the either attack and stealth (or whatever the currencies are called) symbols overlapping makes it easy to miss one or the other. 

As for the actual game play, while in the first mission or two there are some interesting decisions of getting cards to fulfill this mission vs. having to consider what you want more in later missions (and even then, there are turns where you can literally do nothing), but after that the game becomes a slog. If you can get past the first 2 missions chances are the last three are pretty manageable, and so you just damage control the conveyor belt line while doing the obvious thing that helps you towards your goal. There was one game where I literally spent over 10 turns just KOing the next card in the line, as the card I needed to interact with to win was at the bottom of the deck, and at that point adding new cards to my deck would dilute it. Definitely an extreme case, but I had milder versions of that happen in the same and other missions too.

RATING: 7
Very clever mechanics, and kudos to the designer for fitting a five-mission campaign into 54 cards. The missions themselves add new cards to the deck while also often adding an additional rule. I do wonder about the mission objectives - don't really like Missions 3 & 5 in that respect, seem much too easy, especially once we know what the missions are.

Ultimately, the problem here is the same as in most other print and play games I played: replayability, or rather lack of proper challenge and / or incentive to come back. I would love to see some more difficulty levels or something like that.

RATING: 7
Very promising (and free!) PnP game. So far, it seems the first mission can be almost decided by the luck of the draw. Once you´re past the first mission and know what you´re doing, I find the following missions to be easier. Two wins so far, and seven losses, almost all of them in the first mission. My main complaint is the rulebook: It´s way too brief and doesn´t explain many of the situations that come up in a game like this, with many unique cards with various effects and interactions. Other than that, I enjoy the game and will keep it in my collection of free PnP solo games.

I have the full color print and play.  It took a while to fully understand the rules especially because the only ones on the designers site are in Spanish.  I was able to translate them into English and add them to my game.  I think that this game would have some great potential as a co-op game.

Awesome little solo deckbuilder with legacy* elements.

I'll definitely be backing the forthcoming kickstarter edition.

With a few more missions to increase replayability, this could easily bump up to a 9.

*may not fit all definitions of legacy, but fits mine.

I'm a few games in and right now am very excited. Not so much by the game itself, but the game system. I'm already thinking of new cards and missions to create, but I have to restrain myself until I play through what's already been created. For all I know, some of my ideas are in the later cards. It does feel like I will eventually "solve" the game but I've certainly already had enough fun to justify getting it.

Just printed this one off after looking at a review of another PnP that recommended this one. I am liking the PnPs that I have done before so I will try this one as well. So this one, after a few plays is not bad. A nice little mini-deck builder. There is some challenge here as the design is well thought out. The theme is good too.
Just did the reprinted cards. Very nice graphics on these.

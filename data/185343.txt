Very pretty in its deluxe format - vast amounts of colorful and attractive bits covered most of our large dining table.

Overall we enjoyed playing the game but felt it was unnecessarily complicated and had some balance issues - e.g. one evacuation reward was easier to achieve than others but granted way more VP than those that were harder to achieve.

For our 3 player game it took 2 hours to set up and go through the rules.  The game itself took 4 hours.  When you put this much effort into a game that requires a lot of forward planning and careful strategizing it's rather disappointing that your work can be ruined by unlucky dice rolls.  We felt dice didn't really belong in this game.

I think the theme in this game is very well executed.  You can feel the immersion when playing.  I really like the time travel mechanic.  Allowing for resources/personnel to be transported back with future consequences.  Get something now, but have to pay for it plus some additional costs later.

Ultimately though, I think the complexity of the game is not warranted based on the depth of play.  You are locked into a specific path at the start of the game based on the civilization that you choose.  The buildings in particular feel very lucky in that you may grab a decent building only to have a fantastic one pop up.  There's also no offsetting of building cost depending on which buildings are up, so you're paying the same for a crappy building vs an excellent one.  This would be acceptable if not for the length of the game (3-4 hours).  60-120 minutes is a complete lie. 

Not going to pick this one up, but will play again if asked.

Cool game, great mechanics and interesting theme, but a little too much going on for me.  The coolest part is sending stuff to yourself in time - I wanted more of this and less of the other trappings.  And the adventuring mechanism (from an expansion module?) seemed contrived and unnecessary.  One player spent the entire game doing this and little else and won by a decent margin.

Rating based on 1 game only with 4 players.

A fine game. Interesting topic. Nice mechanism for "time travel" - however I ended using it for points only so maybe it is not that useful after all. However, it seemed absurdly large and complicated in setup for what it offers - a worker placement game.

1 play / 3 players

LIKE: Some neat worker placement ideas, coupled with a large variety of building tiles, which leads to some fun engine-building. The time anomaly track could have been very interesting, if it had a greater importance to the central game.

DISLIKE: Iconography hell. Also, this is one of the most over-produced games I've ever played. Did it help? Not really. Also the randomness with the die was a little disappointing. I felt the five end-game scoring cards were pointless and boring-- why even play with them? There is enough game without them.

OVERALL: A game with production values similar to Scythe: too much art, not enough purpose. Simplify some of the graphics and I think the game could be better, less distracting. Yes, it's neat to place a worker in a mech, but after a few rounds I didn't think about it anymore. I would play this again, but not sure about longevity.

Similar to Manhattan Project: Energy Empire, using workers for board spots or personal buildings.

Excellent worker placement game with a fun theme of time travel. Large variety of buildings, super projects, and player boards (doubled sided for both player boards and double leader abilities) makes for a vast replayability space. Like many KS games, this one is overproduced with gorgeous miniatures and several expansions packed into a gigantic box - it is overwhelming at first. Still, very well designed with several lines of strategy well integrated into the theme. Very fun!

Need not to commend too much, this game is just simply awesome. I've been Mindclash fans and this is the second game that I got from Boarders (failed to pledge at first). Time travel theme is always my favourite (despite game or movie). The unique mechanism is to borrow things from the future and you will have to return asap in order not to break the time travel rules, otherwise you will receive anomalies!

It was a little long for my tastes, but it seemed like a solid design.  With a 1.5 hour explanation and some questionable pictograms, this is slightly out of my league.  Great miniatures, but almost a little overwrought.  I could never fit this one in my collection.

Abstract:
A complex worker placement game with beautiful futuristic/apocalyptic theme and nicely integrated time travel. 

Pros:
+ Theme and artwork (also great minis with expansion!)
+ Different types of worker
+ Management of tired workers is fun
+ The rule book, reference, and iconography is very good
+ Building super projects is hard but fun
+ Each player build buildings on his own board which act as worker placement spots (engine building)
+ Public and private worker placement: players can place workers either in the city (with an exosuit) or on their own board
+ Great solo integration (automata)
+ Astroid impact changes the end-game (into a race game)
+ Thematic time travel mechanic (aka loan)
+ Many possibilities to score points
+ Plays well with all player counts

Neutrals:
# Lots of planning is required at each start of a round: calculating resources requirments, calculating requirements for time travel, powering-up mech suits
# Not much interaction between players (block spots in city, take building tiles)
# Usefulness of the red buildings strongly depends on what the particular player needs
# More strategical than tactical gameplay 
~> strategical: acquiring goods from the future, powering up a certain number of exosuits
~> tactical: players have to change their plans if a spot has been blocked in the city
# Players have to do at least some time travel because it scores too many points

Cons:
- Buildings are super abstract (no pictures, no names, just ids)
- The expansion adds even more mechanics which change the flavor of the game but do not make it better
- The decision what goods to retrieve via time-travel must be made at the start of a round and cannot be changed during a round: requires more planning ahead (personally, I wish you could get goods from the future just on the fly)
- Required time to teach, set-up, and play (overwhelming on first play)
- A lot of components, mechanics, and modules: feels a bit overloaded
- Big game box occupies a lot of room on the shelf
- The unique player boards (B-sides) feel as if you must play in a certain way 
- The B-side of the red player board feels pretty weak (because red buildings are not always useful)
- Colors of the worker tiles are very pale (stands out because everything else looks great)
- No compensation when powering up too many exosuits

Thoughts:
Anachrony is big and a very good worker placement game but it also requires time to teach, set-up, and play. Planning ahead is a very important element of the game and I enjoy it. Still, I wish the game would be a bit more flexible in regard to time travel and would support some decision-making on the fly. I would also love if Anachrony would come with multiple leaders being used with the A-Side player boards to create even stronger differentiation between the players. Moreover, I miss stories a little: everyone mostly plays on his own each game. I wish there would be more memorable highlights to share. Still, it is a satisfying game; you feel like having accomplished something at the end. The impact is also very cool and spices the game up in the end game.

RATING: 10
I love this game!  For me, what does it is the combination of mechanics (worker placement+), multiple non-obligatory paths to success, flexibility, multiple points of asymmetry in the factions, additional modules/modes to incorporate, and theme (TIME TRAVEL!).  The theme is intricately woven into, and reflected by, the vast majority of the game mechanics.  It's a mildly complicated enterprise, but one well worth learning and developing.

Mechanics:  I like the balance of public and private worker placement spots.  I also like how there's an intermediate consideration (powering mech suits) for the public spots.  Also, the differentiated workers and their different benefits and weaknesses really does push-pull on everything.  The loan system (borrowing from the future, repaying the loans using time travel) is very flavorful and helps sell the bigger picture.

Story:  In short, the story works.  This is one game where I read the initial flavor text to new players because not only does it demonstrate how the designers carefully wove the theme into various aspects of the game, but it really does set the stage.  So much of the game is truly reflective of the story elements that are described.  Even the names of the superprojects are evocative of their effects as well as the game world.  (One of my favorites is Outback Conditioning - training a worker to endure the hardships of the ravaged world in order to perform an action from the capital.)  Yes, you could boil this all down to strict mechanics, but doing so really does shortchange what is obviously a labor of love.

Component-wise this thing is amazing!  Excellent artwork, solid symbology, fantastic component quality.  In addition, the optional mech suit add-on/expansion is AMAZING!!!  THE MECH SUITS ARE FUNCTIONAL!!!  You put the worker chits INTO the mech suits they're using and it doesn't obscure critical information!  SO AWESOME!!!

Oh, and by the way, NO KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVES!  This is a sane publisher who understands their audience and is honestly trying to satisfy their customers.  (I will note that there is a 10-card pack of promo cards that are only for 1 module and are completely unnecessary.)

Another also, THE PRICE!  The price on this is ridiculously good for the quantity and quality of components.  Very reasonable!

This really is a fantastic package!  Give it a whirl because it really is that good.

RATING: 6
1st play: A little bit of a weird game, but beautiful on the table.  There is an amazingly cool time travel mechanic which I've never seen before but drives home the theme:  Essentially in an early round you can just get free resources, but then in later rounds you have to hop in a time machine and travel back to your earlier self and give resources away.  Borrowing resources from my future self is really a need idea.  The other parts of the game included mining, super products and customized buildings.  Standard WP euro with a good theme.

2nd play: Very improved with a second play.  Had a better understanding of what to do.  I think the science track is underpowered and underutilized, but it's possible with the expansion materials it's more interesting.  I like the theme and the actual time-travel is really cool.  I'm not sure if there's a ton of replayability with the pieces we used but there was a lot of un-used stuff in the box.

Beautifully themed sci-fi worker placement with resource management and a time-twisting loan system. We're still feeling our way, and a bit timid of too much borrowing from future-us.
I'm lucky enough to have the Exosuit pack which despite me thinking was just a cherry on the cake, actually, I suspect, make the clean-up each round a bit easier. 
Some of the player colours are a bit muddied, but overall it's very satisfying to play.

Instantly top three worker placement for me. Really like the variety of options and how easy it is to get going even though it's fairly complicated.  I wonder if the buildings would become too important on repeat plays, but as is, this might replace Manhattan Project entirely.

RATING: 7
A heavy worker placement euro with tons of components and iconography that is thematically strong.  Anachrony may very well be the most decorated "all the bells and whistles are here" worker placement game in euro game design history, and I think that is amusing and fun in and of itself.  Just look at this beast!  

What I found interesting and pleasing on my first play was that I could actually focus on those mechanics and thematic elements that I liked (getting resources, building cool buildings to further an engine, meeting asteroid goals, recruiting and waking up tons of workers, placing the best workers on the right spots at the right times, jumping in turn order, meeting common goals, and leveraging my special asymmetric ability) while almost wholly ignoring the game elements I was unsure of, or not interested in  (time travel, rolling dice (really?) for science breakthroughs, and overworking tired workers.)  

Curiously, I managed to win my first game with 54 points, without ever using the time travel mechanic.  Interesting.  Perhaps the time travel mechanic can be considered an "advanced strategy" for advanced Anachrony players, an alternative "cool path" to victory placed on top of a more straightforward core Anachrony worker placement game possessing multiple paths to victory.  

Because I wasn't stressing about the time travel mechanic (and steered clear of playing the asymmetric ability involving time travel), for me, Anachrony became a very quick to play, easy to understand, and dare I say, fairly easy to teach, straightforward worker placement game.  

Bottom line: Anachrony is a fun, highly thematic worker placement game with interesting buildings, asymmetric abilities, and time travel to explore on multiple plays.

Layers of unnecessary complication obscure what is probably the most tepid, uninspired worker placement game I've come across in a long while. Collecting resources to build things that get you points and resources. Some games do that in really interesting ways (Stephen Feld). Not here, I'm afraid. Despite the nice story that the rulebook spins, nothing about playing the game play really evokes a sense of atmosphere or story. It doesn't help that, aside from the impressive exosuit minis (KS edition only?), the art is often...not so good.

Anachrony features a unique two-tiered worker placement system, traveling to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources. Players need various Specialists (Engineers, Scientists, Administrators, and Geniuses) and also Exosuits to protect and enhance them — and both are in short supply.
The game is played in 4-7 turns, depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs (unless, of course, it is averted!). The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic Timeline. By powering up the Time Rifts, players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past "self" with resources. Each Path has a vastly different objective that rewards it with a massive amount of Victory Points when achieved. The Paths' settlements will survive the impact, but the Capital will not. Whichever Path manages to collect most points will be the new seat for the Capital, thus the most important force left on the planet...

What a game! The complexity might scare off a few people, but it is what makes the game so rewarding. The fact that you have to either make sure you either recruit the exactly right people or just have to face that you will make suboptimal moves is absolutely fantastic in my eyes. 

The main thing that drew me to this game was the big ball of wibbly wobbly, timey wimey stuff. You have time travel to help you! Imagine you can fire up your own freighter-version of the Tardis and deliver the exact ressources that you need for that particular round. The only catch is that you have to send the things you received early back in time as soon as you get to the future. That sentence made my head spin, again. All of the talk about time travel around the table was so incredibly fun that even for that reason alone it's worth brining to the table.

The reason I've only given it a 9 is the fact that I feel it might be just a bit too heavy and a bit too long for me to get it to the table regularly.

Suffered all the game long, rules are long to explain, got no thrill from the game. I was the only one who could counter an opponent from ending the game, and after 3h30 I was fed up, so I didn't and the end was a relief.

This game has an appeal that goes far beyond its somewhat humble worker placement/euro core mechanics.

Initial Impression: I have to admit that I had little idea of what to expect going into this game. The iconography and graphic design of the the gorgeous boards and tiles were overwhelming. Coupled with the chunky miniatures, and tons of components, this game can be intimidating when spread across the table. Once the mechanisms were explained, most of the graphic design work suddenly fell into place. In this worker placement game, you are trying to save your civilization from a disaster that you've been warned is coming. The twist in this game is that you can request resources which will appear from the future but you will eventually be required to pay back. With the introduction of exosuits, you're limited to the number of actions you can perform on the shared main board. Overall, I found the game to be one of the most thematic worker placement games I've played to date. There are lots of decisions to make and many ways to get VPs but surprisingly, the game didn't feel like a typical point salad or resource conversion game. Due to the time travel aspect, the game rewards the player who can plan a few turns in advance. My one niggle with the game is that I find it counter intuitive that you are rewarded for needing to "borrow from the future". At times I was placing warp tiles simply so I could jump back in time later and repay the resource. It wasn't a thematic dealbreaker but it did feel odd. Overall, a very enjoyable experience.

Original worker placement game, with many mechanics of resource management, and a cool theme. Done by the same people as Trickerion it's difficult not to compare them. For me Trickerion it's more original, this one has cool things about going back and forth on time, but maybe the strongest point it's production, and for me the "mechs" are a bit annoying. By the way the game works, it's very long but has cool strategics, but has little interaction between players, kind of multi-solitaire.

Oh my. This is really cool worker placement game. It looks extremely complicated and takes up a ton of table space (seems to be a Mindclash thing) but once you start playing the game it flows very nicely. The game design and iconography makes sense once you know what they are which helps a lot. There's many types of resources, four different kinds of workers, and worker spots on the main board as well as on your own board. All this presents a very interesting puzzle that's fun to solve. As with most worker placement games, the only interaction between players comes via taking spots and blocking and that's fine with me. The components and art are top notch. The "time travel" aspect of the game is interesting and for the most part fits in well with the rest of the game but also feels a bit...bloated? The whole idea of "research" also feels unthematic when it's just is rolling dice and hoping for what you want. These are relatively minor complaints as the game overall is really good. To add to replayability there is two different Leaders per faction that each give a special ability to choose from. There's alternate player-board sides that vary the points and abilities by faction even further. Then there's a bunch of modules you can add which I have yet to try.

I need to play more to develop a meaningful comment here, but after several initial plays I have this to say:

The time-travel aspect is fantastic and provides the player both with flexibility and difficult decisions regarding the risk/reward of getting items early. The variable player powers really add a lot to the game, and simultaneously can help give new players direction. I love how interconnected all the systems in the game are. Finally, I applaud this for being an incredibly thematic Euro.

Excellent worker placement euro with some impressive chrome.  The theme is strong for a euro.  While it seemed good but straight-forward at first, a few more plays is revealing multiple paths to victory and some interesting subtleties regarding warping resources (a sci-fi version of a loan).

The replayability is high with assymetrical playerboards (on the "B" side), faction specific evacuation conditions, and faction, as well as character, specific abilities.  Add in the two expansions and you have an impressive amount of content that should keep you entertained for a lot of plays.  

We played 3 times in one weekend.  This is definitely a good value for the money (and the minis are excellent).

Initial impressions: I have been a bit surprised how much I am enjoying this game. There is a LOT of chrome going on and players will probably be overwhelmed by the components, iconography, and art that is everywhere. However, if you get past this there is a very clever worker placement game with several unique twists. The time travel mechanic introduces fun decisions about taking "loans" or certain game items and how to pay them back. There are a large variety of unique buildings that are each interesting in their own right. The decisions on how many exosuits to power and when/how to activate workers are great. The differences in worker types and penalties for coming late to certain worker placement spots also adds complexity. Also, the two phases of gameplay give a unique feeling to the game.

The game definitely has a lot going on, but I find that it all comes together quite nicely. I like the meaty decisions and feel that the game isn't just complex for complexities sake. I have also really enjoyed the solo mode of this game. The Chronobot is run in a similar manner to the Race for the Galaxy AI in The Gathering Storm (i.e. semi-programmed but with randomness from die rolls). This makes it challenging for the player and adds variety. I'm very eager to get this game to the table more!

Best worker placement game I've played. Plays great with two and even better with four. The theme is there and you can feel it - and it's not common in games with complicated and coherent mechanics like this one.
The B sides of the player boards make a lot of difference so play them after the first or second 'intro' game on side A.
I cannot say anything bad after 3 plays I had. It might be a 10. I need to play more!

Fantastic presentation, with engaging layers that weave together in a way that pulls me into... a worker placement game. It's not a genre I typically love, but this is the worker placement title that unseated Agricola, Stone Age, Pillars of the Earth, and many other familiar names. The theme is compelling, I'm delighted with the AI system for solo play, and I haven't even accounted for the modules + many ways to vary the setups and gameplay.

I was stunned at first glance by the visual flood of information provided by each board, card, and tile, but I quickly groked the user interface conventions and realized just how smoothly it all aided the flow of the game. That's a noteworthy achievement in itself.

Dávid Turczi is now on my very short list of designers to watch, and I eagerly look forward to what might come next.

Uno de los mejores juegos que he jugado en este 2017. Colocacion de trabajadores con una vuelta de tuerca al haber 2 tipos de localizaciones (exteriores donde necesitas exoesqueletos o interiores que tienes que ir construyendo). Ademas los trabajadores tienen dos estados y hay que activarlos para que puedan trabajar.Pero la autentica chispa del juego es la linea temporal y el poder mandarte recursos desde el futuro. 
La estetica y el diseño al nivel del scythe. 
Un juego sobresaliente.

Excellent thematic euro with great worker placement and engine building mechanics. Big downside: strange post-midgame scripted ending.  An asteroid hits and all of a sudden 'bonus' tiles appear in the capital that, if used, shut down the game.  Super anti-climactic.  If they would have blocked spaces from asteroid damage, and even allowed you to pay a steep price to repair them for use, THAT would have been thematic.  OP Bonus tiles?!  Doesn't make any sense.  A couple hours of crafty interactive engine building undone by a weak design choice.  Too bad.

A solid worker placement with a unique theme, but ultimately I found the time travel / paradox mechanism to be more penalizing than it was worth and our group tended to entirely ignore it in our plays. Factor in a ridiculous setup time and we came to the conclusion that there are better euros that are easier to get to the table, so this one hit the sell pile. Too bad, because the minis were very cool... but I'd rather just play Trickerion.

Having played the digital version (available on tabletopia) I am super happy I pledged for this on kickstarter. Like any good worker placement game there are tons of options, each of them meaningful with a continual sense of scarcity. I often find worker placement games optimal strategies to "get more actions then your opponents" but in Anachrony you can find yourself with too many "actions" and not enough spaces to place them. The mech requirements to use most of the action spaces balances the want for lots of "actions" with the need for resources to pay for these actions better then any other worker placement game I've played. The capital actions and buildings make it so that no one space is always contested yet the actions of your opponents still mess with your strategy increasing the costs of doing contested actions. The super projects can drastically change the costs of things and the buildings are both expensive and valuable. The threat of the oncoming asteroid and the paradoxus from messing with the time stream make every turn feel important and every decision meaningful. The game may seem overwhelming at first but the clever indexing means that any rule is easy to find and generally represented by symbols and the flow of the game is intuitive. If you like Through the Ages, Lords of Waterdeep, Caverna or Agricola then this game is for you!

Kickstarter edition - Path of Harmony - Leader box

I had several Kickstarter games that I liked but that didn't last very long. With this I'm pretty confident that it will stand the test of time. I'm even sure that I will sell some "simpler" worker placement games because of Anachrony.

Until yesterday I liked Caverna or Fresko as worker placement games that are simple to teach but offer a lot of gameplay...then Anachrony came along and stomped them to the ground.
Anachrony is very easy to teach, has a relatively easy symbology and offers a much deeper gameplay experience than the others combined.

Easy to teach but a struggle to succeed:
Don't forget to do this, don't forget to collect that. But remember that you just have so many exosuits (they are the vehicles needed for your workers) and not so much time. Maybe you can get what you want if you buy a building? And don't forget that you have to deliver your goods to the future...

Additionally it has so much variety, more than several other games combined. And that is just in the base game.
The leaders pledge offers 4, I guess it is 4, new modules that expand the game. And a solo mode... And stuff...

I love it.

A interesting game that has some truly original ideas, but is marred by bloat and overproduction. The central "time travel" mechanic is absolutely brilliant: the notion that you can instantly "get" a worker or resource from the future, but are required to later send it back to your past self is so cool and thematic. Kudos to the designers for such an innovative idea.

Unfortunately, as simple and streamlined as the time travel track is, the rest of the game is overwrought and needlessly convoluted. Having to put workers in mechs, then send the mechs out, then mine according to the worker type, but also determine which spaces are available, etc. etc. ... it all feels like the game is just too long, the round structure too complex, and the board way too busy for what could have been a smooth 90-minute worker placement game. The mech minis, though awesome, only add to the cluttered and bloated board space. 

All of this is just with the "basic" game in mind. Forget the two in-game expansion boards! This game is an object lesson in the idea that sometimes, "less is more." My rating may actually go up with future plays as I become more comfortable with the fiddly rules, but I'm a little disappointed. This should have been great, but is just "good."

Too many moving parts for me. A blitzkrieg of resource efficiency and conversion. The end of the game is a mad rush. 

There is some tight worker placement on the board. There is true competition for valued spaces, and interesting choices out there. I wish there was more thematic stuff happening with the time travel. That part felt tacked on. Overall, meh.

Really enjoyed my first play of this game.  Throughout my rules explanation everyone just stared at me like there was way too much to know. as soon as everyone's second turn has hit, they've got it figured out as the worker placement it is and the games an immediate hit.  Really like the tableau building, and with all of the B sides and modules I feel like I could play this game plenty and never have the same game.

There's a good game in here someplace.  Too bad that with each increasingly byzantine lever there's a hole in the rules that requires interpretation by a biblical scholar.  The time-travel "loan" mechanism is nifty, the component quality is better than average.  I do believe there is a start player advantage that is poorly compensated (one or two water?  seriously?  try an energy core instead), and the distribution of buildings in conjunction with evacuation requirements can be swingy: the game is simply too tight in the end, despite the point salad, to ignore random variation.

Azt hiszem ez az a játék, aminek - a komplexitás miatt - kifejezetten árt, hogy a tervezők nyelvfüggetlenné tették. Komolyan, egyiptológusok előnyben. Sokkal jobban élveztük volna a játékot, könnyebb lett volna érezni a tematikát és legalább egy órával kevesebb lett volna a playthrough, ha nem kell állandóan megállni és megnézni a függelékben, hogy melyik hieroglifa pontosan mit jelent. Most összehasonlításként a Viticulture jut az eszembe, ami összességében hasonló komplexitású, de valahogy sokkal jobban megközelíthető és nálunk elsőre működött: többek között azért, mert ránézel egy kártyára és rá van írva, hogy az mire jó. Itt meg ránézel az elérhető, megvehető épületekre, és szabálykönyv nélkül fogalmad nincs melyik mire jó. És akkor 2 percig áll a játék és ez nem is az AP része a dolognak, mert az még utána jön. 

Nyilván megvan ennek a  tanulási görbéje és kellő számú játék után az ember már talán fejből tudja, hogy mi micsoda, de most nem tudom, hogy mennyi időnek kell eltelnie ahhoz, hogy a csoportunk újra elővegye ezt a dobozt egy ilyen első negatív élmény után. 

Egyébként a szabályrendszer viszonylag világos, de az volt az érzésem, hogy minden további nélkül le lehetett volna felezni a komponenstípusok számát (ezzel a hieroglifák száma is kezelhető méretűre csökkent volna) és akkor egy sokkal könnyebben játszhatóbb, megközelíthetőbb játékot kaptunk volna. Megintcsak Viticulture példa: Jamey is berakhatott volna még oda fa meg tégla meg tetőcserép meg gyapjú resource-ot és a különböző épületekhez líra helyett ezeket kellett volna gyűjtögetni, csak az úgy egy lényegesen pocsékabb játék lett volna...

Nyilván a tervezők célja nem ez volt - nem egy széles tömegeket bevonzani képes közönségjátékot terveztek, hanem egy viszonylag heavy eurót.

RATING: 7
"Postapocalyptic worker placement featuring exosuits and time travel" did sound like a pretty damn terrific concept, but in the end, despite having a good time with it, Anachrony didn't quite meet my expectations. Looking beyond the attractive theme and production values, the time travel mechanic is just a loan of resources that must be paid back in subsequent rounds to avoid point penalties; nothing really groundbreaking, so it left me somewhat disappointed. I'm looking forward to playing again with the additional modules now that I have a good understanding of its mechanisms, but all in all Anachrony is a little bit too fiddly, overproduced and convoluted for an otherwise fairly typical cubes > buildings > VPs conversor with not so many interesting actions and choices.

Full disclosure: as a huge fan of Trickerion, the tactical brilliance and thematic resonance of Anachrony's predecessor casts a long shadow in my mind. I'd almost certainly be less disappointed in Anachrony if Trickerion didn't exist, though I don't believe that makes my opinion significantly less valid.

Because Anachrony is just a worker placement game. Sure, there are some additions that make it feel unique. The exosuit mechanic limits how many of your workers can go to the main board but, in general, I don't find the decisions around powering up exosuits to be interesting enough to merit the overhead. The same goes for gating certain spaces or bonuses by worker type. In Trickerion, the complexity added by special assignment cards and the variable number of action points on each character makes for difficult and interesting decisions. Exosuits and worker types work similarly but without the interesting payoff. I feel the same way about time travel--sure, it's unique(ish) and, sure, it's not exactly a loan system, but are the things that make it unique and make it distinct from a loan system really worth the added weight? Certainly not. 

But I think my biggest disappointment is the way you accrue victory points throughout the game. In Trickerion, when you consider the theme, the things that should get you points do get you points. Almost all of your fame comes from performing tricks--after all, you are a magician. How you go about getting those points and performing those tricks is complicated but the win condition and the way you earn fame are not. In Anachrony, whose theme is just as strong as Trickerion's, you get points for... everything? For using a specific kind of powerplant? For building any building? For completing a super-project? For having high morale? For time traveling a lot? For breakthroughs that match? What does it even mean for something like a breakthrough to "match," anyway? For a game with a cohesive narrative to, in the end, resort to point salad to determine a win condition is thoroughly disappointing and makes the rounds of worker placement that preceded it feel exactly like worker placement--no more, no less. I don't feel like I'm leading a civilization to prominence in the wake of a cataclysm; I feel like I'm spending an energy core and a water to send an engineer in an exosuit to get a pair of resource cubes to help me build a building that will let me assign an administrator to produce another energy core and also a victory point. Yawn.

I just played this solo to learn the rules, but already I can see there is a lot of advanced planning involved. This game is not for those prone to analysis paralysis. You can make a misstep that will cost you dearly in VPs pretty early on. These are not necessarily downsides, however. The theme is rich and very cool. The rules are surprisingly easy to understand and remember after a few turns, probably because the graphic design and player boards are so nice.

The best non-combat game I have played and I have played a lot (Terra Mystica included).
My favorite games are (in case it helps someone understand my taste in games and how compatible it is with his own): 

Blood Rage
Scythe 
Forbidden Stars
Lord of the Rings LCG

Although it initially seems complicated it is has very intuitive mechanics and it is easy to teach to others. With the modules included and the ones of the expansion it is very easy to make it more complex/simple, given the tastes of each group.

My main problem with the game is that it requires a lot of space (a really large table) in order to play. Although it does not sound serious it could really make the game unplayable for many groups. 

Before rating it I would recommend playing it at least once using the asymmetric
versions of each faction (the feeling and the game play experience was much better fro me). 

My main concern initially was that since the game offers no conflict (military, sabotage ...) between the factions, it would be boring and each player would only focus on what he does, ignoring the others. But after playing it 5 times, I would definitely recommend  it even to players that prefer war board games compared to economic ones. 

Pros:
1) Very fast turns between players.
2) Your actions can truly limit the ones of the others, in that way the feeling of conflict exists, although real combat never takes place.
3) The idea of time traveling is really nice integrated in the game.
4) The symbols explaining each card/action/component are really very good at what they do. The best non text-based board game I have played actually, given its complexity. 
5) The mechanics are very nice.

Cons:
1) Requires a really large table
2) If you set it up alone, it requires some time. But if all players help (this usually requires not playing for the first time), it could be set up quite fast given its size (5-10 minutes).
3) With 2 players is not as good as with 3-4, (the capital board in 2 players remains the same as in 3, too many available options are left for both players)
4) After the impact it is very likely that the game will end in the following round (especially in 3 player games). I would like a way to be able to  influence the game to last longer as player. The only way to do so is by avoid taking a collapsing capital tile action, but they are very powerful and usually they are expended at the first round/era they are available.

Like Mindclash's other design [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163068/trickerion-legends-illusion]Trickerion[/url], Anachrony is a long, involved and thinky worker placement game. And like Trickerion, I did really enjoy my first play of it. At first, it looks overwhelming with all the different things you can do. But the rulebook does a good job teaching you the game and once you've played a round or two, everthing flows nicely. Not that it get's any easier at this point. But instead of the rules, you're struggling with all the options the game presents you. It seems like there are quite some avenues to pursue on your quest to generate the most points and it's never quite obvious which one you should choose. Just as Trickerion, Anachrony forces you to formulate a plan for your whole turn and it's a great feeling if it works out.

Despite from the very solid worker placement core, there are some ideas in the game that did really impress me. One thing is the "market" where you can buy building from an ever changing offering which is achieved by just using two stacks per building type. Together with super projects, this adds a huge variability. I did also like the timeline/loan-mechanic which feels not only quite thematic to me but can really help in game if you get stuck in a dead end or you need to boost your engine.
I hope, I get a few more chances to play Anachrony in the future!

RATING: 8
I love Anachrony: awesome mechanics, really puzzle-y, completely gorgeous. But I have to dock it a point in my personal scale for being a bit too complex and time-consuming to get to play regularly. It also loses a "fun" point because it's a brain-burner. But if I can find people willing to do the work, I will always want to spread it out and start it up. Also, I am spending an inordinate amount of time and money making custom boxes for my game. Eventually, it will be even prettier, have no plastic in the box (other than the minis), and be much easier to set up.

The game looks a bit intimidating on first glance, but once through the rules everything falls into place perfectly.

First impressions are very good.  This game seems to have variety from play-to-play, something I find key for my prolonged enjoyment of heavier worker placement games.  I also found the manual to be quite excellent (except for a couple FAQ issues).
I dont much care for the Doomsday module though, so I’m glad it’s optional.

From the makers of my favorite game, Mindclash Games, I had high expectations when I kickstarted this one.  Production quality is fantastic.  The miniatures are especially cool.  It is a very hard game to play the first time as there are so many moving parts in just the base game.  That said, subsequent plays reveal a solid worker placement game with unique strategic choices.  Having added the first two expansions now, the game really hums and the choices offer so many strategies.  I see this game residing in my collection for a good while.

Truly a most extraordinary game.  A stellar worker placement euro-game with some unique twists, multiple interacting mechanisms, mind-bogglingly meaningful strategic and tactical choices with potentially far-reaching ripple effects, beautiful components, included expansion modules and variants, dazzling replay-ability (4 "paths," each with 8 possible variations in terms of starting abilities and goals/conditions), and a well developed theme/narrative which shines through brightly.

And then, at least for me, the "icing on the cake": the included "Chronobot" -- an included AI opponent to play against solitaire, which strikes me as a "cousin" of the Race for the Galaxy: Gathering Storm bot.  Wow.  Still haven't beaten it, but I'm learning -- and really enjoying trying out the different "paths" and their different versions.

Looks like this game will not be leaving my table for the foreseeable future.

I was very excited to receive this game and I was not disappointed. I love the theme and the story. I like the mechanics and the nature of the beast. Beware it is a very thinky game with lots of moving parts, but when you come to grips with them it is a very satisfying feeling. I think with repeat plays (bearing in mind I have not used any of the modular expansions yet) I think this rating could rise, and it may become my favourite euro game.

I think of Mindclash in the same league as Lacerda, making beautiful games that look complex and intimidating from the outside, but play very logically from the inside. 

After owning, playing, and loving Trickerion, I really badly wanted this game, too. The size of the box deterred me. But after one play, I’m mentally trying to work out what I would have to sell in my apartment to make room for it.

Love the “borrow from yourself in the future” mechanism, though I overplayed that and was unable to pay it back later, running out of time. Very interested to play again.

I love, love, love:
- the asymmetric player powers
- the Awake vs Tired worker system
- the time travel mechanism
- the story and theme
- the Manhattan Project-style worker types
- the worker vs exosuit placement spots
- the hex pools vs hex slots for exosuits
- the exosuit designs, size, function, and "paintability"
- the Chronobot solo module
- the fantastic art, especially on the modules' cards
- the well-written rulebook
- the cubes with cracks inside--they look cool, and none have broken so far

I dislike:
- not having played all of the other modules, yet

Final verdict: It's the perfect mix of worker placement, planning ahead, multi-level worker types and placement types, asymmetric player powers, a well-themed time travel mechanism that makes you gamble with risk vs benefit, and a strong sci-fi theme and story. This game is never leaving my collection.

Loved the theme and thought the variable abilities and the method by which the time travel/take a debt system worked was quite fun, but ultimately this felt like a really rules heavy version of standard worker placement. It isn't a bad game at all, but for how much there is to teach and explain, coupled with the length compared to simpler games with as much depth I couldn't justify keeping this one. Not to mention this game should not be played with 3. Anachrony. Could have done as much with less.

2017-05-03: Like the theme, like the game, but just a bit to heavy for me.
The rules aren't that complicated but since everything is very tight, even a slightly misunderstood limit in the game can really make you sad. (i.e. in my case, not know that you can take as many frikkin anomalies as you want if it ever goes up to three. They do NOT wrap around. . Also. . if you hit three you get hurt, NOT if you get OVER three. The iconography is a bit poor).
The heaviness comes from the gazillion interacting currencies in the game. It is just really hard to see the best move. You almost always end up seeing 'if I just had converted that to this, and used an engineer there instead of a scientist, I wouldn't have had to use that 1 water and could instead bought that exosuit with water instead of the bioreactor which I spent 2 titanium to get via using a scientist to convert 5 water to uranium and then using my genius to use the time machine to go back in time and build the superproject which produced 3 titanium.
Kind of.

Initial rating = 6 (for heaviness alone almost. Otherwise it would probably be at least a 7, maybe 8)

[b]A heavy, derivative kitchen-sink euro with a great theme. Good 1p implementation. The focus on worker placement isn't interesting enough to keep my interest beyond a half-dozen plays. GREAT value.[b]

[b]4 plays:[/b] SOLD. Not a bad solo system, but the game felt the same after four plays. The buildings don't have enough variability (i.e. all blue buildings produce water, and are just minor variations on each other), and so the focus is on a hybrid public-private worker placement. Heavy enough to enjoy the puzzle for a few plays, but not enough to bring me back.


[b]2 plays:[/b]The theme is quite well-developed and does a decent job over the first few plays of masking the fact that this is really quite a mechanically-derivative game. Multiple resources, buildings you build so you can do resource generation and resource conversion, etc. I can't see myself wanting 10 plays of this, but the first few have been enjoyable, mostly because gameplay is so dense that it takes some puzzling out to figure out how to play decently. But on my third play, the game was already starting to feel samey, in part because so much of the game is familiar.

As the rules were being taught, I thought this to be a complex game with a lot to remember.  A few turns and everything was easy and I had more choices than I could do.  It is important to keep an eye on opponents and block them.  I like worker placement, and this is certainly that, using the coolest  figures.

Ok, but no real hook for me. The competition between worker placement games is tough. This game tries to stand out with time travel. What it really is, is borrowing resources and then having to travel to pay back to the turn you took the resource. 

It has a kickstarter feel. Not well tested. Some unclear rules. Inconsistencies and unneccesary complicated with exceptions. 

Many ways to get points. No that really feel satisfying. Most resources you just place a worker to take. It does not get better as the game progress. Making me feel little progress of accomplishment when I just take what is up for grabs instead of making something with my engine. 

5 years ago I would have liked this game alot, but now it cannot compete with Scythe, Viticulture, Feast for Odin, Concordia, Great Western Trail and many other superb games.

First impression is a slightly long engine builder. Feel like I'd prefer Energy Empire to this. Need to play with more modules, but this has similar feel to Trickerion without the depth of gameplay that the magicians powers add.

Some really good ideas here.  The game seems to have a few more things going on than seem optimal.  They are all thematic but I can't help feeling that culling a few things and focusing more on making what worked better might have been a better idea.

What worked good:
1)Different worker types with bonuses worked well(I like it in Railroad Revolution too). 
2)Exosuits(mainboard actions) requiring pre-round commitment and cost was a quality decision.
3)Asymmetric starting resources and evacuation requirements made the experience feel personal.
4)Tired and active workers was also a nice resource management touch.

Neutral:
1)Breakthoughs: The risk/reward and choosing what dice to roll worked well.  Success/failure ratio's for exact matches should be more of a coin flip for maximum excitement.  So while this is probably bloat that should be culled, I think if fixed it could have been a fun required resource for some of the more powerful buildings to help balance them out.

What didn't work:
1)Warp Phase/Paradoxes/Anomalies:  Yes I know that is the heart of the theme but these were not fun to complete or suffer from and they really slowed the game down and added a lot to the teaching time.  Maybe a different theme would have been better if this theme doesn't work without this because this felt like bloat not fun unfortunately.
2)The regular buildings:  These were boring stat variations and minor resource acquisitions along with the bloated timeline related "power" buildings.  The superprojects were exciting and having the regular buildings be more interesting and varied thus eliminating the need for superprojects would have made the game much more streamlined and been more fun I believe.
3)Having the board depict the building cost was interesting but not a quality decision usually.  Having buildings have a cost and "land" have a minor additional cost seems to be the better solution there(especially if the original buildings were more unique and interesting). 

Overall I enjoyed it but it seems that some further development would have made this game something it should have been.  More accessible, fun, and popular while also remaining somewhat heavier.

Heavy worker placement that I like a lot. There are some downsides: it takes quite long, it is a VP fest, there is no combat (as can be expected in a Euro WP, but would make sense thematically), and complexity more by layering than integrating different mechanics (as mentioned by Solipsiste). But the game is beautifully designed, plays quite fluently, brings a lot of variety with the (KS-included) modules. One of my favourite futuristic worker placement games.

I love this theme! Both in terms that it really appeals to me, but also the way it's implemented into the mechanics of the game. It's a bit heavy while still being a pretty straightforward worker placement game, which is a shame. I like complex games, but it's hard to convice people to learn and play this beast when all you get is a standard worker placement game, although a very good and thematic one. I think Trickerion does so much more with its complexity. For example, I think it's a shame that the only interaction is blocking, I would love to be able to for example have players help each other with their warps. 

Perhaps the modules will make it feel more unique and interactive, I look forward to trying them out. For now, this is a very good game, but nothing special.

Another near miss for me from Mindclash. There were parts of this game I really liked and parts that frustrated me, which is basically the same thing I think of Trickerion. Therefore, I rate them about the same with a slight edge to Trickerion. Here, I love the theme, the component quality and the time travel/meteor mechanic. However, the game ran a bit long for my tastes. Vital Lacerda games are often criticized for being complex for complexity's sake. I don't agree with that statement, but here it seems applicable. There were a couple rules that felt neither thematic nor strategic, one of which I felt cost me the game. Overall, there was far more good here than bad, but Mindclash has yet to make a game that I feel I have to have in my collection.

Typically overrated Kickstarter trash, a mediocre worker placement and resource conversion game disguised by layers of complexity that only make it worse. There are dozens of different buildings, four different minerals and other two resources, seven unique "superprojects" per game, four types of workers, tokens representing breakthroughs in three different shapes with five different icons, various goal cards for majority scoring, and so on. It's one of those games that try to add strategic depth by presenting an overwhelming amount of information and options to the players.

The design owes a lot to "The Manhattan Project" with the specialized workers and personal buildings, but it also reminded me of "Euphoria", maybe because of the theme. Speaking of which, there is a rich background story, and many (often unnecessary) gameplay elements are supposedly thematic, but the whole still feels dully abstract. The best (worst) example is the time travel mechanic, which is simply a kind of loan.

The player factions seem unbalanced, but the main flaw is that the game is boring. It requires a significant mental effort to play well but there is no reward in fun. Even though you may fill your personal board with buildings that grant you new abilities, there is a strange lack of sense of accomplishment. By the middle of my first (and certainly last) game, I just wanted it to end.

I liked the large exosuit miniatures in the deluxe version (or whatever it's called), but they really should have been made in the players' colors for better visualization. On the artwork, I found the board interesting, in contrast with the horrible leader cards.

A fine game with a couple of nice ideas and overall interesting choices. Even though there's nothing I disliked, it didn't catch me. The things that came to mind are:

- too many rules for what it does
- the dice could've been cut completely

However, all the mechanics work together very well, so that you always need to think ahead, which is the most interesting and satisfying part of this game. I would not ask for it, but I'm open to play it again.

In short: The game is completely fine and works very well, it just didn't catch me like others do.

The only downside for me is that its have way way too many stuff, which it is hard for me to bring it to the table. However, I still adore the game and looking forward to play with many more times.

Really enjoying this game after a few plays, and haven't even cracked open the additional modules yet. Seemed to play well with both 4 and 2.

A prime example of where eurogames have gone wrong in the last ten years. Gone is the elegance of the engine games of the past: Puerto Rico, etc. Instead we get a HUGE box which contains a lot of air, but also a multitude of plastic and card tokens (I understand some versions include a host of unnecessary miniatures). For all that, this is just another worker placement/cube converter: get cubes, trade, cash them in for buildings that give you special abilities, try to get a few more points than your opponents. The trend to bloatware is one I despair of in game design. I seems as though the audience is too ready to be impressed by image, with substance nowhere.

At it's core, JAWPRMG (Just another worker placment, resource management game). But the twists it adds are intriguing, decisions interesting, and the theme is well-implemented.  Worth it even just for the cool concept of "borrowing from the future" and later having to "pay it back".

Fantastic, and rather expansive, worker placement game that sets itself apart from other games in the genre.  I like the differentiation between worker actions on your home base (which you customize) and exo-suit actions on the main board.  The time traveling loan system is interesting.  Beautiful production quality.

This game has a lot of things I love, it's pretty, it's thematic, it's a solid eurogame, easy to understand but harder to win, lots of replay value, a good solo mode,... I can't give it a 10 because there is just something holding me back, probably the variable player powers, but I can't give it less than a 9 either because it's just that good. With 8 plays in there is still so much left undiscovered.

So many interesting decisions, and everything is done in a thematic way. I like how the time traveling is a main story point, yet it remains unclear how much of the story is influenced by time travel - which almost makes fun of how confusing time travel is in many stories/movies/series. A lot of replay value too, even without extra modules or expansions, and you have a lot of fun playing even if you don't win in the end.

After having received Anachrony in the post, my first thought was that this was an overblown monstrosity and that perhaps I'd made a mistake in being seduced by the Kickstarter campaign. The box is oversized and weighs a tonne. The themed Leader outer casing is a complete waste - all it does it hide the very nice design of the box itself. And the miniatures are unnecessarily large. However, after a first play with 3 players, using only the base game and the A sides of the player boards, my faith in having made a worthwhile purchase was been restored. The 2-hour play time was acceptable for a first game.

Now, after several games, I have to conclude that, while not a monstrosity, Anachrony would benefit from being more streamlined. The large number of components means that the game takes quite a long time to set up and pack away, and the size and weight of the box are a disadvantage. The large number of options in the game tends to make the game rather too long for what the game offers. Of more concern is that the strategic paths seem to be limited and so I'm beginning to find the game less interesting. There are 3 additional modules to try, which may inject something new, however I suspect that they will only add to the fundamental problems outlined above. I'm also not convinced that the game is balanced - the Path of Salvation is more difficult to play and I've yet to see it win a game. 

Overall: a beautifully presented game which is full of interesting mechanics, yet everything is done to excess. At its heart, this is a good mid-complexity worker placement/resource-management game, but there is too much needless distraction. A traditional publisher may have turned this into a very good game, but the Kickstarter route has delivered commercial success and lots of bling at the expense of the game itself.

Juego de colocación de trabajadores. Visualmente bastante atractivo.

La duración de la partida depende de las acciones que vayan realizando los jugadores ya que lo marca una especie de evento-cataclismo que medio destruye el mundo donde se juega

Como curiosidad adicional esta el hecho de que los jugadores pueden irse trayendo recursos del futuro (un poco como la raza de la expansión Shadow of the rift del Eclipse)

Tras una lectura de reglas no deja una sensación de juego especial pero de momento las reviews están siendo buenas.

Very good use of the time travel theme. You can bring yourself supplies from the future but you better be prepared to pay those back later.

The worker placement aspect of it is cool as you power up mechs to place in the city spaces so you can build up your own board so that you can gain access to actions only you can use.

The art is great but for some reason the renditions of people in the art is really bad compared to the rest of the art in the game.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2017)

After Trickerion (a game I love) I will back every Mindclash Games game, I just backed Cerebria and I was very keen to try Anachrony. It seems, they publish the kind of game I tend to enjoy as I liked it a lot.

The rules of the game aren’t as complex as you would think from the rulebook, but there are many rules and variants. You can teach them under 20 minutes and you can explain a lot through the theme. At first, I though Anachrony´s rulebook wasn’t very clear, but as it turned out I first read a draft of the rulebook (27 pages long) I had on my files. The final rulebook is much better and does a good job at explaining the game. I found some small differences between the two rulebooks (but I don’t remember them now :(). To summarize, the game seems hard to learn, but that´s not the case.

The theme is fascinating and you do feel it through the game, the game´s mechanism support it very well. The story seems weird, but I have not read the full story that came with the KS box.

The game´s components are very well done as is the art. I won´t comment here about the oversized miniatures as they are part of the Anachrony: Exosuit Commander Pack. With the KS box I couldn’t fit back all the unpunched components (there are so many of them) and sleeved cards, but my SO could, so it is possible but I lack this skill. The box is very heavy, so some of the plastic pegs arrived broken in my copy.

I have only played the base game without any variant, but it comes with some variants and additions right out of the box (like Trickerion) and I love that. I will try them next and then I will come back to comment on them. I played with the A side of the faction boards.

Anachrony is a solid worker placement game, it has a medium weight and it plays around 3 hours. It features specialized workers, which is not a novel mechanism, but it works very well here. The decisions needed to play the game aren’t easy or obvious. You need to plan carefully. Among the decisions you need to take are: how many suits to power up?, what resources should I request from the future?, should I recruit more workers?, if so of which kind, should I get resources?, if so which kind, should I construct, if so which building, should I construct the super project?, should I evacuate? should I get water?, should I wake my workers peacefully or by force?, should I activate a building?, should I research? Should I become the first player?). After the impact new options become available. You don´t have enough workers to do all the things you want to do and you also have to take into account your opponent’s´ moves as they can block the action you want to do. There is a lot of tension and fun in the game and the best path isn’t obvious, it seems it has many paths to victory.

When you recover your workers, some of them can be played right away and some of the are tired :D, I like this mechanism.

Each faction has a power, I have only played the game once so I need more plays to verify if they are balanced, but the player who played the red faction complained a lot his faction was very weak compared to ours because his evacuation action didn’t net him a lot of VPs. Time will tell.

I, particularly, like the warp phase. It is very novel and it reminds me of the videogame Day of the Tentacle. In this phase, you can get up to two free resources from the future, they are free this round but in the future you will have to send them to avoid paradoxes (and lose VPs). Also if you are the player who most has used this warped resources, you will probably get them anyway.

Best with 3 players but I wouldn’t mid to play it with 4 players. It can also be played as a solo game for people who likes this kind of stuff (I don’t).

The luck factor is low, there is luck in how the buildings appear, but, most times, you can see two buildings at the same time. The luck is a bit higher with the breakthroughs. The are more dice that I haven't used yet.

Anachrony is a solid game, but after Trickerion and after seeing how well rated the game is here on BGG, I was expecting something better. The game disappointing me a bit, but I still like it a lot (if that makes any sense). I still prefer Trickerion to this one. 

Bottom line, Anachrony is a good worker placement game and I will keep it in my game collection. It has many mechanisms that mesh together to offer a fun and compelling experience, the decisions needed to play the game are very interesting. I´m keen to try all the variants and modules and I enjoy it a lot. The game is overproduced, but I don’t mind this part. Packing the game after a play is painful for me as you need to do it in a special way to ensure all the components fit in the game box.

Limited worker placement options that lead to each player simply using workers on their personal boards in later turns. Probably need a second play, but i wasn't engaged during the "engine building" process - race to put a few dudes on the competing spots then spend the rest of your turn activating your personal spots - create a good engine on your personal player board!

The time jump mechanism of returning what you borrow is an attempt at an interesting loan mechanism that just didn't work for me. I was 'borrowing' goods, not because I needed them but because returning them was points. And why is that only the person(s) who have borrowed the most have to roll for anomalies? Just to a way to ensure interaction, I suppose? Remove the point system and I much prefer it.

And why do I have to pay for mech suits before-hand? It's calculable, so let me pay as I need them rather than spend 10 minutes performing mental math to ensure I prepay for the correct amount. This could easily be house-ruled to quicken the game pace.

Again, all this with only one playing, but with so many offerings, I doubt I'll get to this one again. I'm sure this game will have it's fans, but for me, it goes on the pile with the other hundred mediocrities. If it breaks the Top 100, I may have to replay it to see what I'm missing.

Anachrony is a large game with lots of pieces that looks like it will be a real bear to learn and play, but it isn't at all. The actions your workers perform are all common tropes of the genre - collect resources, recruit workers, build action spaces, research, and trade. What sets Anachrony apart is how you manage your worker pool: there are four types of workers (each worker has advantages or disadvantages for certain actions), when workers return they are usually exhausted and need to be refreshed, action spaces on the main board require powered-up exosuits which must be planned for, and you build out additional action spaces on your board throughout the game. All of this makes for a very engaging set of decisions and room for forward strategic planning.

The story of the game is that each player represents an ideological faction vying for dominant control of a planet that has mastered time-travel. Because of this, everyone knows that an asteroid is going to destroy the capital and every one is prepping for this event in order to best lead the world in its aftermath. In game terms, the asteroid hits after turn 4 out of 7 turns. Players can borrow resources from the future to use in a current turn, but on future turns they need to actually go back in time to give the resource as the lender. While this is cool in concept, nobody ever really needs to do this in the game. Players who borrow the most each turn usually get paradoxes and three paradoxes become anomalies that eat up your building spaces and cost you points if you don't get rid of them. Frankly, I'm not sure if borrowing is worth the risk. You do get two points every time you go back to fulfill your commitment, but there are lots of less-risky ways to get points. Once you start borrowing from the future, preventing time-continuum paradoxes necessarily becomes the focus of your resources at the expense of potentially greater opportunities - the penalties of not addressing paradoxes can really add up.

I really like the game, but knocked it down because of how long the setup time is (with expansions even more time), how fiddily the rules are, a couple of rule wording holes, and some of the deluxe components are easily susceptible to wear and tear (please round of sharp component edges or make them plastic or something because my tech triangles out of the box looked slightly frayed on the edges).  My biggest complaint is the game feels like if a few thing had been changed it could really be elegant.  I think the designer needs another three or four releases under their belt before they reach their peak.  That doesn't mean this game is bad it just means I feel the games are still a little quirky and undercooked.  I think the designer is very close to perfection but just a few things feel off.

This is so overproduced it actually infuriates me. Not only that, but it feels like they did the opposite of streamlining: they tried to make everything as complicated as possible, adding layers upon layers of rules to hide the lack of strategy in this very standard worker placement. The theme is interesting, so are the worker types, and the retheme of loans to "warps", but mechanically, it doesn't hold up. Most WYG titles achieve twice that depth in a quarter of the rules.

This is a good worker placement game, I was really taken by it after my first play but after a few plays I realized it didn’t really have legs for me, it’s solid but doesn’t really bring anything new to the table.

I think the Time Travel trappings are really silly - the game would work as a 'colonise before collapse' game in a space setting, with the recruitment, building, research, racial goals and abilities all making sense. The time travel is just a mechanical and thematic oddity, more of an impediment than an attribute to me.

As far as this type of passive aggressive euro thing goes it's the one I've enjoyed the most in the recent past.

What a totally unexpected surprise this game was. Easily one of the best for 2017!! Simple worker placement mechanisms with a time travel theme make this game a must buy for all gamers. It really comes to life if you also buy the Exosuit Commander Pack! Really like the way the worker spaces decrease toward the end of the game for some real drama. This is a euro game through and through , and it does it well! When you finish this game , you actually feel as though you've been traveling in time. Each path has a different feel. . There are four paths ; Harmony , Dominance , Progress , and Salvation. Each with  unique characteristics and their own set of Exosuits for your workers. Simply a beautiful experience !!!

RATING: 8
Moving rating from 7 -> 8. Enjoying it more with the B side. Haven't tried the draft of initial resources. 

The B sides of the four factions are quite different and interesting. I think I prefer those sides so I don't have to focus so much on one type of building for end game scoring. 

Doomsday module with research wasn't as exciting as the adventure deck. The only really interesting aspect was that the impact tile could move during phase 6. (In my one game it moved once so we had the normal game setup with impact occurring after round 4 (Doomsday module starts impact tile after 5 rounds instead of 4).

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Okay, the plastic minis are just for show but they do look nice! Typical for Mindclash, the game has a lot of bits and table sprawl and has interesting game play. It is worker placement with the exosuits required if you wish to place a worker on the main board whereas you do not need exosuits to use workers on your home board. Workers also frequently exhaust and require either water to reactivate or require forced labor and loss of points to re-activate. The time travel aspect is basically a loan system where you can borrow against the past to complete the present. However, if "interest" comes due before you have a chance to repay then you will have to block a building spot and use a worker and materials to pay to remove it and the -3 points. With each era seeing dice rolled for interest due, you don't want to be in the majority too many places with these "loans". 

The explorer module is interesting but pretty random as to what reward (or penalty) you are likely to receive. You can add research to the mech to increase your card draw and give yourself options, but I'm not certain about this module in the long run although it was nice to have available to use mechs - particularly late in the game.

Backed on kickstarter in may '16. Path of Dominance Leader box. Received March '17.
I knew when I opened the box that Anachrony would be an impressive game. First of: this is a very generous game. The base game has four factions with two different leaders and two sides to the faction boards. That's 16 different ways for a player to start their game so there is huge variability in the game. Add to that three modules to expand the game and a soloplay version and you've got even more ways to play. I've only played this game as a solo experience (but will be playing multiplayer games soon). My opinion so far is that Anachrony is a hard game to master. The learning curve is steep. While Mindclash games first game Trickerion might be more rules heavy, you can focus more clearly on your end goal. Anachrony is more open, with more paths to victory. So it's hard, sometimes even a bit too hard for my liking, certainly when you play against the Chronobot. Having said that Anachrony is truly an epic sci-fi board game that I'm proud to have in my collection.

Did play Anachrony for the first time. Some reflections after playing it:
* A good game that I will have to try multi-player as well. My rating might very well change after trying that.
* This is a good solo game with the Chronobot. It scored 50% more points than me this first try.
* The time travel, time warps, paradoxes, asteriod impact, exosuits makes this a really good SF themed game.
* Stumbled on the rules, and had to google some questions. I do recommend playing it solo to get to learn the rules.

I would put this as #1 among the games I have tried solo. But I still have not tried a few I think might be good for solo play (Le Havre, Terraforming Mars and Robinson Crusoe). The theme is something I do like. Have had some problems with the design and the massiveness of the game but of course there are much bigger ones.

After playing through a couple of eras my first play, I gave this game a 9. I have since played fully through two additional times and have increased the score to a 10! I love this game and how the strategy is very self-contained for the first 4 eras and then a free-for-all eras 5-7! There are so many different strategic approaches you can take with this game, and the fact that each Path has their own advantages and disadvantages when playing with the B-Side of the Player Board makes the combinations of strategies unreal. I will play this game any time someone wants to play and try to focus on a different strategic approach each time. I don't think it's possible to get bored of this game if you love strategy games with little interference from other players!

RATING: 7.5
7.5 for solo so far. Looking forward to multiplayer... not looking forward to teaching it.

It's all about the little things with this game. Everything from the lore to the little twists the designers added to familiar gameplay tropes. For instance, I really like the Tired/Motivated mechanic for the workers and the risky play of blindly selecting the number of warp tiles to use. 

The design of the AI chronobot is also very clever. There's something about pushing tokens around the board that feels so much more fun than drawing a card from Scythe's Automa deck. It definitely adds to the premium experience of a Mindclash game, elevating the solo experience from what other games typically deliver.

As much as I enjoy the individual parts of this game, there's something about it that lacks cohesion. Like I don't really feel like I've built an engine so much as I've scraped together what I could get my hands on and made the best of it. I enjoy the tension, I just wish the payoff was a little more ... epic? Regardless, I can't stop thinking about this one.

This one definitely has legs. The replayability is higher than most other Euros I've seen what with all of the asymmetrical and randomized options in the base game plus all of the modular expansions that can be added. I'll be pulling this one out for a while, I hope that means I'll get faster with setting it up too!

Loved the twist on worker placement by adding a loan and repayment plan (time-travel). The resource management was good, and the player interaction (while standard worker-placement interaction) felt stronger than games like Agricola. A game where everyone was on their feet, really invested in everyone's turns. The figures were nice, but not needed at all for game play.

It’s gonna take a lot of time to unbox it. It’s gonna take a long time to set it up. And it’s gonna take a long time to read through the rules. But it’s all with it. This is an amazing game. Super thematic, visually grasping, and the time travel mechanic, while not the most innovative thing in a game, actually notches the theme up a level. 
Highly recommended. If you can get the exosuit expansion, do it. The minis are great and bring the theme out even more.

RATING: 7
Thématique bien incorporée dans le jeu. L'échelle du temps n'est peut être pas assez mise au centre du jeu (par rapport au plutôt classique plateau d'action). Elle sert de système d'investissement mais je soupçonne qu'on puisse jouer sans, sans que le reste du jeu n'en soit particulièrement bouleversé (ce qui serai très dommage justement). D'ailleurs le jeu propose une version allégée de celle-ci...
Chaque faction est asymétrique, ce qui peut réduire l'interaction en orientant les joueurs sur des éléments différents, mais d'un autre côté sert de contrainte créant des stratégies différentes à chaque partie (mais + ou - imposées, ce que je reproche parfois à ce genre d'idée).

Ummm.. yah... huge learning curve. Typical worker placement. Theme: time travel. If you mess with time and you don't fix the problem, it'll bite back. 
I'm unsure about some rules, but to continue to be thematic, if you have gained an anomaly, essentially you have opened a rift in time space continuum and the future has been warped because of your actions. In the anomaly tile it says that you can return an action back to the future for no price at all, SO keep the most historic era with your old warp tiles there which will symbolize it as frozen in time. IN END GAME, those # of warp tiles will hurt in points as they stay permanent as a remnant of your past deeds.

Worker placement with some familiar twists (different workers get different benefits at different places) and new (time travel-themed loan system). I like the way this comes together. The mechanisms and theme are well interwoven and the introduction and destruction of worker spots over the course of the game keeps it interesting. For whatever reason it just didn't grab me as it did the rest of the table. I think it's "fine," a conclusion that cannot justify its price tag or shelf space, both inflated by the most gratuitous use of minis I've yet encountered.

Only a single solo play with some rules errors.  Ultimately I don't think the game will be that intimidating, but even stripped down to the essentials it takes a bit to grok and throwing in running the Chronobot takes some getting use to (even though it's ultimately a clever system, though I think it might build too often).  The amount of possible variation, even more introducing the expansions, is already very high - moreso than I'm likely to ever need with the rate my groups jump from game to game.

I was a bit scared about playing the game because my gaming community gave some mixed opinions about it. There were a few enthusiastic and much more sceptical. However, after a long struggle with the rulebook (read it three times before playing the game itself) I finally sat down and sank into the world of Anachrony. I've only played three games so far: one solo and two games with all the modules (mixed). And all I can say is just... WOW! This game is really something. The core is very good, although to feel the real taste I advise using the modules. Even the other side of the time line, because the standard one is just boring. The one with the award and punishment symbols is better fun and gives you more to think about, more to plan, more to struggle. The time travel is a kind of a loan, although some people (I believe) seem to misunderstand its purpose. You have to borrow things and give them back as soon as possible, which will grant you points and allow to borrow the same things again (you really don't know when you might need those things, because the game is dynamic and you're always shy of resources, water or energy cores)... it's a kind of a management system where you have to keep in mind the paradox and anomalies. It works neatly. I also like the impact idea, which turns the game upside down by diminishing your force, upgrading city actions and therefore discarding them after the first use. This makes the game a lot different to the style one has played till that time. There is so much good to say about that game... for instance, the Chronobot Solo gaming! I just don't know how they came up with that idea of action programming for the bot. It works excellent and does a great job. You can just feel the chronobot reading your mind, because whenever you're thinking about some kind of action or movement, the bot is right there before you and rips the tastiest bits off the board. Amazing job, well done! Just try it. I think it's wort it. 

At the very moment, after three games, the rating is very high - number nine - however I am absolutely sure, that it will go up after a few more games.

Very intuitive and fun worker placement game, powering up the mech suits is cool and thematic.

Two plays in now. Still think its a great game.  The only down side if any is that it is pretty complex / thinky, and your first few games will be LONG.

I really like this game and especially the timetravel mechanic, but that is surely not the main focus of the game. At its core it's a worker placement game with asymetrical powers & victory conditions. The mood and theme are pretty strong.

I have the kickstarter version with all the expansions and the miniatures. They are gorgeous and add a fun tactile as well as visual plus when putting your workers in an exosuit, but if bling is not that important to you, just forget about the mini's, they don't do anything extra gamewise except look pretty...

Oh my goodness this game has got it going on like Stacey's mom! I was a huge fan since the KS campaign.

It's similar to Agricola in that you sort of have to plan out your entire turn completely in advance. But In this case I don't mind because the theme is more attractive to me. Can't stand most of Uwe's games.

I love the world-building in general, in this game. The exosuits are amazing, and the time-traveling "loan" mechanic is simply brilliant. With so many modules and expansions at various player counts, there is a lot of game to explore.

Beautifully made game. The theme is strong . The miniatures look pretty. There are a lot of things to keep track off. It is a worker placement style game . With some of the placement taking place  on your own board. You have to play Side B of your player board so that each Ideology actually feels different. I like worker placement games so I enjoyed this . There isnt a lot of ways to mess with your enemy except maybe to block there moves but for the most part you just try to outscore each other.

The pacing is unusual because you have a major event that occurs after the fourth round that changes up the board, but then the game keeps going for another one to three rounds and often it seems the importance of the things you were focusing on prior aren't as relevant now, so you want to make sure you don' shoehorn yourself into something to meet the early event and miss having a strong finish. I don't have any other games like this (ie: worker placement euro?) and it's really my first big foray into the genre but so far it has been really enjoyable. No regrets in buying it.

This was a shockingly good game! Shocking because there are many elements here that would've made me pause before outright buying this game, like the futuristic theme and the fact that Anachrony is from the same company and team who designed Trickerion, a game that hasn't been played but once because of its general overcomplicated nature. And while there is a still a whiff of "too many moving parts" in this new venture, the design and flow of the game was enjoyable and pleasant. Outwardly, Anachrony may seem like a Descent in Space-type experience, but its really a worker placement game with resource management. There are workers who become exhausted, buildings to build and points to be earned. The one mechanic that stands out in Anachrony is the Timeline which not only signifies the end of the game but also holds the "free" resources players receive at the beginning of a turn. Free is in quotes because players must pay these workers and building materials back...those resources were sent from the future to help you build your civilization! If they are not paid back later, time paradoxes and, even worse, anomalies occur ie., destroying resources and victory points. Anachrony has a million tiny rules for almost everything, and none of its intuitive at first. The iconography can be a lot to comprehend but it is consistent. And very little is given to chance; almost everything in the game is pure tactics and strategy. There are no windfalls or event decks which grant player bonuses which makes for a very punishing game if you don't plan correctly. However, at game's end, when I had thirteen measly points and had misunderstood a handful of rules, everyone at the table generally approved of the experience and was not opposed to playing it again...which never happened with Trickerion. Anachrony succeeds in following Vital Lacerda's hieroglyphic design (removing text from the board), swift one-action turns, and an innovative design for a worker placement game. In contrast, however, the cumulative layers of the game feel more like mini-games within the larger context; every section of the board feels detached, requiring specific rules and strategies which can exhaust and frustrate certain players. Overall, the designers have vastly improved their skills by editing and distilling the game to the core mechanics of what makes the game enjoyable. I can't wait to see what they come out with next. Anachrony definitely has replayability as the game comes with many modules and variants to try out every time you play and I, for one, can't wait to discover them.

This game might be intimidating at first glance but isn't so bad as you play.  Let your worker pool and priorities dictate your possible actions.

I would give this game an 8 if not 9 out of 10 rating if it wasn't for the flipping dice.  WHY!?  It doesn't ruin the game but it practically removes my sense of control over scientific research and paradoxes.

Last time I played, a player at our table, despite rolling the paradox dice 6 times, only received 3 paradox tokens.  The same player got to build 2 mega projects by only doing 2 research while I had to do 3 just to build one (I got the same bloody thing twice).

Dear game designers, if you want to make a complex strategy game, don't add randomness to it!  A huge part of your target audience, cerebral gamers, need a sense of autonomy and competence to feel intrinsically motivated to play your game again and again.  If randomness robs us of either, well... it sucks.  Read up on self-determination theory.

I really liked the look of this game, but after 1 play through with a faction that I didn't get to use their 'power' and being the last player of 3 where player 1 always controlled the game (retaining 1st player for 3 of the 5 rounds), I am not eager to play again.  I liked the concepts, but found something missing in the delivery.  Maybe because of my faction, but it fell short of the mark for me.  I would rather get Yedo out for a worker placement game.

You can really tell this game came from the same guys that did Trickerion. It's a touch lighter, but there seems to be more paths to play around with. The rulebook is well written although slightly unclear in certain places (namely the time traveling aspect). The miniatures are freaking huge and while they are completely unnecessary, I do think they add to the game. The game is beautiful, but holy crap does this barely fit back into the box. It's like god damn tetris each time I want to put it back.

I have yet to try any of the variants or expansions. The base seems like plenty for a few games, unlike in Trickerion where I felt like the expansion was needed shortly after to keep the game fresh.

We had a 3 hour window.  4 player game.  We managed to play 5 of 7 rounds.  Had to cut short because the game store was closing.  One of us had played before - he owned the game.  Two of us had watched play through videos, so we had an idea of how to play.  All were experienced gamers.  We had some excellent aids from BGG that really helped clarify the building tiles (kudos to BGG there).  Overall, seemed like everyone at the table was a little frustrated.  Some  of the rules were misinterpreted (and reinterpreted) during the game - which slowed things down a bit.  One person got really irritated by that and expressed it in private after the game.  I've never seen that reaction before.  Our copy will arrive soon (we bought it before playing it).  If we teach the game, we'll probably try to hold the player count to 3.  And, I think a short "strategy guide" for new players would be helpful.  Maybe it's in the rules - not sure, as I have not read them yet.

An absolutely amazing game. The theme is clever, and just plain cool. The two-level worker placement feels fresh. I am still noticing new ways the factions are asymmetrical. And this is without even touching the extra content that can be added by the boatload. Also a very well-written rulebook, which goes a long way in helping a heavier game get to the table. One of my absolute favorites.

I'm very impressed by my first play of this game. Thematically this is very, very strong. It's quite a challenge to get the things done on time and there seems to be quite a lot of possibilities to get VP, especially if you add some extra modules. 

The only minus I can think of for now is that the leaders, evacuation requirements and starting resources are fixed to a color. Most of the players I play with have a fixed color, which made they will always be driven in the same direction and that's a pity.

I have 14 plays of Anachrony as of the above date and received the game in the mail on February 22nd.Two games were with my son, one with my wife and the rest as solo play.

The Chronobot is tough and requires a different mindset to play.  I found I should be passing sooner instead of playing out all of my actions. 

A great game over all with a wide variety of strategies to win.  

I love the engine building aspect. 

I love the asymmetrical factions.

I love the worker placement actions where you can build your own spots on your home city and do not even need the main board as much near the end game.

I love hitting some cool action combos.

My favorite module is "The Pioneers of New Earth".

No negatives since I knew this was a worker placement game, but with the cataclysm coming, the cool exo suits, time travel and the sci-fi theme it seems some combat would have been incorporated somehow. Still love the game as you can tell by the number of plays so far.

You can still "mess with" your opponent some by taking actions or buildings they may need, but not at the detriment to your own strategy. So the player interaction is minimal like most worker placement games......maybe similar to Terra Mystica.

I highly recommend!!

Ohhh the new hotness arrived in the mail, I couldn't wait to play it. Seriously beautiful and awesome bits. Well produced game and fun worker placement.

Variable player abilities which I haven't explored yet and A TON of modules I haven't looked at. I have to say I am excited to explore this game further and I think it will be an awesome edition to my ever growing collection of games.

This vs Trickerion. They are both worker placement games from the same manufacturer. If I had to pick one, it would be Trickerion, for the following reasons.
* As nice as the artwork of Anachrony is, the theme is not grounded at all
* Purchasing of first player status in Anachrony can perpetually benefit the first and second player if they don't want to change things up -- and 3rd / 4th player are possibly forced to go after the more expensive slot
* While there are different resources in Anachrony, there was never a feeling of scarcity or importance -- unlike Trickerion, whose resources not only have to be loaded into the game, but their cost mechanic fluctuates. Anacrhrony tries to do this with stocking cards, similar to San Juan market cards, but it falls flat. Also, with as many components as the game has, I would have preferred the trickerion solution, which is to have a couple die rolled each round to set the market vs having to store and optionally sleeve two whole decks of cards
* The mechs add very little
* The simultaneous action selection of Trickerion made decision making feel much tighter. Anachrony still has some good decisions to make but things feel less compelling
* Almost all point scoring occurs at the end of Anachrony -- this is good and bad -- everyone is engaged until the end, but for the length of the game, there's no real indication of who's in the lead, making for very little tension

Base game is very solid worker placement and resource management. Mostly nothing that has not been done before apart from the time travel mechanism.  Time travel is a way to take out loans of specific resources.  If not paid back later, your home board suffers damage.  Very cool.  The game is long and takes about an hour per new player.

This is a very tightly designed middle-weight euro that looks far more complicated than it actually is due to an insane level of over-production.  
That said, as much as I might want to criticize it for the abundance of unnecessary minis and mountains of chits... I just can't.  It's all so charming!  The theme really shines through, and the art really helps the game stay tantalizing.

Side note: Do not play with the paradox dice.  Just assign one paradox token per outstanding future loan each turn.  The dice can go die in a fire.

EDIT: I was paying water to force workers when not required to. Maybe why water was so scarce to need to play it again correctly. Doh! (3/6/10)

EDIT 2: Played again with correct rule change and had a bit more water to use for the game. The gameplay does require good planning since the extra water was not needed as much and scored in the 50's using Path of Dominance. Planning well for evacuation can net you the game winning points. It's a game that rewards lots of plays to figure out how to maximize what the game offers to you (path, superprojects, buildings, research). Raised score from 6 to 7. (3/10/17)

The game overall felt too tight and maybe dragged at times since I'd just run out of moves from poor planning I think (maybe good and bad?). Needed water a lot and it was scarce if I didn't plan enough for it. Post impact rounds are most constricting if not planned for it. Was using Path of Progress. Production and components are great though. Tried two plays and just wasn't having fun playing it as I thought I would be. Need to try other factions to see if they're better or lean for one strategy. I got destroyed both games with 2 players by Path of Harmony (A/B sides; 21-40/21-51). Other medium-heavy games I own and enjoy are Great Western Trail, Scythe and Vinhos Deluxe Edition.

First impressions - after one solo learning game against the bot and one two player game (28-01-2018) 
-first of all, the theme and presentation is top-notch. Even without the minis, the board, the art are fantastic and the theme is very well integrated into the gameplay. The whole warping mechanic (borrowing something from the future what you can use immediately, but what you have to produce later and send it back to yourself so that there won't be any paradox in time. - maybe there is to much chrome, but it's fantastic!! 
- The variance in the setup makes this game highly replayable. There are different end-game scoring opportunities, different super-projects, different buildings come up in every game and also the four paths have two sided player boards, two sided path board and two leaders to choose from. The variability is over the top here, and the four paths each offer a very unique style of play. Plus, there is already an expansion in the base box, two more available in the minis expansion plus some variants at the end of the rulebook.
- In its heart this is a tight worker placement game with some resource conversion trhown in with a hefty amount of chrome over the top. Don't be freightened by the dense iconoghraphy: The graphical design is good, by your 3rd game you will rarely consult with the rulebook. 
- BUT: this is still only a tight worker placement game, this is still only a farely simple resource conversion game involving only 6 kind of resources (I don't count the different workers as resources here). The question is this: will the game open up later for more varied strategies or it remains what I feel it is? A mishmash of basic ideas with slight tweaks thrown in for chrome... Time will tell.... :)

RATING: 5.5
There are several interesting mechanics at play here.  At it's core, it's a worker placement game.  A twist is that to play to the community board, you must place your worker in a "mech".  To gain mechs, you must pay resources (varies based on race).

Where you go from here depends on a lot of things.  First, the variety of your player powers.  The end-goal(s) you are going for. The modules in play (there are several).

All things considered, this game is one that I enjoy in theory more than I enjoy in practice.  We played with a single slow player and it turned what would have been a 90 minute game into 3+ hours - that's annoying.  Is this the game's fault?  Not necessarily, but it did facilitate it.

I like worker placement and I like a lot of the decisions going on in this game, but ultimately I think there are just a lot better (and faster) options for me at this time.  I would play it again, but won't be searching this one out.

There's a lot to say about this great worker placement game. The time travel twist give a whole extra level of planning and efficiency that can be achieved to come out on top in this game. There seems to be multiple paths to victory. Final scores seem like they will typically be pretty close (and hard to come by), so every thing you do to lose/gain points matter. I HIGHLY recommend the exosuit expansion pack. Not only to the miniatures add to immerse you into the theme, there's extra content in that box that really add to my enjoyment of the game. Here are my other thoughts on what to include or leave out:

VARIENTS:
1. Alternate timeline (base game) - Timeline tiles are placed on their back side. When placing warp tiles, they are placed in turn order and possibly cover bonuses or penalties. (Examples: gain morale, gain 1VP, receive double the requested asset, remove a paradox, lose morale, gain a paradox). I think this would be a very fun addition as long as there's a decent balance between reward/penalty. It also might give another benefit for players that spend the extra water to take 1st player. 

2. Draft for starting assets (base game) - Start with 2 water, 2 energy cores, 2 active scientists, 2 active engineers. Then there are cards with varied assets (water, resources, cores, workers) printed on them. We draw a certain number of them into our hand. Pick one to keep and pass the rest to the left. Take the new hand of cards passed to us and pick one to keep... until you have kept 4 cards. There are also numbers on the bottom of the cards and the player with the lowest sum gets to be the 1st start player. Love this actually. The ability to customize what you start with and also via to be start player. Only issue is that the "draft" does add time to the game, but it shouldn't be too much.

3. Endgame goal cards (base game) - Instead of drawing 5 randomly from the deck, Each player is dealt some cards to choose 1 from and the remaining are pulled at random. (based on player count obviously). I could take this or leave it. In a 3-4 player game you only get 2 to choose from and both could be crap. Again, a draft would add time to the game and this time the benefit just doesn't seem to be enough. Maybe in a 2 player game where you are dealt 4 and pick 2.

DOOMSDAY MODULE (base game):
4. This adds a new multi-user main board worker spot (like the exploration board did). It's used to conduct experiments. Experiments are available similar to the superprojects (1 per era and you have to be focused on the era you want to do). In addition to those points, there is a track to save earth or seal its fate. 2 factions are pushing their combined token up the track while the other 2 factions push their combined token down giving extra VPs accordingly (and know, but different for each faction). This movement, plus the roll of 2 new dice will possibly move the round where the impact will happen (or end the game if the save earth track is completed - no impact or evacuation would happen). I feel like this has some balance issues (especially in a 3 player game where 2 players are working together on one track and the other has to do all the work themselves). It also has 2 major wrenches to throw into your planning by possibly changing the era that the impact happens or possibly ending the game and denying the ability to evacuate (the best pre-game points focus you get to work towards). It does seem to be good points with a cheep cost (although it does have other conditions you must have, but don't pay). If I got to play this game a lot, then I would try it occasionally if I had 2 or 4 players. I'll always prefer the other exploration module. Actually, I don't think I saw anything that says you can't use both, but I still would prefer to cut out the random this adds as planning is hard enough as it is.

GUARDIANS OF THE COUNCIL (expansion):
5. This adds a way to get more exosuits (that can be powered without a worker and as if they have a genius in them). It also adds a way to have your own reserved main board action spot to go to in order to perform a build, recruit, or research action (with a 1 water cost). You do still have to power up these suits as per normal with the regular suits. The cost to obtain them is varied, but all make you kill a worker (permanently assign them to remotely control the exosuit) plus some other smaller additional cost. I think this could be good and useful and seems to be able to be added in with any of the other modules/variants. If you don't think it is worth it to use, then it seems like it can be easily ignored. We ate up those recruit and construct spots almost every era, and post-game were wishing there was a way to do more... this allows for that.

ADVENTURE ON NEW EARTH (expansion):
6. I like it a lot (even though it partially burned me). It gives you an extra place to go on the main board and can give you some pretty powerful rewards and points. Think of this similar to the Caverna adventuring.

RATING: 7.8
Only played the base game once, rating may change with more experience and trying the extra modules...

So far I'm honestly not that impressed with Anachrony: yes, it is a beautifully produced game with an immersive story. Yes, the mechanics are grounded in theme, and there is some innovative worker placement going on (4 types of 'specialist' workers, deciding how many workers you will send out to the 'contested' worker placement spots on the central board before you actually start placing them, workers who go to sleep after they have worked unless you keep them 'motivated'). Yes, there is a nice dynamic in which the game changes about halfway through when the astroid strikes earth in which gradually 'contested' worker placement spots close down and the availablility of certain resources change. Yes, there is some (minor!) engine building going on with erecting buildings offering some personal advantages.

For all those reasons, I like the game. However, I had expected more... In the end, this still boils down to another worker placement game and the 'innovative' aspects which were implemented in Anachrony fall a little short for me. A game like 'Nippon' for example does a much better job of utilising an original and innovative game engine driving the worker placement mechanic in the game, and I know many recent worker placement games which feel more orginal and have a more elegant set-up. Anachrony takes a pretty long time to explain and play, but actually offers little more gameplay experience compared to classic worker placements (the main decision you will be making is: 'what spot do I need to take first, before an opponent snatches away the stuff I want'). Been there, done that (in more simple, quick and elegant games). The manual could have been better with more examples. Most of the game components are beautifully emerged in theme, but others are pretty sterile and generic looking (mainly buildings and super projects). I also think it is a shame they cut the engine building aspect short by only allowing 3 buildings of the same type to be built - a bit of a shame... As in all worker placement games, turn order is important, but Anachrony has implemented a rather strange mechanic to change it (play unfortunately always revolves clock-wise and the action spot to grab 1st player spot switches from overly expensive to overly cheap depending on how the board fills up. I would have preferred a more balanced mechanism for this aspect).

All in all a good game, I enjoyed playing it, but still I hope my rating will improve with more experience and trying out the extra modules, because for now Anachrony failed to really impress me.

Enjoyed the game but really felt that the time-travel/loaning of resources was a mechanic that was not that widely used by players because they could do without it. Still, the art and production value and general gameplay make it very enjoyable.,

For most the game you feel as if you are trying to scrape together a functioning resource engine. But that is sort of the point, given that the game is set in a barren wasteland where players are trying to opportunistically build a viable city. The game feels fragmented and discontinuous which is also consistent with the time travel theme. Overall a great integration of gameplay and theme
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
While themed around time travel, it is really just worker placement with the ability to go into debt.  Loans aren't really time travel.  That is not a major criticism, but the game's hype had raised my expectations on that front.

The rulebook isn't stellar, but it is complete.  However, I think it makes the game seem more complex than it really is, and a bit harder to teach than it should be, which has proven to be a barrier in getting the game to the table.  People who don't know it are hesitant to try, and those who have played it before say they like it but never seem to want to refresh the rules and set it up.  This all makes me worry that it is good, but not quite good enough for its length/complexity/rulebook.

The game looks very busy but it's actually a fairly straightforward worker placement game.  The time warp mechanism is interesting but it's just a gimmick for loans.  Still, this is a very solid game and it plays very smooth.  The actions you perform all makes sense and you don't feel like you are just doing random things to get points.  The setup and clean up could take awhile with everything you have to put out.  Some of the faction powers seems a bit unbalanced.

RATING: 6
For all the mech minis, tons of components, and time travel theme, it's actually a pretty straight-forward worker placement Euro.  Recruit workers, collect money (water) and resources, turn those into buildings that give you access to new personal actions, gains points on various tracks and end goals.  You have 3 types of workers  (some are better at certain actions or only one type of worker can do an action), they get exhausted after being use and must be reactivated each round, and you have to pair them with another worker (mech) to take actions on the main game board.  The time travel theme and lingo is more complicated than it really is - basically, the players' pawns move down a track, one step each round; each round you do a blind bidding to take loans for extra resources; and then later you're going to want to use a special action to temporarily move your pawn back to previous rounds to pay back those loans and be able to build special big buildings. Players with more loans in each past round are more likely to take extra debt (paradoxes and anachronies) that you have to pay back or take negative points.  All in all, it's quite enjoyable, but it's definitely an example of taking a straight-up medium weight Euro and covering it up with a sci-fi theme and non-intuitive terminology/graphic design to trick you into thinking you're playing something better than another Euro about trading in the Mediterranean.

Update: not as interesting on 2nd play, it's just too long for what it is.  The 2-step worker+mech to take the main actions is an interesting mechanism, but the rest is just a lot of fluff attempting to differentiate itself from other worker placement games.

RATING: 8.25
A hefty worker-placement game with different worker types and player boards with personal worker spaces, two things I love in worker placement games.  In this way it's a bit like a heavier, slower The Manhattan Project; less engine potential and a slower pace, but some more difficult decisions to make each turn. The time-travel theme is done quite well, and the game feels like top quality.  

It's a tiny bit unfortunate that the buildings come out one at a time; it can be frustrating at times when you reluctantly purchase a power plant that is merely adequate, only to reveal the much more ideal tile underneath it, for the next player to grab.  I also am slightly annoyed that it's not possible to be a completely responsible time-traveler; when you warp back any resources, the best you can do is to pay them back in the following round, which often means you still must roll the risk die and potentially suffer consequences.

These are minor complaints, and overall I like this game a lot.

I'm so impressed by this game. It was heavy, but not TOO heavy. It was long, but not TOO long. It was strategic. It was Thematic. Ugh. The game really moved and just had incredibly satisfying decisions and moments. Chaining your actions together to get the most out of your rounds was very, very fun. It's a complete optimization game. You really need to manage your resources and workers to achieve the best possible score. I really love this one after only one play.

I'm always a little wary of KS games, but this one was pretty well done.  The components are fantastic and well constructed.  The game was a fun engine builder with some nice scarcity on the board which causes tough decisions here and there.  

On the negative side, I felt somewhat limited in the tile draw and it felt like a few times the available building suited other folks better than me, but largely that wasn't a huge deal (at least not more so than other games of this type).  It also felt like it had a LOT of rules to explain for the weight of the game (I'd classify it medium/medium-heavy). It also is a bit longer than my preferred game length.  

A decent game that I'd play if the group needed a 3rd/4th, but not something I'll request myself, mostly for personal taste reasons.

I liked Anachrony, despite it being a giant mess of a game. Up until the last turn of the game, every decision felt meaningful. I liked what I was doing. I liked that there were wildly different powers. (Though I wonder how they figured out the balance, or if they actually did...) I wasn't a big fan of the time travel bits; they felt tacked-on and not very meaningful. But ultimately, this game took 4 and 1/2 hours including rules explanation, and that's just too long. The payoff isn't high enough for that length. If I'm going to play a meaty worker-placement game, I'll grab Argent at half the time and twice the fun.

Had a great time at 2. Had a horrible time at 4. 2 felt just right timing-wise. 4 just seemed to drag on interminably and felt extremely ponderous.

It is a GREAT worker placement with a lot of interlocking parts that provide a lot of interesting decisions. The design is very well thought out, has beautiful graphics, rules that flow logically, and most of all, everything makes sense. Even the dense iconography, once learned, makes sense for the most part.

It is a table hog, but honestly no more so than other component heavy games of this type. I think Cthulhu Wars with some Neutral GOO/Monster expansions would take up as much space at 4 players.

But it has various problems that should have been resolved before release: research and super projects are underpowered, leader abilities and evacuation criteria are not well balanced, the pioneers of new earth module is overpowered and clearly serves some paths more than others, and buildings are not well balanced. A huge disappointment. Hopefully they will release some fixes at some point. In the meantime, I will look for fan fixes...

A Trickerionnal a srácok már bebizonyították, hogy a magyar társasjátékfejlesztés is kezdi ostromolni a legjobb eurók világát, az Anarchony-val pedig el is jutottak a legjobbak közé. A sci-fi téma és főleg az időutazás jól visszajön a játékban, pedig egy komoly euró esetén nehéz a tematikát láthatóvá tenni. A jelenben kért nyersanyagokat később a jövőből visszajőve kell visszaszolgáltatni, különben paradoxon következik be, ami a játékost negatívan éri, szuper ötlet és nagyon jól működik. A fő táblán és saját táblánkon való akciózás nem újdonság, de ötletesen megoldott, hogy a fő táblán való akciókhoz védelmi ruha szükséges, amelyek megszerzése jól kitalált. Érdekes, jól működő megoldás embereink használata, ami két féle lehet. Könnyebb, nekik való munkában nem merülnek ki és a következő körben is használhatók, viszont nem rájuk kitalált dolgok végzése megerőltető számukra, frissességük visszanyerésére pedig két mód is van. Az egyik nem kíván akciót és újabb munkaerőt, cserébe negatív győzelmi ponttal jár, míg a nehezebb megoldás pozitívval. Jók és változatosak az építhető épületek is. Jól kitalált az egyes népcsoportok különleges képességei is. A játék szerintem nem nehezebb a Trickerionnál, sőt talán könnyebb is. A szabály jól magyarázható és a játékidő sem vészes. 3-an ideális volt. Nehéz bármibe is belekötnöm, talán a grafikán dolgozhattak volna még, főleg a tábla lehetett volna szebb és talán kevésbé színes. A kickstarteres extra bábuk, szebb nyersanyagok tetszetősek és illenek a játékhoz. Le a kalappal srácok, bravó!

Solid worker placement game with a decent theme. Does not do anything new, but the various elements come together well. Has the tension of worker placement slots, hotly contested first player, variable setup, asymmetric powers and such. One complaint I would have is that the setup seems long, and the 4 player game can go 2.5 hours, but the good design makes it so it just manages not to overstay its welcome.

RATING: 8.5
At the moment, I am still playing it multi-player solo, but it is so clever.   Mind blowing.     What is helpful is that even though there are a lot of resources that you build that do different things, they aren't individually too complex.    Learning the iconography and interpreting what purchased or built assets actually do is quite straightforward.   Compared with Trickerion, which had a lot of look-up in the reference booklets during gameplay, this one seems to require far less of that.    It's simpler.   Yet, the combination of all the elements is delightfully elaborate.   My relatively high rating is a reflection of enthusiasm for the game, at this point.

The new gold standard for overproduced. 

Worker placement has never looked so good. Nor has it ever taken up this much table and shelf space. The box is huge and it's absolutely packed with gorgeous components.

"Anachrony" has a lot going for it. It's a very deep and complex strategy game with an excellent theme and one of my favourite mechanisms, time travel! Fans of Martin Wallace games will instantly recognize the time-travel feature as a debt mechanism.

In fact, "Anachrony" is such a good worker placement I really don't have any complaints about the game itself. It plays very elegantly and probably deserves a higher score than I gave it... that is, if you are capable of overlooking some things I cannot.

Setup is a nightmare, as is take-down. The sheer volume of components that must be sorted into different piles is off-putting enough. Trying to keep them sorted in individual baggies or trays only ensures you're opening 300 of them before every game.

I've already said this game takes up an incredible amount of space. Unnecessarily so. All of the components are needlessly large. If you have the "Exosuit Commander Pack," even the miniatures are huge, and ultimately unnecessary. It's a worker placement game! All you do with these 3 inch tall minis is plug a cardboard token into the top and place it on the action you want to take! That's it! They're so big players are constantly moving them around because they obscure information on the board! The player board themselves are enormous and contain very little useful information and act more as a place to store your workers between placement rounds.

The rulebook is not written very well. It makes the gameplay seem more complicated than it is. It seems more interested in giving you the lore behind the game, and a thematic reason for the mechanisms than a concise instruction in how to play.

But, if you can overlook these things "Anachrony" is a very good worker placement game that any fan of heavier games will enjoy.

This is the second game from Mindclash Games, and it looks to be absolutely amazing. As I mention every time I get a reason and then some, Trickerion is my favourite game. While the designers of Trickerion is only co-designers of Anachrony, their influence is obvious. I love the immense table hog of a game, with separate player boards the size of most regular games' main boards. And I absolutely love the asymmetric player powers.

Update: Well, I think I can comfortably say that this is now my second favourite game, just behind Trickerion. At least I think it's still behind Trickerion. I'm not quite sure… :)

RATING: 9
I cannot rave enough about this game.  Medium complexity, highly thematic, with loads of bits & bobs that make set up and clean up time consuming. Due to the number of pieces, we are constantly referring to the rules to understand what each thing does.  This is partly because there is so much iconography in an attempt to make the game itself language-independent.  As a worker placement game, the expansions included in the base set give additional options for selection, so it never feels like all the "good" choices are gone.  The use of time travel is quite clever and adds significantly to the gameplay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A game that hinges entirely on its theme...although I'm not quite sure what I mean by that yet.
This game is more polished than Trickerion but still slightly clunky in its execution. A bear to teach and learn without knowing some of the backstories of the paths. A terrible rulebook doesn't help either. Inconsistent language throughout and MANY vagaries leave much to be "interpreted" by your group. Constant references to the rulebook to decipher the hieroglyphs will slow the first few plays of this game WAY down.
Gorgeous though and full of theme this games knocks it out of the park. With the asymmetrical starting conditions and several expansions included in the base game or available to purchase separately make this game unbelievably replayable.

Edit: After reading the rules again after our first play and scanning through the forums here on BGG I can honestly say this has to be the worst rulebook I've ever had to struggle through. However, at the end is an amazing game well worth the initial slog.

RATING: 4
Simpler-than-it-looks worker placement game. As the world hurtles towards its predicted destruction, factions struggle to use new time-travel technology and prepare for evacuation. "Time travel" is an amusingly thematic implementation of loans, where players can warp in resources from the future -- but are penalised if they do not build and use a time-machine to send those resources back.

Player strategy is broadly determined by the faction's evacuation goal. After the cataclysm, players can only take the evacuation action if they meet their faction's requirement; meeting an additional goal can earn major victory points. Evacuation can reasonably be expected to account for 20% or more of end-game VP.

The rest of the machinery just provides endless options for spending and gaining resources (~6 kinds) using 4 different kinds of worker. Buildings are unique, each round unveils a "superproject" with game-breaking super powers, and each faction also has a choice of special abilities. Phew.

I hate it.

It's one of those "more options = more fun" games about complexity for its own sake, yet includes significant hidden information to make those decisions harder: breakthrough dice, paradox dice, random resources and worker availability, random building availability, warp tile blind bid...

The numerous expansions add more options rather than what I would have considered more depth or more choice (additional leader cards would have been more welcome, for example, to add variety to existing factions, than yet another module with yet more actions and yet more randomness).

Just about everything players do is worth victory points, so there are different strategies to pursue -- insofar as you can do whatever you want so long as you do it efficiently.

Production is lavish but tasteless, with generally dreadful artwork that contributes to poor graphic design (a bizarre combination of both clutter and wasted space). The super Kickstarter edition also includes exosuit miniatures which, while more functional than the cardboard they replace, are almost all awful sculpts. 

The core of the game is solid but it's an overproduced, overcomplicated mess.

RATING: 7.5
It's heavy, and it's not necessarily all that intuitive, but I found it really interesting.  It's definitely a game where there is a LOT you want to do, but there is only so many actions that you'll have to do it.  I'm not sure how I feel about the theme, but after you get going, it mostly makes sense.  I definitely think there are some rough edges to this game, but it was significantly more interesting than most worker placement games I've played recently.

It is pretty long.  Our game with 4 took about 3 hours with a reasonable-length rules explanation.  I was engaged for the entire time.  For a heavy worker placement, I'd rather play Argent, so I'm not likely to end up with this one, but I thought it was solidly good.

Has a few interesting twists on the normal worker placement. The theme is neat and the idea of getting bonus goods from the future and then paying them later is cool. It does feel a little bit luck based in the paradox rolling (I've heard there is a rule to just give 1 instead of roll) and getting the right stuff to fulfill your goals. Overall it is decent and I'd like to play it again with the special board sides to add more diversity between players.

tl;dr: solid euro, could have been cleaner

The first game from these designers and company, [thing=163068][/thing] was a very solid euro. This game is a very solid euro.
It took almost an hour to explain everything. Granted, no one had played it, and explaining a game you have already played is way more efficient. But still, that's a lot of explaining for what is basically a resource collection, engine building euro. But as soon as you start playing everything falls into place nicely.
The game comes in a huge (Scythe size) box, and it's full of cardboard. You can shelve out another $40 to add custom plastic resources and sculpted plastic playing pieces for each player. Those are really nice. Way nicer than the cardboard bits they replace. But $40 just to pimp your game? I would never pay for that. I'd rather have had wooden bits for the playing pieces. Cheaper and nicer than cardboard. OK, granted, that box also adds small expansions, but I didn't feel those add much to the game.
But how does it play? Each round you need to make a choice as to how many exosuits you're going to use that round. This impacts your resources and stuff. It also impacts how many actions you can perform on the main board. You also have to manage your regular workers well so that you have enough of the right types, as some types are better at some things and some are even unable to perform certain actions.
Building buildings helps you be more efficient but can be very expensive. It also brings you points. I build a lot of them and some of them I built simply because they where a good amount of points.
In the end I really quite enjoyed playing this. After a long explanation the game did only take about 2 hours. That didn't feel too long. It also gives you lots of hard decisions that do have a meaningful impact on the outcome. So yeah, good level of strategy.
Oh yeah, did I mention this game has a time travel element? Don't expect too much of that, that is mainly just a theme thing.

Pretty much liked it, but maybe too complex to live. A totally over-produced KS, but maybe it might lose some of its charm in just cardboard. Pretty much too much of everything: types of workers, types of commodities, types of actions--plus individual special powers.

It might take more time than it's worth to figure out the min-max on it.

RATING: 7
Somewhat unsure after first play. Theme is a bit meh, even if I like postapacalyptic stuff. Gameplay is very hard for me to pin down at the moment: OTOH there are lots of options and (imagined?) freedom of choice. But the flipside is, that the game seems a bit all over the place and there is a lack of focus. Coulkd go up or down with repeated plays.

2/22/2017: Played it for the first time with a total of 3 players. We were able to finish it within 2.5 hours, not as bad as I thought it would be. 

The first impression of the game is that the game feels very constricted in a sense that the player may not have enough workers/action places to do what we need to do at the beginning of the game, and in the end, we are running out of resources to do the actions. 

I am definitely want to get a few more plays out of the game to get a final verdict on whether I like this game or not. The first play for me is to understand the inter-correlation of elements in the game. The next step is to maximize each of the path ability which is different for each path.

I'm a bit tired of worker placement games, but Anachrony was a refreshing addition to the genre.  It uses a great time travel mechanic where you can send resources from the future back to the present.  But then you need to later pay those resources or else cause anomalies in time.  Very cool theme, although I wish it was emphasized a bit more.

Besides the time travel mechanic, Anachrony is just a solid game.  The rules aren't terribly complicated, but decisions are interesting.  The components are also quite pleasing, especially if you have the upgraded mech suits.  I thoroughly enjoyed this and look forward to playing more.

Another busy picture where you gather A, transform it into B and then score C. Sorry but I've seen too many games of this type to be intrigued by the nice miniatures. The time travel mechanism is somewhat original but I don't think the game would change much if you left it out.

This is a game that will likely grow on me if I have more chances to play it.  It's a little bewildering at first, and I don't think the unique and elaborate theme comes through in the mechanics very strongly, but I believe there is potential here for those who want to dive in deeper.

For heavy worker placement games, I prefer Argent: The Consortium.

RATING: 6.5
This is a pretty straight-forward worker-placement game that, surprisingly enough, is on the very heavy and brainburny side of the scope. Overall, it overstayed its welcome immensely. Feld would approve of its "point-saladery", which I tend to grow tired of. Nevertheless, I had a good time wrapping my head around this. I just wouldn't say this is one the best games in its category.

This is a design team to keep an eye on, especially since Anachrony is an even better worker placement game than Trickerion. Some of its individual elements aren't as meaningful as they might have been, but that's a small quibble in a game that permits such breadth to how you approach the coming asteroid apocalypse. Slick stuff.

RATING: 9.25
Anachrony takes worker placement, which was a dull concept in my mind for a time, and makes it lively and thematic.  Having the Exosuit Commander pack also brings some of the coolest minis I've ever seen into play, which adds three-dimensionality to the game and makes the theme even stronger.  Having variable player powers depending on the path you choose, different choices of buildings and superprojects each game, a freaking awesome time travel/anomaly system, and workers with variable powers and a tired/ready system make Anachrony a brain burner. That said, it drips with the richness of all the systems interacting and the theme of post-apocalyptic time traveling races of humans competing to convince the world to join their paths.  

Pros:
- Post-apocalyptic theme shines
- Beautiful game components (get the Exosuits!!)
- Game mechanics work together beautifully
- Variable player powers/building offerings different every game, very high replayability
- A ton of modules to keep the game fresh
- An excellent A.I. opponent for single player games 

Cons:
- So many components make setup/breakdown time long
- Significant cost of base game + Exosuit Commander pack
- Amount of table space required can mean players can't reach all the resources they need at times
- The game boards warp, but this can be fixed by stacking books on them to restore flat shape

Overall: 9.25/10 Fantastic game!

Nothing has shaken my confidence in bgg ratings (esp for kickstarters) more than this game.

Anachrony is time travel worker placement game. It's by three designers, two of whom made Trickerion, which immediately put it on my radar. The learning game was fairly complicated as there were a lot of icons and symbols to figure out and lots of questions that came up in our learning game.

Players have workers that can be used on their player boards or on the main board. There are several types of workers, each of which may have bonuses for doing some actions and restrictions from doing other actions. In order to play workers on the main board you have to power a mech suit for them to survive the hostile environment outside their home board. But which worker will use the suit isn't determined until later. It can even be used by workers you acquire during the round. Deciding how many suits to power happens at the beginning of the round. How much water you get is dependent on how many suits you power.

Workers are generally tired after being used and will return to your player board asleep at the end of the round. You have an option to force asleep workers to wake up, but it hurts your morale. You can also spend water to wake them which improves your morale, but makes them need more water the next time you wake them. Some actions and some buildings won't tire particular types of workers.

The actions on the main board mostly relate to resource gathering and building stuff. There's an unusual mechanism where you can borrow things from your future self. At the beginning of a round, everyone secretly decides what, if anything, to request, which they then get. The request token is placed next to the current time zone. In subsequent rounds you can travel back to the time zone where that item was requested and pay that thing to remove the token (thus giving it to yourself in the past). But each round the player with the most request tokens in each time zone has to roll a die to see if they accumulate time anomalies. If they get too many, a paradox occurs and they get penalized with a tile that fills up their building slots and gives them negative points (which can be removed but is painful to do). The plus side of a paradox is that it resets your anomalies and allows you to cancel out one request token from the past.

In the fifth round, an asteroid crashes into the world (which you knew was going to happen from your future self). Starting at the point, all the action spots on the player board start "collapsing". Essentially, all those spots become a one-time use spot, but also give a one-time bonus. Once all nine spots are taken, the game ends. Before the game ends, players will want to evacuate. Each player has a different evacuation goal which they must meet to evacuate (and which gives them points). Additionally, they have a second goal which they can score if they evacuate which gives them points as well. The last player to evacuate (where last means the Xth player in an X player game even though only X-1 may actually choose to evacuate) gets a penalty.

There are a set of goal cards for each game that give points for the player who best did X in that game. There are something like six or seven of those. At game end, you get any points you scored during the game, points for how often you time traveled, points for how well you managed your morale, points for the game goal cards, points for your evcauation goals, and points for the buildings you built.

I really liked this game. There was a pretty big hurdle at the beginning as I struggled to understand all the fine points of the iconography and the rules, but once I got the game it was a lot of fun. There was a decent bit to think about in this game.

Anachrony is a very good worker placement type euro. The game is dripping with an engaging and unique theme that directly impacts the mechanics and goes so far as to tell a story. The game mechanics are rich while being simple at their core with a few innovations that makes it really stand out (time travel, mechs maximum number, etc). 
Also with the variety of content in the box, the game offers a great replayability. 
Solo wise the game really shines as it remains simple while being effective and challenging enough, providing you with a bot which will score at the end of the game like in Lisboa. 
In short, good job to David Turczi for the outstanding job!

There are a lot of pieces so you need a good plan for storage or each new game is going to be too much upkeep...But Anachrony is a great game...currently my #1. What's to like? For me:

1. Great Theme
2. Interesting game play with factions and leaders that all feel different even though general play is similar. Also some good Varients to play (including solo play).
3. While there is a ton going on and it takes a while to pick up on everything, for a "heavy" game it feels somewhat intuitive...and while I love games I have not played enough worker placement/euros that these mechanics should just be natural.
4. I never know who is winning until the end...and I love every minute of the game play.

The cons:
1. It takes a lot of space to play (But that is getting more and more common in Boardgaming)
2. The pieces will overwhelm you if you don't keep them organized.

Having played it...for me it is a must have. Hope to enjoy it for many years to come.

I am really impressed by this game. I have to admit that I backed it on KS based mostly on theme and production value. After one game I could tell how truly fun and innovative the time travel mechanics were. It really felt like fantastic themeing around the troubles of messing with the time continuum - which is actually completely optional in this game, but can be a huge advantage.

The downside is, if you don't patch the holes in the timeline that you make, you create paradoxes and anomalies that lead to a loss of lives or impact your final score if they are not resolved. For somebody who plays a ton of worker placement games, this is the first one I've played in a while that felt so fresh. It's a priority to get it back to the table, despite me absolutely getting crushed in my first play.

Mindclash games are kings of overcomplication. This is possible an amazing game!, if it were the only game you could ever have. It ticks a lot of boxes and has many many gorgeous bits. But it's too big and hard to setup/teach for what boils down to a simple worker placement game. 
It's main "cool" mechanism of time travel where you can take anything you want at the beginning of a turn by asking yourself to send it back in time to you is great in concept. You just have to be sure to produce whatever it is you asked for in the future to avoid the backlash of paradox. EXCEPT things are so hard to produce and paradox is so bad you don't want to take advantage of this unless you really really need to. THE PROBLEM, you have to be able to think through your entire turn and your opponents to know what you'll need. Only the very patient / AP prone could/would want to do that. Therefore we quickly decided not to ever do that, it wasn't worth the potential paradox for an item you weren't sure you'd need. And without the timetravel the game lost it's specialness. :(
Ultimately, I decided to sell, because it was never gonna see the table enough to pay for itself. In a world where I'm spoiled by game choices we never "had time" or wanted to make time to slog though the setup/rules of this over other known favorites.

Yet another worker placement game, this time with "time-travel" which is actually just a "loans" mechanism, and (optional) huge exosuit commander miniatures as player colour tokens.

Solid worker placement game with lots of decisions. Everything from variable powers to the excellent minis set this game apart from others "like it". A lot of moving parts and things to take into consideration so the learning curve is rather steep. Once you get going it's pretty easy to play and feels incredibly smooth. Many paths to victory make it fun after many plays. The components and art are great as is the theme. And it's dripping with theme. Can be brutal for newer gamers. Plays better with 3 than with 4.

Fine worker placement game, but nothing really out of the ordinary.
The much hyped "grab a resource now by claiming it came from the future, and then make later on that you do send it to yourself in the past" mechanic, which is how many people were sold on the game, boils down to a loan. "You need something now? Sure, but you'll have to pay it back later." So what's so revolutionary about it?
It's ultimately an overproduced collection of things we have seen elsewhere for the most part. (But hey, overproduction is the name of the game if you go the Kickstarter route.)

Absolutely love this game. Almost didn't buy it as I'd heard it was hard to learn but so glad I did. The rule book is very thorough and after one read through, everything made perfect sense. Bought at retail (without the exosuit pack) and there is tonnes to do in the base game with variable player powers and paths to choose from adding to replay value. Forward planning and resource management are essential and the thematic stuff like discovering time travel and a pending cataclysm appealed to my taste and did not disappoint. Despite this being my favourite game right now, I don't plan to get the exosuit minis as I love it just fine without them :)

This game is a lot to take in at first but gets very manageable after a couple plays. The time travel mechanic is almost just a loan gimmick but allows you to get things you may not have been able to otherwise and is essential to playing the Cult faction. The factions play drastically different from each other which is really cool and well done. We can play 3-4 player games in just around 90 minutes which is pretty good given the weight.

[b]base game[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] Great first impression from the base game. Even with a very rough first play with a very, very distracted set of opponents, by the end, we'd all had a good time, and numerous discussions on temporal paradoxes came up, which is always fun. The rules provide plenty of trade-off decisions to make within a fairly simple framework. That is always a good thing. Looking forward to plays with the expansions, and without teaching it to distract-o-matic opponents. :D

Continuing impressions: Much happiness….

[i][b]Alternate Timeline variant[/b][/i] [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] This adds nice additional variety and suspense for timing of when you beg your future self for things, but it only impacts the game proportional to how cavalier the players are willing to be with causing temporal paradoxes. If you're a bunch of preservationists, you'll hardly feel the difference. It adds negligible complexity but a bit of variety, so it's nice, but I certainly wouldn't fight someone who didn't want to use this variant.

[i][b]Starting Asset Draft variant[/b][/i] — It should grant more control once all participants have played enough to want to fine-tune their starting resources, albeit at the mercy of the draft options….

[i][b]Endgame Condition Draft variant[/b][/i] [b][bgcolor=#ff66cc] 4 [/bgcolor][/b] Fine way to accommodate pickier players, but for me, it just slows down the game start unnecessarily. Having a tiny say in the otherwise random pool of goals doesn't excite me much. Straight random is good enough. (Funny, because the same thing as a production mechanism each turn of Automobile is great!)

[b]Chronobot[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] This is a really good AI system. As long as you have a reference to make it really easy to remember what Chronobot does for his actions (some of it is decently represented on its board in iconography, but not enough to get you going), it's a great fun to play this way. Like a real opponent, you can see likely "choices" Chronobot will make, but still can get surprised. Chronobot has subroutines with loops, which help maintain the bot's parallel concerns. Sadly, the AI does nothing with any of the expansions; it is explicitly incompatible with Pioneers of New Earth (and I can see reasons why), and has no interaction with Guardians of the Council and Doomsday; however, those two seem self-balancing, so it hasn't proved problematic to use those with the Chronobot.

[b]Doomsday[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] I am charmed with the ability to save the planet — or seal its fate earlier. The tug-of-war (or one-way pull — that difference alone makes things interesting) alters when the asteroid impact occurs, and if it even occurs at all! Because it only alters the timeline, so to speak, it doesn't imbalance the game for there to be a lopsided tug-of-war for the fate of the planet; it just affects the strategies you pursue as the world spins into or out of control. In short, I feel like this adds a lot of variety to the game. It's a shame that it's not recommended for combining with Pioneers of New Earth, but I will have to try the combo myself, because that less predictable asteroid hit is much more interesting.

Neat worker placement. Might rise in rating after I actually play with people instead of just the solo bot (while getting rules wrong).

Have always had very tight games. Very thematic- feels like I'm hopping in a time machine each time. I love the intricacies and variability the game has to offer.  What more could you want?

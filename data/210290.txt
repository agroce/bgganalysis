As someone who has never watched a full episode of Buffy and who doesn't enjoy deckbuilding very much, I am so far from the target demographic for this game that you might want to disregard my rating.  The deckbuilding element of this game felt pretty stale, with its opening hands of low value purchasing and attack cards, the wounds that clutter your deck and reduce effectiveness and various cards for purchase that work best in combination.  The constant stream of villains and a big bad at least give the deckbuilding a thematic point, even though it's all ultimately about grabbing victory points.  

My main criticism is of the lack of interesting decisions - you kill the highest value villain you can and then purchase from a  market of just six cards, which could include duplicates and very often cards you can't afford.   In the four player game I played downtime was also a significant issue.  There is little you can do to plan for your next turn while you wait since villains, the market and sometimes even your hand of cards will change during other players' turns.

The artwork is mostly stills from the tv series, which is OK. Card text is small, so there's a fair bit of picking up cards to find out what they do.

I'm obsessed with BTVS and love Legendary as a real easy game to get into and teach (especially if somebody has a base knowledge of Dominion). This would've gotten higher if it wasn't an Encounters game.. Thing there would've just been soooo much more content to work with (7 seasons worth of plot!!)... But I'll take it. Just disappointing. Cards works well, like the addition of courage tokens as either recruit or attack. The dark and light track adds a little something extra and the cards and characters reflect and are true to their show personalities.
Also wish flavour text could've been on these cards because the dialogue for this show is iconic! A lot of wasted chances to have made this game great from a BTVS fan perspective but still super fun.
Lastly, I don't mind the screen grabs as much... But some just aren't that great for sure.

Played it twice, loved it, want to get back to it but I promised myself I'd learn Secrets of the Lost Tomb before any more time went by.

Watching my Buffy DVDs and refreshing my acquaintance with the story and all the characters. Such a great show.

First, Upper Deck did not follow their usual sorting process for Legendary.  Everything is grouped together so you do not have to do the usual pre sort before you play mode.  The light and dark balance is an interesting mechanic, though it does seem weird that a of Angel cards have light kickers.
If there is any real issue with the game, it's with the lack of proof reading.  On the game mat, "cemetery" is misspelled.

This version has the light and dark meter that also triggers card abilities. It seems the cards don't trigger off each other as much as the other legendary games but makes up a little with the light meter. Seen a little lighter then the Aliens Legendary Encounters but that isn't a bad thing. This is a good deck builder with a theme that I really like.

My first experience of this system without the 'Encounters' aspect and I think it's a good fit. Enjoyed my first play. 

Second play was also very enjoyable - I hope this sees at least one chunky expansion as there is a lot of material that could be mined.

I'm very ambivalent. I like the theme, but I continually find the "sort of cooperative" nature of Legendary to be very unsatisfying. Counting up scores is the last thing you do, so I always leave the table feeling bad, even if I win. But, but, Buffy!

Haven’t played any previous legendary games so I can’t comment on it being better or worse.  Nevertheless it’s a fun little deck builder and the light/dark track works great.  The box is about 3x larger than it needs to be since expansions are highly unlikely

I got to play this at GenCon and have to say, they haven't yet released a set that can top Legendary Encounters: Aliens. The legendary marvel games are okay, but the others have been very lackluster in my opinion. While the Buffy theme definitely fits Legendary better than Big Trouble in Little China did, the game is just not very fun to play in this system, and the artwork is an ... odd mix of drawings and live action pictures.

My only issue is that the Courage tokens seem to make the game a little easy. Maybe future expansions, combinations, and so on can mitigate this.

Your appreciation of this game will be based largely on your attachment to the TV series, serious fans will find a lot to like here... me not as much. Utilising the classic Legendary system makes this an obviously enjoyable game, however the Light/Dark mechanic it tries to add does little to nothing and can lean towards overly complicated at times. It's also worth noting that it uses screenshots from the series rather than original artwork... for better or worse.

I may be a bit biased since Buffy is one of my favorite shows, but this is my favorite Legendary game to date. Aliens is my favorite of the Encounters series, but this game blows Marvel and Big Trouble in Little China away for me. It just feels like it accomplishes two things that past Legendary games struggled with: A very nice balance when it comes to difficulty, and consistently thematic abilities on cards.

I really thought the light and dark track would be kind of a gimmick, but it actually works quite well. On top of that, every character specializes in something. It's not just a case of coming up with cool abilities and applying them to cards haphazardly. Giles is all about utilizing Watcher Cards, Willow has really powerful abilities, but they usually require sacrifice, and Spike has different abilities depending on where the marker on the light and dark track is located. Hell, even Dawn, a bystander, steals from other players when you rescue her. It's a little odd that Buffybot and the First Slayer are playable characters, but this is a minor nitpick in an otherwise great game. I probably would have preferred they used Maggie Walsh and Kennedy, but no matter.

Along with that, the balance between easy and difficult feels spot on. I've played 3 games so far, and they all came down to the wire. I also like that the Masterminds in this game are fairly easy to hit, but their abilities can be pretty brutal. It's a little odd that Adam is nowhere to be seen, considering he was a Big Bad for a season, but then again he was probably the most forgettable one.

I really don't have any major complaints, other than those inherent to Legendary as a system such as the possibility of too many scheme twists at once and things like that. This is just a fantastic game, and easily the best one on the market to carry the Buffy name.

Lauraine loves the Marvel series and so we have been collecting but not really playing.  Stephen has the Alien version, which was ok but didn’t grab me at the time. It wasn’t until Firefly came out that i can say i enjoyed a game and wanted to play again.  It goes to show that theme is important to me, despite what i tell myself and the collection of euro games.
Played a couple of times. As a solo game its quick, easy to setup/take down and with the introduction of a dark / light track, makes for some interesting choices.  Until then, I’ve felt that these type of games tend to play you.
Score of 32 soloing using the base rules.
4 games in and this is still an 8 for me.  Playing solo so far and enjoying taking on the intro big bad but starting to look forward to some randomised mayhem.

It might just be that this becomes one of my go to solo games.  Its quick(ish), a bit of a puzzle, doesn’t feel like the winners been decided during setup and that my choices matter.  Most importantly, i don’t need to refer constantly to a manual or rules guide and can have some meaningful decisions as part of gameplay to make.

First random setup game tonight (22/11/17).
The big bad was Angelus fighting against Riley, Xander & Tara, rolling dice to select both.  The different way the plot twist works , made the whole day / night track less important for staying alive. Using the additional courage tokens to bring the smack down on Angelus swung it.

Upper Deck has undertaken a special recruitment effort to [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/article/26839236#26839236]hire illiterates[/url]. (Harbringers? Cemetary?) Since the Legendary series is a top 10 for me, I hope their latest effort outshines their employment practices.

Ah, it's OK. The light/dark tracks adds more randomness  than anything else.

Would have been better as an Encounters entry: fully co-op with dramatic scenario effects.

I was very impressed with this.  The best aspect of this Buffy version is that it meshes well with the Marvel version.  I cannot wait to team up my favorite Buffy characters with the X-men.

The light and dark track definitely adds another layer of strategy to how you build your deck and I think that adds to the game a lot.  It ups the stategy and makes the big bad feel less like a pylon you occasionally beat up and more of an actual threat during the dark.

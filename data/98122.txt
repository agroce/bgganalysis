A quick dexterity game for pairs.  Okay but not as exciting as I want it to be since the theme is entirely overshadowed by the GET IT FROM A TO B AS FAST AS YOU CAN gameplay.

Played with adults or children, always an absolutely tense, hilarious time.  Love this one!  First few times playing, house ruled nearly everything because I don't read German -- but with the pieces and the mechanics, it was easy to come up with fun variations.  Had an awesome time -- and with the actual rules, it is just as fun and even better for the co-operative part!

Rated as a child's game, but still makes a really good game, full of fun, for adults.  Great idea to use your hands-skill to move a piece through a labyrinth.  I can only worry about any piece breaking, that would make the game useless...

It ain’t easy to review a children’s game from a grown-up’s standpoint and it’s even less easy when it’s Monsterfalle, because this game looks quite shallow to a grown-up but is a sure hit among kids.

When I tried Monsterfalle indeed I got bored the second time I had to move the monster with my sticks: then I turned my head and saw what a good time all the kids around were having by playing Monsterfalle non-stop on the other tables.

This means only one thing: it’s a game they like. And since we (or at least I) don’t understand it, we’d better try to rate it by a kid’s standard.

+ Team-game, which is good for kids, since it mitigates differences in skill.
+ Dexterity-game, which requires some small planning.
+ Monsters. Kids love monsters.

RATING: 7
Wonderful kid game with a cooperative dexterity element.  Yes, there is a lot of luck of the draw, and yes you need to get really really lucky to get more than two a turn given the time constraints, ensuring all scores are pretty close.  But the activity is fun enough to make up for these shortcomings.

2017-07-30 : played with simplified rules : 2 vs 2, using the timer, but no restarts if the bagged monster falls over. It was fun to see how absorbed both kids got with this game - not even noticing I manipulated the timer a bit to give the younger one some extra time. I also wasn't expecting it but they actually invented a rule on the spot : that you needed all 12 monsters in order to win. Instant classic. I can see this working with adults that had some beverages as well - full enforcing all rules in that case of course

"As I looked through my list of favorite games to identify which of them were pickup-and-deliver games, I realized that, although I hadn't thought of it as such, Monster Trap is clearly a pickup-and-deliver game. It is a team dexterity game (a category without many members, though it includes Packen Wir's!, which is also clearly also a pickup-and-deliver game, even if I didn't like it as much as I like Monster Trap.)"

I like the game. You can play with a kid without letting him win as you can modulate difficulty with optionnal rooms to vists. I like the team variant too ^_^

Nicely done game. One of the rare co-op games which works. Still, offers nothing for the adults... at least after 5-10 games. But it's a children game and I've seen how much young enough children likes it, so I guess that's the most important thing.

I wish there were more than 12 monsters somehow. It seems like the same ones come up regularly. Shuffle well! :) Sliders can be tricky to use. If game were weighted down somehow, so it didn't slip and slide on table, it might be easier to use the sliders. 6 year old enjoyed.

[Children's Game] Too easy for anyone who has ever played any rod hockey but the frantic pace makes it quite hilarious nonetheless. I bet the gimmick works wonders with small kids (with the necessary motor skills) but the scoring is strangely complex for a children's game.

Very nice representation.

Wow! Que jogo, que produção, que arte, que animação... Mecânicas deliciosas, num jogo que todo ele é um mimo, que deveria ter sido KinderSpiel des Jahres, não ter sido é um insulto! Ideal para a pequenada, serve muito bem para gente grande, uma versão gigante então seria um deleite. Adoro!

RATING: 7.5
A Winsome-esque game from Knizia's back catalogue. Very much enjoyed my first play of this one. I've been longing for a group to persist with Chicago Express until the incentives and alliances become more apparent. But this will have to do for now! 

The impact of your actions on everyone's bottom line seemed clearer in this game, and the resulting tensions gave the feel I was hoping for from CE. Tons of layers and opportunities to be sneaky. A bit longer than CE, but not much! - 75 mins for a 4p game with two newcomers. 

A bit sad I missed the Kickstarter for the Grail Games version now; I'll just have to push Chicago Express instead ;)

RATING: 10
This is a unique game. The game has a dynamic and logic of its own. Needless to say, it is one of my favourites. In our gaming group we really get into some rollocking action playing this.

I think Stephenson's Rocket is seriously underrated. Compared to many other german games this is really fulfilled and satsifying. Two thumbs up! It is one of the best games around.

how do you play this? seems like you are forced to invest heavily in one company and stick with it no matter what.

Chicago Express is a much simpler and smoother implementation of the rail baron idea.

RATING: 6
I love the idea of the game but hate it in practice, your hand is often forced too easily and good play encourages you to just reverse what the last person did on their turn, this sort of back and forth irritates me in games. Then the winner is the person who had his plans least interferred with, most likely a newbie because they weren't perceived as a threat.

Knizia's train game.  Lighter then Age of Steam, but a different game also.  Multiple ways to score each one varying in importance depending on what the other players are doing.  Recommended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
For a Knizia game this one is a little fidigity.  The scoring almost requires a calulator at times.  The first time through the game we didn't understand the game itself and it turned into a very nasty game at the end (which we weren't looking for).

It didn't go over so well, but I'm willing to play it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The story goes that Knizia was challenged to produce a railway game by 18xx enthusiasts among his playtesters.  The end result is more like Acquire than 1830.  Typical Knizia touches are multiple ways to score and always needing to do more on your turn than the rules allow.  A fine design...and yet one that doesn't come to the table often.

RATING: 5
After 1 play. Knizia really knows how to get his plate spinning monkeys in a sweat, but the balancing act required is taken a step too far for my liking in this game.
The trademark ratio of multiple scoring options vs limited actions felt so skewed that I had no sense of gradual development at all, which is fine for some games, but not what I felt I wanted from a rail game. I was either engaging in purely reactive play, or having the feeling that any move made with an eye on the long-term could be a complete waste. SR has a shortish play time so I may try it again with adjusted expectations.

RATING: 6.5
First play, 4-handed. For the first 3/4 of the game, I was trying desperately just to understand how it works. As (some) understanding came, I started enjoying myself more until now, two hours later, I'm dead-tired an anxious to play it again!
This rating is likely to rise.

The Best Knizia game I’ve played by far! With multiple ways to score, far reaching decisions to make every turn and no luck this game just hit all the right notes for me. It seems like you are constantly giving away current power and influence for potential and short term profit.  This game could go top 5 for me if it holds up to repeated play and the depth it seems to have is really there.

RATING: 6
Multiple layers of majority control create a somewhat unintuitive gaming experience. The unintuitiveness is certainly turn-off during initial plays but repeated play reveals a lot of depth to the game. Controlling train movement via stock ownership is very important and should not be overlooked by new players. While I appreciate the novelty of the veto power given to stock owners, I'm not fond of the gaming experiences it imbues to the game. It personally makes me whiny, vindictive SOB which is not exactly a desired outcome when I choose to play a game.

Egy játéknál nagyon fontos, hogy mikor játssza az ember. Ezt én fáradtan játszottam, utolsó játékként. Szeretem a Knizia játékokat, de ennek nem kaptam el a fonalát. Nem voltam túl jó bakter, csak szedegettem fel a termékeket, de azt is többnyire bután csináltam:) Ez az egysíkú stratégia (nagyképűség is annak nevezni) fele annyi pénzt hozott, mint az összeszedettebb ellenfeleimé:) Jár még egy esély a játéknak, kizárt, hogy másodszorra is ennyire kevésre értékelem majd.

Még annyit, hogy nagyon emlékeztetett engem a cégek összeolvadási mechanizmusa az acquire-re!

I won't disagree that it is one of Knizia's good tries. For its time it should have been a top game. It is balanced and it does not suffer from pointless back and forth takeovers.

However in this genre there exist nowadays similar but better games, like Chicago Express(stock holding), or Steam (network building) that make this game obsolete.

It was untill the very end that I understood the mechanism of the game. So this game need some more plays tho rise the score.

I dislike most Knizia games.  This is the one exception - while not too much of an original design (rather Acquire-esque play), the game has a great feel to it, and a lot of chances for good manipulation.

It definitely is an improvement upon Acquire, and I am enjoying it more with each play.

Trains, hexagons, track tiles, stations and stocks. Sign'o the times for sure. I never played it until recently and I expected it to be dull. But it wasn't at all! There's a majority race on several fronts (stocks, connected stations and various goods) and since you can do only two actions per turn there's constant presure. Then there is the fact that train companies merge as soon as their tracks connect. Timing and player gauging is essential to do great in this game and since all information is open and the lack of a luck factor, it means the players make the game.

After one play it's hard to say whether the possible strategies are balanced, but it was nice to have played one of the train classics.

RATING: 7.2
A Knizia classic, but not as good as Tigris & Euphrates. I like the rail theme. There are lots of variables to juggle with this games which makes it very complex. Also on the practical side, the money bills are way too thin and big for my style. Another downside is the complex endscore determination.

Nice game.

Seems to really be an abstract game with a train theme.

There is no stock market to dink with so it is all about selecting lines to run, choosing when to join them to stations, or cities, or other lines.

Do you want to run a big line into a little line or Vice versa..?


I need to play more in order to understand how to agressively plan for money.  At game end you need to figure out how to have a majority of the biggest line.

FINALLY, a Knizia design that didn't leave us saying "meh," or propel us far away from the table, screaming and gibbering.  This is one game I'd been searching for, a semi-grail, but it has long been out of print.  I finally had the chance to trade our much-reviled copy of Space Alert for the RGG version of this, and it was a done deal.

This is a very good train game for 2.  Yes, the theme is more or less pasted on, so if you don't care for train games (or even if you do), think of this as Aquire with a spatial aspect that actually adds to the game.  If you've played Acquire, you can pick this up quickly - it's all about building up chains (er, rail lines) and then merging them together to build/destroy value.  What makes it heads and tails better than Acquire is that it replaces the random, perfunctory building element in that game with a spatial, strategic system that has no luck and adds much depth.  We haven't played this many times, but so far it is one of those games where strategies aren't obvious, or, if they are, the tactics that will develop said strategies certainly aren't (or can shift from game to game).  This one is a real winner, even for non-rail fans.

This is a game I just didn't get but it has slowly growing on me for a long while now.  I think I've finally grasped it.  We'll see. ... nope; I still haven't grasped it - though maybe partly, as that's a couple of back to back wins - albeit a few years apart. It's probably now on a par with Tigris & Euphrates - in that I can muddle along, but the longer term consequences of each turn's actions are a bit of a mystery. Those consequences remains tantalisingly furth of my comprehension.

RATING: 7
Very nice little game that is just on the cusp of getting good repeat play, but doesn't quite. Still, merited 8-10 plays when it first came out, which is quite good by any measure. Unfortunaetly, repeat play seems to have been killed by the weakness of the goods disks; it doesn't appear that there is any reasonable strategy that involves ever taking one. This sort of imbalance (almost unheard of in a Knizia!) makes learning the game hard, means experience matters more than skill, and amplifies experience differences - all traits very undesireable in a euro.

A nice game, but it's no competition for more recent Knizias like Amun-Re, Tower of Babel, or Beowulf.

Fun stuff going on in this one.  Another good game that is enhanced by the 'too many things I want to do on my turn' syndrome.  Has some definate 'Bash the leader' potential, but I don't mind that.  This game would be nothing without the ability to Veto train directions.  --Update.  Dropped a point.  After a good bit of playing, the vetoes stop and game boils down to a 'looking for oppurtunities' game and not so much of a 'long term strategy' game, which I think it masquerades at first glance.  I respect the system - but I don't think its any fun.

I went in expecting auctionless shareholding with a network value backbone. Maybe something similar to Clippers. What I got was a heavy-duty multi-dimensional area majority game, shot through with very interesting parasitic tactical plays generated off of the set-value asymetries. In fact, the shares do not represent fractional ownership at all. They are merely another dimension to the set collection (with a tasty control mechanism that requires you to use shares to attack or defend directional decisions). Alliances emerge for mere moments in order to take advantage of attractors, then disappear as soon as the connection is made. The original expectation of Clippers similarities was not entirely off, though. Neither game allows for branching (American-Samoa aside) so aggressively managing direction is critical to both games. Overall a very interesting experience, but I wonder if the deltas become a little too obvious, the right-left binding a little too constraining on future plays. But I do hope there will be future plays.

RATING: 8.5
Stephenson's Rocket is a rather counter-intuitive perfect information Acquire derivative that is built atop three fields of area majority systems (shares, stations and tokens). Playing well is very much a confrontational balancing act of those three areas and in making your opponents constantly play extra for their tenuous balances via vetos.  This is what Acquire and Union Pacific should have been all along.  A far better game than those weary familiars.  Essentially an area influence games with areas defined by the slime trails of the snail-like trains.  The value of an area is defined by how many things it touches and the ownership of a slime trail is two-dimensional (shares and stations).

Note: Shares and stations are effectively the same and offer the same actual value.  Stations are merely harder to get but offer more frequent payouts, shares are easier to get and pay out less often.

There's more here that meets the eye.  I'm not sure yet how much more, but there is clearly subtlety and several layers of time-complex interrelated trade-offs at work.  Quite a solid game with reasonable depth and some delightfully tentative shifting alliances.

Update: One of the keys of Stephenson's Rocket is its dynamic volatility. It is a temporary emergent incentives game ala Wabash Cannonball. It is also a bludgeoning exploitation and leverage game ala German Railways. And it is a simple minimal pluralities game akin to König von Siam. And best of all, every decision and point in the game is some mix of those three in tenuous volatile balance, prone to flying off on a tear in any of the three directions as the players desperately attempt to pull it to their favour.

This game is a diabolical mix of simplicity and complexity. The action choices are simple, the scoring is difficult. Mergers have frightening high impact, cascading as the lines grow, and give the game's mid to end game increasing drama. The auctions with veto give the tactics and strategy extra dimension--plus, the auction feels original, since the active player has more power (able to equal other player's bid strength, while they have to surpass other bids). It's satisfying to put down the attractive wooden pieces and cardboard tiles. The board's slightly drab, period-feeling watercolor decor seems more and more pleasant to me. I really like this challenging, intriguing game. The theme works for me--this is my favorite train game (though I haven't played that many).  I like the feel of the stock baronage, the mechanics that push the companies toward oligopolies. Two player game goes fast. Too much bean-counting as a player style would drive me away from the game pretty quick - I like this game a lot with intuitive play.

RATING: 6
This is one that I got based on strong recommendations from geek buddies, but apparently we all have found it difficult to find the right group to play it with.  

The mechanisms in the game are very simple and opaque, which is usually the markings of a great game.  What sets this game apart, and which is criminally under-utilized in our games, is the incredible veto mechanic.  It creates some weird cross-investment incentives and adds just the right amount of brinkmanship to make an otherwise dry game interesting.

However, the scoring is just too fiddly to overcome one really innovative mechanism.  Couple that with some a lot of fiddly cash handling, and it feels like the game bogs down a little in the upkeep.  I KNOW there is an interesting space to explore here, but the hurdles have made it too hard to convince others to go on the journey with me.

Great majorities train route game with a lot of aggression. The game is simple in principle, but the rulebook is ambiguous in places. Mostly tactical in nature, at least at first glance. Requires multiple plays to open up to players. Recommended.

This game is very cut-throat. I have a hard time keeping track of all the ways people can score...and I certainly can't manage a very reliable rough estimate of who is ahead at any given point. 

The thing that makes this game special is the mechanic for being able to veto a placement of a track, at the cost of your shares. Very neat dilemma that presents.

A lot of interesting things going on in this gamer friendly Knizia title. As per usual, there are several interlocking systems and ways to go about things, and it is difficult to do well in more than one area at a time. For instance, collecting city chits: they can provide a boost of income when engines reach the town, as well as add to your final score. Stations are hypothetically very valuable, but it is possible for the opposition to obstruct you from going into rail towns. Stock is also a double edged commodity, you want it to score big points at the end of the game, but you also need it to direct the path of the rails that you're invested in. Very good mixture of systems that should reward replay. Also, zero luck, which appeals to me. Glad to hear it's being reprinted.

Another game that I have only played once (it deserves much more). I was very impressed by the depth of strategy. It was also very cuthroat which I like. Even though I like railroad games I don't think I'm overating it. I really feel it deserves a nine and a half. The reason I have only played a lot of my games once is I have only recently gotten back into the hobby and I have bought about 200 games in the last 2 years so its hard to keep up.

It feels wrong, but this, after only one play, just didn't strike me.  Too much going on at once without any real ideas as to what actions would be to my benefit.  There's a steep learning curve here, and I'm just not used to that with a Knizia design.  I'm a huge fan of the good doctor, but not of this game.

RATING: 8
I first tried this at a game group gathering.  It was love from first play.  I was sad to learn that it was no longer in print.  I found it on Noble Knight but was disappointed when I found it was gone the next day.  Undaunted, I found it on the BGG marketplace, thought about it for a few days, then made my first BGG purchase with the help of a very good seller.

I like the elegance of Stephenson's Rocket.  It seems simple.  Each turn, a player performs 2 actions from a list of 3 possible actions.  However, given the variety of scoring options that occur both in play and at game end, each action is crucial.  

I like that the set up time is minimal.  I like that it has a shorter play time.  The box claims 75 minutes.  This can be increased greatly with new players or if players are prone to AP.

I find the merge mechanism intriguing.  When two rail lines merge, the rail line being moved merges into the dominant line, regardless of the size or strength of each rail line.  The merger is dissolved, shares are traded two for one, and no further shares are issued.  The mergee railway's line now includes all the cities and stations formerly belonging to the merger.  This can result in an abrupt shift in majority shareholders and stations on a line.

Finally, I like the scoring mechanisms.  First place gets the lion's share; second place gets half that, third and fourth get nothing.  Some variance occurs in case of ties, e.g. 2 tie for 1st, sum the money to be earned, each receives half, and no one else receives money.  First place is awarded according to a majority of a certain type.  The type depends on what is being scored.  For instance, in-game scoring when a rail line reaches a good city, majority of city goods tokens; end-of-game scoring for a railway line, majority of shares and again with majority of stations.  This is not a complete list of scoring opportunities.  I have not yet played this enough times to know if there is a "best" strategy, but it seems to me that this variety results in many paths to victory and does not necessarily reward a player who keeps development even or another who attempts to monopolize a particular type of scoring.

After 1 play, I rated this a 7.  After 2, I've upgraded it to an 8.

Reiner Knizia's take on Acquire, just as Union Pacific is Alan Moon's. You might want to play Acquire a few times first before moving to Stephenson's Rocket because it gives you a much better feel of what you need to do. Starting off with SR is really not recommended. Nevertheless, the convoluted scoring and complete absence of any luck whatsoever makes this a tough bugger to teach and play. As a result, it didn't come out anymore, and was eventually sold off.

Production: Attractive map that doesn't interfere with the game play, but helps set the mood.  The tiles are nice quality, as are the commodity tokens.  The stock certificates are boring in design but have distinguishable colors.  The money is poor quality and an awkward size, but it isn't handled very much.  Play: Lots of tough choices.  The scoring and tie-sharing is not yet intuitive to me, and control in a line's stock is so tenuous that I find it very hard to feel invested in any particular line.  But the game is interesting, and I like the decreasing number of options as trains slowly merge.  (3+1+3) (1 play)

I'm not into this game as much as most people. it seems. While it's a decent game, I feel it has a couple of flaws and that there are many better options out there for this type of game; [gameid=1338], [gameid=17133], and [gameid=19995], for instance. But then again, I'm somewhat of an anti-kniziite. ; )

Tentative rating since I've only played it once and I'm still confused. The mechanics are quite simple, but I'm completely lost on strategy. There are multiple ways to score points and the interactions of mergers, station building and city connecting is confusing for a newbie. The good news I definitely want to play it again. I had fun and I want to understand how to win.

Knizia's take on Acquire with trains. A very cool game, but I have a feeling the game system could still do with some fine tuning (Knizia-ing?).  The commodity tokens, for example, seem to be pretty much redundant. However, it is still a very good, brain burning and highly strategical affair, that plays a little better and looks a whole lot better than the original Acquire.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good game but the veto system could use some tweaking. As it is now you almost always veto just to make the other player spend stock or just take a turn moving the wrong way forcing the other players to veto you and spend stock. All-in-all there's too much vetoing going on for my taste.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After one 3er play, I'm not sure what to think about it.  Getting routes through my stations was particularly difficult.  There were very few places that stations could be placed on the board.  Once placed, I didn't have enough stock to direct a train through them as my tile placement would get vetoed.  Still I had a respectable finish.  Need to play this one again.  Rating could go up a point or 2.

Meatier version of Durst die Wueste from Knizia.  Players manipulate the track of several railroads across England, forcing them through cities and into one another.  When two railroads meet, they merge and the stock options change.  It's all about earning money, with three ways to pick it up during the game, and three ways to earn it at the end. Fantastic, cerebral game with no luck at all.  Recent games in 2010 have consolidated my opinion that this is a very dry, but intense game.  Probably the deepest "simple" game I own.

RATING: 5
Knizia's attempt at turning Acquire into a train game.  The "rocket" is a misnomer, as the trains inch along at a snail's pace, leaving track in their wake.   Grabbing goods tokens from anywhere on the board doesn't really work with the train theme.   Connections are based on adjacency also, something that worked better in Through The Desert with the tree scoring.   So this ends up falling in the middle of the road, probably, as far as train games go.   For something in this time frame, this has been surpassed by more immediate and intuitive games like Chicago Express.  And, on the heavier end of the spectrum, there are the Age of Steam family and variations.   So, Stephenson's Rocket will likely be left behind.   Glad I had a chance to play it, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Train theme, but not really a "railway game" in the veins of 18xx. Sort of an area majority game in disguise, but with an added spatial element.

You score for having majority of stations and shares in each railway line, and goods tokens in each city. So you are trying to manipulate the direction of the railway lines: control mergers so your shares are worth more, steering lines through your stations by paying shares, moving lines to force others to cough up shares to veto your moves, grabbing a goods token right before a line hits that city, etc. It's a fine art of coughing up shares for stations, and stations for shares, and having the "spare time" to grab an extra token, and affecting which lines gets to score where, all through the spatial manipulation of the lines' movement and direction on the board and all these dynamics interact with each other in very interesting ways.

I never played Stephenson's Rocket before.

I've heard a lot of good things about Stephenson's Rocket. When I saw a copy was available I knew I wanted my own copy even if I never played Stephenson's Rocket in the past.

Being a Reiner Knizia game made my decision easy.

Got Stephenson's Rocket in a game trade.

Update: I've played Stephenson's Rocket for the first time. I did enjoy it. Although it was not quite the train game I expected it to be. I need to play it again to see if my opinion changes. Looking forward to playing this game again soon. In most cases I would have to read the game rules myself in order to play this game again. I don't know that many people who has Stephenson's Rocket.

RATING: 9
An intriguing game. After several plays, I haven't yet fully grasped how the scoring mechanisms work. I understand them mechanically, but making them do my bidding is difficult. This makes the game somewhat difficult to introduce to new players since they're likely to spend their first game mostly just flailing. Perhaps with time, I will figure out how to explain it such that new players will have a better understanding.

In each game, the popularity of each scoring mechanism varies. It seems to be key to pay attention to who is scoring by which methods and go after the less used ones. For instance, if tokens are not much taken, a few actions can net a lot of points.

Using vetoes to manipulate both majorities in shares and majorities in stations is essential. Bid amounts are motivated not only by how much you want to change the direction the train moves in but also by what resulting share distributions are acceptable. Often, it's worth accepting a veto because it will put you ahead in shares.

RATING: 6
There is a high amount of depth to this game despite the simplicity of what you can do in a round.  As with some other Knizia titles, the scoring is a lot more complex than your actual turn actions.  There are few other games that make me feel so limited in what I can do compared to what I want to do.  Part of this is from the game itself and part of it is due to other player's being able to veto some of your actions.  Not only is it a good game, but I don't feel this fact would change regardless of whether you have 2, 3, or 4 players.

I wanted to like it - and I did! 
A great design by Dr. Knezia with really strong thematics.  The game offers many tough decisions and options, though is at its best with 3-4.  Like most of Dr.K's games, players are never out of the game, nor options, and can usually come back, so the final winner isn't known until the end. Scoring is tight and a wrong or missed move may be costly, but should be recoverable. AP can be an issue, though there is little down-time. The rulebook is vague in some areas, so consult the FAQ.  Glad to hear it's coming back into print Dec 2017.

Mechanics on your turn are really simple, though because of how many scoring options there are, decisions prove to be really difficult to make. A really, really great game of good length. 

Very Acquire-like, but taken up 3 notches or more - plus it's a train game! - and absolutely no luck whatsoever. I wonder, though, if the luck element that exists in Acquire (with the board changing depending on the tiles drawn) is essential for replayability. I don't know yet.

Stephensons Rocket is an opaque game. There are many different ways to score points, yet you only have two actions per turn and that means you can rarely do everything you need on your own. So that either means forming temporary alliances with other players or providing the right incentives that those other players do your work for you even without converging interests.

The three scoring categories (goods, stations, and shares) require different levels of investment and pay out very differently but all of them are valuable. Finding out which of those paths is worth following in any particular game is one of the major challenges.

Hard to judge after one play as I'm not sure that I got the rules all correct.  Interesting mechanic of merging railroads.  Some of the railroad aspects are pretty abstracted so it is hard to call this one a "train game".  I would love to try this one again as I think it has some interesting twists.

Stephenson's Rocket takes a lot from Acquire shakes it up, strips away the luck and fat, and dresses it up into a train engine.  The result is one of Knizia's best and a real reminder of what a classic euro game is - simple, elegant, and with a wide girth of chooses and strategies.  This game makes Acquire obsolete and probably a ton of others.  Wow, wow, wow this game excites the grey matter. Every game begins very opaquely, but then quickly takes a life of it's own and necessary strategies become apparent.  This game spins in it's own circle and i can easily see this climbing to a ten, and well up my top ten list.

So many options, but only 2 moves per round.  There is always at least one more move you want to make, but it's a delicate balance between what can I do to help myself now without helping someone else out too much.  Whatever you do, someone else benefits in some little way almost all the time, and when they don't, look out - they'll try to veto your play!

When a fringe publisher releases a game from a major designer like Reiner Knizia, my expectations are very low.  Stephenson's Rocket is among the very few exceptions to this rule.  I suspect that the major publishers thought the game was too weird and counterintuitive to be successful, and they were probably right.  But for the niche hobbyist who's willing to devote some energy to exploring a game that's confusing the first time through, Stephenson's Rocket is a good game.  Not a top tier Knizia, but still quite good.  It's a subtle, cerebral game that will grow on you if you give it the opportunity.

Why not top tier?  Two reasons.  First, the commodity tokens are a sucker's bet.  They're really only good if everyone is mostly ignoring them, making a majority easier to secure.  But unless everyone at the table knows this, the player who invests in commodities is a sure bet to lose.  Secondly, the theming is really weird.  You build train stations in the middle of the countryside and hope that someone will build tracks to it.  You merge one company into another by running the first company's track into the second's.  You receive stock as a reward for building a company's track.  It all requires a very active imagination.  Strangely, the game's description here on BGG trumpets this as "a surprisingly thematic offering" from Reiner Knizia.

For me, no-random-element multiplayer games are like meat that is too lean: a good idea in theory but flavorless in practice. Knizia tries to spice things up with a multitude of ways to score so that you never know who's in the lead, but really this just ends up making the game bewildering to play. Still, not actually a bad game, and as you can see from the ratings some people love it.

Must play a few more games to see if it goes up or down. This game will certainly do one or the other.

4-player (some think 3-player and even two).

Alterations/House rules: Poker chips in the open, or maybe a cribbage board (in any case there are alot of VPs awarded at the end of the game); If there is a tie-breaker we probably wouldn't use it; 

Touchstones: Area majority times three - shares, stations, tokens - and are all roughly worth equal; The timing of payouts differ between shares and stations; Merging and the 2:1 stock swap has always been an important driver to me; Needs aggressive players to really become a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Knizia's masterpiece. No random elements at all (other than seating order). It's a little tricky to play well though -- the voting mechanism is crucial, but difficult for many people to grasp. Often, you propose a new route not because that's where you want a railway line to go, but because your opponent *needs* it to go elsewhere.

I think Stephensons Rocket has 80% of the skill of an 18xx  game, but playable in less than half the time.

RATING: 8
This game should get more play. It's a combination of tile placement and stock holding with many great options for strategy. There are too many things to do on a turn and not enough actions. The game is over before you know it (always less than an hour) and usually very close. A classic Knizia.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This has some similarities to Acquire in that it is all about getting shares in different railways, but players have more control in some ways as they can choose to advance the railway of their choice on their turn, rather than play a randomly drawn tile, as in Acquire. I'd need to play again a few times to get a proper view.

Played again recently after a number of years and many new rail games being released. It is medium complexity for a train game, with some interesting twists. It does take a bit longer than otherwise, due to the inclusion of a "veto round" each time a company builds. Need to play again, but that holds down my opinion of an otherwise innovative game. Players of Acquire and its derivatives will see a few bits of that in here. Good for moving gamers up the scale from basic rail games to Railways of {abc}, Steam and eventually 18xx.

Too low excitement factor. I also dislike the money (too much alike) and the rules (ambiguus in part). Of the three ways to acquire money, one is of practically no importance (goods). There are also, as in many of Knizias games, Nim situations, i.e. the first to play loses.

Although it is painfully clear I have no idea what a good strategy is (my score was doubled by the winning player), I had a lot of fun playing this.  This is the bastard lovechild of through the desert and railroad tycoon.  Yes, I know RRT came out years later...  thats just the best way I can describe this game.  I like the wonky scoring, the share system makes for a lot of interesting decisions, and there is a lot to do on any given turn.  

The theme, although it looks strong, doesn't make much sense.  You get stock for moving a train, you place your stations in the middle of nowhere and try to bring your trains to them, etc.  There are also some odd situations with the veto system and the endgame.

Overall its a good game I would play again but the theme issues turn off a little bit... and although it does offer more depth than TTD, I'm not sure its that much more fun.

[Initial Impression: 8]
In this compelling train-themed game, players earn money in one of three ways: by picking up tokens, getting stations onto lines, and by collecting stock in lines.  Each of these pays out for the majority and minority at various times during the game and at game's end. Each player has two actions per turn, and the main strategy involves trying to best use those two actions to set up large scoring opportunities later in the game.  Stations and stock payouts are proportional to the number of towns and cities connected to a line, so these provide the largest scoring opportunities (token payouts are a fixed amount). However, it can be difficult to forsee which lines will become the longest, as lines merge in a non-intuitive manner - when two lines connect, the one that was moved to cause the connection is acquired by the stationary line.  There is also an interesting veto mechanism, by which anyone with shares of stock in a line can veto a proposed move and change the direction of the line's extension.  By carefully planning to cause mergers and vetoing aggressively, you can wrest control of large lines from other players.  It's a complete and perfect information game, which allows for long-range planning and strategy.  The game can play slowly, as moves often need to be carefully thought through, and a runaway leader problem can occur if one player is able to get both stations and stock in the largest line (so don't let this happen!).  This makes for a very engrossing and competitive game with a number of fun and somewhat unusual mechanisms that give an impression of an economic game without actually being one (money is simply a score-keeping device).  Currently, the game is hard to find, but definitely worth seeking out.

RATING: 6.5
Despite the historical train background, Stephenson's Rocket immediately reminded me of Tigris & Euphrates, but even more of Sid Sackson's Acquire.

Essentially it's a stock acquisition and valuing game, based on simple map movements and physical joins to make mergers, generating cash and valuable stocl in the new company.

Knizia has some different twists in it, with resource claims, stations and stock-powered vetos of tile placement, but really it comes down to very similar mechanics.

I think it's less dry and themeless than Acquire, and I'll start it's rating at 6.5 on one solo 3-player play.
Definitely a worthwhile Knizia, recycling some other designer(s)' classic ideas.

1st played 4/16/08. Taught in 15min, played in 1.25 hrs w/ 3 players. Good luck/strategy mix. Each player picks a station color. On your turn you get two of the following actions: take 1 city good, place/move one of your stations(no place on town/city/track/next to train or another station) or move 1 of 7 train lines(move only left/right/strait from the previous track direction(unless no track laid). Any action can be done twice except move same train line twice. When moving the train line you get 1 stock of that color(if any are left). If another player doesn't like the direction, he can object and pay stock back to the bank to move it the direction he likes(must outbid you by paying more stock than you are willing to front). Once you move the train, you place a track showing where the train came. If the train enters a space with a station(not your color) you get a passenger. When you connect a line to a city, the player with the most goods tokens gets $2,000 and 2nd get $1,000(ties for 1st split; 2nd each get). When connecting to a railroad town, the player with the most stations on the line gets $1,000 * the number of cities and towns on the line(2nd place get's 1/2, ties each get $1,000 per city/town. When moving a train adjacent to another train or track, it's considered merged and scores the same as connecting to a town except it's the player with the most shares and players with the merged stock get 1/2(rounded down) of the new stock(get extra if you run out). The game ends when there is only one train line left or all 60 track tokens are played. End game scoring rewards the player with the most stock getting the number of cities (total in the game is 28 cities) connected * $1,000. 2nd place gets 1/2 rounded down.  The player with the most and 2nd most stations on the line gets the same as with the stock. The player with the most of each of the 4 goods(have to be connected to a line) gets $6,000 and 2nd place for each gets $3,000. Player with the most passengers gets $3,000. It will take you a game playing it to figured out a good strategy. It's worth a game play if you know someone who has it, otherwise I wouldn't bother with purchase.

I finally played this in 2013. Fantastic game. Not as hard to wrap your head around as I feared; I think what seemed really heavy or complicated in 1994 is no big deal now. Just goes to show how ahead of his time Knizia was. I think of the game as kind of a stock game in which there are two kinds of stocks (with the second kind being the train stations). The veto mechanism is very interesting.

This early Knizia game displays some of the designer's hallmarks, but in many ways Stephenson's Rocket is an unusual, if not unique, entry in his ludography. The depth of theme stands out; indeed it is strongly integrated into the game. The track building, the shares and even the merging of railways and the scoring all make Stephenson's Rocket feel more like a simulation than an abstract game. The only major downside is that it is difficult for beginners both to grasp the tactics and to foresee how a game will develop.

I like this Knizia's shot at a railway game.  Some concepts are meshed together here - a bit of track building, a bit of share owning, a bit of merging companies and a bit of typical Knizia's scoring for advantages.  Quite unusual mix, but it works.

Not easy to figure out what to do at first (possibly the whole first game), but the rules are, in fact, simple and you can get a grip on the game quickly enough.

Not essential in my collection, but a pleasurable game nonetheless.

EDIT: I could sense some replayability problem (8 plays) so I sold the game.

There is actually lots to like here for a Gamer, very low rule overhead, NO luck (a little PIC which is different), very simple turns since only 3 things you can do and you only do 2, and yet has a nice strategic/tactical mix BUT it is VERY dry for sure, and really almost a pure abstract game and plays like a somewhat advanced version of TTDesert (The theme is there [which includes locomotives building track BEHIND them as they move ahead on trackless groud...lol] but somehow the game is still quite dry).  

Note sure about the play time either, I think more likely to run 90 minutes than 60 which is still okay for this. I need to play it again, first play was aborted.

I don't know that I'll clamor to play this game again soon - it makes me yearn for heavier train games.  As it is it's Knizia's take on Acquire.

Like Acquire this didn't really click for me first play - but perhaps I'll give it another crack.

SR is a game with no luck and makes wonderful use of the classic 'fewer-actions-than-options' element for that perfect turn angst rush.  Interesting mechanics and easy to understand rules, however, the scoring system does take some getting used to.  My rating will most likely increase with more play.

Having played this once, I don't feel quite ready to give it a rating yet, though right now it'd be a tentative '7'.  The whole game is a series of tough choices, and I don't feel I understand the balance among them well enough to submit a rating.  Still, it's an economic train game, which for me is two points in its favor already.

This game is one of Knizia's best creative efforts. A train game that features route-building, shares, mergers, cities and stations -- and yet feels NOTHING like a game created by any entity named Tresham, Winsome, or Wallace. THAT is an accomplishment!

The difference here is that there are shares, but no money. Shares are earned by extending a railway track. Shares can be used to veto the route choices of other players, but you have to give up your shares to do so. Otherwise, having the most shares in extensive train lines can get you a lot of points at game's end. Each city starts with three tokens with different goods on them. Players can also place stations on the board that they can then run routes through. You get points in game for having the city tokens for connected cities, having stations on routes that connect to rail towns, and having a majority of a type of good, as long as the city they come from is connected to a railway line.

It sounds a bit confusing and the game takes a play or two really grok, but boy is it worth it! This game does not have the usual Knizia luck factor, but does not suffer for it. If you are a fan of route-building and/or train games, this one is different from any other and should be in your collection.

I don't rate this a 10 like Knizia's other best games because I suspect that the set starting locations and cities could lead to a samey feel after many games - problems that Ra and Tigris and Euphrates successfully avoids, hence their higher scores.

Este juego lo tuve poco tiempo, ya que pasó a formar parte de la colección de un amigo.

Es otro de esos juegos que Knizia te dice que es de una cosa, pero que en realidad podía haber sido de cualquier otra, no te da en ningún momento la sensación de estar jugando con trenes (salvo por las fichas).

No acabé de encontrar la manera de sacarle partido, y la verdad es que hace mucho tiempo que no jugamos porque solemos probar otras cosas.

One of my favorite "perfect information" games. That said, I think the theme of the game can actually cause confusion to understanding what is going on in this game (i.e. companies don't build "stations" on the speculation that a railroad may hopefully one day connect to it; just because 2 tracks cross doesn't mean the companies merge, etc.)

RATING: 5
To be clear, my 5 rating is more a rating of the game's sheer opacity than anything else. By comparison, Chicago Express is easy to grasp but also easy to understand what you don't know yet. Stephen's Rocket is neither. Not much to hang onto upfront, not much sense of learning as you go either. Pretty much everything about it feels arbitrary, counterintuitive, and somehow the opposite of subtle, though I'm sure there is subtlety if you know what you're doing. 

The target audience for a game like this must be tiny. I might play again, I might not. I'm not sure it's worth the effort.

For a "gamers game gamer" like myself, this is near Nirvana.  It combines an engaging train-tile laying game with clever battle for control.  It does get a little chaotic at the end.

RATING: 9
I am tempted to give this a 10.  It *IS* a nearly perfect game.

The gist of the game is you are building railroads in England and you can store products (textiles, skins, machinery, etc....), build stations on a line, or gather up stock.   If you extend a railroad, you can gain stock thereby positioning yourself for gaining points through mergers during the game or the length of the railroad at the end of the game.  Stations give you a stake in the railroad not unlink stocks.  

Each session is different and you can use the same strategy twice and have two very different results.

Be warned about two things:

1) One mistake and you could be doomed.
2) The first game, its hard to get your head wrapped around how it all works.

Stephensons Rocket could be a blueprint for recent Winsome game titles like Preussische Ostbahn. It's an opaque game that borrows rail development from caravan development of Through the Desert and adds an Acquire like merger payout scheme. Temporary alliances and setting incentives are main elements of SR. Good for train gamers that don't mind their games being mean. My only complaint is that replayability might be limited due to the fixed setup without any random element.

I'm not sure I should even rate this yet, after a single 2-player game.  Surprisingly thematic, yet also at times downright counterintuitive.  I'm sure that strategy reveals itself after multiple plays, I just don't grasp what's best to do after one play.  Rating is likely to move up with repeated play.  I hope I will get the chance to do so.

Update: I never really felt the desire to play.  The relative scarcity is what made me hold onto it, but I finally ended up trading it away.

An excellent railroad share-management game. Its a bit hard to categorize this game because there are so many things to try to control at once (e.g. the direction of the railroad, placement of stations, control of cities, control of shares). But I think it all came together nicely to create a very engaging game. Plus: no random elements.

Note: the color choices were terrible, and made setup a pain because there were so many different colors.

I have played two times (within a span of about 4 years) and both games I found frustrating to get your stations on a railway.  I suppose I need to veto more often.  I feel that there is a good game in here, though it might have too much of "screw your neighbor" feel than I like.

Not really a train game, but a kind of stock game with a train-themed board element to control the timing of dividends and mergers. I generally like hexagons and games where players use common instruments for asymmetric utility, so this is all fine with me. The problem with the goods may not be so much that they pay off too badly as the fact that players taking the same goods will always be working against each other to the benefit of everyone else, whereas getting stocks and stations typically amounts to cooperation.

Great luckless strategy game. Although all the elements of a train game are present (goods&passengers, railroad building and stock collection), the game feels differently from other train games. In some ways, it is even quite similar to E&T: e.g. the mechanism of merging two railways.

Forgot to comment on this . 

It was quite hard for me to wrap my head on passing the cities to claim it instead of going through them. But in order for the game to work it has to. The "passing" feels similar as Through the desert.  

the decisions you have to take are all meaningfull.
ALlthough the actions are reasonably simple there is a decent learning curve in this one. 
This has certainly repeated plays in it. The player interaction is higher than in most euros.   And if you have to compare it with a gametype I can only think of winsome.

A frustrating but challenging puzzle game. The only problem I have is that planning ahead is almost impossible as your opponent WILL foul you up every turn. It's a game that concentrates more on the 'what's you best move for right now' rather than 'what's your best strategy over several moves'. I like the product/passenger element and the tracks based on hex's is cool too. Worth trying if you like thinking games--probably frustrating to adventure gamers.

RATING: 6
The earliest decisions seem almost arbitrary, having more to do with how well you manage to end up working with others or on your own, but the late game slows quite a bit.  Everyone ends up making turn-by-turn comparisons of pluralities in different categories, though games can play out pretty differently depending on mid-game mergers.  This slowdown (and sometimes a reduction of choices) weakens the last few rounds of play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Couple of games played, so my opinion might change a bit. The basic idea is great and when you understand how everything works this is a really brainburner. But then there are few negative aspects: game is a bit too long and too quite slow. Then there is this scoring system where all the big points are shared later on the game, so at the  beginning you get only couple of points BUT that's nothing compared to the big (over 20) points at the end.

Beyond the basic premise of building as many stations as possible, I can't seem to wrap my head around (in a fun way) when to grab shares or try to steal opponent's shares or lay track tactically for me or against my opponents.

Odd but interesting take on the train game genre by Knizia.  The rules are fairly straightforward but strategy in the early part of the game was difficult to determine on our first play.  Things began to click as the game progressed, however, and I suspect the game itself is not quite as opaque as it originally seemed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Acquire meets Through the Desert in this tough, choo-choo themed package.  

This is a pure investment game.  Players have two opportunities per turn to invest in a diverse range of prospects across the board (city tokens, railroad shares, and their own stations).  All investments WILL pay off.  The trick is to invest in those that will pay off at higher rates, and more often, and to manipulate and drive the game so that while everybody gets rich, you get richest.

Three plays in, it is NOT easy to crunch the figures and figure out how to manipulate this game, despite SR being a perfect and complete information game.  The toughest decision comes down to the veto rounds:  deciding when to call a veto, how much of your shares to bid, and whether it's worth burning your own shares or forcing your opponent to torch his.

In the end, the likeness to Acquire that at first seems so strong (first and second majority payouts everywhere you look) proves only fleeting.  Stephenson's Rocket is Knizian factor-juggling and turn angst (so many things you want to do, so few actions per turn) pushed to its most extreme.  This game lacks the pistol-butt-to-the-face brutality of Acquire, with that game's steep cliff edges and rich-get-richer feedback loops.  But SR has its own meditative vibe, is delightfully opaque, and more truly the "gamer's game".  For my part, I'm happy as hell to have both in my collection.

This is my second-favorite Knizia, after Modern Art.

In reality this isn't a game about economics - gameplay-wise it is in fact very, VERY similar to Through the Desert. The rules are equally simple but the scoring mechanisms have to be grasped perfectly in order to be able to plan ahead. The game is full of Knizia and you can see that at first glance. Some rules remind you of Through the Desert, some of Loco and others of Ra or Amun-Re, especially when it comes to the sophisticated scoring mechanisms. After the first game I didn't quite get the flow of the game and I think that I didn't make any smart choices - it felt very chaotic to me, though some of my fellow players looked as if they knew what they were doing. I'm looking forward to another session since I'll be knowing all the rules by heart and the rating will surely go up. Update: my second play was indeed much more thought-through (I won ^^) which proves that you have to gain some basic experience before grasping all the scoring opportunities. As expected the rating goes up to a full 8 but I still can't claim that I'm really good at the game.

Another fine game in the the Knizia line. It's all about collecting sets of the tokens from each city to get points that way, sets of the different symbols on the tokens to get points that way, and sets of the stocks from the individual railways. Choosing what lines to isolate and which lines to merge is a  huge strategy in this game.

An interesting take on train games.  Reiner Knizia did this. You can acquire shares in a company and operate the company.  Other shareholders can veto your actions but it carries some penalties.  If two networks touch, they merge into a single company.  When there is a one company the game ends and the player with the most money wins.  

I found it interesting and different.  It has some clunky elements but simplifies the train genre with stock which can be very heavy with 18XX.

Well, I probably shouldn't rate this after one play, especially considering I was bouncing my infant daughter on my lap for most of it. I can see that there is some depth to the game, but a 5 pretty accurately describes how much I want to play the game again. SR has a very intricate scoring system as many other Knizia games do and it's hard to grasp all the intricacies on a first play. What I didn't like was the seeming randomness of the mechanics. Why do you build train stations in the boonies BEFORE track gets there? Why can't stations be built adjacent to a train? Why can't you move a train twice in the same round? Why does most stock matter for some scoring determinations, but most stations for others? Why do you have to give up stock in order to determine a train's building policies? What does that represent? Shouldn't you have to acquire it instead? When a player extends a large railroad so that it becomes adjacent to a tiny one, why does the large one get dissolved? Shouldn't the big fish eat the little fish? Now I can see why some of these decisions were made in game-play terms, but the sum makes for an incoherent jumble.

I strongly dislike games with a standard setup because it leads to standard opening moves eventually, and that in turn means that games can be "thought of" beforehand, which is something I sincerely dislike. I am not sure however, if it will become a problem with Stephenson's Rocket. In fact, I am not sure about this one at all yet.

A Knizia train game!  I really enjoyed playing this game and may of rated it higher but I found it was really difficult to come up with a good strategy.  There are so many ways to make money and the merger mechanic wherein the passive railroad (rather than the stronger most dominant railroad) getting taken over by the attacking railroad (who simply moves adjacent to its tracks).  Perhaps it will just take a few plays to wrap my head around this one.  Nice components and one of Reiner's best themed games.

Played once.  This is a fiddly game that has relatively simple turns, yet requires very complex decisions due to the complicated scoring mechanisms and infuriatingly limited number of actions that can be taken per turn.  

There are at least four different ways to get points in the game, all of which require at least somewhat differnet actions to acquire.  Thus, I want to play this again to get a good taste of it before reviewing it further.  It seems like this game could either end up being far too fiddly for what it is, or it could be a great strategy/tactical game for the ages.  I think it's leaning more to "fiddly" than "greatness" right now, but who's to say.

Fun, interesting, but a little confusing game of railroad building and merging. Reminds me of Euphrat & Tigris mixed with Acquire stocks. In the end, despite being a fan of railroad games, I'd rather play the more straighforward Acquire.

I really like the choices and the route building.  The comparison of Acquire with trains holds true for me, and (for three or four players), I'd much rather play this than Acquire.

4 player train game by Knizia. Shares in a railroad are acquired and players can move a rail line. When rail lines collide, one is absorbed into the other and people can convert shares, like Acquire. From my point of view, appears to be a lack of control with the railroad movement, or at least a bit convoluted for my taste. Otherwise could be a good game.

Theoretically this game offers everything that I like in games: no luck dependency, a lot of variability, a lot of interaction and so forth. But the appreciation of a game is not completely equal to the sum of the factors that shape our tastes, there is a more important factor, that is how much we like and want to play it. I find this game cold, not exciting to play. The game can go in one direction or another depending on the combined actions of the players and it seems a feast of the tactical moves and of king-making more than a strategy game of the sort I really like. Rating can go up if I play it more and I discover that it is nicer with many more plays, but I don't think I will soon, there are so many other games that I prefer.

Interesting game of multiple kinds of majority control scoring, though the number of actions a player can take on a turn is almost too limiting.  You feel like you can never really make a clever play, you need someone else to set one up for you (but at that point it is not longer clever, it's scripted).  Some focus on playing the other players, and I do like that about it.  Certainly willing to give it more chances.

First impression (3 players): Knizia's take on train games. It is a no-luck game where it wasn't too easy to see how to make best of 3 different scoring systems. I like how there are scoring opportunities both during the game and a bit bigger one at the end.

There's a tight balance between the possible actions, which usually means that I don't have the faintest idea what to do in the game. So for me, the fun part is missing here. Investing in the biggest railroad might be a viable option, but that does not sound like a lot of fun either.

A lot of people think E&T is Knizia's best, but I think a lot of them haven't played SR. There's a LOT going on in this game, but it all fits together seamlessly and all the options make sense.

Bears a striking resemblance to Acquire, but with no random elements and slightly deeper gameplay. I enjoy Acquire very slightly more (and Union Pacific even more still), but I am very pleased to own both (all three!).

Use of railway stations to constrain the other players while simultaneously making profit more likely is an excellent aspect of the game. Like this.

Nice wooden steam-engines, but the board, cards, chits and cash (used only for scoring) are merely average.

You need a few games under your belt to understand the full repercussions of how and when to merge, and if you have a table of players who do, this game can take on some nerve tingling menace. It's just missing that little something that would encourage the game to come to the table more often. I think it's the lack of instant gratification in a move. ie your stations have to hang around for a whole turn before you know whether you've been pus'd or whether you can get to them.

RATING: 10
Massively underrated, wonderfully balanced and zero luck. 
One of Knizia's best by far.

I find it useful to explain to new players that you have to think about trying to be the holder of the most shares in the remaining train company/companies at the end of the game and that you should really try not to fall behind when connecting stations, without this advice it's easy to completely destroy your opponent in final scoring (which is only going to put them off playing again!)

Based on one play: I will definitely need to play again, since I could not figure out a strategy going into the game. The mechanics are turn actions are fairly simple as you either take a city token, place a station or move a train. But the interaction of mergers and final scoring was not obvious and since you do not go through cities and towns but around them, the board is very odd at first. I'll have to try it again soon.

Stephenson's Rocket is a hard game to describe.  It's a little like Expedition, where there are a number of different routes on the board, and you're trying to control where they go.  However, this game adds a stock element, meaning different players have varying interests in each route, and that interest can change over the course of the game.  I'm not a big fan of stock games because I often feel like I don't know whether possible moves are better for me or my opponent.  This game seems to exacerbate this feeling--I felt like I was doing things, but I had little idea what relation those things had with actually winning.

It has a lot of what I like - zero luck, depth, highly interactive, etc... - but it lacks a certain harshness that I like. Instead of trying to survive the game and win, you just try to accumulate money. There's no punishment for stupidity as nearly everything you do is going to give you money.

Partial Acquire-style play with equally simple rules but improves on Sackson's creation by having a simplistic payout system, a wider range of scoring majorities and shorter playing time. (The only aspects that I like about Acquire over this model is the surrendering money to make more and the secret share holdings). It's been a while between playings and I find acouple of games are needed to develop tactical decisions. One thing that intrigued me is how dependent the play relies on attracting alliances with your neighbouring opponents to succeed in your plans. (Obviously, this is due to the limit of moving a particular train once in your turn, gaining a share, which may later provide you some muscle to divert that train to your desired scoring railway station and/or city). The game feels like Durch die Wuste in that you have visual scoring targets which you're aiming for, but instead of being blocked you have this limited control; there's that constant feeling of being attracted to various locations but you can't do all of them. Hence these unspoken alliances are important to make gains, you need to make your targets attractive by playing to opponent's needs. Sadly, assessing these needs are hampered by the city token type being alittle small. In fact, these tokens add another layer of majorities which for me is alittle rich for my brain. As all information is out in the open, despite the strong theme and mechanic coupling-I had to throw that in-, the game is tense, but lacks drama.

Stephenson's Rocket intrigued me because I love both Knizia and rail games but didn't necessarily see them working well together. I picked up a copy of the Dutch edition on the 'geek and got it to the table at my games club. Like Tigris & Euphrates, it felt very opaque on the first play, but left me wanting more. It feels like a hybrid of Through the Desert and Acquire, and has about as much to do with the railway industry as those games do with camels and hotels. It has the classic Knizia device of having to choose two actions from a menu when you would like far more, but it doesn't have Knizia's usual elegance. I felt that there was maybe one majority system too many, and it loses something over Acquire by having liquidity count for nothing: money is only received, never spent. I really want to try it again, but it may be one of those games (like Chicago Express, which resembles it in other ways too) that don't work well with new players and so have trouble getting played often.

UPDATE  My second play was wonderful. The real magic of the Rocket is in the veto mechanism. Once players figure out how easily the fate of a line can be altered by a single turn to the left or right, it becomes a brutal game of extortion - trading shares for stations and vice versa.

Some of the basic mechanics require clarification with each play (move engine with proposed facing and placing trailing track tile; track doesn't run through towns & cities). Once these are sorted, this is a typical Knizia game of subtle scoring and one too many choices at every turn. Also, the technique of the nuisance 1 share veto needs to be shown prior to play (having a single share in a line you're not interested in so you always bid that one share to ruin the route forcing the track laying player to give back his newly earned share in order to continue along his planned route).

There are several things I like about the game
There are several different layers of scoring occurring. Yes complex but provides for different objectives.
Like how building a line provides the "income" in shares, and how these may need to be spent to force the line in ways you want it go.
The scoring is by majority (shares, stations, tokens) in the better developed lines. As each line gets absorbed you can score and get an interest in the remaining line. I like how you can trade off stock interest for station interest - since both score for the line.

To me it is very much like Acquire - a game I also appreciate.

RATING: 5
Despite the reviews, this game is very easy to teach. The rules that come with the game make this sound way too complicated than it is. I really, really want to like this game. I really like the veto mechanic. However, I find the scoring too unbalanced: scoring by merging railways seems too lucrative in comparison to the other ways to score.

Feb. 2006: UPDATED from 6 to 7. The game dramatically improves if you warn players of the following:

Scoring by station majority and shares majority is *far* more lucrative than the other scoring methods.

This will prevent someone from easily amassing lots of stations on a line, and make players start using the veto mechanic not just to move a line another direction but to drain an opponent's shares.

I despise all area-influence games, but I enjoy  this one simply because of the veto mechanic, which allows players to reduce their opponents' shareholdings.

August 2015: Downgraded from 7 to 5. It's just not that much fun, and I don't know really why. I want to like it -- it's a perfect information game about trains, and all game events are triggered by the players, not at some arbitrary turn of play -- but here's my attempt:

* AP inducing, but it shouldn't be; there are only three actions to pick from!
* Perhaps too strategic: You really have to pick which majorities you want to control early in the game as it is very, very difficult to take over another player's majority
* Other than the big scores that rack up near the end of the game, there isn't that much excitement during the game; the game gets samey and a bit tedious

Ok, but very susceptible to player chaos (which is not necessarily a strike against it in my book).  The veto mechanism is a neat way of letting players mess with each other's minds.  Quite a good satisfying outing with an enjoyable amount of 'nastiness'.

One play. Late at night. Might have been a bit much for me at that hour. Even on the last turns of the game, I was still asking for rules clarifications.

Second play: this game is completely unintuitive - I have absolutely no idea what's going on in the game or what the strategy is.

I used to own this game, but had to trade it due to lack of response in my group. I thought it had potential, but it was so extremely slow in the beginning, that it failed to hold interest. Also, I can see how the "forcing someone to either lose controll of the direction of a train or give up stocks in it" can become quite annoying. And what is up with the superhuge money in different amounts but all the same freaking color? VP chips would have been much better as you dont use the money for buying anything.

I've played few games where I was so clueless through so much of it. Having said that, I can see that there's lots of depth here. I want to plumb those depths, but because it's so obtuse, I doubt I'll be able to convince the group to play this very often. [Update: Played again and liked it even more. Glad I have this one.)

2-4 player majority game with snowball effects. The rules appear so simple, but the possibilities are so endless. The convoluted scoring system (even by Knizia standards) can be hard to wrap your head around in the first play. The rulebook is terribly brief and incomplete. This is one of those epic Knizia designs like Tigris & Euphrates. It punishes you severely for mistakes you think are tiny, and it offers a lot of room to think about and improve your play. Elegant. Still have no idea how to do well in the game.

The light bulb has turned on after my 3rd play, and I'm starting to see why this is a classic with near-infinite replayability, that demands you to think about what you can do better next time after each play. But boy, those first 2-3 plays are shit unimpressive to get through, and a lot of people I've introduced this to got turned off after the first play (including me).

The hardest part of the game is timing. You want to cut through the chaos, and get things to score at the optimum time, which is much harder than it sounds. You also want to fork people and give them tough decisions and trade-offs, while ensuring you don't get caught in those situations.

Played once, probably under-rating it a bit. I usually don't mind Knizia's lack of theme, but a train game that plays like Acquire is a bit of a letdown. Too many paths to victory mean that there's no way to block people effectively, so it's just a chore to add up the money.

Got this in the German Version from eBay  because it was cheap.  I got a rules translation from BGG, but a number of questions appear to persist.  <BR><BR>The two major problems that I am having with the game are the lack of 500 money bills, especially when there are numerous payouts in 500 money increments.  Rules insist that you need to round down on payouts, which means that players rarely get all the money that is coming to them, as 500 rounds down to zero.  <BR><BR>It also appears that the commodities are underpowered for their role in the game.  This may not be the case, as further plays may help to flush out a better commodity strategy.  I do like the board and the bits, but the large green money drives me nuts.  <BR><BR>I am wondering if Age of Steam might be a better RR game for me...<BR><BR>I eventually traded this game away for Zertz, which I am enjoying much more...

A decent train game that overstays its welcome a bit.  There is enough going on in the game to keep you entertained, with many short turns that give you tough choices.  

Ultimately though, what seems like it has many roads to victory, only leads down paths that can't compete.  This can be frustrating if you think that the goods strategy is viable.  I guess I figured that because it was Knizia that it would be balanced.  

What this game comes down to is controlling the stations and having stock in the end.  The goods just aren't worth it.  Unfortunate.  Otherwise it is a fine system.  It certainly offers much that isn't found in other rail games.  I like the luck free mechanics, but I also feel that this suffers from the same "problem" that Puerto Rico has, where if a player isn't paying attention to what the player on the left is doing they will just hand them their victory (although in Puerto Rico's defense it is hard not to see when you are doing it, whereas here it isn't as obvious).  

In comparison though, I'd much rather play Age of Steam for the time spent or Volldampf for something lighter.

Very interesting game.  It moves fast, once you get the hang of it.  There's a lot of nastiness in the game, and it's nice to see how the rails collapse into each other as you race toward an ending.

I finally got to play this and I have to say: brilliant. I love this game. The mechanics are simple: place a station, draw a token or lay a track. But the application is complex and constantly interesting. Even when you lose, it's fun to look at how the game built and say, "How did that happen?"

This one really fell flat for us. It gets the "can we just play Railways of the World instead?" treatment. The unintuitive logic of this game throws her off, and rather than it becoming an interesting game of intellect, it just becomes boring, with every move being an AP-inducing exercise in patience, resulting in a frustrated "I guess I'll just do this" random play.
 
This is a wide, wide open and very subtle game and I can see how in some circles this is considered a masterpiece, but its just not for us.

Subjectively, this is an average game which I very much have the take it or leave it mentality, leaning very much towards the leaving.

Objectively, its an average game due to it being a major flop or major success depending on the group. Very much a 'take it or leave it,' 'love it or hate it' type game.

Super good track laying, route building game where there are 5 or 6 train companies on the board that everyone can move.  They don't belong to any player.  Each time you move it, you take a share in the company.  At some point, multiple people will have shares of the company and they can veto your proposed move via a once around auction.  Each line scores points by connecting to cities, towns and player stations.  There also a goods collection part of the game.

A Reiner Knizia game. With trains, track pieces, a hex grid, and map of England? What? A great game that needs to be reprinted. The only things I'd change are to print the money with different face colors for each denomination (on whatever color is most authentic for 1835 English money--I suspect not one color) and maybe saturate the map color a bit--make it a little more colorful.

I actually enjoy Knizia's Stephenson's Rocket as much if not more than his Through the Desert, though it took much longer to grow on me.  Maybe because by Knizia standards, it's a heavy game.  There are rules and then sub-rules, and yet the core objective is a hat-trick: acquire the most shares in the most valuable rail networks, and acquire the majority of stations and tokens. These acquisitions behave differently, of course, so it's not just a matter of their being interchangeable. The scoring system especially takes a bit of effort to wrap your bean around. But once grasped, the game comes together and shines in all of its opportunistic brilliance.

This is an interesting game in which the board fills up with train routes and train lines start consolidating with one another.

Actually, with more plays bashing the leader and manipulating opponenets isn't as key as I thought.  Its about having bluff power to scare your opponenets and occasionally cutting their throats.  Always a neat shifting balance of power of the rail lines with the stations and stocks.  It is fun to constantly scanning the board to put your opponent on a lose/lose situation.  A mix a patiently doing y our own thing, while biding your plan to use up their strength in stocks, or ruining their majority held rail line.  It is an interactive game system.  The obvious benefits and negatives of the interactive games are present.  Still, with 3 other good gamers this game is quite a treat.  The goods do not seemed to be balanced with the stocks/stations which is small blemish.  Good times, good times. 

I do not feel it plays well with three.  I have never tried it with two, but I also have no desire to.

Good game changing plays take several turns to pull off, as the players improve.  Its a negative for some, but its why this one is a winner for me.  Probably not suited for mini/maxers.

Many ways to get VP, but all paths are majority games ("plurality" actually) of various types. You can take two actions per turn, like in TtD, but it usually feels like you're doing less at a time than in that game. I have the initial impression that I have a million things I could do, but none are particularly better or even all that significant, especially in the long term. Nasty.

The game rewards four types of pluralities, but they aren't tightly related, so that some systems could be removed to simplify the game. The main idea is that you can extend any railroad's track you want, receive a share in that railroad for doing so, and get VP later for the railroad's total size when you have the most or second-most shares in it.

The main asterisk is that when a railroad's track bumps into another's track, the former line merges into the latter, and the shares of the old railroad (which initiated the merger) lose half their weight in the combined company. Also, when you propose a build for a given railroad, the other shareholders can declare a "veto round" and bid their shares to alter the direction of the build.

I have not yet played the game properly with all systems, including commodities and stations. The game with just shares and mergers is sufficiently puzzling for me at the moment.

A horrible train game.

A mish-mash of rules that make no thematic sense.  Here we are, industrialists developing a railroad network to serve various towns and industries.  Can we re-invest the money we make?  No; money only matters for your score at the end of the game.  WTF???  Then, neither the merger rules nor the station placement rules make any thematic sense either...

The game might be ok if you ignore the theme and treat it as an abstract, but I find this impossible to do.  Bleah.

I am a great Knizia fan, but this game strikes me as a little fiddly. The scoring mechanism at the end is quite cumbersome and mergers in the game really change the tide of the game tremendously, locking some players out of the game quickly. Also, toward the end-game when all stations are on board and one or two lines are left, the tension is low and your choices of actions are rather limited since the game ends either on finishing the track tiles or one gigantic railway line left.

Magnificent twist on Acquire that for my taste makes all other games in that genre obsolete. At first I didn't get it, but with repeated plays it has really become a personal favorite. Tension is high as you need to do many things at once but can only perform two actions a turn. Every investment gives you influence in some arena and much of the skill is making the choices that lead to influence in the most relevant struggles.

Reiner Knizia expands his fleet of tile laying games with this game about colliding railroads in early 1800's England. There are seven different rail companies that players can expand. Each time you extend a rail, the other stockholders can veto your action, but it might cost them their shares. When two companies' rail touch, the railways merge to become one. The game is over when only one company remains or there are no rail tiles remaining, and the winner is the player who earned the most money over the course of the game. Re-Developed in Great American Railroad Game, The (2008).

RATING: 5
My first impressions weren't great, but I chalk that up to not having a clear idea of how the mergers took place.  The second playing was clearer, but still ... the game just doesn't sing with me.  I can recognize that it has a neat design -- it's a perfect-information stock game with some neat ideas for placements and payouts -- but I just struggle terribly with games like this.  I can't ever get a good grasp of how the board will look after a particular move, and I always find myself at a terrible disadvantage by the end of, say, the fourth turn.  I'm torn, because I think the design is solid, but I don't do well at these types of games, and I'm unlikely to play them frequently.

There's a lot to like here. No randomness, plenty of player interaction, and lots of meaningful decisions. In fact, I think there might almost be too many meaningful decisions for the design. There's so much going on in this game that it almost feels like work (and I like the last turn of Power Grid, for example, so I'm not adverse to mathy games). One turn I spent two or three minutes frantically trying to calculate in my head the outcomes down the line of each of my most viable options, and the conclusion I ultimately came to was that most of what I like in this game is also available in Through the Desert in a much more streamlined (and, therefore, more fun) manner. (I ended up guessing wrong on the options, but I learned.) I still rate this an 8, same as TtD, because I think the chrome does add some - I'm just not sure how much.

This is a hard one to rate. Need to play it again.  I think it may be a case of the more you play the better it will be.  It is very much in the vein of Through the Desert, the latter being more elegant and intuitive.  In fact it is almost like TtD with knobs on but I'm not sure if it needs the knobs - must play again.

[EDIT] lowered 0.8, to 6.5; too complicated....not completely bad, maybe interesting, but scoring and nomenclature are a nightmare


[EDIT]: i finally managed to play this game. I tried to read the rules 5+ times and i always found them sooo complicated (even if they are very short) that every time i deemed the game unplayable. Today i tried to play it alone and i finally grasped it. I proposed it during the evening and it was quite appreciated even if it is somewhat strange.
It's like Aquire (that i adore) but with train, companies disappear forever, there's much more topology and more ways to get points. The fact that stations can't be adiacent make it for an interesting game; you have to decide where to concentrate yourself and you must think in advance where things are going to be the one will the highest shares in the final railroads. I'll be happy to try it again!

Before first play: the rules of this game are so convoluted and the scoring system so tricky that i can't find the will to try this game. it really doesnt seem Knizia, it is chaotic to say the least.
I hope everything will be clearer after first play.

This is a tight game. I think mechanics wise, I would say it is very much like Tigris & Eurphrates except that the board stays more or less intact and much of the scoring takes place at the end, although mergers can contribute significantly to scoring throughout the game. I think it is a solid game, but for some reason it doesn't appeal to me on the same level as T&E.

A tough strategy game with absolutely no luck! I would have rated it a 10, if it wasn&#039;t for the difficult scoringsystem. The game is simple to play, you only have three actions to choose between, what makes the game deceivingly simple. But the rules make these actions a lot more difficult, and the scoringsystem is so complex, only a true gamemaster can build a strategy around it. Not for the non gamers.

I like this game but after several plays still don't have a good sense of the proper strategy.  I know what I want to have happen, but I don't know how to make it happen.  It seems that to implement a winning strategy, it is necessary to think several turns ahead on a tactical level, but calculating the effect of moves in the late game seems quite difficult.  Update:  I like Acquire better.  It seems a cleaner implementation of the same idea.

a lot of potential things to do, and only two actions per turn.  how Knizia is this game.  i found it fun.  need to play a few more times though, to see if the fun dies down.  i'm not sure i like how the shares and goods are identical when scoring.  seems like it could've been made more interesting by changing up the scoring of those two items, and maybe made different rules for grabbing goods to even it out.

Felt a bit like RK's take on Acquire, with a bit of Age of Steam thrown in. Unfortunately, we had two copies of the german rules translation, which had some significant differences, so the first game was a wash -- but I saw enough to know the game deserves another play.

One of the biggest problems I have with Stephenson's Rocket is that while there are multiple ways to score, not all of them are equal.  For one the commodity markers are completely not worth the action it takes to acquire them.  The same can be said of the passengers, because what you gain for them at the end simply does not compare to the advantage and payout you give to your opponents by connecting their stations.  The winner of our game had collected neither goods nor passengers and won by a fair margin.  So to me that's a pretty poor design when one type of scoring clearly outstrips all others available.

Not sure if I like the veto and bid mechanism either in terms of track building.  I hope the remake will fix some of these glaring problems, but as the way it is now, I'd rather play Union Pacific, Acquire or 18xx than this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Wow.  I'm pretty impressed.  No element of luck whatsoever, and I can still see the replayability of Stephenson's Rocket (I think it's because there's so much going on).  We scored the game incorrectly the first game; rating is based on that game and how I envision the scoring actually fits with what happens.  Good stuff. Update: taught a good friend to play, and we played a 2-player game.  I got smoked, and I like the game even more now.  It's unintuitive, but I can see things clicking the more you play.

After 1 Play: This game really confused me.  The mechanics were unintuitive and there were so many similar ways to score it was hard to keep them straight.  I'd be willing to give it another try, but if it didn't impress me then I'd probably give up on it.

After 2+ Plays: I revisited this game after several years, and I can definitively say that will be my last play.  The ridiculous scoring was not any better on the second play, and I found it even less tolerable than the first time around.  There are three different things you can do during your turn, but six ways to score points.  Am I the only one who finds that silly?  The convoluted scoring serves only to hide the fact that this is a boring entry in a genre already suffering from overcrowding.  Dropped rating from 5 to 2.

RATING: 9
I finally got to play the finished game! The commercial run is due out November 1 and I highly recommend it! The movement across and over the board is interesting and has lots of possibilities, and will require plenty of play to figure out the winning strategies. The quality of the bits is good to excellent, with only a couple of small problems. The box is a little light, and the back of the hexes are not printed which gave me a bit of a "raw" impression. But you don't use those in play, so who cares. It was a year ago that this game was all the buzz, I am definitely buying a copy!

Quite a deep game, requires you to think carefully about where you play as next turn, you might need the support that the previous piece provides.  The normal rules game goesn't involve personal confrontation, it's practically a Euro!  But with a fantasy battle theme.  Very good fun.

Pretty good artwork. Game play is simple with good strategical considerations. The cards may be better represented with tiles. Gives a better euro feel though not necessary.

RATING: 7
The mechanics of the game is simple.  It takes little effort to learn the game.  The game has only 4 simple phases each turn.  Players have to acquire more followers so that they can deploy more powerful troops, forts and magic cards every turn.  However, acquiring more followers costs money and it will be wasteful if you have too many followers without having troops to deploy in the game.  

The advance rules provides more interactivity to the game as players can pay to fly to attack lands that does not lie adjacent.  It also provides more power to mage followers which provides more balance to the followers in the game.

Good points:
The game has 2 sets of rules which makes the game has higher replayabilty.  Besides the boardgame is 'created' on the fly and that makes it even more replayable.

Bad points:
The basic rules has little interactivity with fellow players.  Players can block each others path and that is all about the interactivity in the game.  The mage followers are a little too powerless compared to craftmen and swordsmen followers.

RATING: 6
A surprisingly good game, which was a nice surprise as I bought it mostly out of curiosity and interest in the theme.

The game (advanced rules, at least) forces you to balance your immediate benefit with the potential help you'll provide your opponents. The components, depending on which one you are looking at, range from acceptable to above average, but for a game from a small manufacturer with no other titles (are they even still in business?) that's a small price to pay.

This is an excellent game that I have been playing again and again discovering new strategies and adjusting to the strategies of different partners. This is a game that keeps you awake at night with new ideas that keep popping in your mind. At first it might look like the game is easy, and you know how to play it, but wait until you play a few more games with different opponents to discover there is so much room for improvement in your strategies. Every time you play it - the game is different, and unless one of the players is really inexperienced (has never played it before) - the fight for the win lasts till the end. I am still figuring out how my 9-year old son manages to beat me half the time with a strategy that I do not believe in.
Lots of fun playing for both kids and adults.

We're still playing the basic game, mostly because it seems like the advanced game with 5 players would add too much time. I tried a new strategy (not hiring new followers after a certain point in the game) which would have worked if someone else hadn't gotten the magic horn just in time to foil my devious plans. If I had only had 2 more mages or knights!

I had a few component problems -- some scuffed and scratched hexes and the wrong color of glass stones. The game's designer saw the note I wrote here about it and offered to send me replacements, and I got them in a few days. Great customer service!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game is somewhat portrayed as RPG-ish, but the game is not really this at all.  At its heart. the game is a solid and interesting area control game.  The random hex board ensures the game is different each time.  There is a key in deciding which characters to take, but this is somehwat dictated by a random card draw.  As you play you have to react to what you have in hand and what is on the board.  All this said, the game is primarily in the players' control and not based on luck.  Players need to plan according to turn-order as the first to play can either have an advantage or put themselves in serious jeopardy.  

The game components are very good but not quite to the level that the price suggests.

RATING: 10
Great game, kids love it. Very lovingly packaged and assembled, the hand-made portion of manufacturing done with amazing quality and aesthetics (thanks, Andrei!) (The hand-made version is worth way over the $50 IMHO). A very high replay value. The random field and the random cards place a high demand on one's strategy adaptability. I have learned a lot and there is still so much more to learn about the game dynamics. The normal and advanced rulesets together make for a great package of actually two games in one (I was a bit sceptic about the normal ruleset as the test run only included the advanced rules; the advanced ruleset requires more depth in strategical thinking and more mathematical approach to the game, the normal is slightly quicker to play and allows younger participants to enter, so after all I do play both). Rating +0.5 --- it's pretty addictive :-) another +0.5 -- for two rulesets in one package.

Played once.  Every player rated it a 7.  Some thought and strategy involved, but if the cards don't go your way, you seem to spin your wheels and have a tough time catching up.

Interesting little area control game. You need to have the right cards to conquer (buy) hexes. The hexes give you money that let you buy more and better units and also figure into final scoring. It is fun, but not really something I think the people I play games with would enjoy, at all. So, it is getting sold.

I enjoyed this game, I like the theme and the artwork, it was a good sized full game with very experienced gamers, this was new to more than one of us, still it moved at a brisk pace. The strategy is brutally simple and becomes more apparent with each round. it breaks down into a fair amount of number crunching, but still retains a good deal of charm, I give it higher marks for the modular board, as that lends to very good customization possibilities in the future. It remind me in play of Heroes of Might and Magic and this is a good thing: get your guys to support your army, and plan your moves. no direct pvp combat is also welcome to me, and lend this game an extra bit of light strategy fun, good game it left me wanting another play, and on a Con weekend, that is high praise indeed.

Very good game.  Has abstract strategy roots, but the theme is implemented well and is fun.  There is a solid amount of resource management and planning.  We like the basic game a lot--enough to probably never try the "advanced" game.

I really want to rate this game higher. After 3 plays I have had a lot of fun and there is lots of tension and good decision making. I have only played the basic rules, and want to try the advanced soon. In the basic rules I really think the Flood card is totally broken. If this problem is resolved with advanced rules this could be a 9.

*update* Advanced rules are definitely tighter and more fun for me, if a bit more brain-burny as well. Either ruleset is fun and engaging though, I think this is definitely a diamond in the rough.

RATING: 3
Before it appears that I'm just completely bagging on this game, I will state the following- I recieved a review/demo copy from Mr. Burago and I will do my best to impart a fair, reasonable, and accurate comment on the game without bias.  CONQUEST OF THE FALLEN LANDS is not at all the fantasy/adventure game you might be lead to believe that it is by the advertisements and the generally well-executed faux-anime artwork.  CotFL owes much more to abstract, numbers-heavy Euros like SAMURAI or other area control titles that emphasize methodical, mathematic gameplay.  All the fantasy elements are very abstracted and as a result fans of mechanics over theme will likely find some interest here as Mr. Burago's design is solid and offers some pretty tough choices (particularly in the advanced game) and a very low luck element.  A three piece resource management system proves to be a pretty interesting and sensible way to handle cardplay and the process of having to build up resources and board position to eventually claim the more valuable territories can be grueling to say the least.  Frankly stated, this isn't the kind of game I tend to enjoy but I do think that fervent Eurogamers shouldn't be scared away by the theme and graphics at all- if you like Knizia, Kramer, or even Colovini games you'll likely find something good here.  The production is well done (printed in Russia!) and although I believe that $50 retail is a little high, for an essentially DIY product CotFL is presented exceptionally well.  My main problem with the game is, in fact, the lack of a solid theme/mechanics connection as the game could essentially be about anything- there's no sense of narrative, specificity, or atmosphere whatsoever.  To Mr. Burago's credit, he designed the game with a more Euro-oriented audience in mind but at the end of the day if a game promises monster fighting and treauring collecting then I expect a "War Golem" card to be more than just numbers on a card.  I usually shy away from "it's not for me, but someone else might like it" comments but in this case, I think it's entirely appropriate.

This was surprisingly good. I played the "normal" version with the designer at lunch. I really liked the flow. You can, for the most part, exactly plan your next move, which really keeps things moving if people actually do that. I really like how you choose what kinds of workers (or whatever they're called) to invest in, and that dictates your ability to play cards. And since there's no way to accelerate getting workers, pretty much everyone is on even footing in terms of raw capacity to play cards. I.e. there's no rich get richer problem. There's also not much of a kingmaker problem since people tend to have to do what's best for themselves--like it or not. My only resrevation is with the magic system. It's one of those things where there are cards that completely permute the normal rules of the game, which make it completely impossible to predict what might happen. Some of the magic cards are minor incremental effects, and I wish they all were, but some are more drastic, and those I think I could do without. But to be fair, that's a minor point on what is all-in-all a very solid game. Having heard the rules to the "advanced" version, I have no real inclination to try it, but probably would if others wanted to. The designer expressed regret in choosing the term "advanced", as it's really just a variant (and less predictable, which means less planning, and to me means ironically "less" advanced). Oh yeah, and to be super nit-picky: the board looks a little unappealing with cards put on the spaces. I don't have a good alternative though.

I have mixed reactions of this game having played it twice.  The game for me was like having a great night drinking with a hangover in the morning.  The opening and middle phase of the game is great, but I felt it had definite end game issues. This most likely was caused by me for poor moves in the opening, but never the less, at a certain point I had lost, and it felt as if I should quit the game right then.  Even though it is not over, you can predict basically right there who is going to win.  If the game ended right there then great -- but it seemed to drag on with no real struggle left for the multiple of players.The game is an 8, but with the end game issues I would give it a 6, making it a 7.  If these end game issues is solved then the game is a definite 8.

Comments after 1 play. A land-grab game which uses resources to convey abilities to the players. Because of this, the endgame ramps up fairly quickly. I understood the mechanics and baisc strategies fairly quickly, so was able to play a competitive game during my first try.

Surprisingly fun!  I like that victory points and money are the same thing, so you need to make sure your purchases will have a good return on investment.  There's lot of fun position/maneuvering and the random board layout ensures it always plays out differently.  It even comes with essentially two different rule sets, although I've only played the "base" rules.

Pleasant area control game based on worker control and card play. Would play it again but it doesn't have massive replay ability. The key is to be very efficient with your card play. But because of random card draw there is some luck to the game. It really bonkers down at the end when everybody is struggling to do one last action.

RATING: 8
Players hire troops to attempt to conquer vast areas of a "fallen land".  Players on their turn can spend 5 gold to recruit either a mage, warrior or blacksmith, which is added to a growing pool of personnel.  Then these recruits can be "tapped" to deploy troops and fortifications out onto a Catan-like hexmap playing area, conquering it and earning income equal to the conquest value.  Mages can be used to toss spells around.  Game ends when the board fills up, or conquests stagnate.  Most gold wins, so knowing when to stop recruiting (i.e. spending those VP's) is a tense decision to make).  Neat, simple game with nice growth and expansion feel to it, as you encroach across the board and support further conquests.  Only played the "friendly" game, but felt good and played inside an hour.  Impressive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very cool game that has a slight CCG-feel insofar as you ramp up resources then tap them to bring cards into play. But it has no direct attacking the other players. Instead you take turns placing cards, taking turf, and using the influence of your previously-placed cards to help you grab more turf. So it is a positional game at heart and it uses the cards to drive it.
 
Intersting and innovative, and probably deserving of some replay. At heart it is more chaotic spawn of Knizia's classic Samurai. Certainly worth a try, though not exactly easy to find [poor availability and high price tag].

Use your workers, wizards and warriors to activate the troop cards in your hand. The troop card conquers a hex adjacent to one you already have, and the hex earns you money to buy more workers wizards and/or warriors. Beware of getting cut off by your opponents.

The set-up is like the Settlers island, with hexes ranging from 1-12 (but that is their VP value).   And from there, it's a simple land-grab conquest game.   Your units have attack values (for the current hex) and support values (against neighbor hexes) but all players supporting values are considered.  The units are a bit bland, typical medieval stuff, but the wizard spells are slightly more interesting.   It's fun and simple, probably doesn't have much replay value, but I enjoyed it enough to play it again.  Small World would be a better choice in this genre, however.

This is a solid strategy game (advanced rules).  It can sometimes suffer from analysis paralysis which tends to bog things down with 5 players, but in general, it moves along nicely.  It's possible to get screwed by bad card draws, but there are enough opportunities to acquire cards in the game, that this can be mitigated somewhat.  At its core this game is a numbers puzzle, and that fact isn't really disguised by the theme and artwork.  For players who like lots of theme, this could be a source of disappointment, but you shouldn't let that keep you from trying this very enjoyable game.

Two plays and I'm done.  The game degrades into an AP mess. I usually play pretty quickly, but this game sucked me into the AP vortex along with everyone else due to the way its constructed.

This is one of those games where you can't plan moves until it's your turn b/c the board will have changed so much. Add to that all the roles you need to tap and the combos you need to plan and it can be a solid 5+ minutes per player per turn, so you have some seeeeeerious (e.g., 15 minutes) downtime between turns where you can't do anything. Throw in some bad card draws and I'm thinking about what I want to play next.

RATING: 6
An interesting take on the old area control genre.  Players recruit workers, mages or warriors in order to execute their plans set up by playing cards.  Cards offer different abilities (warriors, strongholds, and magic) at different levels of strength and are played to conquer hexes and retrieve monetary rewards.  The fact that each players' units aid everyone for future conquests develops interesting strategies as initial placement and following conquests have to be carefully planned in order to give yourself the maximum benefit for furture turns and not aiding others too greatly.  Conquest evokes the feeling of many games but actually meshes everything into a fresh package - meaning although some mechanics may feel familiar they are executed in such a way that you can't quite pinpoint the origin creating a very original feel.  There seems to be some issue over the expense of flying, but after playing the high price makes sense.  If your initial conquests were chosen poorly and you discover yourself quickly enclosed, although a high cost, it does allow you to in a sense reset your position and possibly close another player in. I can foresee Conquest getting quite a few plays in the future and possibly rising in rating.

Enjoyable game.  Easy to learn - quite intuitive to its theme, with the magic thrown in to make it less processional.  Couple of 5p 'advanced' version, 1 3p 'normal' - both versions look to be a viable games., and can reward thinking. I wonder if they should have been called different names rather than implying that one was better than another? Luck of the cards can be a factor as usual in this kind of thing, but is quick enough to bear here.

This is a very well-designed game that offers much fun. It starts slowly, but once you begin to accumulate followers with which to support moves to conquer areas on the board, it really picks up. Players must also pay heed to opponents' strategies because you can't just let someone waltz over a particular area of the board conquering all of the hexes surrounding the more difficult and therefore more valuable lands, else you'll find yourself quickly on the losing end when it comes to gold. The game is easy to pick up and rewards long-term strategies.

ADVANCED GAME: After three games the first player has won in a walk each time, and I am beginning to smell a significant first-mover advantage ... certainly the choice of where you make your first couple of attacks are among the most critical decisions you will make all game, and being able to go first in those circumstances is a valuable thing. Going hand-in-hand with a first move advantage is the ability to cut the other guy off from valuable lands (only partially offset by then having no choice but to lend support to another player's conquests); getting walled in is certainly a miserable experience in this game. Momentum counts for a lot -- the player that can capture two or three fields in a turn gets a real cash advantage, allowing him to purchase more cards during his turn and have even more options at hand on the following move. Fortunately, I like the things you are doing in this game -- the decision points are intriguing, the system is transparent, and there is satisfaction in putting together a run of two or three cards to snap up spaces that seemed unassailable just the previouus turn. And if there is imbalance or a runaway leader then you haven't long to wait for it to be over ... the game ticks along with decisive players, and it's fun enough (even when you get stuffed), to ask to play "just one more." And at about 45 minutes to finish a three-player game, there's usually time for another game. Still too soon to tell if there is an imbalance at the heart of this game, but it plays fast and fun enough that I'll give it another couple chances before condemning it. I do wish my cards hadn't started shredding their backs after the first play, though.

BASIC GAME: At the author's suggestion we changed over to playing the basic game and found it superior in almost every way to the advanced rules. I've adjusted my rating to a "7" on the basis of playing the basic rules with three players on the "small four player" map configuration, which yielded a very satisfying game indeed. This is the first time I can recall in thirty-five years of gaming where the "basic" game was so superior to the "advanced." I guess all those years to jumping straight into the "battle manual" in old Avalon HIll games led me astray on this one.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent game that plays very differently that you might imagine.  You are not actually fighting the other players.  It is more a Euro where you are trying to control hexes and use money to buy resources to conquer hexes before other players do.  Of course, having the most money is also the way to win.  In some ways, it is like Attika.  The issue that appeared in our game was a clear kingmaking situation that determined the path of the game and the eventual winner.  Once you play a piece, it does not move, but it does affect all the hexes around it.

Had rated it a 7.5 after the first few plays, just moved it up to a 8, cause this game rocks and my group is loving it. I moved up to 8.5 then, and then moved it again to 8.7.   Close games where it comes down to who uses some of the magic cards, and who has managed their hands the best.  The leader changes a few times near the end, which makes for an exciting game.

RATING: 7
I'm glad I finally had a chance to try this out at a game day--we used advanced rules. Initial impressions from reading the rules were: "Huh? Is this all there is? Just put down cards that equal or exceed the number on a given hex?" However, the actual play is much more involved. Each turn, a player may do as many actions as he wants to, but this is practically limited by the number of followers he has. First, he can hire a follower--mage, craftsman, or soldier, for five coins. Thereafter, he can conquer various land hexes, using troop cards from his hand, as long as his cumulative attack strength is equal or better than the printed number on the hex. However, all cards require that a number of followers be "tapped", much like mana from Magic, in order to use it. Troop cards that are deployed can be used to support subsequent conquests, including troop cards deployed by other players. Thus, it is important to plan troop deployments accordingly, as other players could use your troops to conquer a more valuable adjacent territory, and thereby gain more coins, which is the VP of this game.

There are an interesting variety of troop types, each with differing attack and support values, as well as differing follower requirements of soldiers or craftsmen. The more powerful attack troops require that more soldiers be tapped. More powerful support troops require more craftsmen. The more balanced the troops in terms of attack and support require a mix of the two. Fortifications can also augment the support value of a hex, where attacks on adjacent hexes can be launched from. Mages are required to play magic cards, which can have profound effects on the game.

As cards are played, the options become limited, so the option to hire new troops is available, but this is costly. Tapping mages pushes the cost down. It is this tension of the need to conquer to get more coins, and the need to spend coins to get more troops/followers that is the heart of the game, coupled with the fact that your deployed troops can be used by your opponent. The game is reminiscent of Samurai, where the board gets slowly filled up with troops, and instead of capturing key figures, it is about capturing the progressively more difficult, and therefore more rewarding land hexes. Fascinating in its simplicity of mechanics and depth of play. The theme is a tad thin, as this plays more like Samurai--a poor play by another player may give you the support you need to get a juicier hex--which is another abstract dealing with area enclosure, sort of like Go. The components are good, although the followers' card stock is annoyingly thin as well as the troop cards. Nevertheless, this is an excellent debut from an independent, so I am eagerly looking forward to Galaxy's Edge from this publisher.

Update (01/22/12): Initial rating an '8'. Do I want to own this? No. Do I have a sense of urgency to play this? No. Downing to a '7'.

RATING: 8
Very simple mechanics create a deep and mathy gameplay. This game is short, fun and satisfying. The only downside is the possibility of having a very bad hand because of the luck of the initial draw. Hiring Mages helps you to get rid of your bad cards, but in the first turns you simply can't have enough Mages to overcome a very bad hand while staying competitive at the same time. Players should have an optional mulligan or initial hand draft.

The key of a multiplayer game is not to be blocked by other players, so you depend greatly on what others do. I don't find this to be a problem, because you can predict the optimal and suboptimal actions of other players. Sometimes, flying one hex early in the game to overcome a block can give you the victory.

This is a self-published game, and the production is subpar: the components are durable and functional, but a bit ugly. As the cards come wrapped in rubber bands, many of them are slightly bent, but you can correct this bending them to the other side. With nicer components, this would be a 9.

RATING: 6
(Please note: Take with a grain of salt as this rating is based on only one play)-  Conquest is beautifully produced for a self-published title.  Gameplay is interesting and relatively straight forward.  I really like the "support" mechanism where your opponents' conquests support any of your own attempts in adjacent hexes.    However, as I found out poor planning at the beginning can lead you into an impossible position in the mid to late game in some board setups.  However, I believe this is more of a first game problem that is unlikely to repeat once you have a game under your belt and are more familiar with the troop cards.  My only real complaint with the game is that it seems to have a slight "rich get richer" problem where someone doing well can use their lead to acquire even more followers and then use these followers to pull even farther ahead.  This is mitigated somewhat by the "support" mechanism detailed above, and might well be a player inexperience problem and not an actual game problem.  Overall, this is a game that I thought was slightly above average (a 6), and as with most games I'd gladly try it again.

RATING: 6
Area control:variable powers:modular board

Midweight strategy AC game with planning 1 to 2 turns ahead possible (some minor 3 or 4 turn planning for bigger spots), the upside of only 1 to 2 turns is AP should be lower. 

Not much of a wargame and the theme fades off into the background once you start playing. It is similiar to Samurai in that players are vying for the same prize/spot on the board and also like Iliade in the way card play is supported from past cards played (I like this aspect in both games). Depite the comparisons it felt unique enough to stand on its own as it is quite different from both or other games. 

I thought it played well (basic game)and had a nice balance of strategy and luck.

Ok game.  Fun take that game until the end, especially if you have a player who is clearly in the lead and nobody can stop him or you could stop him but would not really benefit yourself, meaning you could fly to an area which costs 7 then play your card on a 4 scoring area - you have a loss of 3.  Very anticlimactic ending.

Conquest of the Fallen Lands is a very good abstract/area control fantasy game. Easy to learn and a simple engine, but plenty of depth and strategy here. Great appeal for younger players but enough substance to be enjoyable for adults as well. A big hit with my son, and that's always a plus for me!

RATING: 4
I very rarely will walk away from a game still in progress, but when someone new showed up 2/3 of the way through this one and was willing to step in for me, I fairly leapt across the table to get out of my seat.  One other person had already done this and a third just left the game ("I'll pass for the rest of the game").  Needless to say I doubt we'll be playing this one again.

We played the advanced game, and maybe we should have stuck with the basic game.  The major differences between the two are that other people get to use your Support and you don't automatically get replacement troop cards.  Thematically the former doesn't make any sense and it also doesn't make for a fun 5-player game as someone will surely snap up the high-valued land before it comes around to your turn again.  The latter change from basic to advanced hoses someone who is dealt bad cards, as I was, at the beginning.

I'm sure with experience I would learn to overcome these issues.  To the same point, I'm sure with plenty of meditation and practice I'd learn not to scream out in pain whenever small bits of bamboo were shoved up under my fingernails.  But I have little desire to do either.

RATING: 7
Surprisingly good filler game. You play cards in order to take spaces on the board and collect money according to the space's value. There are two twists that make this a cut above most fillers. 1) Each piece has a support value in addition to an attack value. Any player can use support values to help them take a space, so you need to be careful that your placements are not helping the other players too much. And 2) The winner is not determined by who has captured the most spaces or most valuable spaces, but whomever has the most money. You get money by capturing spaces, but many actions in the game cost money. This game is really about securing a steady income through expansion and controlling expenses. Positioning and efficiency. Surprising combo, for a "conquest" game.

Nice enough game which demands a thoughtful, look ahead sort of playstyle.  The problem is that the random factor makes it very difficult to look ahead.  We played the advanced game but, after some discussion, we think we will give it another go with the basic game.  This may be one of those rare games where the basic version is a better game.  Rating may change.

Based on 5 plays of the Basic Game.  It's quick and easy to learn, yet there's still a fair amount of strategic decision-making involved.  The luck of the draw can be a tad excessive (particularly early in the game), but not enough to hurt my impression of it.  The actual mechanics scale fairly seamlessly from 3 to 5 players.  However, each additional player adds a little extra downtime, so I prefer it with 3.

Very poor production values but actually a pretty interesting game.

Don't know how balanced it is as some cards seem so much better than others and getting a bad draw can be horrible.

Also got very slow towards as each turn was a fairly complex puzzle of how you could use your cards/resources to max your money.

Still, despite all that it is well worth a try if it's your bag.

RATING: 2
It's horrible, it's a pure abstract game that has absolutely no relation to medieval warfare. 

If you start very badly, you can screw up yourself badly. That is probably my case since I ended up with less gold that what I started with.

There is an unwritten design rule which say that a resource used to purchase stuff cannot be used also as a scoring resource. This is not respected a all in this game since your gold is your victory points. And it's one of the reason that this game is bad. Rich gets richer.

Players try to surround more valuable areas so that they could group attack larger point value territories. I don't know if it was me, but the territories I wanted to surround always got stolen before I had a chance to take them, or I really draw bad cards making it very hard to capture stuff. I had to split my group once because they was nothing I could conquer anymore, but that is something you cannot afford to do in this game unless you want to lose.

So for those who are expecting a war game here forget it, it's just a plain abstract euro game where you surround stuff. A bit like Reiner Knizia's Samurai.

So on my point of view it's a very boring game.

VERY good design, lovely artwork.  I greatly admire any game that has 1 page of rules Could take a long while to master, and very challenging depending on your opponents.

On a modular, hexagonal board, are tiles numbered from 1 to 12 which represent the VP of the tiles. Players may recruit one mage, worker or swordsman per turn at a cost of 5 gold, which allows the player to pay the casting cost of their cards. Cards have an attack value and support value. If the attack value of the card and support value of all adjacent cards equal the number on the tile, then the player earns that amount of gold. Mages allow one to cast spells, or draw cards for cheaper cost. 

***

It's a fun game, though there is a little downtime while waiting for others to take their turn. It's pretty simple to play, and there are some tactical possbilities, since you have to expand to where your other cards are, and you could get sealed off. 

***

I have played the normal and advanced rules. However, we played the normal game wrong, since you are not forced to play adjacent to your troops. In the normal game, you start only one troop, while in the advanced game you put down two troops, but your subsequent plays must be adjacent to those first two troops, and the turn order is reversed in the second placement.

RATING: 8
Although I'm not a big fan of board games in general I enjoyed this game very much.

The board is interesting and dynamic (being completely modular - you create a new map for each game), gameplay is balanced and interesting, and despite the element of chance that adds surprise and fun there is a big demand on strategic planning (as opposed to just throwing dice).

The background story is nice, but overall not an important factor in the game at all. I think it's purpose is to make the whole game more aesthetically appealing, and in that respect it really shines.

This one blew me away.  I don't know what I was expecting but whatever it was, it wasn't this.  Such an elegant system, so much hidden depth.  The production value is deceptive, the artwork is deceptive; at it's core, this is an abstract game with a nice helping of math and it's SO satisfying when you pull off a coup and make some magic happen.

A very abstract game of positioning, with some blocking included as well. 

The basic game runs very smoothly; With four players it takes only an hour. The advanced game is more fun but has quite a bit of downtime; It's definitely not suitable for five players.

The Plague card does not fit in at all, and should be removed. The graphics are okay but the materials used are of low quality, even the box is flimsy.

I really like this game because the (Basic) game is so easy to learn, has a different set-up every time (with hexagonal tiles), and yet requires thought and careful  moves. No charts for resolving battles, and the conflict mainly comes into effect when rivals vie to conquer open territory adjacent to one another. Very clever game, obviously inspired by others, but put together to be its own creation. Traded for, December 2011.

You will play it once and leave it on the shelf forever. It doesn't have enough going on. It has the makings of a sweet game: it has overlapping player turns which is great, and an interesting action point system which should in theory allow for differing strategies. However, every card is qualitatively equal to every other card and there is no combo potential, which invalidates the apparent diversity of options. Furthermore your vps are also your main resource, and the reward for capturing areas is always proportional to the difficulty of capturing it, so in the end you have an extremely bland time.

RATING: 6
Preliminary rating based on 1 play of basic game.  I actually liked the game more than the rating might suggests.  I do want to play it a few more times.  My main complaint is that I feel the first early player(s) (particularly the first) have a big advantage.

RATING: 6
I liked what the designer was going for here, but there really seemed to be a lot of player seating issues.  If it happened to be your turn right after someone made a big tile conquerable, that was a huge boon.  Also, card drawing was a huge random factor.  The game was pretty dry for a sword-and-sorcery theme, too.

Amazingly simple game, that is still entertaining and hard to play. Although some luck might affect the outcome, you still want to try your best and at points you can get a second wind by conquering the right fields. Biding your time to conquer multiple fields in a row may be the way to go, or may be your doom if another player does take them. Really entertaining.

Interesting mix of mechanics. The short game is sufficiently long and interesting while maintaining a good pace. Does suffer from a bit of downtime and a poorly designed mechanic regarding buying things and then playing units which generally makes one play out their turn twice. We just set the income aside til the end of the players turn to avoid spending money on the same turn you earn it.

One six player game.

My first game of this wasn't that positive because some of the players were taking the game way too seriously, which led them to take way too long during their turn. This is a quick playing, elegantly designed game.

I must play this game again with perhaps less players or more importantly, more appreciative players that don't drag the game.

The other two players seemed OK with it, so it may be just a taste thing.

--Aug2007-- Mostly a tile-laying game, I guess; but the mechanics are clean and easy to grasp.  After one play, I wonder how significant the cards drawn are: it looks (naively, I admit) like one's success is at the mercy of one's draw.  Nonetheless, it was an engaging experience.  I'd be happy to own a copy.
--Oct2007-- My children seem amused; we'll see if it has staying power.

While this one looks interesting and even a bit comical, its game play turned out to be anti-climatic.  Downtime was a factor in a 5 player game.  Often in between my turns the board would change so drastically, and become so crowded that my options were rather abismal.  Several of the glass player pieces were very close in color, and the cards are well drawn but laying them on what is initially a nice map, clutters the look.  We played this first game with the advanced rules, so I am willing to try out the non-advanced rule set, to see if it has more to offer.

The advanced rules should be played from the outset, don't bother with the beginner ones.

In my first play, I really enjoyed the game, the next game I liked it as well, but my third game I felt was dominated by cards (other people made mention of that while playing the other two games).

The cheap guys are just plain better than the expensive ones, and there aren't enough of them.  It plays like Magic or Dominion, except you have absolutely no control over your draw.

Therefore, it's more of a beer and pretzels type game -- play it with a grain of salt.

Neat game.  I only played it once.  I might not have understood some of the rules or strategy, but I really liked it.  I think my rating will only go higher.  Those that say the game is a lot like Reiner Knizia's Samurai are probably on the right track.  I like a lot of older fantasy-themed games, but the newer ones with all the plastic figures and longer time requirements seem to be a bit much.  However, the card-drawing can seem a bit random when all you have are support and magic-based card and not much for attacking.  The artwork is very nice.

This game is almost complete.  I'd be very interested in playing this when either the designers or some other wise fellow comes along and finishes the design.  Right now there are a number of cool elements that do in fact work, but these are just the wheels of the machine.  When I play a card game I expect to get a bad hand, as this is mostly a card game in disguise, it can be easy to forget when the board is laid out in front of you.  If a hand goes wrong in this game you have to spend your way out of it.  This is overly costly as other players may just get what they want or can at least get what they can use hoping to draw something more worthwhile and plannable for the next round.

If you could divide the magic, offense and defense cards into their own decks I could at least pretend that I was doing something to help myself out.  Plus the 7 points to fly seems extreme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The trick of the game is that you have to play offense and defense in terms of the territories you defeat because once troops are down, they are down. And anyone can use surrounding hex support values to conquer another hex. It was a very cool dynamic of cooperative area control wrapped in a nice war theme.

This game plays 3-5 and I was a bit skeptical about the three player game but it turned out to be a winner. I really want to play this again soon. Great pt. about the game it played in a little over an hour. Bad pt. about the game is that Patrick won hands down, with Lev coming in a not too distant second and me bring up the rear. Back that thang up!

Meh.  It's an area control game where you build up power and try to get greater rewards by gathering up support from adjacent hexes.  While there is a bit of strategy and game balance in what followers to get and what cards to take, it's your run-of-the-mill area control game that has very little that I haven't already seen before. I'm glad that I've played it so I wouldn't have to buy it.

RATING: 6
Played with the advanced rules with 4 and the game moved along very nicely.  We made a small tweak to speed play where you would put aside your treasure money until the end of the turn, but could buy new people with the money you started the turn with.  That kept you from having to plan everything out first, and just stumble through, buying guys as needed.   Interesting game that I look forward to trying again.

Second play - Not as interesting as the first.  We played with 5 and the game felt much more sluggish. Also, since I had experienced the interactions in the game, it wasn't as enjoyable.  Fun first play, humdrum second play.

this rating is for the normal version, which seems better balanced.  the "advanced" actually made luck a bigger factor in the game, and would be just a 6 or 7 for me.  area control game with some maneuvering and risk estimation.  one of my favorite area control games, by dint of having a good light mix of strategy with tactics, and quantifiable stats rather than the convolution that makes decisions in a lot of similar games worse (i'm not a big fan of "well, option A seems only marginally different from B, C, and D, so i guess i'll go with my mental lottery", and this game manages to avoid this cleanly).

hex based game of  territory recapturing, vaguely reminscent of settlers, a clever little mechanic of support and attack, each hex has a number , to equal this number is to capture it,  all support from all adjacent hexs applies as well as any attack you actually bring to bear, units are purchased with a recurring basis of craftsmen warriors and magicians, magicians power spells and more exotic troops, craftsmen  fortifications and  some specialist troops and wariors the big hitters, a balance must be maintained as each supporting person costs 5 money and money is what wins the game, each hex conquered reaps its value in coin, fun and  simple good for a gateway i think, short playing time and attractive (fn somewhat  flimsy) componants, well worth a look

I really enjoyed this one.  The tension between helping yourself without helping others really makes for some fun and different decisions.  The components are really nice, especially considering the self published nature of the game, and it is an all around fun game.  I knocked the rating down by 1/2 a point because after a couple more plays, we found that even with a starting hand of 8 cards, it is really possible to get knocked around a bit by bad hands of cards.  This isn't a huge problem, but it does take a slight bit of enjoyment from the game.

RATING: 5
Rating based on only one play. Full Disclosure: I am a friend with Kirill, the "publisher". The game has nothing that hasn't been seen in other games, but combines them in an interesting way. Playing first in the turn order means you can grab the best hexes on the early turns, but it also means that by the time the later players go, they can use your placements to their advantage. Played a 5 player game, I was in slot 4. The three different kinds of followers seem balanced, though you will need some  Warriors and Craftsmen to do anything. It would be interesting to see how various "extreme" strategies would play out. Basically, this is a very mathematical game. The current components are also less than ideal in my opinion, as playing the cards to the hexes covers up the vlaue of them, requiring you to move them to give out the payout, and I think the game would work better if the number of stones you placed on your hexes represented the support value, instead of having to read the numbers off of the cards. I did like the positional aspect of the game, where you can cut off opponents from various parts of the board, forcing them to expend Mages and coins to fly to those areas. A solid effort that could use a bit of tweaking.

Update - After Richard Garfield got involved, giving suggestions, my rating has dropped significantly. The removal of the positional aspect makes the game very pedestrian. Perhaps the "advanced" rules are better, but...

An tactical area control game with a fantasy/military theme. Tension quickly ramps up as players vie for position and get in each other's way. Cards dictate tactics but there is still opportunity for thinking a few turns ahead. The endgame can drag a bit as the last of the board is cleaned up, players debate whether to spend money (which are also victory points) to expand, and there can be some kingmaking. The random setup and card draw keep each game different though not radically so.

Played twice, it is another game that suffers from the "Can't get cards, can't play" syndrome. In my first game it was a tight game, and no one pulled ahead, in my second, two of us could not get cards, instead wasted turns drawing and trying to do something, while our opponents took turns racking up huge points. Went from my "might own" list to "meh, what's the point" list.

Main game mechanic relies a lot on luck of the draw of cards, with the fortification cards almost essential in taking certain lands. Player interaction is low. Unfortunately, the game is AP-prone and downtime can be very long. For this reason, the game is not scalable to higher player counts. Artwork is mediocre at best and game component quality is low.

This is in essence an area control game and not the RPG dungeon crawling hack/slash title the art may lead you to believe.  I actually quite enjoyed my first play of this, especially the tactical nature in terms of managing what type of troops to use and planning your next one in advance.  I will agree that how well you do is too dependent on the luck of the draw.  If you cannot obtain the more powerful cards then it is almost impossible for you to go after the higher point valued tiles.  I like the simpleness of the rules, but a part of me also crave for a bit more depth and variation.

Conquest is kind of neat thematically, but it blows in practice.  My first three games were all were decided mostly by first-turn placement.  Placement is prone to suicide bombing, like Settlers on a too-small board.

In each game at least two of us were out of the running within 3-4 turns but were stuck playing it out for the rest of the 80 minutes.  Waste of time.

So far, I've only played the basic game.  I would like to try the advanced game soon.  Something about CotFL excites me into thinking a little tweak of a variant would make it a brilliant game.  Still, what's there is a card-driven, abstract strategy game.  Like with [thing=21882]Blue Moon City[/thing], having the bravery to cycle your cards to hunt for more useful ones can really pay off.  Unlike [thing=21882]BMC[/thing], though, you get back half as many cards as you cycle.

After 1 Play: A fairly standard Euro-game with a fantasy theme.  I liked the game well enough and would like to play it again to see if can seperate itself from the crowd based on it's mechanics.  As is, the only memorable thing about it is the theme, and not because it is particularly interesting, but because it it is so seldom found in Euros.

After 2+ Plays: A second play did nothing to alter my opinion.  Solid, but unremarkable.

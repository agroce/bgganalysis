I'm very impressed that they turned a coin dozer into a viable boardgame mechanic--kudos!  The game is pretty simple and accessible.  The turns are quick and relatively non-taxing.  We just saw the leader run away--far away--with no real way to catch him and very little hidden information to make the endgame interesting.

Very easy to learn and play. Offers some interesting choice and the dexterity aspect to it is a fun little mechanic. There's a bit of a runaway leader problem; the game tries to address it by adding a limiter but it doesn't seem to work as well as intended, especially in a 2-player game.

RATING: 5
Lots of positives here:

* A limited choice of actions (a highly-manageable four)
* Several ways to get VPs (but not in overly complicated ways like Hawaii or Tzolkin, e.g.)
* Just enough strategy and tactics
* No player mats (hooray!)
* A good theme
* Can be played just for fun or more seriously
* A fun-factor (sorely lacking in many current games) in the quarry device

The game weighs a ton, and its components are of the absolute highest quality. Unfortunately, it wasn't as much fun as I anticipated, and players can easily cheat in the quarry. Overall, somewhat "blah"; still, this one deserves a lot more attention, IMHO.

Rating as a family game. Excellent introductory euro for younger family members. Not too much to think about, race aspect draws in younger boys, the quarry/pusher adds excitement (randomness). An attractive package when all put together, which offers a couple of ways to play but decisions are largely kept simple enough for younger players. Would be too light for seasoned gamers, however.

There's one very good idea in this game : the pusher to push stones into the quarry. This is a system that is as nice as the tower in wallenstein. Even here you have a good look at the chances of getting any stone. But the rest of the game is somewhat old-fashioned.

This is a very enjoyable game.  It is light and approachable. Yet, the decisions feel meaningful enough for me to enjoy repeated plays of the game.  The quarry mechanism has been well received by everyone I have played it with.  It is a gimmick that works well with crowds that I play the game with.

RATING: 3
There was a lot of promise early on in this game. I was fascinated by the way every single aspect of the game was essentially you playing chicken with the other players, waiting to see who would set up the person next to them. Then the game started to reveal its true colors and the flaws started to show up. First of all the repetition was massive, it was tedious seeing the same cycle play out round after round. Then we started to realize everyone was stockpiling small stones because it felt like a wasted turn every single time you would push them. They seemed too small to have any real impact on the board unless there was a perfect setup. The race to the finish felt like a whimper because it starts to become obvious who will be able to move the last few steps or place the last tiles, so everyone just waits in a holding pattern trying to rack up any little points they can before someone decides "maybe I'm winning" and triggers the game end. Most of the mechanisms in Via Appia work, I just thought they'd be more interesting. Sadly, this game falls into one of the biggest board game sins of all...it's boring.

The family played our first game of this tonight and we found it tremendous fun.  Yea it has that game mechanic gimick, but nonetheless it was a lot of fun.  We play mostly family games.  The rest of them are not interested in the hardcore games and a game like this is perfect.  Sure there is some luck involved but there is still strategy necessary to win.

The game play is a pleasant light/medium, with a decent amount of blockage against other players, who compete for income, building the road, and jostling for the lead in travel. There are enough decisions each turn to make it appealing to the gamer, but not overwhelming. The scoring is diverse, forcing players to focus on both building tiles on the road and moving into position. The other two actions, to quarry or take income, set up these scoring opportunities. The mechanic of pushing the stones through the quarry and off the wagon is unique, but wondering if the novelty will last. It does offer somewhat of a challenge, demanding an eye for the right opportunity to push off the stones. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A slightly gimmicky game with the quarry stone push. A lot of waiting for opponents to fill up the quarry FOR you, but of course no one is willing to do the grunt work for the benefit of others. 
Good for a few laughs for a light game.

An interesting family-level game with a really neat gimmick.  Also some interesting timing decisions in when to do things, as beating other players to the punch (and not setting anyone else up) is very important.

If you've looked at any of the images, you'll know that the fun gimmick is pushing discs into one side of a board of discs, hoping to make other discs fall out the other side (if you've ever played the "pusher" carnival games where you put in a token, hoping that token will push other tokens out, that's what's going on here).  This is a pretty fun part of the game, as nothing is ever a sure thing with this action, and you definitely don't want to set the next player up by loading it for them.

The rest of the game isn't really mind blowing, but it's a nice combination of familiar mechanisms.  Again, timing is huge as you always want to beat other players to certain things.

I can see this game being a bit frustrating with 4 players, just because the timing issues are going to get out of hand with people getting to do too much between your turns.  For that reason, this seems like it would be best with 3, and is still pretty good with two.

Grossly under-rated game, better than the rating suggest.  The road to Appia is a bit puzzle, bit dexterity and a whole lot of fun for the family. The game has a great theme, production value, big chunky components and and is a very accessible game that scales well and plays in about an hour..  Def. worth taking a look at. Well done.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Via Appia is a family-weight game that heavily depends on its central mechanic: the "coin pusher" or stone crusher. And it's one heck of a mechanic. Even seasoned gamers were having fun pushing their stones into the crusher and seeing what popped out. And the state of the crusher actually starts to affect a player's choice regarding what to do on a turn.

The game plays slick, with each turn having a player choose one of four options. This is clearly a family-weight game, but after one play, I'd say it's also a good bit of fun.

Update: this sat on my shelf for quite some time, and almost hit the trade list, but it might have found a home with my lunch gaming group. One play and they were eager to try it again... we'll see if this has staying power.

RATING: 5.7
Without question, this game brings a unique mechanism that I've never seen before - you acquire tokens of various sizes and try to push them through a trapezoid-shaped hopper to try and get others to push out and thus acquire tiles you want to build the Appian Way.

Other than that, this is just a multi-layered game of chicken. You're constantly wanting others to do something before you do it, because the person that goes later gets more, gets cheaper prices, etc.

While I don't mind a little chicken aspect in a game, having the whole game built around it is tiresome. I won't refuse to play the game again, but I definitely won't seek it out.

The Chuck-E-Cheese token pusher is a neat little gimmick, but there's not much of a game here.   There's little in the way of variety, so the game only has a few plays in it.   Gameplay is very dull and repetitive.  Expensive for what it is.

A penny-pushing mechanic from the seaside arcades of old is the novelty underlining this game.  I would recommend this game as a good family euro.   If you are looking for a game other than Ticket To Ride to play,with that same easy rule set and good straightforward opportunities for strategic play, then this comes highly recommended.  It is not a gamers game, but it introducers those concepts in a family-friendly way, with the penny-pushing mechanism at the heart of the appeal for everyone.

It's not very deep, but it moves at a quick pace with little downtime and the dexterity part sets it apart from other games. You probably won't play this 2 or 3 times in a row, but it offers a different feel than most games of this kind and it doesn't outstay its welcome.

RATING: 6
Bought it cheap and still underwhelmed. The basic idea of laying three tile sizes to score points is OK, the use of 7 face-up cards to get one or both incomes is OK, but the quarry shoving thing to get wooden discs to convert into tiles, that's just a gimmick and not very good. Nice for kids, but there's precious little here for any adults.

RATING: N/A
Very average points/coins optimalization game, with a nice gimmick though, but I prefer Niagara/Iguazu if I want to play a game using a similar mechanic. And for huge fans of the gimmick itself, there's always the small Ravensburger game Treasure Falls aka FlussPiraten.

RATING: 7
The first thing to strike me about this game is the quality of the production.  There is a large quantity of components, wood pieces or very thick cardboard.  This is a game that will stand up to lots of plays!

The game itself is towards the lighter end and makes for a fun family game.  Everyone enjoyed the 'penny-shove' mini game and timing the use of this appeared to be a key strategy.  We did find that when large holes appeared in the penny-shove that everyone tried to avoid using it and it became an exercise in who would break first.

This runs aground on its "no, you first" mechanics -- you want other people to finish segments of road for you, and you want other people to fill up the quarry for you.

A game like that can only work if sometimes helping other people a little helps you a LOT, so you choose to do that (instead of "I barely did myself any good, but at least I didn't help you"). I didn't find that to be the case here.

The quarry mechanic was sort of great, though; it didn't seem out of place in the Euro surroundings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There is a decent game here, with the race to build the road and get to the cities, but unfortunately it is buried underneath an annoying gimmick. You push some stones (wooden discs, actually) on one side of a platform and hope for others to fall off the other side, so that you gain the necessary building tiles. But  it's very hard to predict how it will work and it feels very random, even if it's just Physics. It's extremely frustrating when you push two or even three large and medium stones and nothing falls, then the next player gets a lot of stuff because your bad move set that up for him. As a result, strategy seems to take a back seat. Some other means of acquiring the building tiles could have made this a much better game, but the gimmick is obviously its selling point. And it doesn't even seem to work as it should, since pushing small stones most often feels like a waste.

Ebben a játékban utat kell építenünk, ami Rómától Brundisiumig tart. Ehhez el kell mennünk a kőfejtőbe,majd az onnan kibányászott köveket addig faragjuk, mígnem lapos útburkolattá nem változtatjuk. Miután kész a lap, már építhetjük is az utat, amin elindulhatunk Brundisiumba.

A saját körünkben következő lehetőségek közül kell választanunk egyet:
1. Megfordítunk egy bevétellapot, amin további két lehetőség közül választhatunk: pénzt kapunk a paravánunk mögé, vagy köveket, amiket a paravánunk elé helyezünk,
hogy mindenki jól lássa a készletünket. Ha már csak három, vagy annál kevesebb lap közül tudunk választani, megkapjuk a pénzt és a követ is. Aki az utolsó lapot
veszi el, kap további egy lapkát, ami a bányászatnál ad lehetőséget egy további bányászásra.
2. Megyünk a kőbányába, és követ bányászunk. A korábban megszerzett egyik kövünket elhelyezzük a kőbánya végébe, és a tolófával megtoljuk azt. Ezt kétszer hajtjuk végre, és ha ügyesek és szerencsések vagyunk, a másik végén lepotyognak a korábban odahelyezett kövek, és ezekért cserébe azonos színű, de már kifaragott (lapos) útburkolati elemet vehetünk el. Ez a toló lap egyedi más játékban nem található meg. 
3. Építjük az utat a kifaragott útburkolati elemek közül legfeljebb 2 darabbal. A játékban három különböző kő van. Szürke a legkisebb, őt követi méretben a fehér, és végül a natúr színű a legnagyobb. Ha egy lapot teszünk le, megkapjuk annak pontértékét, (1, 3, vagy 5
pontot), de ha két követ építünk le, akkor a pontokon kívül kapunk 1 sesterciust is.Az útra csak adott számú és típusú lapot lehet leépíteni. Amikor leépítünk egy
vagy két lapot, kapunk minden lapért egy jelölőt, amelyek plusz pontokat érnek a játék végén.
4. Utazhatunk a figuránkkal a megépített úton. Ha egy lapot halad, 1 sesterciust;ha kettőt, 3 sesterciust; és ha 3 lapot halad, akkor 6 sesterciust fizet a közös készletbe.Természetesen csak megépített útszakaszon haladhatunk. Csak szabad kis vagy közepes méretű lapra érkezhetünk, illetve, ha nagy lapra érkezünk, azon legfeljebb két játékos figurája lehet egyszerre. Amint valamelyik játékos elér a következő, de nem az utolsó városba, elhelyezünk egy arany korongot a város mellé, és innentől kezdve a többiek olcsóbban mozognak. Ahányan beértek, annyival olcsóbban. Ahogy eléri az egyik játékos Brundisiumot, az aktuális kör még lemegy, és kezdetét veszi a végső számolás.

Ez egy könnyed családi játék, némi taktikai igénnyel.  Nem mindegy, mikor fordítunk lapot a bevételért, mikor bányászunk, mikor mozgunk, mikor építünk utat, a játék a
megfelelő időzítésről szól. A játék a Queen Games kiadásában megjelent jó minőségű és  csodaszép grafikával rendelkezik.

Purchased for theme alone. Hope game play can match it.

One play in and it's definitely not one for the serious gamer. But it's a great family game. Our boys enjoyed the quarry gimmick and the game does presents some interesting choices along the way: rush ahead to gather extra points or quarry for paving stones or money, or put those paving stones down for others to travel on? Any strategy has to include a good amount of road building though.

The family likes it, I like it, so mission accomplished.

One complaint: With so many various bits, especially small ones, that have to separated, why did Queen Games only put one bag in the box? It's a joke, right? :shake:

Second play not as much fun as first (a long time ago). Rather dull - even the Stone pushing could not save the game. In fact, that piece of "dexterity" is what broke the game for me - someone gets a few stones, next person is almost certain to get fewer than they put on. 8-(

I'll say this for Via Appia: like many recent games, it has some gimmicky gizmo at the central core of it. In this case, stones are "quarried" by pushing discs through a quarter-pusher like thing. Unlike those games, however, the gizmo is pretty cleverly wedded to the theme and actions of the game. They didn't just set it on top of the same boring game we've already played a million times without the gizmo. The game itself is pretty light and breezy, and certainly cool too look at. It's weird, though, that despite its lightness we had some pretty basic rules questions that weren't answered by the rulebook. As a family game, this is fine, but nothing I'm clamoring for.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun game, lighter-weight euro-style game with this little disc-pushing mechanic that is strongly reminiscent of those coin-pushing games in the arcade where they rest on the edge and you drop another coin to see if it pushes them off.  Your actions are limited to one of four choices, but each one can contribute strongly to your final victory point tally.  The rulebook isn't the clearest thing in the world.  Yes, this is a lighter game, but I had to watch a clip of Rahdo Runs Through It to make sure I was playing correctly (which I wasn't).  Other than that, fun game, cool components.  It's a winner.

Fun light game that plays in about an hour. Has a unique dexterity component to the game where you push stones (wooden discs) into a table full of them to make other stones fall off the far edge that you can trade in for tiles and money.  The game is about helping to build the Appian Way.

I love the gimmick this game uses. The pusher games at the carnival were my favorite thing. Otherwise the game is alright. A bit of a race to build roads to the cities and gathering the stones is pretty neat. Nothing fantastic, nothing offensive.

Light family game that offers something different in its randomizer gimmick. Plays quickly with low downtime and simple turn structure. Recommended.

Update: as a strategy game, this appears to be about managing tempo to your advantage as when it is not, your turns feel like they are simply setting someone else up for a better payout. I find that incredibly frustrating, personally.

Top theme, plays out really well - especially once you've sorted out the rules (and they're hardly difficult!).  Getting income, crushes stones into tiles, build roads with the tiles, travel the roads... genius! Any game with an arcade 'shove penny' mechanic has to be great though doesn't it?

----- Preliminary thoughts -----

If you strip the coin drop mechanic from this game, it becomes an average game with nothing standing out.

The game is too light and too simple, most decisions seem rather obvious and the quarry mechanic seems to be both the difference maker and the point of interest.

If you like this mechanism, you might enjoy it... at least for some games.

I would still like to play it to confirm these first impressions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Light family game entirely based on the coin pusher gimmick. Every action (pushing, moving, building, income) is chosen mainly by deciding what kind of a position you want to leave for the next player to exploit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Look past the penny-shove mechanic that is the game's selling point, and you've a very tight game of turn-ordering where - whichever option you choose - you are balancing your own benefit against what you might confer on the player to your left.

The rock-crusher very much falls into the same category with the added bonus of being novel and enjoyable without being random. More games need a feature like this.

[b]Via Appia[/b] was traded away in a math trade 5/15/14 with Drizzt. (Received 1775:Rebellion)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]My initial thought were pretty accurate, this is a beautifully produced game with some strategy. After multiple plays the game felt very samey and eventually the rock crushing mechanic was not enough of a draw to get this one to the table. Via Appia also suffers from a similar problem as Kingsburg; about 3/4 of the way through the game you pretty much know who is going to win. There are not enough hidden points in the game to add much doubt as to who is going to win. Add to the fact that it really doesn't play well with 2 and this game ended up languishing on our shelves for a while before I traded it.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]First of all this is a beautifully produced game, everything is top notch. The rock "crushing" part of the game is the highlight, the rest of the game is okay.
There is some light strategy in this game. This game plays best with 3 or 4, I would not recommend it as a 2p game (there seems to be a runaway leader problem.)

Overall I would recommend this game to families looking for a light weight game everyone will enjoy. I think this game would work well with younger children (I would say 6+).[/i]

Getting points for building the most road and being the fastest to travel that road make for standard Euro fare. The fun part of the game (that elevates it from an ordinary 6) is the push-the-rocks gadget which reminds you of the fairground game that suckers you in to playing coin after coin as a kid, because those coins just have to fall now, right? The rocks that fall get you the building tiles used to score the afore-mentioned points, upon which you spend coins to race along it. The decision each turn is whether to get income (money or pushing rocks), use the pushing rocks to get building tiles out of the gadget, build the tiles if you don't think the time's right for pushing, or move along the road so you're not blocked off. It's a pretty simple decision tree so there's not much to it, but it was fun enough, although perhaps a tad long for what it is.

Via Appia is a game whose gimmick is using discs to physically push other discs off of a ledge.  Over the course of the game, players can earn differently-sized discs, and later use them in the same fashion as one of those coin-push games that you find in amusement park arcades.  The hope is to push one or more discs off the other end of the platform, which give you stones that you can use to pave the titular Via Appia.  Players get points for paving the road, majorities for each section of the road, and for moving their pawn down completed sections of the road fastest.  Honestly, aside from the disc-pushing mechanic the game didn't stand out that much.  However, the disc-pushing does get an A for originality, and is much more interesting than the only other game that I've seen do something similar, Niagara.

RATING: 7
After some games of some higher difficulty (like Edo or Lancaster), this is clearly again in the 'light' sector. It's not bad and doesn't take long to play, but for me it could use some 'modules' to spice things a little bit up.

Timing at the stone quarry is everything in this game. If you put your stones in and nothing comes out, a lot will fall out for the player comming behind you. So if you notice it won't work, it's probably better to stop after 1 stone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
At first I was worried that the quarry mechanism was just a gimmick. But it turns out to be a very good gimmick and being able to "read" the stones to see what might fall is actually a significant skill in the game.

Also, I was worried that the play would remain simply tactical without any strategic considerations. While the tactical play is certainly present, strategic play really seems to be important as well (perhaps even more so when playing with more than two players).

In the end, the different turn options really mesh well together and have players jockeying for position -- sometimes trying to take the lead and other times deliberately letting someone else go first to set up a better move down the road. (Pun intended.)

A game I have wanted to play for a while but never got the chance since it wasn't too well received. I honestly found this to be a snooze fest. I yawned 5 times in the hour it took to play.

RATING: 4
This game works like one of those machines in an arcade where you put a coin in and hope it pushes more coins out. In this case, coins are replaced with some nice wooden disks. You spend the disks that fall to buy stone tokens in the same size or dollars, and then build the road part of the board and walk down the road. The dexterity aspect of this game is really entertaining. I thought that would be the part I didn't like about the game, but in fact I thought it was pretty fantastic. Placing the road bits down was fine too, as there is a sloppily implemented area control aspect to that, which I also enjoyed (although I would have liked it more if we put tokens down to mark how we were doing rather than collect tokens and make it hidden information.) The tedious part was having to pay money to walk down the road. There is a poorly implemented blocking aspect in terms of the size of the stone you sit on, and it makes the game outlive it's welcome in terms of playtime.

There is an intriguing subtle dexterity element to this game with the quarry that really is unique and fun.  However, this is a euro game that needs a little planning for success.  There are just some really interesting puzzle-y type things with tile road and cart placement. On top of all that there is a race element to this and seems that there needs to be a balance for pushing and patience as you accumulate the needed stones, tile and coin.  Just a very interesting bunch of mechanics put together that was just fun as you weigh your options whether to pull the trigger on certain actions to optimize your game play.  

Update:  works great with two.  I think there is a little more a race feel.  Also, there is always a thought to put your opponent in the least advantageous situation which doesn't shine nearly as much with 4.   I almost think that this might play best at 2 but I'd like to try three at some point.  I starting to see how the quarry push works two as my brother seemed to have a better ability to get the quarry to cooperate.  Just an excellent fun easy to play game that is only growing more on me.

Not a bad game - clean and easy to understand. Should play very quick. The biggest problem I can see is about the quarry mechanic needing clarifications on how one is to use it. As it stands, there is room for a lot of maneuvers that seem wrong, but give an important edge to the player using it (kinking the quarry handle, pushing very hard, shooting stones in etc.) The scoring system is nice, but the race aspect feels a bit out of place.

The theme is pressing stones into the streets surrounding Rome, a genuinely original idea.  However, Via Appia is really just a set collection game built around an arcade coin pusher.  It all comes down to the gizmo.  If you like the gizmo, you'll like the game, because nothing else here is remarkable or problematic.  But the gizmo makes 'em cheer.

I really wish there was more to Via Appia other than the disc pushing mechanic. And unfortunately, that even gets a little old after everyone goes crazy with it at the start of the game. 
Player turns revolve around choosing 1 of only 4 available actions. Sadly, even new players quickly realize that in any given turn there is usually only 1 sensible choice. Gameplay then settles down to doing what you must. 
Tactically, you can block your opponents on the roads but, given the multiple paths available, this is fairly ineffectual. All in all? Little strategy, and overly long for such a light game. I think however it will appeal to a younger or family audience.

Despite the luck of the quarry, which can be mitigated, I'll call this a light to perhaps medium weight family style Euro.  The stone mechanism reminds me somewhat in the way discs would fall off the waterfall in Niagara but here they're functional and more beneficial for you. Given the short play time, it won't outlast its welcome.  Solid components and plenty of wood as you'd expect from Queen.

it isn't absolutely as bad as some comments depict it. it's not the bast family ever but it's fast, simple and there are small but somehow interesting decisions about which of the actions it's better to take not to favour the next player.
the quarry is a gimmick but it does its job if players are sensible enough to use it in a fair way (slowly, no kicks or tilts...).
Some mechanics are indeed a bit lacking in elegance, expecially those that tend to favour the last player. it seems as the editor added these mechanism to the original author ideas...

We are Roman engineers building the road from Rome to Brindisi. It's an area majority control race using the best stones gathered from the quarry.  The quarry uses a mechanism that reminds me of our childhood spring loaded booby trap game.

Really fun penny-arcade-pusher thing raises the mundane building game to something very different. However, the clunky mechanics weigh heavily on what is otherwise a fun idea. Almost very good.

viaappiaJust like Tzolking: The Mayan Calendar had it’s gimmick with the calendar wheels, this game has a gimmick with it’s Stone Quarry. Where Tzolkin turned out to be a nice worker-placement game (which is overrated on BGG in my opinion, but that’s another story), what will be left of Via Appia when you turn the gimmick into something simple component of the game? The first big difference between those two games, is the fact that Via Appia is a gateway-game, like a gate-way game should be. Very simple rules, easy to explain. Nice components. A pretty short playing time, where Tzolkin’ is a game for the more experienced gamer. Result is, that you can’t compare these two games, because they both have a gimmick inside the box.

As said, the rules of Via Appia are very simple and easy to explain. I’ll try to do it in a nutshell.

During a player’s turn, he can choose one out of four possible actions:


    Income. Get income from 1 of the 7 cards, which are placed next to the game board. A player can choose between the top (money) or the bottom (stones) of the card. Once there are 3 or less cards next to the game board, a player gets both forms of income (money & stones). If he picks the last card, he gets a shuffle in the quarry token extra.
    Quarry. The gimmick itself. A player places 1 or 2 stones in the quarry, and pushes the slider forwards. The stones that fall of at the end, can either be sold for money, or turned into pavement tiles.
    Build on the road. A player can place 1 or 2 pavement tiles on the road. He will get victorypoints for building a tile on the road, and he’ll get a bonus tile.
    Travel the road. A player can travel 1, 2 or 3 spots along the road. He has to pay 1, 3 or 6 money to do so. If a players reaches first, he gets 6 VP’s. (2nd players gets 3 VP’s , 3rd 1 VP). Also the player places a city token (small orange disc) next to the city, which indicates that the costs for traveling are lowered by 1 money for the players who didn’t reach the city yet.

The game ends when a player reaches the last city, or all the pavements tiles on the road are build. Player with the most money gets 2 VP’s. The player who has the most bonus-tiles (which you can get by building on the road), gets 8 VP’s. The player who comes in 2nd here, gets 4 Victory Points.

When playing with just 2 players, the bonus tiles of 3 VP’s is taken out of the game. In my opinion, this way the game turns into a racing game, because of the big difference in VP’s (5 that is). It would be smarter, to leave out the 6 VP tiles (which give only a difference of 2 VP’s), or the 1 VP tiles (which give a difference of 3 VP’s). Because the final scoring in the game is pretty close, racing towards a city, can give you 15 more VP’s then it does to your opponent. Your opponent probably is trying to build the most stones on the road, which will give him 8 VP’s, which is only a difference of 4 VP’s. Also it’s likely that he owns the most money at the end of the game, which will give him 2 more VP’s. The other player is likely to reach to cities, which will give him 2 VP’s, which will make a total of 8 VP’s. So, there is a difference of 7 VP’s between it, it seems to me, that the best strategy to win the game, is race to the end of the road. Don’t care about building too much tiles, don’t care about the money. Conclusion for me, is leave the 6 VP tiles out of the game with 2 players, and there only will be a 1 VP difference between the two strategies (racing-game versus tile-laying game (which is an interesting comparison in 1 game if you ask me).

The gimmick…. Does it makes a difference? There could have been a cloth bag with cardboard tiles inside and you can pick a couple of tiles out. But this quarry does fit into the theme of the game. It looks great, and above of all, it provides a lot of tension (and fun if nothing has fallen of). So, I guess the answer to the question should be a yes. The gimmick does make a difference for this game.

This is a game to play with non-gamers or as a game to end a game-night with. I wouldn’t recommend it with just 2 players, therefore the scoring in the game is too unbalanced. Or use house-rules.

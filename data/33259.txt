An unusual movement system, but simulates space movement rather well. You can choose the movement system you like most. Houserules can be designed and integrated in the gamesystem quite easily in order to make this fluent gamesystem even better. However the typical problem with houserules remains ... everyone has to agree with it.

The point system is not easy but appears to be very clever designed to me. It is also very suitable to add your own rules to it

Typical spacegame 'problems' still remains, such as ganging up on one ship and firepower concentration which leads to a lot of spaceships on a small part of the table.

Starmada has been able to establish itself along with Full Thrust as the reference where generic space combat games are concerned. The rules are simple and allow for a pletora of options so that any background can be re-created, Worthy of note is the construction system which is the most "munchkin-proof" I have ever seen and allows for virtually millions of weapon combinations. Even with the craziest ship and weapon combinations it is nigh-impossible to break the system. It is that tight.  

On the other hand while the game lends itself well for straightforward "build and bash" engagements or short campaigns, the game has the same major drawback as it main "competitor" (Full Thrust) in that it is pretty much "vanilla" in how things happen and are resolved: move ships, pick targets, roll dice, end phase, wash & repeat, etc. There is no room for "surprise" moves; any given ship will move according to its engine rating and will fire all its listed weapons. The only choices to be made are where to move and to shoot which weapon at which target. Not "when" or "if" you should move or shoot.

Regardless, this newest iteration of the game shows a few improvements over the previous version, notably the new 'pseudo-vector' movement system, a streamlined damage allocation system, a cleaning-up of the various weapon abilities and a new system that allows to customize fighters and ordnance much like weapons. The new movement rules are fun and an improvement I feel over the older "cinematic" version but they are poorly explained, Once you get to plot a few ship moves they become very easy to manage though.

Great space combat system, but battles can be over too fast.  How much strategy can go into a two turn game where the first turn you're not even in range?  Best when played with a LOT of ships, I guess.

What makes this game so great is the system flexibility.  I played my first game with four people as part of a campaign game that a friend is designing.  One of the nice things is that multiple players can control parts of a larger fleet so additional players doesn't mean additional downtime.

I do enjoy the Newtonian mechanics aspect to manuevering, but I think that internalizing the movement mechanics are the hardest part to this game.

A lot of my friends love the design your own ship aspect to the game.  It is a mini's game, but with a hex based map, there is a lot of structure to the game and it flows smoothly.  Our battles have been taking about 3 hours.


I'm still not convinced that there's a better tactic than concentrating your forces into one large sphere of destructive forces, mantaining only minimum distance to avoid damage from adjacent exploding ships.

With a couple plays under my belt this seems very promising. Very well laid out rules set, with an excellent ship construction system. The strength of the game lays in its simplicity and flexibility. It's very easy to pick and choose which options you want to incorporate and discard the rest.

The ship construction system appears to be well balanced and well thought out, especially when compared to, say, [i]Star Fleet Battles[/i]. This allows players to fairly easily adopt the system to their favorite universe. I've already seen people adopt Battlestar Galactica and Star Wars. There are also some source books from M12 you can use, including books for the SFB universe.

There are a couple things I don't like with the default rule set. First, the generic shield rating results in a "just keep your nose at the enemy" movement style. I think faceted shielding (in the separate Rules annex) effectively forces more interesting and intelligent maneuvering. Second, fighters are slightly overpowered and again you must have the Rules annex where they introduce anti-fighter batteries and point defense.

Still, thumbs up. Definitely want to play again.

Oh yes, everything is fixed in this version.  Hit allocation better, turn activation better, ship customization just as good as ever.  Perfect spaceship game.  And get your minis from Wormhole.

.pdf Version.

Fun and intuitive (except for movement) system. Lighter than Federation Commander, and you can expect slightly less detail as a result. A happy medium for a fast playing space combat game.

This is a really playable game!  Also the ship construction rules are extremely flexible.  The game plays fast and brutal.

I purchased this title in my quest for the perfect starship combat game. I like the rule set its easy to understand. I also purchased the Star Trek version which worked much better for my needs.

Designed the vassal module for this, with art by Dugan. Great game. Fun, tense, easy to keep the rules in your head once you play.

The most generic starship combat rules I know. Easy to learn, fast to play, but very entertaining and its options and potential for customization is almost infinite! Great for adjusting it to any SciFi setting you might want!

Completely customizable (with lots of options and/or make your own) and thoroughly violent! Power up, bring in the big ships and loads of fighters, and fight a short, violent space battle. The shipbuilder spreadsheet is a must-have!

I've played (and designed) quite a few tactical starship combat boardgames, and Starmada is by far my favorite. The core game is extremely simple, but there are lots of optional rules for those wanting more depth. The optional rules are almost entirely independent, so it's easy to pick and choose which weapons/equipment/rules you like. It's also very easy to make up new rules.

This is one of the few starship combat boardgames to provide a really balanced ship design system.

Each version is better than the last. The new default movement system is a brilliant compromise between "Newtonian" and "cinematic" systems: you can build up speed over turns and changing heading takes more engine power the faster you're going, but the only speed and heading (conflated with facing) carry over from turn to turn. Of course, if you want more (or less) realism, there are many optional rules and it's easy to add others.

Doesn't feel like space combat.  Doesn't feel cinematic.  Doesn't feel good.

It does feel fiddly (but most space combat games do).  It does feel tedious.  It does have a massive customization system which doesn't really add any tactical depth.

The demo version is a great place to start/try-out this space combat game.

Plotted movement by default (a deal-breaker for myself). Ship design is not balanced (especially if not using pre-plotted movement). It's too easy to stack the front arcs with high powered weapons at the expense of movement, creating a situation where the target's defense and maneuvering don't matter. Once both sides adopt the same design principle the game turns in to a dice rolling contest!

I believe I may have found my spiritual successor to Starfire.  Awesomely twiddly ship construction followed by lightly crunchy blowing stuff up.

My favorite space combat game. Wins over Full Thrust because of it's significantly greater versatility. I use it for Bablyon 5 and it's much simpler than Babylon 5 Wars and much more interesting than A Call To Arms.

Still an old favourite. I loved the simple design program it had. I created loads of star trek ships & put them on their web site. I covered other settings too. Got to find some way of using all those space ship models stored in the attic.....

Good, clean space combat game that is expandable to fit many genres.  Tries to compete with FULL THRUST but comes up short.
Good - Easy 'To Hit' and Damage Resolution
Bad - Weird Movement rules ("absolute difference"?) and firing arcs.  Ship construction requires a scientific calculator (i.e. crunchy, but not really easy).

Read through the rules.  It has some good ideas, but still left me with something to be desired.  Perhaps it's because the rules are a "generic starship" system where you choose which rules you want to kit-bash together.  Sounds appealing to make your own game, but ultimately you end up risking a set of rules that were not mechanically balanced against one another.

I shall try a game as soon as I procure a hex mat.

Our favorite spaceship combat game.  Lets you create ship designs of any type (Star Wars, Star Trek, Babylon 5, Star Blazers).  Like most Majestic 5 Games, it has a ery balanced points system too.

Look at the position of your battleships and those of your enemy. Check the direction and range of your weapons, possibly choose targets.
Now roll dice and check results, if succesfull then reroll dice, if succesfull again then roll some more dice and check the reference sheet for the eventual damage. That was for one weapon, one spaceship. Now redo this for every weapon on each ship and you get the picture of the flow. While I understand that the flow of the game will become more fluent once all players are used to the weaponry, it won't affect the core of the system which is simply [i]dicefest[/i].

Played a first game. Good fun, if a little too much dice-rolling for my tastes. Movement didn't seem to matter so much tactics-wise.

Not only is this the best Civil War wargame I've ever played, it's possibly the best wargame I've ever played. (Non-advanced) Gameplay takes a bit to assimilate but flows very well and makes sense. Just wish I played Vassal so I had a shot at trying the campaign games.

Just got Battle Above the Clouds 1/20/10.

Saw this at the Central Connecticut Wargaming Association on Friday. I had mixed feelings when Grant Takes Command came out in 2001?

The series had always been near and dear up to me up to the time GTC was published. I was an early playtester of the series. Recent games seem to have been somewhat lackluster. (not to mention the series had a lot of rules creep in GTC). Having seen the BAtC I was impressed watching the first scenario played. The new maps and counters work nicely together in the new graphic format. There are a lot of scenarios and some of which are fairly meaty. A new standard rules book is nicely presented. GCACW fans would seem to have a lot to celebrate with this game. One which will keep those so inclined busy for some time to come.

Now that I have my copy and had some time last evening to peruse the game, I am even more happy that I bought it. It will be on my game table within a week.

The medium-sized scenarios in this set, Chickamauga and McLemore's Cove, are really great, some of the best in the series: large and sweeping but playable, lots of opportunity for maneuver and operational force allocation, but playable in an afternoon. I've really enjoyed them a ton, as much as anything else in the series. Great terrain, great maps, interesting forces, an interesting variety of engagements - this is a real treat for fans of the system.
---
I have only played Scenario 1, but it was a blast. For some reason just reading the OOBs and stuff I didn't think it would be that interesting (lots of units can't move for chunks of the game), but it's an interesting wide-open situation that uses a surprisingly large geographical area for a short scenario, and both the Union and Confederate players will face down some pretty tough choices early on in the game. Make sure you understand the victory conditions. The Confederates need to either completely bag the strung-out Union division (hard) or get over the ridgeline in the center to win (also hard), and not lose to many points on the flanks or to casualties. Watch out for that 4-manpower Union mounted infantry which can make a mess of your small cavalry units. In general the Confederates can lose a surprising number of points in the cavalry battle.

This whole series is great, but the entries have just been getting better and better. The early entries were rather gratuitously pro-Confederate, but starting with Roads to Gettysburg things got really good, then On to Richmond was my favorite, until Grant Takes Command came out, and now Battle Above the Clouds so far really feels awesome, and I look forward to logging a bunch of hours on it.

I can't deny that the new unit counters are not awesome. The fancy scrollwork or whatever it is needs to go, and the substance brought more back in line with what it was before. But in practice, I think it looks worse than it is. When I first saw the new unit style I almost gagged on their elaborate busyness for no purpose - the worst of both The Devil's Cauldron and GMT-standard over-design. But having played it's not that much different than the old counters. They definitely are not as good as the old style, but it's not that bad.

Gorgeous game.  ACW isn't really my thing but I wanted to try this due to the graphics and what is supposed to be a good system for ACW operational warfare.  The fact it is a Union advance is a big plus.  No interest in "Lee wins" games.

After the political events of 2017 here in the U.S. I can't stomach the idea of playing a game with Confederates in it.  Too many of the real thing still around.  Sold on Ebay.

I'm a long time fan of the GCACW series, but I had real reservations about this title once my preorder arrived.  I punched it, marveled at the horror that the rules have evolved into, swore when said rules suggested that I use white out to correct errors on the counters ... who has white out?  What kind of $60 game has a rulebook that tells you how to fix errors on the other game components? ... and then I played the shortest scenario.

For over a year the game sat on the shelf.  I played other members of the franchise, and I honestly doubted I'd play BATC again.  

Which was a shame as the new theater is a refreshing change.  

Finally, I gave the game a second chance.  Encouraged by Shelby Foote's account of the campaign around Chickamauga, I set up the McLemore's Cove scenario.

In a word ... Fantastic.

It stands among the great scenarios of the series.  You have tons you want to do and never enough activations to do it in.  The tension, the narrative, the insane topography, the maneuver despite the insane topography.
  
It is the GCACW at its best.

Kibler's map is gorgeous as one would expect.  The color coding on the counters is a nice addition, and I absolutely love that the fatigue markers are *finally* four distinguishable colors.

On the downside, bridges should have been drawn as destroyed with markers provided for functional ferries in the counter mix as most every major river crossing is destroyed in any and all scenarios.

The divisional counters are unnecessarily crowded.  The scroll work needs to be pitched, it takes up a lot of space, and makes every unit look like a either a member of the X or the XX Corps.

Errata on the player aide ... guys this is the eighth installment, can't we get the basics down.  The standard rules are decently written, but I'd prefer references to rare exceptions like OTR be removed completely.  I understand why they can't be. But honestly, I can't imagine how new gamers can get into this series.  The flanking and retreat rules are nightmares composed in the kind of legal verbiage necessary for tournament play among sharks.  Honestly, normal folks play with those particular rules the way they were back when they were playable.

The player aides, while graphically well done, are on thin, floppy magazine paper stock ...

This cornucopia of faux paus rubs me the wrong way, but like any good member of this great series, when a scenario is good, it's fantastic.  BATC's best scenarios carry it past the game's presentation shortcomings, gaffs, and rules wreckage.

Synopsis of scenarios I've played:

Crossing The Chickamauga::star::star::nostar::nostar::nostar:
An OK short/small scenario.  A bit more crowded than the single day scenarios I like in other titles.  I can't see this one getting a lot of play and to be honest I played it so long ago I don't remember it very well.  To be equally blunt, I didn't like it enough to want to play it again anytime soon.

Battle of Chickamauga :star::star::star::nostar::nostar:
This three day scenario works infinitely better than the single day version.  Considering it is a situation where units begin spread out and quickly coalesce, I was surprised how much I enjoyed our play.  At first it seemed like the Union had the Confederates stymied, were about to slip out of the Cove, and circle the wagons about the VP hexes, but then "all of a sudden" the center was pierced and all heck broke lose.  Both sides are challenged in this one.  The Rebs to force the Union to defend at multiple points, while maneuvering to break through the Union line ... the Union to move units laterally while maintaining a cohesive defense and protecting the VPs.  Mind the rules regarding woods and restricted ZOCs ... they can play a huge part in piercing he Union line.

Wheeler's Raid :star::star::star::star::nostar:
A cavalry raid ranging across both maps, hidden units, unknown entry points, multi-day fatigue concerns, an element of "catch that wagon!", hell - "find that wagon!" ... this is a good scenario for anyone who loves the way this system hands cavalry maneuver.  The scenario plays quickly and has good replayability as well.  

However, cavalry aficionados be warned, the terrain here is rather restricting.  The entire scenario takes place in about 1/4 of both maps, the portion north of the Tennessee.  In fact we fold our maps in half when we play.  Wheeler's play space is quite channeled and a few critical choke points mean he really only has the choice to go after the wagons mid map from the north, or at the train stations from the south.  

A good scenario, just not the best cavalry scenario in the system. 

Wheeler's Raid (Historical) :star::star::star::nostar::nostar:
I'd give this four stars for the first solo play ... or as an added bonus, as an introduction to the challenges and choices of the hidden unit version of the scenario.  Its replayability isn't stellar and players will quickly want to try the ftf version.

Opening the Cracker Line:nostar::nostar::nostar::nostar::nostar:
Not my favorite style of scenario.  Play is constrained to allow for a historically plausible storyline to develop, but in the end the game comes down to a few critical die rolls for activation (once Longstreet is released) and for Union movement.  Hell until Longstreet is released, the Union basically just keep rolling to see how well they can move and Grandby's cavalry keeps rolling to try to slow them down.  In the end, tittering stacks faceoff in a 4 hex area.  I'd never use such a scenario to teach the system as it highlights the worst aspects of the game (the reliance on die rolls) and none of the best features (see below).

McLemore's Cove::star::star::star::star::star:
A four day scenario that presents both sides with challenges, opportunities to go on the offensive, and a Cumberland Plateau full of maneuver.  This is the best scenario I have yet played in the game and stands among the series greats.

Ringgold Gap::star::star::star::nostar::nostar:
Another good, multi-day scenario.  It has everything I love in a GCACW scenario: 
(1) a limited number of units with a lot of room to maneuver 
(2) lasts more than a single day
(3) the forces involved *diverge* as opposed to converge.

The third point is critical.  While "Opening the Cracker Line" is a scenario that ends with stacks crammed together, in Ringgold, the action disperses and then coalesces in three or four areas as a result of units moving and counter-moving to block.  Making for a classic small scenario that has replay value.  

Ringgold also features "the escaping wagon!" mechanic wherein one player has to escort a unit out of harms way while their opponent seeks to harm it.  In fact, to win handsomely, the Union player has to annihilate the wagon, or cause serious casualties to the CSA combat units.

Campaign: Chickamauga :star::star::star::star::star:
Brilliant, and like the best campaigns in the series, worth every minute spent learning the campaign special rules.  Like a meal in France.  You're seated at 8 and you stay until closing.  Taking your time enjoying the chef's art.  So much space, so few units, a couple critical choke points, and so much more that you want to do then you can.  Turn the flank, turn the flank, the occasional battle exhausts all involved while everyone else tries to stay fresh ... and the dance continues.  A classic with the Blue and Grey on a more equal terms then we've seen before.

That having been said, the supply system clearly breaks if one has successive turns ended early by 1-1 initiative rolls.  To wit in one game we had four turns in a row ended by 1-1 initiative rolls.  Three of these saw less than 5 activations total, one turn had only 2 activations.  Four turns where not a single wagon train moved ... four days and the teamsters behind the lines can't plod on from point A to point B?  Both sides were thrown OOS as their finely balanced supply chains completely collapsed for lack of movement in the wagon trains.  Well, I say both sides, but the fact was that the supply glitch hit the Union really hard, and at a critical juncture when they had the CSA on the ropes (or did they?). In short the entire house of cards collapsed.  

Now maybe it's me, but I can't see devoting your first several activations to moving supply when things at the front are fluid and in the balance.  Getting there "first with the most" isn't about supply.  I don't play games to move supply, and I'm not sure what ending a day without the rear area supply units able to move represents, particularly when the weather is clear and dry.  We reset our game by basically removing all in-transit supply and distributing it, then sending the wagons back to depots and playing on.  In the future, I suspect that we will end the movement of combat units on a 1-1 initiative roll case but allow each wagon train F2 worth of activations prior to ending the action round.  Heck, maybe we'll drop the whole 1-1 turn end entirely, but I am loathe to change the nature of the game that much.


History :star::star::halfstar::nostar::nostar:
While generally decent, the game makes concessions for play balance.  Many leaders' tactical ratings are suspect, to the point of having been "phoned in", and ignore recent scholarship on this long misunderstood campaign.  For improved history, ignore Sherman's +1 rating and play without the Forest, Joe Wheeler, Pegram, or Wharton *counters* (remove them for the game completely).  It's hard to justify their inclusion let alone grant them capabilities on par with Wade Hampton or Jeb Stuart.  Give Wilder's brigade a +3 bonus to their movement rolls and Minty's brigade a +2 bonus.  Consider increasing Minty's and Wilder's tactical ratings to 3 and 4 respectively.  Consider reducing CSA cavalry leaders movement bonus to +1 and CSA cavalry units to +0 while increasing USA cavalry leaders to +2 and units to +1.

As mentioned above, we play that 1-1 turn ends do not impact wagon trains and we have found play satisfactory when completely ignoring the 1-1 "sudden death" altogether.


Game :star::star::star::star::nostar:
Bottom line, I am happy to have BatC in my GCACW collection.  It's not perfect, but it has a lot of great gaming to offer.  To date, I have enjoyed four of the six scenarios I've played; the meatier the better.  It's fair to say I have loved the multi-day scenarios in BATC and disliked the single day ones.

Update 4 years after release. 

I still like this game, but it's simply proving too difficult to put on the table.  The rules bloat in particular turns off new opponents and presents a significant hurdle for occasional players as well.  Who wants to plow through dozens of pages of rules for a game where you roll to move?  

At the end of the day, there's simply too many other, less convoluted titles on the market vying for our time ... including older members of this series.

After three plays (and two currently on-going games) I am giving this game a tentative 8.5 - while I have some problems with the game's design concerning the CRT and other issues - the game does tell a great narrative and is a really good game, as such.  I am thoroughly enjoying my plays of this game and learning the intricate nuances inherent in the design.  Thumbs way up.  If I continue to play this game, I expect my rating will incrase, as well.

Brilliant,. Might even be the best of the series. Maclemore's Cove (spelling?) might be the best scenario of the series. What's interesting is that it's simulating a failed historic manoeuvre that didn't amount to much, barely necessitating a footnote in some histories of the campaign. 

The campaign game was brilliant and felt like a real long-term slog with a tense awareness that the CSA would spring a trap at some point.

Absurd dice fest with obscene amounts of procedural complexity that you cannot hope to digest without dedicating a significant portion of your wargaming life to it. Roll the dice for initiative, movement allowance, disruption, assault actions and combat. Add buckets of modifiers, a nine (!) step leader activation sequence, two types of ZOC and, well, you see where I'm headed with this.

The initiative and movement system are just silly. The design clearly assumes the dice will "even out". What happens when they don't and you get long streaks of good or bad initiative and/or movement rolls? The game completely falls down, that's what. At least chit pull systems provide a statistically decreasing chance of repeated initiatives. This game? No. The difficulty in distinguishing units doesn't help matters.

To top it all off the combat tables are totally daffy and susceptible to gamey tactics. In this game smaller units take fewer casualties. With a 1d6 combat differential combat system (again, with buckets of modifiers you won't remember) that heavily favors the defender, smaller units can stymie larger units many times their size while suffering no actual casualties. Indeed, it seems that breaking units down into "certain sizes" is a regular staple of strategy discussion for this game. Stupid.

All of this rolling of dice means there is precious little either in terms of strategy or tactics that can be undertaken by the players. When playing a scenario you have an objective, and you know generally how you want to get there. The rest is completely up to the dice. To wit, I recently played and won the Ringgold Gap scenario and won through absolutely no fault of my own. If that's your idea of fun then, hey, this game is for you.

It's just not for me.

Update: After playing the start of the Campaign Game I can't say my rating has really changed. While I think the system works better for longer scenarios, it's still largely subject to the whims of the dice, with the addition of random events, plus the complexity and tedium of a too-detailed supply system. Between rain and turns ending early, the Union was not progressing very far and had made no attacks. None of that had anything to do with my decision making. Not particularly fun.

Currently learning this game system. I have only played some very short scenarios but so far, I like what I see. I can see why some people might find it a little bit to much like work with very big counter stacks but I love the detail. 

I also like how combat works. There is quite some uncertainty involved and even big attacks can fail and give you some heavy losses.

Another GCACW winner. The core system remains sound, and everything comes together smoothly. 

I've only played the short scenarios but it's holding up well. Very tense for both sides. Like GTC, the victory conditions put a tougher penalty on Confederate casualties, forcing the Confederate player to think hard about achieving his objectives without undue casualties. 

On the changes to the look of GCACW - glossy maps and fancier counter graphics - my view is that it does not hinder the GCACW experience in any way. It's just not a big deal! Took me maybe five seconds to get used to it and after that, it's simply not an issue.

GCACW goes to the Western Theater and provides a terrific play experience both in the scenarios and in the campaign game.  You either love this system or hate it.  There are times when the activation sequencing goes against you and there's nothing you can do about it--just relax and start over.

This is an excellent game. I didn't give it a perfect 10 because the series has a tad too much overhead with fatigue, disorganization, demoralization, exhaustion and combat loses possible for each unit, and this game's leader counters are a tad to busy. In my opinion, the more unnecessary art work you put on a counter, the more difficult it is for the important information to get noticed. But that's just about the complete downside. The map is beautiful, the system is terrific and there are numerous scenarios to provide players with years of re-play value. This almost perfect game, in an almost perfect series, sets the standard against which all other American Civil War simulations must be judged.

RATING: 9
The scenarios in the two GCACW (GTC and BATC) games I've played are just so top notch.  Even the one turn scenario is quite good in this.  I loved the two scenarios I soloed, Ringgold Gap and Cracker Line.  McClemore's Cove, a medium length scenario, is set up now.  I've now since started a historical campaign solo game and completed a bunch of the scenarios online with friends.  I feel comfortable with my conclusions about the game.

The components are a huge improvement over the the old ugly AH graphics.  I can, however, see the complaints about the unit graphics--the old unit graphics themselves weren't too bad.  The new ones do have a lot of information on one counter and some of the showiness is a little excessive (the scrollwork).  Overall, though, they're mainly just a sidestep.  But the rest of the counters are a positive change and the map looks beautiful.  As for this claptrap about glossy maps, it suffices to say there is 0 problem with the maps in this game.

To be critical, I would say that this game does look a notch more complicated than Grant Takes Command was with the unique rules it needs for a number of things.  My complaints about the series still stand.  Counter density is high because of the number of status marker indicators needed.  This is mitigated by the small number of units in even the campaign game.  There is some gaminess as well, EMing units to death and preferring to have a smaller disorganized unit to get on a lower CRT, for example.  The combat is definitely clunky with the flank calculations and the magic 1/2-3 CRT of no death.

Nevertheless, I think the campaign in this, despite being more complicated than the other Eastern campaigns, looks the most interesting of the series.  Why?  Because the two sides are relatively evenly matched troop and leadershipwise.  I can't wait to try the campaign out.  Bring on the reprints and Atlanta, I will order them all!  GCACW is one of my new favorite series.

Update:

I've been playing Scenario 8, the Chickamauga campaign.  It's my first GCACW campaign and it is fantastic.  This game shines in the campaign.

Great game and great series.  Not overly complex but enough so that it's not for beginners, and just a bit of chrome.  It hits my sweet spot for complexity.  The initiative system is a great way to mix things up and raise and destroy your hopes and plans every turn.  Every game is completely different from the previous one and keeps the game fresh.

I really want to like Battle Above the Clouds, but, I have come to the conclusion that the Chickamauga campaign is not winnable by the Union.  The excellent research, beautiful map, and clean-playing system kept me coming back, but no longer. 

The Union did lose, of course, so I guess that is historically okay, but it doesn't make for a good game, esp. one that is 10+ sessions.  Since I bought the game for the campaign, not the scenarios, my rating ('4') is reflective of the historical campaign.

This is based on 4 games, 2 F2F (different opponents) and 2 solitaire.

I have read a few session reports where the Union did win, but I think it is clear from these games that the Confederates were either inexperienced (e.g. attacking forward of Lookout Mt., into the Union strength), or were acting in a historical way, either role-playing Bragg's weakness, or ignorant of where the Union weakness lies, or how the game works in general.  Intelligent Confed play, using all of the benefits of hindsight that Bragg didn't have, is unfortunately unbeatable.  The game design should have represented this with more special rules limiting the Confeds, changing the Union victory conditions, or starting the campaign several days later than it actually starts.

- off map, the Union has 29MP facing 37MP Confeds (and Forrest). this is a non-starter until the Confeds transfer troops out. With how off-map combat works, the Confeds can transfer alot of troops out without giving the Union a good attack. I can't see this side theater succeeding or keeping good Confed units from moving to the map.

- on map, the Union has 103MP facing 62MP. This seems okay, but the Confeds will generally get more reinforcements (esp. if they get Virgina troops instead of Mississippi troops). They will also get troops from off-map. Finally, they will typically be dug-in (2X to 3X strength) because they don't have to attack to win the campaign.

- the Union divisions are typically smaller than the Confeds (and of course slower). This leads to the Union needing to do assaults with multiple divisions to get good odds. This is slow, so the Confeds will get there first and dig in. Then, there is always a chance that the assault will go poorly with one division going in alone...

- the Union units typically do not have enough of an artillery advantage to avoid getting a -1 in combat, eliminating any bonuses you might get for a better leader or a manpower advantage.

- The supply situation is worse than it might appear at first. Union supplies can only be railed as far as Bridgeport. The only way across Lookout Mtn. until you clear the tip is Steven's Gap; this is huge trip and DeKalb county blocks strategic movement through a crucial part of the trip. The Union has a real problem here because out-of-supply units become disorganized, which makes attacking impossible with the the considerations above. It is also difficult to get the right mix of regiments and divisions to avoid wasting points. The Confeds are almost always very near their supply line and had no real issues with supply that I saw.

- Insubordination, so important in the actual campaign, has real little effect in the game campaign because the South doesn't attack - they just race to good terrain and dig in, waiting for a hapless Union attack.

So what do you get? A bunch of opportunities to make attacks with a plus or minus 1. In the long run, this will lead to a ton of losses with not much to show for it (unless you are really good at rolling a 6 when your opponent rolls a 1).

Specifically, how to contain the Union from even getting to Chattanooga:

#1 = Cheatham to S2933 (Webb pass of Lookout Mtn.)
#2 = Hindman to S2731 (Craven's House pass of Lookout Mtn.)
#3 = 3CS slowly withdraws to block Union strategic movement.  Head towards S3509 to flank any Union calvary that try to open up Steven's Gap.
#4 = Mauldin hold Rawlingsville to mess up Union strategic movement, head toward Steven's Gap if there is no threat.
#5 = Wheeler and the cavalry reinforcements head toward Steven's Gap.
#6 = Walker and Gist - strategic post-haste to Steven's Gap S3608.  This is the key to blocking any Union advance to worthwhile parts of the map.  The Union cavalry may beat you there, but Wheeler should be able to flank them, allowing you to easily knock them out.
#7 = Liddell goes to S3102, the final cork in the bottle.  The Union has a hopeless logistical problem getting off Lookout Mtn.  Note that the Union theoretically has Cooper's Gap at S3506, but there is no way to get a wagon train to this point if Steven's Gap is held by the Confeds.
#8 = Stewart and BR Johnson transfer on-map.  These are your reserves, leaving you plenty off-map to block Burnside.  You can probably get away with even more transfers if necessary, but I don't think you need them.

Now, sit back and entrench, laughing at 1,1 initiative rolls, command paralysis, low Union movement rolls, rain, etc.  If, by chance, the Union gets a spectacular combat roll (we are talking a 6,1 split here), back up and meet your reinforcements (Virginia or Mississippi) and beat them historically, instead of bottling them up from even taking Chattanooga.  The reinforcement rule, in particular, is a major problem - what happens if you roll a 12 on turn 2 for Virginia reinforcements?  Union loses, that's what; bad design.

If I tried to fix this, I would ditch the 1,1 end-of-turn rule.  This only burns the Union, and it doesn't represent any meaningful thing that I am aware of.  The variable movement already captures the whole fog-of-war element, and because you have to move combat units ahead of wagon trains (road blocks!), the Union supply is screwed by this game element.  It is interesting that the scenarios don't have this element as it would really demonstrate how stupid it is (oops, 1,1 on turn 1, game over).  Another element that would have to change is that the Confeds must be limited in movement for much longer than turn 1.  Additionally, insubordination should allow the Union to retreat a confed unit and force them away from perfect blocking positions.  Finally, the Union victory conditions need to be adjusted to game events (rain, early Confed reinforcements, etc.).

One thing I didn't try was the non-historical setup.  This might improve things slightly, even though I don't see how a Northern approach would work logistically.  It would, however, allow you to keep your Corp's together on the Union side.  Splitting McCook and Thomas's corps, as done with the historical setup, is a major disruption to the Union that could be avoided.

Siempre me ha llamado la atención esta serie de juegos sobre la Guerra Civil Americana, pero por unas cosas o por otras no he jugado nunca hasta que ya no he podido ignorar las buenas reseñas que tiene y la gran cantidad de seguidores que desean una reimpresión y nuevos títulos de la serie.

Un Wargame que para mi es muy distinto a todo lo que he jugado hasta ahora, pero que me ha resultado de una brillantez y originalidad increíbles.

La escala operacional que trata este juego es perfecta para esta guerra.

Escenarios que te permiten ser creativo, con mucha tensión y un desarrollo del juego fluido y muy divertido.

Deseando jugar mas escenarios y la campaña.

My favorite: Operational - ACW - Medium

Plus
-Best components I have seen to date in a hex & counter wargame; words can't describe what is in this little box
-Unsurpassed attention to detail, research, playtesting and graphics. WOW!
-A fantastic proven and tried system that Joe Balkoski once invented
-Rules are intuitive and not overly complex (25 pages but small text)
-The most evocative wargame in my collection
-Great scenario's
-Overall the best hex & counter wargame I have (says a lot as ACW is not my favorite theme)
-I love the counter art!

Minus:
-Font of the rules is far too small, difficult to read, even with healthy eyes.
-Steep price (I paid 77 Euro for my copy).
-Can get really cramped with high stacks of counters but sufficient lower density scenario's makes up for it.
-A lot of specific rules to consider so it is one step up from the original but I am not sure if this is a good thing... 

The game shines through uncertain activation which lead to unpredicting situations: one moment you are outmanouvring your opponent, the other moment you will find yourself isolated and exposed to the enemy....

It is this excitement and uncertainty combined with a super solid system and components make it one of the best ever hex & counter games currently available.

The map is one of the best I have seen to date in a wargame. It might have lost some functionality but in return the game becomes more evocative and that is really important to me with games of this complexity.

You will find similar Balkoski mechanisms in 'Against the Reich' and 'The Korean War' and hence they are in my top 10.

All in all a heavy investment; steep price and time consuming, However the rewards are plenty: a great system, an obscure theatre and high quality components.

Battle above the Clouds brings Balkoski's heritage to new heights!

Will play this anytime.

This is a nice iteration of the series, because the command ratings are more even than others (because Bragg is crap) and there's less of a structural advantage for the Confederates (they don't always win tied activations any more, and there's the fun chrome of possible insubordination).

Of the ones I've played, McLemore's Cove and The Battle of Chickamauga are both really good 3-turn scenarios. Ringgold Gap is a 2-turn race which is less interesting. As usual for the system I don't really find the ones less than 3 days very interesting.

Had heard there are alot of markers, and big stacks to keep up with.  It's true. 

Fun game, but seems like a lot of overhead for what it's worth.  I'm told the vassal module does all the book work for you, and the recovery too.  That would be awesome, but I don't believe the game lends its' self to pbem very well.  

Component wise it's gorgeous.  Love the map, but I believe some would say it's too 'busy', and the counters are too small.  I'd find it tough to argue those points.

This 2009 eighth game in the GCACW Series by MMP is a delight to play. The counters and maps are wonderful as is the easy to follow rules. Two army's maneuvering to strike one another makes this an exciting game from start to finish. A great game for learning history, or just having fun.

Anything in the series is good.  After a while, there is a new game from the series at last.  And yet, we have to wait until 2009! (Finally it arrives in Feb 2010!!)  Even the maps alone worth all the wait and the price!

I jump in no time to play Battle Above the Clouds with Ken on Vassal with a short notice and pick up the rules quickly and easily after 20 years (since the first release of Stonewall Jackson's Way). And yes, the series is still fun, serious about simulation of the American Civil War campaigns, and realistic for operational analysis!

Me encanta esta serie. Reconozco que soy un poco parcial a la hora de puntuar el juego, pero es que lo paso genial jugándolo. Aunque previo al Stone Jackson, Yo lo he jugado tras este. En este número se hizo el fantástico lavado de cara a la serie. Tanto el libro de reglas genéricas como el de Escenarios derrochan calidad. Además de incluir dos mapas para realizar los movimientos operacionales, incluye un mapa para movimiento estratégico en la campaña. Una verdadera gozada.Una serie a seguir y muy recomendable.

A solid score based on 2 plays of the smallest scenario.  I really like the iniative system with the ony "strangeness" in the rules appearing to be some results on the combat table.

The smaller scenarios could be overly affected by bad dice rolls because of the short duration and limited combats, but I can see how this would ballance out on the larger scenarios where there are more dice rolls.

I would certainly like to continue to play not only this game, but others in the series.

A very positive first contact with a good system and a great play equipment.
The game gives pride of place to maneuver, the implementation of actions, the attacks and movements are subject to contingencies of the chaos of war. We must therefore anticipate fatigue men, random movements ...



Un premier contact très positif avec un système bien huilé et un matériel de jeu superbe.

Gameplay itself is the solid GCotACW. A.k.a. the operational ACW of choice. Heavyweight, but worthy.

This was one of the games I looked forward to the most in the past couple of years.  Now that I have it, I must say I am disappointed, over all.

The rules have gotten more opaque as the series has gone on and this game is no exception.  The scenarios have tons of exceptions and "little rules" that add more weight than flavor (and are often overlooked).

The graphics are, typically, gorgeous to look at but lose quite a bit in functionality.  Cases in point:  There are numerous bridges and fords over the Tennessee.  The problem is, in the game, virtually all of them start destroyed, requiring a counter on each (cluttering up the map) to show this.  Why not just print them destroyed and use a counter to show the ones that are open?  The various division leaders have various counters, many of which are virtually identical, making it difficult to keep track of them.  The counters virtually disappear in the off-map display, while the beauty of the main maps often masks an inability to actually find the information you need in the hex.

I know a lot of people really love this system.  I used to.  But I never remember doing this much work before and getting so (relatively) little enjoyment from it.

Played scenario 2 and 3 and the Chickamauga campaign. As good as the rest of the series, not really more complex than Grant Takes Command (although advanced rules look not very well organized at first glance). The armies are rather small compared to the Eastern theater (2 - 3 corps per side), which make playing in teams less interesting in my view. Armies are more even-matched than in the East, but I suspect a small Union bias in most scenarios.

The Chickamauga campaign gives several strategic options for both players, particularly the Union. They can fight North or South of Chattanooga or concentrate troops in the off-map theater (Knoxville). Possible arrivals of Longstreet or Jonhston give some variability. Beware of Union cavalry when activated with Wilder's mounted brigade, it's very powerful.

The Great Campaigns of the American Civil War series is solid gold in my book. I find the Civil War fascinating, but my main interest is European history. So it isn't just the period covered that makes it great for me. The games in the series are examples of wargames at their finest. The maps are very detailed and look fantastic, and the games are complex enough to give fine detail to the campaigns but not so much that they require huge amounts of time to play. They have a great mix of playability and meatiness. The historical simulation of the battles is excellent. All of these features combine to give players the needed substance to experience how these campaigns played out.

This is a gorgeous game.  One of the best maps I have seen in a hex and counter game.  The developer really captured the command structure of that battle.  It can be frustrating to have orders not received but that was the way it was.  Reflecting that in the game gives it a legitimacy to the era.  

There are quite a few rules to learn but once you play through it awhile you will be thinking deeply and having a great doing that unless you don't like to think.

I played it solo taking both sides and it worked great.  Just be honest with it and you will have a great experience.

I am really torn about this series. The ACW is not my forte, but the games appear to have great atmosphere. They also appear to be quite fiddly, and I fear a new game in the series will add so many special rules as to bog it down completely for the solo gamer. Looks like fiddly will win out with a 48-page game-specific rulebook.

I'll probably get this one--it's balanced and there's a lot to learn about this theater, the maps are lovely, plus it has some of my favorite generals. Too bad the counter art--forts, strength points, busy combat units--is not so hot though. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This series is ASL meets the ACW without the rulebook.  I like the dual possibilities of short scenario's and long campaigns.  I really like the activation process, adds tension as well as replay value to the scenario's.  I think this level hits home with the way the war was actually fought.  Some battles are famous,  but the campaigning was the key to the battles that occurred,  This series does an outstanding job of bringing the history to life while still being a game rather than a simulation which I appreciate.

This is the first game in the series I have played.  The impulse system works very well although it can become very frustrating when you cannot get a string of impulses together.  The combat system is probably the toughest part of the rule mechanics to incorporate into a good strategy. Overall I find the learning curve to be on the tougher side but I can feel myself coming around and enjoying the process.  I can see why its rated so high by others, it just takes a little longer than other games to get to that point.

I'm a little disappointed in the style of many of the scenario's.  I prefer more freedom of movement where many of these are line them up and roll the dice.  This is probably not the best option for your first module of the series.

While I despise the new counters and really don't have as much interest in these Western campaigns (I miss General Lee), it has to be said that the scenarios in BATC are likely the finest in the series.  The added insubordination rules are a treat, too.  So there's this grudging admission: objectively speaking, BATC is likely the best of this great bunch.

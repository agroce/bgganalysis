GAME: History of the World
RANK: 589
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A bit long, but a very enjoyable game.
Downtime was probably the biggest issue - huge for 6 players.  We ended up playing another game at the same time and that didn't help the focus on History, but it did resolve the downtime....
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One of the better civilisation building type games but really needs 6 (or maybe 5) players and then there is too much downtime between turns and it can last just a little too long
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An epic game of conquests and beatdowns.  You really can't get too attached to any of your units, because usually no one lasts long.  There is a lot of luck in this one, which could probably turn someone off of the game, but I found it fun enough not to mind it too much.

I own first and second editions, and second impliments many home rules that we made for first ed.  The game can be long, and requires some planning, but I feel like a table of competative players keeps the game balanced, and last place gets the first pick of the next round helps to keep people engaged.  Great for a long afternoon!

I have the Hasbro edition. This game is similar to Risk, with key differences being that the it uses victory points to determine a winner, and each player plays a number of historic civilizations throughout the game. All players are playing until the end, it has an epic civilization-building theme, and the game has a 7 turn limit. Players gain points by amassing land, conquering cities, and building monuments for their civilization. Unlike Risk, it is hard to go attack a specific player in HotW, since you only get one civilization each turn, and it is hard to control where your civ first appears. The biggest thing that keeps this from ever being played, though, is the long play time (one to two hours per player).

Also, it just feels different than most conquest-type games; it feels like you're really sweeping through epic amounts of time and the game feels a lot more laid-back and leisurely-paced than other conquest games. As a result, it takes longer to play, but it's not really cut throat at all and feels almost relaxing, which is sort of refreshing. Also, the plastic minis for the cities and forts are awesome.

I freakin' love this game; I just don't really get to play it because of the long play time. 

UPDATE: with a few house rules, play time has been cut drastically:

Played this a heck of a lot with a good group of friends - although there are definite favorable card draws to look for, you're rarely out of it and chances to screw your opponent abound.  Good fun.

Epic game.  There are probably some well-understood standard strategies, but I haven't played enough to have uncovered them all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A (kind of) civ-oriented game of control, conquest and expansion.  I like how the empires differ from one another and, particularly, how they collectively develop over time.

Some of the empires are much more powerful than others.  There are some clear balance concerns.

Combat is resolved by dice rolls.  There's a *large* random element.  Good rolls generally mean you'll win.  However, the game is long enough and there are enough rounds that the luck/randomness will probably balance out over the game.

I like the cards and how they affect gameplay.  I also like the beginning-of-turn passing of empire cards, starting with the person currently in last place.  It can serve as a decent catch up mechanism, depending on whether or not the card draw is kind.

The plastic, oh the plastic!  I played the Avalon Hill edition which comes with enough plastic to melt it down and form a crude implement or a small vehicle (though I don't recommend using the game pieces for either one).

Overall, a fun game though there's a large luck and/or random factor.  Game length is very long (at least for 5 players), but it works.  Can't say this is a must play, but if it looks like it might appeal to you then give it a play, should you get the chance.  It's worth trying.

I really liked this game when I first came across it. It was history, civilizations, conquest, actual leaders of actual peoples! Perhaps I liked it too much. It was played a great deal until the lustre began to fade. My most recent play was the first in probably 2 years and it makes me want to revise my ranking. But not quite yet. After another game perhaps.

RATING: 8
History of the World is a game of world conquest for 4 to 6 players.       
It traces the progress of mankind from the dawn of civilization to the threshold of modern times. Starting 5000 years ago with the ancient Sumerians, a succession of 49 empires rise and fall with the rapidly passing centuries across the width of the globe. No single power can conquer the world. Instead, each player commands seven different empires - one per Epoch-during their all too brief day in the sun.
 
Each empire, in turn, rises to its fullest height of power only to fall before the sands of time and the next emerging, dominant nation. Empires vie with armies and fleets to spread their culture and momuments to their glory.

Expected playing time is about 3.5 - 4 hours.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like this game, although it's invariably too long to play all 7 epochs
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It DOES take HOURS to play, and the rules are confusing at first, but once you have it figured out it's easy and fun. There's a great feeling of satisfaction banding together to take down whoever the leader of the previous epoch was. It is also fascinating to watch how the different areas change hands through the epochs.

Nope, not really for me this one. Too much luck, too little to do between turns, too long. It's a shame because there is some good stuff going on. Unfortunately it all happens at the beginning of each turn - the way the cards are distributed, where units appear on the board, turn order. However that leads to half-an-hour of diminishing interest until the next epoch begins.

Takes too long for the fun level.  Too random in a lot of ways and just doesn't strike a cord.

RATING: 5
Interesting theme (I like grand history), but unfortunately the downtime between "Epochs" is too long that you have nothing to do except rolling dice for your pieces. The latest Hasbro/AH version, although having many improvements, seemed to favour more the "offensive mentality", as it nearly eliminated all the defensive aspects of the game. Its much harder to maintain presence in regions now.

Para la época no fue un mal juego, pero con el paso del tiempo se ha quedado un poco simple y obsoleto.

Me gustaba de él la existencia de tantas civilizaciones y la elección de la misma en cada una de las eras (7 en total). Unas eran muy potentes y otras tenían la ventaja de actuar antes, con lo que repuntuabas todo lo que tuvieras en el tablero. El principal problema que le achaco al juego es que si te toca una civilización débil y que además no actúa demasiado pronto... prácticamente esto te echa de la partida pq te quedas atrás y es muy complicado remontar puntos, sobre todo en las últimas eras.

Desplegado es bonito (sobre todo la última edición) pero es simple y desde mi punto de vista le falta mucho chrome para poder ser considerado un juego de civilizaciones serio.

En cualquier caso dio para algún ratillo majo durante la adolescencia.

I find that too often the game comes down to the empire selection, which means a long (3+ hour) game is decided by a single random element. And this can be absolute death if people take long.

Comment: Heel fijn spel, boeiender dan Risk, lijkt wat op Civilization.  De dobbelsteen voegt wel iets te veel gelukt toe aan het spel, maar anderzijds heeft de aanvaller daardoor wel een groot voordeel --> Dit wekt interactie en aanval op.  Tip: Behoud de sterkere kaarten voor de laatste epoques.

The contents are in super shape--like new--and all pieces and miniatures (700!) are present and accounted for.  The ruleset looks handled.  The box lid is solid, but has some shelf wear, especially up by the AH logo.  The bottom box has one split corner, and two others that are split about 1 inch down...easily repairable...with shelf wear along the bottom edges.

I love Civ games, AH games and I really wanted to love this game.  But after playing it over 10 times, I had to face the fact that this game is a dog!  HotW is rediculously random.  You have the card randomness, the dice randomness and the player randomness.  You have little direct control over the important aspects of the game.

The key part of the game is Civ cards you get.  Certain Civ cards are very good and some are very bad.  Certain combinations can be very good or very bad.  Unfortunately you have little control over what card you are going to get.  You draw a card.  If you are fortunate enough not to have a card, you can keep it or you give it away.  Thats 90% of the game and it takes 5% of the time.

The rest of the game is conquering areas with the Civ you picked/received.  That takes 90% of the time.  Since each Civ goes in order with alot of risk-like rolling of dice, there is huge amounts of downtime.  The game is also prone to AP.  And some Civs can't score many points so there is little to do with them but be a spoiler.

4 hours of my life gone, gone, gone. This game plays itself. You get a card, there is only one thing to do with it, so you do it, then wait til you get your own card from someone else, who had no real choice but to give it to you. Then, your armies move where they are supposed to move and a few dice are rolled to determine the winner of some battles in which no player skill was, is or will be needed...blah, blyeach and begone.

Similar to Vinci and Small World, but HotW is longer and inferior to those games.  The bulk of HotW is based on a fairly random method of assigning empires to players.  In lowest VP order, players draw a random empire for the given Epoch, keeping it if they like it or assigning it to another player if they don't.  There are various reasons for keeping/assigning the empires including the fact that your turn order for the round (Epoch) is based on which empire you control (and when that empire appeared in the true historical timeline)... so there can be a lot of thinking and calculating for this part (assigning empires)... but once the empires have been divided, it becomes multiplayer solitaire... where you just try to grab the most points (and bash the leaders) with whatever armies (and start location) you have been assigned.  Unlike Vinci, you are not always selecting your own potential energy (empire) for the turn... instead you are often assigned an empire (probably a crappy one) by your opponents.  Also, HotW has a lot more randomness (die rolls for attacks and event/action cards) than Vinci and Small World.  If I'm in the mood for a leader-bashing, empire-building game, I prefer those two games over HotW... for the shorter play length and reduced randomness.

RATING: 8
Epic classic of waxing and waning empires through the ages. Players are given a series of factions in seven different epochs and must expand them to exert influence over the various geographic areas on the world map. The choice of factions is semi-random as players draw at the beginning of each epoch and either choose to keep the card or pass it to another player. Factions vary in quality so the card draw is a key aspect of the game. From there, the player must do the best with what he is given (or draws). Combat is a simple dice matching mechanic with tactical cards to confer bonuses which last the duration of the epoch. A great empire building slugfest!

Simple rules with excellent replayability.  The down time that others dislike is not a problem with my group.  Not a realistic simulation, but a nicely themed strategy game.  I have the Avalon Hill/Hasbro version.

Played this a lot in the early 90's - but now age is showing. 1st few eras almost seem not worth playing (which would shorten the game!) except for the big empires. Last turn is the major flaw, get a lame duck empire at the end and you're sunk ... also has a problem that on the last turn you only bash players who haven't yet been and scored their points, giving it a 'last turn madness' feel which I don't like.

--- Update, Brief History of the World just seems much better, doubt I'd play this over the remake.

The thing that I enjoy most is the historical mix-n-match (Queen Elizabeth's Crusade!). It's not a hardcore wargame but all the same can still be lengthy to play and there is enough randomness that you can get shafted by a bad draw of cards, epoch after epoch.  Still, I rarely turn down this game if there's time to play.

This is a very nice game: plenty of style and theme; good combat system ([u]Risk[/u]-esque but much more balanced); and a very neat turn mechanic.  If it has any problems, it's that it has far too many counters and suffers from a lot of downtime between each players' turns.  And other players really should NEVER chime in while you're taking your turn; that turns a 3-hr game into nearly 6...

Must have one drink per epoch. Game is fun, but subject to kingmaking, analysis paralysis, and is ultimately too long and frustrating.  There is [u]nothing[/u] more frustrating than to find out that someone passed the Celts to the player who was the Romans when you pick up the damned Khmers at the beginning of the fourth epoch and you weren't even in the top three places scorewise.  Oh and then you have another three hours to play!

Great game for five or six players. Outstanding game for seven players. Every time we have exactly seven people wanting to play a game, this is always first suggestion. Does take a bit of time, however, especially in the later epochs, and especially if you have an indecisive person in the group.

Interesting game that just takes much too long to play in any of the various incarnations. The new Hasbro version is a modest improvement over the AH, which is an improvement again over the original (Gibson's? - although you can't beat their "teacloth" board for being truly odd. You do have to give them credit, though, for a rather imaginative cost-cutting measure, imagination on the production end which more game companies should show).

Relatively fast paced strategy game with a fixed number of rounds. It is very neat how the theater starts in Mesopotamia and slowly expands to engulf the entire world at the end of the game. They way historical facts are woven into the game and come across is excellent.

Eurogamers will prefer [GAMEID=60] instead. Vinci drops Chits, Dice, Special Rules and historical accuracy in favor of a leaner & much faster game play.

I like this game.  The strategy is a bit different in that alot of it has to do with which empires you get so positioning yourself for points int he future is important.  The combat system is real easy and the game is not too difficult to understand.  Those who like deep games with little luck and lots of rules will propbably not like this game.  But for a lighter strategy game it is quite enjoyable.

[b]Thoughts? - [/b]My favourite "world domination" game.  Difficult to know who is winning until the end and keeps everyone involved throughout.  The Avalon Hill update provided some much needed additions to the original game.  On the longer end of the scale and needs everyone's attention for 3-4 hours at least.  Our club has a "thing" about the Hindu Kush in this game too - it is prized above all else for whatever reason.  I love this as a 5-6 player but can play fewer.

One of the progenitors of (the far better) Vinci.  Most of the rest is a Risk derivative.  

Essentially comes down to a turn-order driven version of Vinci with special powers coming from event cards, the civilisations via an inverse draft and Risk-style combat  Figure about 10 minutes worth of play-value per person in a game that takes an hour per person.  Like Risk is very swingy.  A little bad rolling, and it doesn't take much, can doom even the best position (I just watched the British lose 13 of their 20 in combat).  The thematic, boo-yah and overly testosteronal folk will undoubtedly enjoy it but not me.

Quirky civilization based light wargame.  Plays in a more tactical fashion than I had imagined.  There's some strategy there, though, along with a healthy dose of luck.  The historicity is also there, which is surprising given the somewhat abstract nature of the game.  The bottom line, though, is that I had a good time while playing.  The length is a little prohibitive, as are the number of people - since I think it's better with more.  Also, downtime between turns can probably get excessive.  Still, worth playing.

I enjoy this game tremendously. A friend of mine in college introduced me to it as "Civ-Lite", and in a way I still think of it that way. Plays way faster and sets up interesting victory conditions. I play it as a diversion on cold wintery days. 

Complexity is way under Civ, but still lightyears beyond most current games, yet easy to grasp after a few plays. Possible to play within 3-5 hours, although most games for my group usually devolved into 6-7 hour games.

This is a decent game with lots of parts I like. The evolving epochs are fun. The area scoring works well. The combat is clean, and luck tends to balance out over the game. There IS quite a bit of dice rolling, but given the genre that seems fair.

I'm not a huge fan of Vinci, but I think Vinci gives me what I want from this game in a better package. 

Most of these light multiplayer wargames require some diplomacy to create play balance. But inevitably, there is some king-making and some luck in who wins. You can make a few interesting decisions, but for me this feels more like watching a story unfold than playing a challenging game. In the end, the optimal move seems fairly obvious most of the time, so there isn't a lot to agonize over. You just hope the dice are kind to you.

RATING: 4
Very similar to Risk but with added disaster cards, bloodier combat, and more balance potential because of changing control. You need to have at least 4 to make this interesting, with the problem being typical for this style of game: you need a lot of players, but each additional player increases the game length substantially. I can see the charm of the sprawling armies, and massive battles, but rarely have the urge to trot it out. 

As others have said, this game (and others like it) simply play too long for what they are. The theme is nice, as is the presentation, but it is slightly boring to play and much too long for what it actually has to offer. Given a choice between this and a lot of the other accessible stuff that hybrid RPG/board gamers will play, this is a decent option, but it's not something I would ever recommend or play if there were other options available.

Some possible play balance issues (the "British" question - player getting British Empire in last epoch may be in unstoppable position), but this is very dependant on Empire distribution throughout the game, and is not by any means an issue in every playing. Even when it does crop up, this game is so interesting that it doesn't detract for me at all - losing drastically is just as exciting as winning! (Hasbro edition)

Avalon Hill.  Great multi-player game.  Each player plays various civilizations through out history.  The game mechanics are easy.  The tactics for civilization selection makes for good gaming.

Components: Durable pieces, board, and cards, with nice detail, too convoluted, and too much text, respectively.

Experience: Less aggressive than I thought it would be. Most player turns seem to be relatively straight forward: I play 0, 1, or 2 cards, plop down my new empire, and expand as quickly as I can to maximize the points for that particular scoring. I didn't once see someone choose a lower-scoring path with the intention of setting up a future move. Simpler than it looks; longer than it should be; but somewhat entertaining.

I'd play a game if I had folks to play with and an afternoon to kill, but there are other games I'd reach for sooner if the group was willing. I've had this for 15 years or so, and played it several times with my then middle school daughter (who loved history). It's long enough that nowadays the rest of the family won't touch it, and it doesn't have the depth my wargaming friends (and, honestly, I) look for. So it sits forlornly on the shelf.

Epic game of world history. Sounds great? Well.... This game is about maximizing vp's for your nation. 1 epoch, 1 chance to score vp.

Just finished our first ever play. This game RAWKS! Seriously, it is a straight-forward expansion and conquest game, and the system is remarkably clean. Event cards provide significant flavor to the experience. The epoch to epoch "catch-up" mechanism isn't quite as strong as I expected, but then we need to see this over repeated plays.

I like epic civ-type games that span across the ages (basically this and 7 Ages).  This one is more approachable.  I own, but I have never got around to playing the reimplementation "a Brief History of the World."  I do tend to favor the plastic minis that come with this one.  There can be a rich-get-richer problem here though, but there are various workarounds.

Like a thinking man's "Risk".  I love how the game's simple but streamlined mechanics give a feel for the rise and ebb of civilizations.  Super-powerful empires that spring up in endgame sometimes make the earlier epochs a bit irrelevant and can also turn the game into a bit of a lottery.  The sea transportation rules could stand for some clarification.   

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I just love this game.  Some folks say it is a bit random and sometimes it is...but that is also something to love here.  One turn, I will get the Arabs while the next turn someone gets the Romans and someone else gets the Persians.  The only tough thing is when one person gets to end 2 or 3 epochs in a row and then starts the next epoch.  This is a great advantage...but not fatal.  You can still use good strategy to maximize your score to combat this.  This game is a classic and the newest version is the best.

RATING: 7
Fun, but long, and with much dice rolling. Also, the down time when it's not your turn can be a bit excessive. If you play with new players, it's important to give them some guidance in the passing on of empires: it's clearly the most important part of the game and also the place where the strategies aren't imemdiately apparent. A new player can inadvertently hand the game to someone through a careless passing on of an empire.

Strategy boils down to roll 6's and draw the Romans / Huns / Mongols (if you can).  Downtime is pretty bad, and the length is an issue.  Jones theory: Conquest of Nerath

Nice ideas but it doesn't work. Attacking is too powerful and the empire drawing is too luck based. Besides, the player getting G-B in the last round will probably win anyway.

Owned once but sold it.

RATING: 8
Take the reigns of 7 different empires in epochs stretching from the dawn of civilization to present day.  It's a blast and I look forward to playing it again (1 play).  A simple game that compares to Vinci except combat is resolved via dice (rather than being deterministic).  Some would say that a negative is that it has leader bashing.  This is as true as it is in Vinci.  It's an important part of the game and works well. The empire selection process is one way this is implemented successfully.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The new edition of History of the World is a visual treat - gorgeous board and tiny standup figures in seven flavours to represent the armies. Over seven turns, each player gets to play one major empire from that period of time. Using a very simple roll-the-die system to resolve "combat", players attempt to maximise their points by having their armies present, controlling or dominating various regions of the board. Regions rise and fall over time in terms of their worth. Players also have some event cards to influence history. Excellent package, and I like all the rules changes in this new edition (as compared to the earlier Monach Avalon Hill edition).

[Ragnar Brothers] This game really hits a lot of sweet spots. People searching for a "playable civilization" would do well to try this before bemoaning the undiscovered grail. HotW has majorities scoring and a lot of very euro mechanisms for a 15-year old title. But at heart it also scratches the itch for a risk-derivative where you roll lots of dice and rampage armies across the planet. A new player is rolling in no time flat, and the first turn is very forgiving to help new players get a  feel for the game.
 
I think a lot of folks overlook this as a too-simple game to be played 'seriously' but in fact there are a lot of very meaningful choices to be made. It plays 5-6 players very well and deftly avoids the allainces, backsabbing and kingmaking by simply making each player aim to maximize their score on their turn. There are a lot of elegent catch-the-leader mechanisms built into the empire-picking phase at the beginning of each epoch. The Ragnar Brothers crafted one of the best multiplayer games ever, and I contend they are one of the most-overlooked contributors to these games of ours.
 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very mixed feelings. The kingdom-selection mechanism can drive the scoring, and the catch-up mechanism is unreliable. But when it results in a balanced game, it's very compelling... so we should probably investigate alternate drafting methods.

RATING: 10
One of the best of AH’s light multiplayer board games. Lots of interaction, easy rules and mechanics of play, a diversity of actions available to each player and an intriguing theme. An attractive abstract map of the whole world and simple yet nice counters complete the box. The story starts from the first known civilization, the Sumerians and ends just before the eruption of WWI. The whole game is divided in 7 Epochs i.e. 7 game turns. Each game turn a player, based on his cards can bring one or more civilizations into play. He tries to expand it into adjacent or oversea lands, capture resources and build cities and monuments. All of these score points. The highest score gives a winner at the end of play. Using variants that have been published since the first appearance of the game can add more flavor to it.

First time I played this it was enchanting.  I thought it was really cool that some of the civs would remain through out the game.  I still love this as it feels sort of real.  It's a lttle too risk like in a way for me to want to play often, but I always have a great time playing it.

Great story of rise and fall of world civilizations/empires from a military perspective, and very interesting to those with an interest in history.  It is fairly straightforward in its stategies.  Its narrative qualities overcome its problems, which are long turns and downtime, annoying counting up of victory points after each player’s turn, very little player interactivity, and repetitiveness over games.  There is a lot of luck in the game; although there seems to be enough die rolls to average out dice luck, the civilization card draws are a huge luck factor that may not average out and can easily favor one player.  Also, with less players (3-4), less civilizations come out, greatly increasing the civ card luck factor and influencing which civ's do well.

I have played History of the World a couple of times. I have very fond memories playing this game a couple of years back. 

I played a whole lot more before I started recording my games played when joining BGG.

I played Britannia once after playing History of the World. I found Britannia to be very similiar to History of the World because it's the same kind of mechanic. 

Having a different culture every turn is interesting. Especially if your old one can still score many points if they survive 2 or 3 turns. Best is on one turn you play last, the very next turn, if your lucky, you play first. Doing that gives you a big lead in the game or if you were trailing behind, get back in to the game.

Look at my take on Britannia and see the difference. As for nations are concerned, in History of the World, you got one nation per round for each player. Seven rounds total.

In 2010, when I went to the WBC, a friend of mine who`s first time at the convention, got to the final of History of the World. It`s his favorite game.

*Update*

I now own both editions. One with the card board counters, and the one with the plastic pieces. So own two copies.

Despite the new version with the zillions of nice bits and artwork... meh.  Just too long for what it is doing.  I don't feel epic sweep here, just a long churning action as your blobs of color move across the map every once in awhile.

Vinci I find far far better, both in it's comparitive brevity and the civ chits that provide a lot more variety in gameplay.

If a friend REALLY wanted to play this and asked me then I'd do it for the friendship, not because I want to sit there for four hours with an old school design.

It takes some time to prepare the game (and players) for play, but if you're in the right mood, that's already part of the fun.

And that's good for keeping every player involved. Very beautiful and with lots of little plastic pieces also.

I am pleased with the mechanic of the way cards/armies in the 7 phases are chosen--A nice potential equalizer.  Disappointed in the map colors of areas that are very similar & a that vary on the two board halves.  

Strategy, yes, but heavier luck element than I enjoy in dice & cards.

This game is a little reminiscent of Risk and the declines of Small World/Vinci.  

This is obviously an older game with the board in 2 unattached pieces & the two halves of the board having different color quality.

I enjoyed this game, but my friends told me that the new version, A Brief History of World, probably cleans the game up a little, adds a little, shortens it a little, and is overall, an improvement.

Lots of diplomatic efforts; it matters a lot which civilisations you draw. I think Brief History improved on the game considerably with the compensation power-ups for losses, and the replacement of gifting (which didn't seem to work) with drafting. Definitely a long game.

Great game that I'll always play if given the opportunity. It may be heresy, but I think that the Hasbro (2nd) edition rules are actually better than the 1st edition, simply because you don't get bogged down in fighting. My one complaint is that you need at least 4 players to play (5 or 6 is of course optimum), due to the luck of the draw during the last two turns.

All in all, a great game that I highly recommend.

RATING: 5
Too dice-dependant.  Can be a really long wait between turns.  No player elimination (which is good because you won't lose and then be sitting around for 8 hours. You'll just be sitting around for 1 hour until its your turn again ;-) ).  Hardly any player interaction until one of your old empires is being assaulted by the active player's armies.  The game takes too long to explain and play to see the table often.

6 years ago I had this as a 7. Then I moved it to a 6. They are steadily making better and better games. I think HitW is almost entirely replaceable by the elegance and simplicity of Small World.

RATING: 7.5
AH mauve box edition with counters, not plastic figures.  Played all the way through only twice (to date) ... somehow jumping epochs (at seeming warp speed) seems odd, as compared to Civilisation (AH) or Empires in the Middle Ages (SPI) which somehow seem to "flow" better.  
More a fun game with historical "chrome" rather than a historical simulation.   But fun it is!

Played again (Dec 2010) for the first time in many years with wife and kids and had great fun. The flow and ebb of empires is well simulated.  The kids (12 & 8) who usually play Age of Empires, Rise of Nations and Civilization RTS video games really enjoyed the change of pushing counters and "beating" Mum & Dad.

This one was great for a while. But then I got tired of all the chits, and was disillusioned by the length of the game. I like, even less, the miniatures - too fiddly.

Fun, easy romp through World History.  Strategy is fairly straight forward, but is enjoyable to watch develop anyway.  At its best with a group of quick players (<3h in tournament) though a leisurly game can be fun if all are in a chatty mood.

RATING: 6
Only played it once long ago. I just think there are better, less random games on the same or a similar theme. And it's always a little strange for me to play several unrelated civs in a single game, doesn't make for a good story overall. I know it happens in Smallworld which I like, but I like it in spite of that, it's still kind of a negative point. And the apparition of civs right in the middle of yours without your being able to do anything about ir was a little too disruptive too (although that would easily be fixed by a better knowledge of the game). Not bad overall, great figs and interesting theme in principle, but I feel like I have better games at my disposal for that sort of trip.

RATING: 7
A better Risk. Classic game that is great if enough players are involved. It does a decent enough job of conveying the ebb & flow of civilizations come & gone. Rome & England are very powerful, so players need to cooperate in order to keep things more balanced.

I own the Purple Box/1993 edition. I find it far more preferable than the 2001/Hasbro-miniatures edition, since the map is far more aesthetically pleasing and interesting in it's top down design. Also, like anyone, I appreciate miniatures, but the 2001 edition becomes far too fiddly & busy with them. The 1993 edition keeps everything clean-looking & easier on the eyes.

Wow - the new H/AH version has turned my 6 rating into an 8... way to go!

This is an amazing game about the sweep of history - the rise & fall of civilizations. It is NOT a "civ" game - it's a "conquer lands for points" game. 

Warning: it's long-ish (3-4 hours) and is pretty much decided in the last two turns - but if you can get over that, it's a wonderful ride across the ages.

I desperately wanted to like this game more, but it's too long for its payoff in enjoyment.

I love history, so was immediately attracted to the historical aspects of this game.  However, a 6 player game takes 6-7 hours, and its "stop the runaway leader" mechanism doesn't work very well at all.

I play the computer version now, but doubt I would ever play the board game version again.

I don't consider Britain-America -thing being that much of a problem, but don't get me started on the downtime between the turns. An hour can pass watching other people do their stuff, with only few changes to roll a dice to make feeble attempts to defend your own empire. Entertaining game nevertheless, just a bit too long and slow for it's own good.

RATING: 7
Another old classic. A lighter and faster relative of Civilization, spoilt a bit by downtime issues (if there are many players) and the luck of the card draws and dice rolls. The UK rules work better, IMHO, though I do usually import one or two US rules - such as points for controlling sea areas, along with fleet support rules.
Excellent for younger members of the family due to the fun of the dice rolling and the educational value.

Too long to get much game time now.  Tends to come down to the deal of the cards in the last couple of epochs. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Much like Small World, you control a number of different empires as the game progresses and score points for both your active and previous empires (what's left of them anyway). In all there is a fair mix of strategy in selecting your active empire, and maximizing your point scoring through unit placement combined with a fair amount of luck in combat dice rolls and event cards. One of the best aspects of the game is that it is fairly short in length, especially for a game whose central theme is global domination over the course of recorded human history. I've always played it with 5 or 6 players, I imagine fewer players would likely result in a less enjoyable game, as most of the fun is from watching your old empires disappear with alarming rapidity under the onslaught of numerous upstarts.

I have always loved this classic game. Probably my love for History has something to do with it. The core of the game is quite simple: play successive empires along seven epochs and try to maximize their development. Extension, wealth and built monuments provide Victory Points. As time goes by, new empires will replace old ones. Overall, even if it is a game, it offers a nice "historical journey" and introduces many different more or less known civilizations.

The game is better with 5 or 6 players (otherwise there is less interaction between empires). The only problem I see is the lenght of a game with so many players.

I really like History of World, but it's nice to have a football game on or a crossword puzzle nearby, since individual players will be uninvolved for long stretches (unless playing with just two or three players).  My rating is for the early-1990s Avalon Hill edition.  I don't like the changes made in the newer Hasbro/Avalon Hill edition.  Unfortunately, the game often turns on who gets the best/worst empires in the last age.  To help avoid the problem, I recommend the following tweaks:  Britain gets 16 build points, France gets 12 build points, and the U.S. has limited navigation of the Pacific (but not Pacific ).  This way, Britain's not an auto-win and the U.S. is not an auto-loss.

RATING: 6
I like the game and would rate rate it as an 8 if it wasn't so long and had too much downtime between turns. Also is the scoring mechanism confusing in that way that it's difficult to have a good feeling of much you or someone else is scoring (if you don't spend a lot of time counting on different possibilies, which would make the game even more tedious). The rules are on the other hand unusually short and clear.

During the forth game of this I began to feel weary.  I have enjoyed the narratives that the game provides, enhanced by the production values of this edition, but I found myself wishing for the end (in more ways than one), well before it came.  As my regular brother in gaming failed to rouse himself from the perpetual AP that frustrates us all, I toyed with a plastic spoon, wondering if he would make his move before I had finished scooping my heart out with it. It has been retired in favour of...well, anything else really.  I might be persuaded to play with my kids if they ever insist.

Really an amazing game.  The only difficulty is the time commitment.  Even experienced players can be defeated by poor empire draws (which is what luck is all about).  

Plays best with 6.  5 players seems to have rare occurences with 6 players become merely infrequent.  With 4 the game really starts to break down because there is much less competition and difficult interaction of constant conquest.

First game was with 6 players I think and was quite fun. Second game with just 3 players kind of bored me. Counting up the scores each epoch was a bit of a pain. The age old problem of dice annoyed me too. Not that I'm dice-ist or anything but they seem to cause unrealistic things to happen in many games, this being one of them.
I'd probably be happier if it was only 3 epochs or something cos then the game wouldn't last as long and any bad luck wouldn't annoy me as much.

Excruciating. For the life of me I don't understand the affinity so many gamers and war-gamers have for this lame excuse for a game. The title belies the gameplay. Each new Epoch produces the (actual) historical empires out of thin air regardless of the effects of the previous epoch's dice driven overlapping massacres which successively leave the map looking nothing like the situation which would have given rise to the new epoch's civilisations. Beyond illogical all the way to insulting. Not a 1 because according to the rating guidelines I don't consider it broken, just a dreadful waste of time.

I enjoy this one quite a bit.  I think this is one of those games that you are always still in no matter how far behind.  I also like learning about the more obscure civilizations.

THIS RATING AND REVIEW ARE FOR THE "BASIC" GAME.  Advanced game could rate higher.

Its fun.  Yeah its risk with some fixes.  Yeah the only actual decision making is in what card you keep and what card you pass, and everything else is just an optimization exercise.  So what?  Its a lot of fun, and the basic game is surprisingly balanced.  I haven't played the advance game, but the basic game resulted in a final score with 4 out of 5 players within 8 points of each other...  thats incredible for a game where you score over 200 and there aren't really any mechanisms to artificially keep the game close.

Very Good: Strategic - Ameritrash - Easy

I was a bit sceptical when I opened the box and saw the rules but once I got the hang of it it was very interesting. You can reduce the duration by simple leave two epocs. Also you can take the worst and best civilizations out of each epoc for a better balance.
Highly recommended.

Great bits and pieces, luck plays definately a factor as to what Culture you get but the biggest issue you might have is playing time. Playing all the epochs with let's say 4 or 5 playerstakes a good 4-5 hours 

Revisited: great game every time we play. For competitive players it might not be suitable but for family gaming this is perfect. For shorter games: leave out Epoch 1 and 7.

See session report.

A fun game, plays best with four or five players but tends to overstay its welcome with the larger group. Still works with three but some empires should be removed (the strongest and weakest of each epoch) otherwise there tends to be a run away leader. I like the hasbro/AH (3rd ed?) changes, plays a little faster - plastic figures  and beer go well together.

A much better version of Risk.  Having a new empire each turn means that hope springs anew at the prospect of catching the leader.

For a loooooooooong game, I really enjoyed this!  Yes, it is heavily luck dependent (dice).  i really enjoy, however, the &quot;leveling&quot; mechanism of picking a card and either choosing to keep it or pass it on.  I suppose some of you will call this one multiplayer solitaire, but it&#039;s still a lot of fun.  And yes, my fun factor may be biased by the fact I beat the crap out of four guys who knew the game already...by more than 40 points!

(12/05/2013) Comment based on one play of Avalon Hill 1st Edition.

This is a multi-civilization, card-drafting, area-control hybrid game, that combines the feel of the classic Avalon Hill chit games, such as Civilization and Wizard's Quest. At first glance, this is a more complex version of Small World, but being that this was produced in 1991, it is mostly likely History of the World influenced Small World. However, the name is somewhat misleading--it could be easily construed as a history trivia game, or a game of historical figures, as evidenced by the box art. It is not. It is, however, a very decent macro-simulation of the rise-and-fall of empires and nation-states.

Play is very familiar, if one has played Small World. In each of seven epochs, a player will draw an empire card, which will indicate where they start on the world map, how many units (or "strength points") they start with, whether they have a city or not, and also sea areas where they can place ship units. From the starting point, each empire can "move" into adjacent territories or sea areas, and combat is much like Risk: two dice for the attacker and one die for the defender. High die wins and kills an opposing unit, while ties are re-rolls. There are terrain effects, coastal support, forts, and event cards that can up the number of dice or add a die modifier. Some territories have "resources" that allow the active player to build monuments. The player expands as far as they wish, only limited to the number of stating units, and then they score for that epoch. Players score in two categories: 1) total number of capitals (2 VP each), cities, monuments, and seas (all 1 VP each), and 2) area control of the 13 regions of the world. The player checks whether they have "presence", "dominance", or "control" in each of the regions, where they get progressively more points for more control. However, the game initially starts with only four regions in play, with one or two regions added in each epoch. The values of certain regions grow with each epoch, but some start to fall as they become historically relatively unimportant. The players keep a running total, with highest VP winning at the end of the seventh epoch.

What is unique about HotW is that in each epoch, players draft empire cards. The player that has had the lowest total "strength", or total of all the units they have received from previous empire cards--with total VP being the tie-breaker--will draw first, and that determining turn order for empire drafting. They can look and then either keep the card or give it face down to another player. If they choose to give away the card, the next player in turn order will draw and either keep or give the card away. This continues until all players have an empire card. The empire turn order is fixed for each epoch; for example, in Epoch I, Egypt is first to act, with Crete acting second, and so on, with great empires from history showing up on the board in a roughly chronological order. Each empire will expand (using counters specific to that epoch, but in a color specific to that player) much like they did in history, as far as they can and then stop. The next empire will then show up, most frequently showing up in the middle of an existing empire, expanding, and then stopping. Just like in Small World, the empires will immediately go into decline, but their units will stay indefinitely on the board, and not disappear after some time like in Small World--the units must be explicitly removed through conquest. Interestingly, players score VP for presence/dominance/control not on the specific epoch counters, but on the color of the counters. Thus, the counters from previous epochs count toward area control for each region, sort of like residual income. 

The players are also given a hand of event cards, which includes an assortment of "take that" cards, such as famine, barbarians, civil war, rebellion, and disasters (all similar sounding to those found in Civilization and Age of Renaissance), as well as one-time use military advantage cards--the most common being Leadership, which allows the active empire to roll three dice, instead of two. Some of these are limited to specific epochs, while others are available for use in all seven epochs. The players are limited to using no more than two per epoch. The players are also each given a sub-empire card, which simulates the rise of smaller empires throughout the board, sort of like non-player characters. The treatment of Barbarians, for example is similar to that in Advanced Civilization.

The rules and mechanics are relatively simple. Initial explanation took no more than 5 minutes, with other game concepts explained as the game progressed. However, this is a much longer game than Small World, with a 4-player game clocking in at 4-hours where we had to stop at Epoch VI. The components are pre-Hasbro AH quality, much like Civilization and Age of Renaissance, with artwork being functional and clear. Otherwise, it was more useful using a paper-based scoring sheet, instead of using the on-board score track. Gameplay was smooth and relatively quick for each player, although the downtime between epochs was long. Still, it was fascinating to watch the rise and fall of great empires, such as the Romans, or the Mongols, or the Ottoman Empire. As quickly as they expanded, garnering a lot of VP for the active player, such empires were then quickly crushed by the next empire in line.

There is a lot to like in this design. The card-drafting for empire selection is unique, giving the weaker players (based on the total strength of all of their units) a catch-up mechanism. The player who played the Roman Empire (which gets a whopping 25 units, most of any one empire in the game), for example, gained many points in their Epoch, but then suffered for the rest of the game not getting to draw first. Drafting first or early is important, since undesirable empire cards could be given to the leader(s), hindering their expansion. Each of the empires represented had a unique feel, as represented by their starting location, then number of units, and if they had sea access. Thus, even through simple game mechanics, the empire cards would entice players to behave/act just like their historical counterparts. Also, skillful play of the event cards was paramount to the relative success or failure of a given empire, and thus affecting the standing of the player in the game. However, good or bad die-rolling could have a profound effect as well, much like in Risk. 

If you like Small World, chances are you'll love History of the World. If you like the gambling aspect of figuring out the odds or probability of die rolls, as well as the area control aspect of Risk, you'll enjoy this. The same goes for Civilization, Wizard's Quest, and other "dudes on a map" games; if you enjoy those, this may be an intriguing step-up in terms of complexity, as offered by the asymmetrical starts and event card play. I'd also add that if you enjoy Struggle of Empires, this may be a simpler, faster alternative that seems to scratch the same itch (albeit without the alliance mechanism), even though it models a much longer timeframe, and playable with four instead of the recommended five or seven with SoE. I can easily say that this is a "great", "classic" game based on one play. It is simply a blast to play! I rate it a strong "8", with possible room to move up. I would definitely like to get a copy of the 1st edition.

Update (01/18/2014) 2 plays: First play with my own copy. Taught three newbies, where a 4-player game took 4 to 4.5 hours, including rules explanation. The fun aspect is the dice-rolling Ameritrash combat system, and just like Risk, invokes chants and cheering. One of the players did not like the game, since he was picked on for most of the game due to his early lead. Surprisingly, the near-last place player zipped ahead in the later epochs. The last player was only six-seven points behind. The early leaders were in third and fourth place, respectively. So, the common criticism of multi-player war games was laid against this game, since leader-bashing will occur. As a classic AH "beer and pretzel" game, it shines. Still an "8", but you will need to find gamers who are not so die-hard grognards.

A light wargame with a civilization buiding theme. Beside some strategic and tactical considerations to make it also has a strong luck base component. Which makes it the ideal candidate for a friday evening after a taxing work-week. Its age tells, it can burden you with quite a long down-time if you moved first in one turn and move last in the next turn. It allows for 6 players, but we play it usually with 5 players, otherwise it would take to much time. See "A Brief History of the World...

This is a game that feels as though it was invented in the 70's as it's highly random and goes on far too long for such a simple system. I don't really like the 'scripted' empires, more randomness a la Vinci would increase the interest, but then brings its own 'luckiness' issues. The Brief History version at least addresses the 'one less epoch' feel, so I don't think I'll be seeking this out again.

Really neat game design from 'back in the day'.  You can see from where Vinci / Small World developed.  Combat engine is basically Risk, with a some minor tweaks.

I enjoy dice games, but HotW tries to minimize their affect as much as possible and then makes you roll them incessantly.  Not a smart combo.  At this length (5-6 hours) there are many other excellent games, or you can get 2/3rds the fun from Vinci in 1/4th the time.

There are some clever bits here, and while you're taking your turn, it's a blast.  But the downtime is just unacceptable, and there are much better games that you could be playing in this amount of time.  It's occurred to me recently that this is almost the prototypical PBEM game, and I'll have to try it out that way.  Face to face, though, this is just far too slow for me to anticipate playing again.

EDIT:  Yes, this is indeed an excellent PBEM game, where it rates as more like an 8.  I'm not sure how to put my rating for this, so I'll just leave it at 3, noting that that is only for the board version of this game.

Like Risk on steroids.  Each round you get an empire to play, which gives you a handful of army tokens to rampage across the board with.  Then you score up points.  Key point is that surviving tokens from previous empires still score as well.  Like Small World.  The moment in the spotlight is fun, especially when the dice cooperate.  Then it's the next guy's turn.  A bit of down time between moves, except for defending your guys.  Also a bit long.  Lots of strategy choices on how to get the most out of your fistful of guys.  Good fun and a nice sense of the ebb and flow of history.

Rating based on the older AH version. The empire selection mechanism doesn't work for me (too random), in practice my group always bid for empires. Apart from that, a good game with lots of historical feel. Like Britannia, quite heavily scripted, which is to my liking.

There's a little opportunity for skillful play here, particularly as regards turn order and a quick "double score" but also wild imbalances in the civilization cards.

Any game with a civ theme is going to get second chances with me.  And it is nice not to have to get too invested in one civilization - that way can lead to frustration.  The asynchronous rise of new empires works very well here.

In the end a dicefest, would be good at 90 minutes, but unfortunately takes over three, sometimes four.  I'll play if suggested but at that game length I usually want something heavier.

Update 2/2010:  Theme just isn't enough to save this snoozer.  Should never be played in the same weekend as Advanced Civ.

My 1st game played in 2005 and it was 6 good players at my Nephew's. Very chaotic but interesting, I made the most of what I got for 3rd place. The best part was playing with my Nephew(U.S. Army) and his friends who are the perfect gaming group. They actually all know the rules and are competitive without being abrasive. Wowie-Zowie!Update: I really love this game and will now only play it with all the advanced/optional rules (navies/no Pre-Eminence/3 army or 2 and fort stacking).

The newer AH/Hasbro version is the one you want to get.  The plastic pieces and streamlined rules make this one a 'must have' for any game collection.  My only problem with the game, and one that keeps it from getting a better rating, is its length... 4 hours+ with a full compliment of players.

Ameritrash at its finest... done by the Britons! It's random, bad luck can deprive you of any chances to win, leaderbashing is the name of the game and whoever gets Britain in the last epoch has a good chance to win the game no matter what happened in the 4 hours before. But the rise and fall of civilisations feels so epic and the civilisation distribution mechanism has me on my toes every era that I don't care about all the randomness. It just should be the right group that doesn't have any cross-gaming tendencies and can correctly evaluate the board position.

I played the 1993 AH version. This is an area control game with little real interaction between players - no one has a meaningful choice outside their own turn. Lots of tactics, little strategy.

NOTE: I have subsequently learned that we were playing a major rule wrong, so my take on this game is very slanted...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Another game with a love/hate relationship.  The mechanics are truly unique.  This is a war game at it's heart.  I have a few knocks on it: heavy luck factor, a lot of downtime between plays, and civilization distribution can be quite unfair.  There are certain civilizations that are simply too devastating to get and they can unfortunately go to the last place player.  That can make for a long and unenjoyable evening of gameplay.  The components in the 1993 edition are poor too.  It's difficult to find cities/capitals/monuments in the mess of chits.  I have my eye on the 2001 edition that comes with plastic pieces! Despite my criticisms, I love this game.  I simply enjoy trying to maximize my civilizations and enjoy the thrill of finding which civ I will lead during ever epoch.  The cards add some nice variety and the combat is simple and heavily favored to the attacker (which makes thematic sense since the current civ is the more advanced civ).

This is one of my all time favourite games, and I'm always happy to play it. Unfortunately on too many occasions this has meant getting into a 6 hour session starting at midnight...

Good game.  You just need enough time to devote to it.  Great theme keeps my attention.  Game pace is a bit slower than the typical Euro game, but shares some important features; mainly that no one is eliminated.  The allocation of powers is creative.  While the Hasbro edition is great with all its nice sculpted plastic figures, I had plenty of fun on the earlier AH cardboard counter version.

Hmmmm. The only thing about it from an esthetic point of view is that expanding your empire tends to be kind of a no-brainer. The most strategy comes in deciding whether to keep of give away your card. Not sure how that mechanic emulates anything about CIV building, but...

RATING: 7
Fairly simple, but long wargame (up to 5 hours with four players). On the positive side: this game will end after the seventh epoch and won't go on forever. Rolling the dice can get a bit tedious towards the end when most of the countries are in play and a lot of battles have to be decided. Selecting the civilization card and deciding to keep it or pass it on at the beginning of each epoch is a good balancing mechanism. Try to spread your different civilizations over the world. Proven by experience: it is possible to make a winning comeback when almost in a hopeless last place in the first epochs (at the end of the third epoch, I had only one lonely warrior left on the board and my score was significantly behind the other three players). The rise and decline of the civilizations on the board is nicely simulated, although in my opinion it has been implemented even better in Britannia.

[Original] The largest drawback to this game is that each historical age is dominated by 1 or 2 empires. If you do not happen to get (via a lucky draw) a powerful empire in a particular age, then you watch the other players steamroll you. (Or visa versa, if you get Rome or Great Britain, for example, then you wipe out everyone else during those respective ages.) Additionally, once you play a few times, it's more of the same. I cannot imagine playing over and over. The rulebook is a hefty document in itself, and is not for the faint of heart.

I love longer strategy games involving world domination...:-)  I like the 7 epochs concept which doesn't allow for player elimination as well as the idea that there are different ways to gather points than just flat out war RISK style.  Very tactical in that you aim to score as many points as possible as your unique empire in each of the 7 epochs.  The unique empire selection system generally gives the losing players a chance to catch up and is also where much of the strategy of this game lies as you seek to dump an empire on someone that puts them in a place to earn less points.  Look to stick them in the middle of an area they already own from a previous empire, make sure they go late in a turn if they have a lot of points on the board at the end of the previous turn, etc...  Lots of downtime, its certainly not for the faint of heart!

I played the latest Avalon Hill&#039;s version with Andriez, Frank, Ken in a 4-player game for the first time.  The game is fun to learn and to play as history &quot;unfolds&quot; not alike history...I can jump into the game quite easily.  With random player sequence, special abilities cards on hand, and any faction can come up from behind (not mine though...)The little miniature figures made in China appeal to my fair childhood when we played the small army men just on the playground.  The map is colorful covering all the world. No combat result table but to use simple dice roll (higher wins) to resolve combat.  No excessive dice-roll like that in &quot;Risk&quot;.  The sudden emergence of a particular faction out of nowhere or at the heart of another faction makes this game more gamey than it was otherwise meant to be as it, at least, was added historical flavour with historical names, places and events. Not really a simulation even on this such a highly abstract level but just a plain fun game. Essentailly this is still a resources game and territorial dominance over several continents is the objective to win (with the highest victory points accumulated).  The huge size of the new Avalon Hill&#039;s version just scared me off to have a copy on my own.  If you are lack of storage space, go back to find the original AH&#039;s version prior to Hasbro takeover. A good and solid multiplayer game and a great educational tool about history in high school.

A was game with incredibly simple rules but a remarkable amount of depth.  The sheer number of civilizations in the game (over fifty) is impressive, even if the practical distinctions are simply size and geographic locations.  That said, the combat system is straightforward and does not distract from the game.  The turn structure is absurdly simple.  Really, the only real complaint might be the abstraction that somehow connects each civilization you play in each epoch to the next for scoring purposes.  But this is minor, as we are playing a game and we do need to do game-y things sometimes.  A knockout success.

RATING: 8
This lovely game represents an interesting middle-of-the-road option  between the chit-stacking, endlessly fiddly, but historically authentic Avalon Hill-style wargames of the 70s and the sleeker Euro-style games of war and conquest dominating the market today. The rules are surprisingly easy to internalize given the complexity of what actually goes on during gameplay, and tactical decisions are quite simple for the most part; the pleasure comes mostly from watching the stately march and retreat of all the world's great civilizations back and forth across the globe over time. My one complaint is that the Epoch cards introduce a bit too much of a luck factor that the card-drawing stage (while a clever wrinkle) doesn't really help to cancel out as well as it should.

A pretty good choice to draw in non-gamegeeks, because of colorful pieces and map, simple rules . . and who can resist a game where each round is centuries long?

This is basically a cross between Risk and Small World.  The game is played in seven ages where you draft a civilization from that age.  Some civs are better than others but throughout the game you should average out.  Your civilization spreads out and you score based on territories that own cities, wonders and the number of spaces you own.  You also get a hand of cards to assist you in the game and some must be played in certain ages, some in only one age.  You are limited in the number of special cards you can play.  

The game is long with high player counts.  Only the new Avalon Hill edition is worth getting.  I would like to own this but it is far to expensive.

Very fun game which is almost worthy of the amount of time it takes to play with 5 or 6 players.  Much better when everyone plays quickly and knows the rules.  Otherwise, it has a tendency to drag out longer than you think it should.

The nice idea is to control different empires during the game, with the distribution helping the trailers (thus keeping the endgame as open as possible). But it has a fair deal of randomness in the execution, the possibility of targeted screwage and is quite long.

The bits and map are nice, most of the mechanics are fine, but one thing ruins it for me: For each turn, you only have to worry about maximizing your score that turn.  there is no long term strategy.  Add to that the fact that, on any given turn, and after every roll on that turn, the optimal VP scoring path is easily and definitively calculable means that there are no tough decisions to make.

This is a fun game if you find the right group of people to play it with.  The analysis paralysis of this game is fun on your turn, but playing with a large group may mean a large amount of time between turns.  The drafting technique for each epoch is clever.

RATING: 4
nicely presented and certainly has the historical feeling of rising and falling civilizations (exclusively in the military aspect) but this is also the downside of the game, because the game plays you instead of you playing the game.

History of the World works under the assumptions that all empires eventually fade and that the only things differentiating great empires from lesser ones is how much territory they conquer and how long it takes for their civilizations to disappear. To that end, the game is played in epochs, with every player handling a new empire during each; yes, some empires will be stronger than others, but a few clever mechanisms largely balance that out. At the end of each epoch, players score points for all their forces (from the current and previous empires) remaining on the board.

Too long game. Leader is always hammered by other players so it comes down to last epoch and luck which empire you get. And I just hate when new empires take your conquered areas for free. Experienced players can counter this as they know where the new empires will start their conquest.

I think the bidding variant could save this game. Next time we'll surely try it instead of normal rules.

I really like this game for the first 5 turns.  Then, the colonialism turns (6 and 7) turn into a gigantic scramble for scattering VP spots which isn't particularly fun and dwarfs all the strategy that came before.  It also always takes 2 hours longer than I would like it to.

Based on the old AH edition, not the "new" AH edition with loads of pretty plastic bits.

This has seen the table once in my current gaming group and it wasn't a big hit.  The most enjoyable part seemed to be rolling dice to blow things up, but I'd think that would be better accomplished with any number of different games (Risk, A&A, etc.)  I suspect that we won't see this return anytime soon.The only upside is it might lead us to more complex civilization games like Civilization or 7 Ages.

I like this game a lot. It is quite simple to play and yet it gives a colorful insight on the raise and decline of world civilizations. All the great civilizations and empires are in the game, though not all appear in each play of the game. Rules are simple and easy to graps, usually after a couple of turns players will start to create strategies. Also there is a good crescendo of complexity regarding the board situation, as the map is more and more full of pieces each turn. New opportunities as going to America or Africa in the latter turns are appreciated as they allow to make points beyond the war torn Europe and Middle East regions.

A good game to teach simple history, to learn to play simulation games and to have a good time with some friends, without having to read the rules once during the game.

Despite it's length (6 hours for a 3 or 6 player game), I might have played more games of this than any other. My wife loves the game too, which helps explain the large number of plays. Very simple rules, lots of historical flavor. The distribution of empires is particularly exciting. Suffers from downtime in 5 and 6 player games and excessive randomness in 4 player games. I think 3 players (each controls two colors) is ideal and most of my plays have been with 3 players. Combat involves rolling lots of dice, so avoid if you find that irritating.

History of the World actually has some neat things going on.  I like the minis, I like the cards and how they influence play.  I didn't like the map that much, which is skewed.  It's somewhat disorienting to look at.  That's not why I rate the game so low however.  I really dislike long games for the most part.  2 hours spent playing one game is usually my absolute limit before my enjoyment of the game starts to plummet.  At about the 2 1/2 hour mark of playing this game I realized we were only about half way done at best.  It was headache inducing.  Turns take too long, and there's not a whole lot to do when it's not your turn unless you are attacked.  You could literally have nothing to do for half an hour at a time playing this game.  Never again.

I love this game - but I am not a person who is turned off by longer board games. Nice components, nifty "epoch" system and lots of combat. May not be for those who don't like "fiddling" with tiny plastic pieces or who don't like the luck factor of rolling dice. We think the dice rolling adds some tention and unpredictability, plus lets other players participate out of turn. If we want a non-dice game in the same genre, we play Vinci. But this gets equal billing in all of my game groups.

After years of having my enthusiasm for trying this game run hot and cold, finally got a play in.  And, you know, it's rather enjoyable.  The map is rather nasty-looking (real Avalon Hill version) and counting points can be a little repetitive, but we had a really close game that went right down to the end, and finished a 4 player game in only three hours.  I have since gotten a copy for myself: had to have it.

Sept '15: played with my son and his friend, and everyone was enthralled for all four plus hours, which is something for some young boys.  Straightforward game with many advantages over Risk.

Long, slow (an hour per player) and not very "interactive".  Most decisions seem obvious, or am I missing something?

This is a more involved game than Risk, with good historical flavour and some decent mechanics, just wished that it played faster. 

A lot of the game is positioning for the critical final Epoch.  You have to maintain your position without always being first in points to maximize your chance of getting a good empire.  Quite a bit of luck for such a long game.

The game as published by Hasbro is broken.  Specifically, when somebody is behind, and they draw an "average" power empire - and they know that they need something better to get back in the game - they take a chance and could end up with another that is worse, making the losers lose worse.  Bidding works a lot better. . . but the rating stands for the current ruleset.  Also, the bang for the buck as far as time goes is just intolerable. . . 5.5 hours = a huge investment of time.

One of the best games ever. In essence Britannia moves to the world stage and gets better. Plays really well with four players, a bit slow (though more historically accurate) with six.

Have a copy of the original version with the cardboard counters. Fantastic Game - ranks alongside Civilization as a real classic! In many ways it is more enjoyable than Civilization as you have more opportunity to stay in the game (one bad turn doesn't knock you out of any real chance like it can in Civ) - and there is always the opportunity to get the British Empire in the last Epoch, which provides large nubmers of victory points, meaning nearly anyone can win from anywhere - even if coming last prior to that turn.

One of our most frequently played games both at home and during our gaming nights out. Not so much fun with just two people.

Plays like RISK on steroids with more considerations. Key difference is that players will control 7 different Empires over the course of the game and points can be scored by old empires whilst they exist. Excellent game if you don't mind dice rolling combat mechanics.

I like the idea of limiting your army size to the civilization you draw, but the end-game bonus scoring system tends to create a runaway winner.

This is a good game...grand scale...appealing look...and challenging to win....one of my favorites...wish two player game was better...very educational in the leader and civilization cards...wish i could play this more, but it does take time to finish...which i like...downgrading after playing 7 Ages, which has improved this game dramatically...7 Ages is History of the World on Steroids

This is for Risk players that are tired of conquering Siam every single round for hours.
Empire adds this nice twist that you act as the Mongols or the Romans and guess what: Your advance through Spain stops in Southern France just like the original Arabs. Better luck next time.

[b]History of the World[/b]

Some reviews compare it to Smallworld, since it shares the game mechanic where new civilizations are constantly coming onto the board replacing the older civs. If I remember correctly, the dice battles are similar to Risk, where the defender wins in the event of a tie.

Haven't played this enough to rate it fairly.

One of the best games if ever randomly pulled of a shelf. History of the world is a wargame like few others, in which no player is left with nothing to do for half the game because he has been beaten out of the game. We play wargames every monday and this game is perfect because noone comes to the session and spends half the evening looking at waht the other players do, with no hope of ever having anything important to do. And the way the nations get distributed means that no two games are alike. I've played it for three or four years and have still been surprised at some of the things that happen. A must have for wargamers.

I can usually convince the whole family to play this one. An educational alternative to Risk. There is less strategy than in Risk however because you can't plan anything ahead due to the uncertainty of Empire draw. Most of the time all you can do is optimize the marginal VP gains.

[one play]  Played the newer Hasbro exition with 4 players.  It was a little shorter and simpler than I expected, which is good.  Unfortunately, there was a massive run away leader issue.  Variants have been suggested to alleviate this but none were used in our game.  As the owner of the game said, you rarely need to play Epoch VII to determine a winner.  He was certainly right in our case.

The luck/randomness of the Empire draws also baffled me - why give players such limited control over the most critical aspect of the game?  That would add complexity and length to the game thus reducing the accessibility of the game - but I think it would be more than worth it.

My wife's favourite. We played a couple of games at a friends many years ago and she went out and bought herself a copy (the original Avalon Hill release).

We don't play as much as we used to - takes 4-5 hours to get a game in and we don't seem to get that sort of time lately.

Will probably become a family favourite when our daughters get a little older and start playing.

RATING: 7
Bank on an hour per player. This is a longer dice fest I enjoy, probably because you're driven by the need to maximise points and things therefore don't get too personal as you beat up your friends. Great theme and very atmospheric. Which is good because the downtime is pretty bad with just the occasional dice roll in defense to keep you occupied while the other players plan and maximise their moves. Your results pretty much depend on getting a spread of civs around different spots in the world, getting good event cards which also allow you to spread, and other players not hitting you too badly. You get the picture that a lot depends on things other than your decision making. But it's still fun when it's your turn and your launching troops left, right and centre. When it finally gets to your turn at least. In the meantime you can help score, sort out your different unit types, table talk like crazy, help score ...

Based on one play: I thought this game would be way more complicated. Each round you get one civilization, that you play only once, attacking others to gain control of regions by either being presence, having majority or having full control. The next round, based on how strong your precious civilizations were, you get to select or have a civilization given to you, which you will use also only once. However all your civilizations score each round, so they add up. Very good mechanics that are simple but create a very interactive game.

This is a very good war/strategy game.  War mechanics are not difficult, but decision making on choosing a civilization and what to do with it are very interesting.

Lengthy but interesting strategic flow of warring civilizations style game. Felt like Vinci (civ expansion/decline) crossed with Risk (territory values) with a lot more chrome, downtime, and game length. Prefer Vinci for the more varied civilizations and choices - as one is often constrained as to what to do on your turn which removes all but the micro-decisions. I prefer the larger decisions to decide the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A vast improvement over the good game Civilization. The game can be given away by a player who doesn't understand the epoch selection and round scoring rules.  Also, the last epoch is rather weak and makes the end of the game rather anti-climatic, just missing out on an 8. First AH version is much better as far as rules and the use of counters rather than all the fussy plastic miniatures (capitals/cities and fortresses are the exception). Hasbro edition adds more luck and barely reaches a 7. Game still runs long and the feeling of executing a strategy with good tactics may be more of an illusion than we think.

I would consider a final VP/Strength ratio to be the better measure of victory.

RATING: 8.5
This is one of the best group war games around. It allows up to 6 players and is fairly easy to learn and play. Considering that the scope of the game is huge (recreating all the major empires of history) the play mechanics are amazingly clean. Players take turns expanding an empire across the board to capture as much territory and as many resources as possible. At the end of your turn you add up your score and the next guy goes. Previous empires stay on the board until they are eliminated in combat so your score becomes cumulative if older empires manage to hang on for a long time. Later rounds can be somewhat long, but overall the game moves along a fast pace. The typical game takes about 4 hours to play so make sure you a full evening available.

This was a fun, however long game to play.  It is important to note there are both strong and weak civilizations.  Therefore, with this being said each player will hopefully pull an even mix of strong and weak.  It is important to capture areas that give points during that epoch.  This is done through domination of an area, capturing key areas that allow you to build monuments in your capital and sea areas.  Oceans do not give you any points, however with sea units in oceans you can invade all land areas as long as you have a chain of sea units.  This last piece of information is valuable for the end game.

We found the estate sale online several days ago, and in one obscure photo of a book shelf she spied "History of the World." She texted me and asked, "Is this game any good?" I quickly looked it up on BGG and found how awesome the game was.

She made plans to get to the sale and got #15 in line. She headed right to the book shelf in the photo and BAM! Still there! I have an awesome wife...

Atmospheric simulation of the history of civilization. Enjoy having the Americans take out France and the Russians invade London. The extreme length (an hour per player) and downtime, coupled with the convulted scoring towards the end of the game makes this something I would rarely play ftf.

Much, much better to play online (as Empire) as you don't need to worry about down time and the cumbersome scoring system. I'd almost rate it a 10 online.

RATING: 4
I see little point in wasting hours upon hours playing a game pre-modeled by scripted, inevitable changes in power as each turn follows the next.

In my battle games I want strategy, not an exercise in applying spur-of-the-moment, survival tactics for my forces overwhelmed by a round-by-round, who-plays-what lottery.

Besides, dice-run battles like these I left behind for good when I quit Risk. There are a slew of better systems out now.

However, if ancient military history is your cup of tea, you might be attracted to this game, as it explains events better that a textbook. Provided you can read rules like these.

It tries too hard to be historiclly accurate. But this affects gameplay(makes it worse), game balance(you get Rome, you have a 90% chance of winning) and therefore enjoyment(especially unenjoyable after three hours).

If you want a Risk-type game but with more to it, HoW fits the bill.  I really enjoy watching a civilization grow and ebb as the years unfold.  Little swingy and runs a little longer than I would like, but it's definitely fun and I enjoy getting in a game every now and then.

You've got to be wise in playing your Event Cards or you will get left behind.  My group is nutso about this one, and I think next time we play I'd like to implement the bidding variant.  It is long, but one gets caught up in the sweep of history watching the Arabs or Mongols flood Asia, or placing an inconspicuous Celt in Ireland early on (only to score big points later).

An enjoyable game that perfectly captures the rise and fall of the mighty empires of the past.  Clever mechanics spread the action across the board and the way that the map gets more crowded as the eons pass adds a realistic feel to the game.  Watch out for those pesky Romans!

RATING: 7
A solid Risk-type wargame.  Lasts 1 hour per player.  I'd say there are 3-4 hours of fun in this game, so I don't recommend playing with more than 4 players.  Also, I wish that there was more historical flavor to the different epochs.  It's basically the same game of Risk repeated seven times over, regardless of which Civ you are playing.  Still, it's a very deluxe package, and the rules keep all players in the game until the end which is a nice change from Risk.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Battles play out like 'Risk', but that's where the similarities end.  Each player controls seven turns worth of empires in his color.  Points are given for having past empires still around.  All empires are drawn randomly and starting points are set, so combat is often limited to enemies in close proximity.  The steep learning curve and lengthly playtimes may not be for some.

A simple if long game with a very fanciful portrayal of human history.

I would have liked to see more effort to make each civilization continue actively after their turns. Unfortunately each takes a turn and then basically sits a static and easy target for later civilizations with no real resurgences.

Luck is overly a part of this game where drawing the right powers can destroy one's chances at victory or plop victory in one's lap.

I have some house rules that mitigate this luck to some extent where:
1 I subtract the army count from each player's victory count in assigning victory.
2 I allow each player once per game to not play a power and either retain or draw an alternate power that turn.

In summary this will be an enjoyable Fictional game but has No Value whatsoever in being a Historically Accurate Game.

I've played this only once. It's a decent light-medium area-control game dressed up in a "civ" theme, and despite being old felt not much like any other game I'd ever played.

Played once with 3 players each playing 2 empires. Although I came in dead last, I enjoyed the game. We finished the game in about 5,5hours, including explanation. An interesting combination (although it precedes some of these) of Vinci, Britannia/Chariot Lords and Risk, 
I'd like to play it again with more players, although I'm a bit worried about downtime then. Downtime with 3 players is less of an issue, especially since you're playing 2 empires.

Nearly too long to play in person, this game shines while playing online. It's like Risk and Vinci had a baby. With a definitive end game, more strategy than just trying to take over the world, and an extremely tactical turn phase influenced by terrain, area majorities, presence, future eras, power cards, ships, monuments and capitals, this game is a lot of fun to play.

A game with dice (I hate dice), so, luck is envolved, but, there are good things, you won't be rolling dice for long, only one throw for empire unit (max), there are decisions to take, forts, citys, capital, natural resources, difficult terrain. Very good looking. I like it a lot.

Always fun in our group.

Easy mechanics and simple to teach. Resource cards ensure no one turn is entirely predictable. Also, doling out empires during each epoch ensures no two games are quite alike.

Hate the fiddly plastic miniatures but, the game is solid. It does suffer somewhat with less than 6 players.

An interesting Risk variant but not a game I care to play again.

I would play again but wouldn't care to play this more than once a year, if that often.

This classic game is not only a perfect history lesson but an exciting and entertaining experience! Although its duration is immense (we made it after 7 hours) all players were involved all the time.

History of the World est un jeu de conquêtes, et, comme son nom l'indique, on va revivre l'histoire (militaire) du monde, de l'Antiquité au colonialisme. Ancêtre de [gameid=60], on retrouve donc dans ce jeu le système de civilisations renouvelées. Là où dans [gameid=60], le changement de civilisation est une caractéritique stratégique essentielle, ici, le changement est imposé à chaque tour : on joue tout d'abord une civilisation de l'Antiquité, puis une autre un peu plus récente, jusqu'à incarner un Empire Colonial au dernier tour.

Cependant, cela signifie qu'à chaque tour, il convient de recommencer à zéro, avec un nouvel équipement en hommes. Comme à [gameid=60], il n'y a pas de gestion, pas de stratégie à long terme. On débarque, on s'étend pendant son tour de jeu en une fois, puis on croise les doigts pour que sa civilisation reste en jeu le plus longtemps possible. Obtenir une civilisation dans la même zone géographique au tour suivant aide d'ailleurs beaucoup à ce titre.

À son tour, les choix à faire ne sont pas particulièrement difficiles, sans être franchement triviaux non plus : on contourne les montagnes, on vise à être présent dans chaque région ou à s'assurer la majorité de présence dans une autre. Lors des premiers tours, les civilisations sont équilibrées et peu puissantes, ce qui permet de se familiariser avec les mécanismes. On lance des pelletées de dés, à la [gameid=181] mais on n'est rarement totalement à la merci d'un lancer précis : si on rate son coup, on perd quelques, armées et on recommence. La défense n'est pas spécialement encouragée et au final, la loi des grands nombres fait qu'on finit par s'y retrouver. 

On commence le jeu avec une réserve de « cartes évènement ». Là aussi, elles sont plutôt déséquilibrées, mais ça fait partie du jeu. La plupart des cartes ne peuvent être jouées qu'à des époques précises, et on ne peut jouer qu'un nombre limité de cartes à chaque époque, il n'est donc pas très difficile de choisir à quelle époque on doit jouer telle ou telle carte, d'autant qu'il est évident qu'il vaut mieux jouer ses cartes le plus tard possible pour avoir un meilleur impact sur le score final.

Le jeu est donc relancé à chaque tour, les différentes civilisations étant volontairement extrêmement déséquilibrées, ce qui permet d'agréables (ou frustrants) retournements de situation. Un joueur récupérant l'Empire Romain en début de partie ou l'Angleterre au dernier tour prend une excellente option pour la victoire, alors que recevoir les Khmers ou les Mayas revient plus ou moins à passer son tour. Le problème, c'est qu'une fois qu'on a joué son tour, on ne peut pas savoir de quelle civilisation on écopera au tour suivant. Outre l'impossibilité de planifier sa stratégie, ça signifie aussi qu'on n'a strictement rien à faire jusqu'à la prochaine redistribution des rôles, si ce n'est commenter l'évolution dans le jeu d'une civilisation par rapport à la réalité historique, pour peu qu'on ait la culture adéquate. Cela passionnera sûrement un grand nombre de joueurs, prompts à étaler leur confiture. Cela lassera tout autant un autre grand nombre, dont moi, et ceux là s'ennuieront ferme pendant le tour des autres joueurs. L'absence de vues à long terme réduit aussi dramatiquement la dimension diplomatique du jeu, même s'il est souvent possible de choisir sur la civilisation de quel joueur empiéter pour se développer. Au final, on essaie surtout de gêner les joueurs qui mènent au score (les points de victoire sont visibles), d'où de désagréables effets de « bash the leader » ou de « kingmaking ».

Le mécanisme de distribution des civilisations à chaque tour est assez original, et me fait penser à certains petits jeux de cartes comme [gameid=192]. C'est pas mal trouvé, mais le système laisse cours à de gros coups de bol. Si on récupère l'Empire Romain, et une nation voisine juste au tour d'après, c'est la victoire assurée ou presque, stratégie ou pas. On peut d'ailleurs aussi retrouver ces « sensations » concentrées dans les petits jeux de cartes de vingt minutes, souvent bien plus interactifs et méchants qu'History of the World...

La durée de la partie est presque correcte pour un jeu de ce calibre. Compter 4 heures à six joueurs si une majorité connait déjà le jeu.

Au final, je suis circonspect. Le plaisir de revivre l'histoire du Monde ne prend que lors des toutes premières parties (et encore, il ne faut pas avoir abusé des jeux de civilisation auparavant), mais le jeu est stratégiquement trop limité en regard de la durée de la partie et surtout de l'attente entre les tours, ce qui fait qu'il aura vite tendance à prendre la poussière au fond de l'armoire.

Good historical simulation.

As a supposed strategy game it's way too random and the die rolling is an exercise in tedium. A pity, as there are some good ideas in there. I liked the concept of the different historical empires rising and falling.

My first impression of this game was from a first time play about 5 years ago at a 'Con. I didn't get it at all and wound up coming in last by quite a bit. Since I was in last most of the game, I was picking the first Epoch. I didn't understand (and it wasn't being explained to me) how the flow of the game was supposed to happen. At that time, I would've rated this about a 2.

Of course, winning my second game, a 5 player game yesterday, may have colored my higher rating, but there was a major difference in the gameplay. I understood better what was going on with Capitals, Cities, forts, monuments and how the different Epochs play out. The other players were explaining why I would or wouldn't want to make certain choices. They didn't tell me how to play, but explained my options. After the first couple of rounds I understood how to play, which I think is crucial in enjoying any endeavor.

I still think there is a lot of randomness in this game. Call it "luck" if you like.

1. Initial event card deal.
2. Epoch card selection.
3. Die rolls.

Although this list pretty much comprises the mechanics of the whole game, you have to admit that all of these areas are random-driven. For example, being in first place and not having a card yet, I drew the Arabs. The next epoch, being in 2nd place I drew the China civ. I gave that to the first place player, who proceeded to draw the Franks and he had to give it to me. So, I got the Arabs and Franks, giving me back to back moves. Those 2 epochs accounted for 1/3 of my total VP's.

Now, after understanding the game better, I would be willing to give this game another chance. I don't know if I'm ready to buy it yet, but it was enjoyable. With a little luck, so will  my next game...

Lots of really great ideas.  Pretty compelling for a little while, but the ebb and flow gets a little wearing after a while.  Everything works, but the downtime is brutal, you can't remain emotionally attached your position and guys, so soon into the game I stopped caring whether I won or lost.  What kind of game is that.  Mostly this game is all about going through the process of min-maxing where the points can be had then checking the odds and taking the risks that you feel you need to take.  It is cool to see it play out, but this just drags after a while.

I'm a sucker for historical civilization games where empires rampage over the land and later decline. This one is too disjointed for me. There really is no long term strategy. The strategy comes in empire selection and the tactics of controlling that empire for an age.

Look, this dinosaur has its problems (downtime and fiddliness primarily), but I think that, with the right group, it's quite a fun rainy day or late-night-with-alcohol game.  I especially enjoy the idea of the nomads rampaging in from the wilderness to rout the disciplined troops of the Romans or Macedonians, and holding your breath as you wait to see in which direction the next set of conquerors marches.  And I love pulling for that last scrappy legion of spear-wielding savages as the tanks begin rolling in the modern era.  It's often a game of wildly shifting fortunes that I find more enjoyable in the grand scale of a game like this, as opposed to a 45-minute Euro or a card game.

We play with a few house rules (see the files section) and really enjoy this one. In HotW, each Epoch gives you the chance to start over--how cool is that!

There's not much, however, for the defender in a battle to do, so we resolve battles with a single twelve-sided die.

It does stink, though, when you're rolling badly and your opponent isn't. (Maybe a house rule about the maximum number of losses it takes to sack a territory. Hmm...)

Who cares if the british are powerful at the end of the game.  everyone knows it, and if the winning player ends up with it the others weren't too bright.  Best part of this game is how close everyone is up through the end of the game.  The problem I have with alot of games is playing 4 hours into a game knowing your chances of victory are lost.  This will never be the case playing HOTW.

Game covers a good part of Earth's history.  Fairly easy to learn and play.  Very 'dicey' combat system which can be frustrating.  The player factions are somewhat balanced.

The components are of good quality.

RATING: 5.5
[3 plays]  This game is fun just for the "adventure" of it.  To see what happens, who gets what empires, which direction they go compared to what happened in real life.  How long the old empires can last before being wiped out.  It really is a great theme.  However, it definately can't be thought of as a serious wargame.  The different empires are very different in strength and it is complete luck who gets what.  The game swings widely who is in the lead and who is way in the back with virtually nothing as a player that you can do about it.  The game takes way TOO LONG for what it is.  Especially frustrating if you keep getting bad empires and fall way behind.  It can be good 5 hour+ game with six players.  A fun game to play like at most once a year, or maybe once every other year.

Excellent game. Like the title "History of the World" says, you get all of World's events in 4 hours of gaming time. The game play is very tense, a leader usually gets caught in the last turn. Mostly it's better to be the runner-up or even in 3rd place before going into the last epoch.

Quite a good game, but very long, possibly too long.  My first game was grueling, and we wound up not playing the 7th Epoch.  I think the length will come down somewhat with more experience.  Still a fair amount of downtime between turns--unless you're being attacked, there's not much to do.  You can't really plan much for your next turn without knowing which card you'll get.  In spite of all that, still an excellent game.

I actually had fun with this game and this is the very sort of epic game, that I will likely hate because of the time element. Surprisingly I didnt hate it even though it took most of the afternoon. I guess 2.5 hours? It's added clever mechanics to lessen the impact of die rolls and some others. I think these are for the best the mechanics impressed me. The strategies, not so much. I thought much more could have been done with the card draw mechanism, stuff like that annoys me. Call it the disappointment factor.

A true classic! I can consider Vinci the german abstract version of this game. HotW has something of special. You can rewrite the history by playing your empires in a different ways.

The game mechanic with its 7 (?) epochs and the drawing & distributing of Empires provided a satisfying game experience for me, as players lagging behind could catch up with a good Empire in an epoch, and players in the lead could be given a small Empire with hardly any conquest power in order to more or less hold them at their current level and allow others to catch up. 
We played it quite often back in the days, and kept a score sheet to determine the overall winner after a couple of games (best of 5 or something like this).

RATING: 8.5
History of the World has an interesting theme, with each player taking control of one empire in each of 7 epochs throughout history.  The mechanisms of the game are certainly interesting -- simple combat that still has risk/reward, terrain advantages, cute empire selection.  However, I think that the theme pushes my rating up a good half-point, since it makes the game that much more fun.
Note: I have the AH version of this game, whose rules I prefer for the most part.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun enough game, but even with a group of experienced players, there is going to be a lot of downtime. In fact, with the exception of choosing the civs each epoch, there is actually very little player interaction. Each player's turn is fairly independent of the other players and there is nothing you can do when it is not your turn to influence the current player's course of play. By playing with some of the optional rules (which prevent a runnaway leader) you keep the game close (even if you have a bad epoch). I wish the game was slightly less long... I think this might be more interesting as a 3-player game, each player playing 2 civs. Frankly, I'd rather play Vinci.

** UPDATE 7-2013: Better as a three-player two-faction game.  Still a bit long and Vinci or Small World would scratch the same itch in less time I think.

I especially like the way how this game manages that you play the historical scenarios pretty close to how they were. You can, of course, choose a different path, yet normally, if you want the most points out of your move, it is best to choose the path of history how it's been. That being said you could thinks of this game as a game with the same game pattern in every session, but still due to what civilzation you draw or is being drawn for you, every session is unique. And even though, there's lots of dice rolling included, the system of ever shifting territories and rising and falling empires manages to maintain a very balanced game throughout all seven epochs even if you have been swept from the board entirely in a decade. I don't even see the event cards as unbalanced. I liked this game when I first played it several years ago and now I regard it as a masterpiece. Worth all the effort.

Just a super game. Probably the thing I like the most about it is that no one is ever totally out of the game. But that's sure not everything I like about it.

I think I'd only play this again with the bidding variant.  The game always comes down to the last turn and the Bidding Variant gives you some control there, instead of getting screwed by getting passed a random kingdom.

RATING: 9
‘History of the World’ (‘HotW’) is an abstract historical strategy game, and one of AASGC’s favorites.  ‘Age of Mythology’, ‘Civilization’ and ‘HotW’ provide complementary discovery-learning experiences by emphasizing different historical dynamics.  AASGC treats them as a unit, commencing each fall semester with the three in succession.  HotW offers an excellent representation of the rise and fall of great powers and peoples.  Unlike civ-bldg games such as 'Age of Mythology' and 'Civilization', HotW emphasizes fateful contingency as the vast sweep of demographic emergence propels the succession of civilizations.

The rules are thorough, comprehensive and a model of clarity and organization.  They are errata-free and the game needs no modifications for historical/technical accuracy or playability.  All definitely a boon to a club coach.

The game is highly engaging, by virtue of both the superb game components (in the 2d ed.) and the dramatic and unpredictable unfolding of history (in each successive era, players learn what next-age nation they will be playing only once the strategy cards are distributed).  It is exciting primarily because nations rise and fall with eye-opening rapidity, and player fortunes rise and fall in equal measure.

The game employs very simple mechanics that capture the succession of great nations at the highest level of abstraction.  Peoples emerge, populate swaths of territory great or small, and then yield in turn to successive waves.  The game is strictly military, and at that, only in a very abstract sense (it involves the expansion and contraction of armed peoples more than armies per se).  Strategic choice involves directing the expansion of one’s card-assigned peoples in each of seven epochs.  The game challenges players to see the ‘big picture’ and select directions of advance, but it is not primarily a complex decision challenge.

No game compares with HotW for enabling students to gain an overview feel for the multi-millennial, trans-continental sweep of history.  Repeated play of the game familiarizes students with all of the great eras and peoples of history, of all cultures and across all continents.  Unlike other games, which emphasize the many things players can do to secure the fortunes of their societies, HotW emphasizes contingency and fate.  Playing this game, one gains a sense of the fragility of life – not of individuals but of whole societies.  The experience is a little unsettling.  Play of this game readies students for the study of works by ‘rise-and-fall’ historians such as Gibbon, Spengler, Toynbee, Kennedy and Ferguson.

History of the World works under the assumptions that all empires eventually fade and that the only things differentiating great empires from lesser ones is how much territory they conquer and how long it takes for their civilizations to disappear. To that end, the game is played in epochs, with every player handling a new empire during each; yes, some empires will be stronger than others, but a few clever mechanisms largely balance that out. At the end of each epoch, players score points for all their forces (from the current and previous empires) remaining on the board.

Owned both versions of the game. The new version replaced the paper counters with plastic counters. They are details and gorgeous. However, luck plays a key role rathar than planning.

When there are 6 players, you need to wait for a long time before your turn.

My one and (hopefully) only game of this involved 25 minutes of downtime between each of my turns, during which I had absolutely no decisions to make, or planning to do.
Getting attacked? Just roll your dice. No, you don't get to try and retreat or anything, just roll the dice. No decisions there at all.
Want to plan your next turn? Don't bother. The board is going to change so much in the meantime, by the time it is your turn you just have to make the best of the current situation.

It's an old game (by modern boardgame standards), we have much better now. I see no reason to ever go back to this.

A really excellent game--easily my favorite to pull out to scratch that "risk" and that "civilization" itch at the same time. The mechanic of each player picking up a new civilization each round, with the leader tending to receive a weaker civilization through an interesting civ car selection mechanism, keeps the game interesting. You're playing something new each round, but your previous civilizations keep scoring you points for as long as they hold out against the encroachment of other player's newer civilizations.

All comments based on the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/4871]Hasbro[/url] version.  My initial response was fairly negative, but I've developed a few [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/189316/variants-for-runaway-leaders-and-for-city-destruct]house rules[/url] that serve to rein in runaway leaders, and I thoroughly enjoy the game now.  This is a great sweep of history game.  It's simple and easy to teach, plays at a good pace, and flows well.  Lucky dice or cards can be mitigated through a bit of manipulation of the empire drawing system.

RATING: 7
I like the flavor of this game - the history and epic feel.  However, this game is much better if played with the GGS variant rules (see file above).  This makes the turns interlocking, meaning that there is no wait and more interaction, and it makes the event cards more exciting because they can be played as a surprise.  My 7 rating is only for this variation.

Played at BGG Con 2009. It's a fun game with significant strategic choices, but you can't really call it a sim. It scratches itches for plastic army men, and the mechanic for deciding who plays which country each epoch is clever.

More a strategy game than a wargame, but the luck and the length of the game drop it a point for me.  Make it shorter, with a different way to resolve combat and distribute regions, and I may bump it up a point.

[1993 Avalon Hill edition] Nice game, thematically very attractive and with rules that are easy to learn; but its main drawback is that it's really awfully long. It takes more time the more the players are, and unfortunately it is just better with more players (because almost all empires get played). Still I think I could play it once in a while.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very nice lightweight strategy game (a little more complicated than classical risk but with many more strategic options) which can happily drag for 4 hours or more when played with 6 people. I've played this game many times and it appeals to newbies and people who are "afraid" of boardgames (afraid that they are too complicated that is). Overall a good thought, one problem being that the game drags on in the later stages when the board is full and continuous battles are fought. Downtime can be a serious bummer in this game and there is not much that can be done for it (I've seen many players loose interest when the Romans start playing). Also in some games by the middle of the game the last two players may have seriously fallen behind and thus not have any chance at all to win the game.

RATING: 7
Having played this game many times now, I've revised my rating. It's a fun game, with a fair bit of strategy (especially when it comes to distributing the empires) and quite a bit of luck. It plays best with six people, but can get dull if any of these six players are slow. The game is most fun if people do not take it too seriously and spend lots of time min/maxing every move.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Loads of fun.  Can be pretty random, but it makes the oft-annoying leader bashing in games like this into something fun; hanging in second is still best, but there are risks (esp. with the PE markers, which I like, as you need incentives to pull away).  The card-passing is the best part of the game: I wish there were 14 epochs, and the board play took 1/3 the time.

The game does a lot of things well, and though I like it as written, it sparks a wishlist of possible improvements/options: better cards (both for balance and interesting effects); a shorter combat system; more epochs and empires; more variance in scoring as epochs cycle (the 3-6-9s are too static, and an occasional 5-10-15 would be fun); Britannia-like incentives to follow a (mild) historical course; easier/faster means of tracking game state and scoring; a much less surreal map; some empire-specific powers; options for cultural achievement (beyond monuments).  The designers of this, Vinci, and Britannia should get together and produce HotW Redux; that would rock.

Definitely on the light side of gaming - I like the flavor and the feel of HotW.  Wild swings in power levels of the empires can sometimes lead to a disappointing finish but usually an enjoyable experience - even if it's a bit long for the level of play.

simple game of civilisation building taking the whole world as its scope, fun but bad luck can lead to getting handed a duff civilisation, ifn this happens in a couple of epochs (of which there are 7, hmm 7 ages too) you will be out of the race deffinatly, I have the original ragnar brothers tea towel edition, though the one with the plastic bits looks pretty spiffy but I'll not upgrade, good fun ifn ratehr long especially with 6 players

overly long.the only time i played, it lasted for 8 (eight) hours ! we were 6 players and we made our moves pretty fast, without thinking too much.there is no evolution in what you do: basically you repeat the same damn thing for eight hours: throw dices 5-20 times, then do nothing and wait for others, choose a civilization; repeat all this 7 times. There are a few nice mechanics, the theme is nicely put inside the game, the times and strenghts of different civilizations are accurate, the game seems pretty well balanced but there is too much use of dice and, again, no feeling of evolution and growth. Every turn you start over with a new civilization. The mechanism of choise for civilization leads inevitably to a very strong King Making. I am sorry, this is not the game for me.

One of my very favorites!  If you've got an afternoon or an evening, and several people that are up for playing one game for a few hours, this can't be beat!  Love the semi-random empire selection each turn, and with the plagues and other crazy events, this game has great replayability.  Only complaints are the time it takes to play, and the bonus coins at the end of each Epoch can kind of make for a run away leader situation.

History of the World works under the assumptions that all empires eventually fade and that the only things differentiating great empires from lesser ones is how much territory they conquer and how long it takes for their civilizations to disappear. To that end, the game is played in epochs, with every player handling a new empire during each; yes, some empires will be stronger than others, but a few clever mechanisms largely balance that out. At the end of each epoch, players score points for all their forces (from the current and previous empires) remaining on the board.

I've played both the original AH and the revised AH with the nice bits. I like the later verstion a bit better: the bits are nicer (but sometimes hard to tell apart) and I like the rules tweaks they made, especially eliminating persistent sea control and piece stacking. Has a great _feel_ as you unwind all of human history. Wouls be higher except it is long and (what is worse) has terrible downtime problems. Play another game on the side while you wait for your turn.

Favourite 3-player+ war game.  Optimal fun/education ratio.

Ignore the lies about overlong and turn waiting: it can't stall and drag for any player 'till 3AM like Risk, and time flies anyway because you've *barely* got enough down time to:

1) Pick out your next markers
2) Plan your next moves

    and 

3) Make your witty observations about history.

Duration is usually caused by players reversing those three priorities.  Which is still fun anyway.  Play it with a pocket encyclopedia of history on the table.

One of my favorite games. Excellent replay value, interesting phased epoch turn system, and a great way to give a leg up to people in last place to help mitigate the runaway leader problem. High production quality and easy to learn rules only add to the value. Does drag out a bit when folks get incredibly large Civs, and there can be a bit of downtime if you go first in one era and last in the next. UPDATED 2/12 - Nostalgia painted this game in pretty, pretty colors. Actual play after so long was disappointing. Appreciated the simplicity of the rules, but the wide fluctuation in ability of the event cards and different Civs overshadowed everything. I has lucky enough to draw Rome, and by Epoch four, I had lapped the other players on the scoring track.

This is Risk done right.  Although it is still combat heavy that relies on a lot of dice rolling, but the empire building aspect for area control mitigate that mindnumbing mechanic.  It is particularly interesting to see remenants of your civilization from an earlier epoch to remain on the board and to continue to earn you VP as the game progresses.  I like the uniqueness in the way the empires are distributed each round, but it is also a frequent source of frustration, since being a high scorer often means that you don't have a choice as to when you get to go next turn nor who to play as.  The event cards introduce even more randomness into the gameplay; and the bash the leader characteristic can often be excessive.  I like History of the World, but probably not so much that I'd get in a game very often.

Great game with a focus on long term points gain vs knocking off your neighbor.  Replay-ability is high as well due to the way cultures are chosen for each epoch.  This also brings a level of balance to the game ensuring that there generally aren't any run away winners.  Risk and Carcasonne wrapped up in one and done really well, removing most of the outright chance of Risk and incorporating area control from Carcasonne.  Strategy is the big focus here, and while there will be battles they are a relatively small part of the game and generally only come about because of necessity.

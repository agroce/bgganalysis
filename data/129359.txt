Meh.  I enjoyed all the jokes about Goblins and factions, but otherwise it didn't stand out too much from other Munchkins.  Part of that may be the group I played with which was a little off.

It might seem a little redundant with the theme so close to the original Munchkin, but they definitely bring the flavor through with some of the cards and creatures you'd find unique to Pathfinder's spin on D&D. Deluxe version comes with the nice little scoring board and player stand ups, though I do wish those stand ups had different art (they have different colors, but only two characters on them, one male and one female).

It's a good Munchkin game, but I hoped some Pathfinder mechanics, and it has not. It's more similar to Munchkin base game than any other Munchkin Card Game that I've played.

Okay to break out once in a while.  But, it's Munchkin.  The whole experience is just so clunky.

It's munchkin. It's fairly quick to play, but the strategy is kind of meh. You never want to be the first to the last room, as everyone will dog pile you to keep you from winning, and then everyone's usually out of cards for the next person to make it to the end. Just kind of 'meh'. Not really bad, but it's not particularly fantastic either.

Contrary to most other Munchkins, there's a lot of focus on your class and faction.

Additionally, there are a lot of Goblins and Undead in the deck (which can be played in "horde mode" once one Goblin/Undead is out).

Both of these have always been the most thematic aspects of Munchkin for me, so this version gets rated one more than the other versions.

This expansion is not worth it - and it has very little to do with Pathfinder.

Munchkin Pathfinder is fun. Since it's Munchkin, I'll always play. The Pathfinder brand didn't to much to wow me. I wish it had classes other than Alchemist and Summoner. There isn't much that allows Big things like a Fighter class perhaps would have. 

I give it an Eight because it's Munchkin, not because it's Pathfinder.

RATING: 7
I've played a few versions of Munchkin and enjoyed them, but it's probably one of the most frustrating games I've ever played.  The take that and hand management aspects are what dominates these games, but I'm still willing to play. 
Only issue is that it can last longer than it should sometimes.

RATING: 1
Hoard cards until someone is about to win. Dump your hand of bad stuff on that person. Repeat until everyone is out of stuff and someone wins.

Game goes on WAY too long for what it is and the initial fun wears off pretty quickly as the game can reach stalemates where no one wants to actually do anything as they know they are going to get bombarded.

Think of it like a game of mario kart where everyone has a blue shell so no one really wants to be in first place.

It's about 15 minutes of fun packed into 3 hours.

GOBLINS!!!!  All the fun of the Pathfinder RPG without the role-playing.  Of course, role-playing is the primary point of RPGs.  On the other hand, I do think this game is a fun diversion to quickly kill monsters, gather loot, and build a character, all with fun pokes at RPG and Pathfinder culture.

I'm a huge Pathfinder fan and it's addition to Munchkin is great. It fits very well thematically with the base game and adds much needed variety. I still prefer to play to higher levels (15 to 20 instead of 10) to experience more card interactions and high-level backstabbing, as none of those interesting mechanics seem to come into play until the very end of the 10 level game.

When I tried Munchkin some 10 years ago, I thought it was absolute rubbish. It was random and painfully long. Anyway, fast forward to 2013 and I happened across Pathfinder Munchkin. I wanted it immediately (Pathfinder is too cool a cross-over theme) and received it from my 2013 BGG Secret Santa. The game saw the table immediately and it is AMAZING! There are some rules changes (I believe) from when I last played, which have seemed to balance out the game somewhat. The art is gorgeous and the cards are all very funny. The game has so far always a close race between all 6 of us. This is a great rendition and a must own for those who are fans of Munchkin.

People like to talk bad about Munchkin on BGG, I personally see a lot of upsides to it in party play.

I play a lot of Pathfinder so I thought the jokes would be okay. I was wrong.

As Munchkin games go, this one is the worst.

Unfortunately, the girls in our family don't want to play this game, and my family's aversion to "take-that" games has kept this in the closet. My son has convinced me a few times to play with him, but it's not really designed for 2 players. So it really hasn't been fun. However... I could see how it might be fun with a group of 4-5 players, preferably teenage and above, who can play take-that games without getting their feelings hurt. 

I personally like just going through the deck and reading all the cards.

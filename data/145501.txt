I like to hold the box and open it. I enjoy taking out the animals and arranging them. I enjoy putting the animals back to where they belong. Play the game? Not so much!

Fun Farm is one of the best dexterity games I’ve ever played: you really need a lot of coordination here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Quick dexterity game, like Dobble or Jungle Speed. A little more friendly for children, still fun for whole family. Unfortunately, unplayable for me because of colors on dice (green/red, white/pink).

RATING: 6.5
Fast paced fun. This game is short and can be played with up to 10 players which makes it a great game for non-gamers. It's tricky visually, a lot like jungle speed, but I like it better. The little Styrofoam animals are super adorable too!

Kinda like Jungle Speed, except five times easier to explain, guaranteed to terminate in finite time, changing player count doesn't change game length or the complexity of matching things, and you get to mock your friends for failing to grapple barnyard animals.

If the high-mental-effort of sorting real matches from near-match fake-outs is your source of joy in Jungle Speed, you'll find Fun Farm lacking. Otherwise, I'd say it's better.

RATING: 7
A fun game with the kids. It's a speed game where players have to quickly react to the color combinations rolled on the dice and match them to the animal cards. The animals themselves provide a fun toy factor.

Cute speed game.  Love the use of themed stress balls.  Great game to play after getting through a long play after any long game with AP prone players.  Played as part Iello league at Origins 2017.

Fun little quick time grabbing game, where dice are rolled and you much grab the associated animal [b]IF[/b] the dice match exactly, and only [b]IF[/b] they match exactly.

Children are a lot better at this than I am.
The animals themselves are very cute and younger children generally just want to play with them.

Ridiculous fun. Plays great with younger audience and also... drunk people. Drunk people seem to have a blast with this because it's so silly. It makes it even better if there's competitive players on the table and watching them fight over a cow plushie? Hilarious.

Fillerino basato sulla velocità di reazione, in cui bisogna acchiappare dei pupazzetti di gommapiuma. Molto semplice. Un po' troppo.

Es el tipo de juego que casi nadie mira. Pero la verdad es muy divertido, Genial para la familia y/o cualquier tipo de jugador…La verdad nunca sabes lo difícil que es estar concentrado. Muy buena dinámica de reconocimiento de patrones.

Hoy jugamos con mi hijo de (4) le gusto mucho. La dinámica de reconocimiento de patrones, si bien en un principio se le dificulto entenderla, luego de unas cuantas rondas fue asombroso como fue mejorando su desempeño, lo disfrutamos muchísimo. 02/11/2014

Fun Farm is fun enough if you're into speed games.  The components are nice (little squishy farm animal balls) and there's definitely a challenge here when it comes to spotting the dice and racing the others to finish.  Cut your fingernails so you don't stab each other!

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Okay, it may not be bad for what it is, but I have no interest in playing again! This is very much a kid's game with fun plastic stuffed animals which one grabs based upon dice rolled. Speed pattern recognition - so if you don't enjoy these, stay far away. If you do enjoy these, there are enough better ones that this can be ignored.

Need a game that kids and adults can play together? Want to chide all those you play games with to cut those fingernails because lets be honest you only really need one coke nail? Well this is probably the game for you. Fun Farm is just silly fun that you get together and try to grab cute foam farm animals in inappropriate ways to win cards. Makes sense, doesn't it? Overall there really isn't much a of a game to be found in this one, but is that really all that important? No, of course it isn't. What is important is that you can have howling fun snatching up the pig and sheep from your friends and then taught them with the animals shortly thereafter.

Silly family fun.  Great components.  Six-year-old dominates and gets upset when I grab animals for the three-year-old.  Three-year-old still can't grasp the concept - but doesn't seem to much care beyond upsetting her sister.

Another clone of jungle speed, this time mainly for the youngest players. Roll a dice and catch an appropriate animal before the other player will do that.

Nice game to teach eye-hand coordination.

Good dexterity game that can be played with kids and adults. Similar to Ghost Blitz where you have to grab the correct item depending on the coloured dice rolls. Plays quick and easy to teach.

This is one of those speed games where you try to figure out a little puzzle and determine which piece(s) are legal, then grab it (them) before anyone else. Here, there are 2d6: black and white. Each die has a patch of color on every face. The cards show an animal and 2 specific die faces. On your turn, add a card to the center and roll both dice. If any of the cards show either of the die faces rolled, they are legal targets: grab the matching foamie! If you're right, you get the card(s). When the deck runs out, whoever has the most cards wins!

It's a fun little dexterity game and the animal foamies are really cute!

The components are super, but for a quick reaction game, I don't know why, I find it lacking. I much more prefer Ghost Blitz or Anomia.

I won: it's a great game!
Ok, no joking, this is not a gamer's game of course, it's a party game for young young players. It's probably not even very original: identify what to grab and grab it before the others. Nothing new. But it's fun anyways and creates some physical interactions among players. I think it could be perfect in some situations where you have to favour the creation of some reltionships among ppl.
0.7 points for the wonderful components, useful as an antistress.

Perfect gift when children are involved.

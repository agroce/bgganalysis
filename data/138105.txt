Decent deckbuilder. Even with all the expansions though the game can feel the same after a while.

Man this game had potential.  When I first played a demo, thought it was the deck builder I always wanted because it has combat! 

Turns out, the full game is slow and clunky.  2 resource types is difficult to manage.  Lots of down time.  Factions are very similar, especially across Hordes/Warmachine.  And the text is SO SMALL.

Just not a great game.

Average... deck builder? I guess you'd call it.  Fans of the miniatures game will find more fun in this than other players.

RATING: 6.5
Such high hopes for this game, but there are just a few too many issues.  There are a lot of cases where there really is no reason to every get into a conflict with other players, and indeed, plenty of decks can win without interacting with another player at all.  There are variants that seem to make the game more enjoyable... but why weren't they made official to save this game?

A polarizing game, but I ended up really enjoying this as a mash-up of deck building and deck customization, in which the theme really shines if you'll just let it. You are competing over various locations to score them by placing troops, many of which will have individual powers and variables. Choosing different Warlocks each game and different colored detachments allows for a slightly altered experience each time, and with so many expansions out you've got a lot of variation awaiting. Think of it as Dominion meets Smash Up with the Hordes theme...love the universe and really liked playing this!

There's something about this game that keeps drawing me back. The theme is slightly off the beaten path -- a techno-fantasy world war with unique and interesting factions -- and the gameplay is a fresh take on a prolific genre. This is not just another deckbuilder; you won't find yourself looking at your hand and just buying the best card you can afford. There's multiple viable options, and some painstaking decisions to be made as you struggle for control of locations and victory points. It also stands out for being a head-to-head card game that plays well solo. [b]Hordes High Command[/b] is a good choice if you're a little put off by steam-powered mechs in your fantasy and want a more traditional experience -- it has everything that's great about this game system with an organic focus -- but get the other games if you find yourself enjoying it.

Amazing deck builder - the best I've played, and I've played a lot.  Every card play is an agonizing decision. Can't wait to see what fixed the expansion packs bring to the table.

Picked up this deck-building game because it was on a super deep clearance. This is not a very great deck-builder but if you are interested in the WarMachine/Hordes theme and world then I guess it's ok.

Everything I just said about Warmachine: High Command just copy and paste and put Hordes instead. Also the lovely thing about Hordes High Command can be put together with Warmachine: High Command to play against. Great for fans of both games.

A decent deck-building game with an excellent theme and awesome art.  The game can feel a bit uneven and clunky at times.  Overall, the experience is an entertaining one.  Combines quite well with the Warmachine: High Command game.

5 games in and I really like it.  Incredibly easy to learn with some depth in setup and play.  I feel like the game plays a little too fast but I think that is almost me looking for something to complain about.

A decent deck builder, I really like it in 1 vs. 1 or even in solo. If you have an interest in the Iron Kingdoms' theme, it's even better. I hope I could try in multiplayer this year.

Deck building with individual card pools, and your fight for vp bearing locations some what like Blood Bowl Team Manager or Smash Up.

I have truly enjoyed this game.. Having a large Circle of Orboros army got me excited for this game.. The one thing I have a problem, some of the game play in the manual is not 100% clear, but thanks to youtube it turns out ot be a very easy game to play..

Ok, this game has great amounts of fun and tactics! Every decision in this game is crucial! The art is astounding, and really captured the beauty and epicness of the Iron Kingdoms. The fonts are a bit small, but nothing that you can't handle. The setup is quick and it's really easy to teach this game (my brother is weak with english but he was close to victory!). I can't wait to see how this game plays with 3-4 players.

Played the game at Gen Con.  Essentially a trick taking game that is light on deck building.  VP collection strategies favor rushing multiple units to an empty location to deter opponents from going after the same location, banking high VP unit cards by successfully taking locations, and banking high VP location/reserve cards when your discard pile is reshuffled periodically in order to minimize the risk of not counting those points if they're in your hand when the game suddenly ends.  Another disappointment was the warcasters/warlocks, which are basically one-timers and don't influence the game (other than the reserves you can choose at the beginning) like they do in Warmachine and Hordes.

I found the multi-use resources on the cards to be cumbersome, and the battles to not be interesting.  Also, the microscopic special power text on the cards is stupidly small.  This one is going to trade, sale or the garbage bin soon.

Worst. Deckbuilder. Ever. Buy cards, then pay again to use them in battle? No thank you.

Sort of feels like Core Worlds meets Smash Up. I like it. I imagine it would be a whole lot better with more factions, however, so I think I may track down the other core sets. The game play could be a little more refined, but this really combines deck-building and area control in a way I like. The game runs a tad long, and I do think it's a lot more difficult to capture locations than it ought to be, but otherwise there are some really cool ideas here. Purchasing a card vs. deploying a card is interesting, and I like how you have your own little card row to buy from. Other than the graphic design of the cards, I really have no major complaints about this game.

Mildly fun game, but lacks variety. Card synergies were fairly minimal and competing for locations not to be the best way to score VP, which means opponents might choose to play a buy game in their own corner with the occasional blocking on location.

This game is probably one of the most entertaining deck building games I have played. The wife picked it up at GenCon this past year while I was working and promptly proceeded to play it for 12 hours strait. By the time I was actually able to get a game in she was a master. We probably play the game 2 or 3 times a week. 

It's very easy for new players to approach or even people who have no idea what Warmachine or Hordes is. The game mechanics are wonderful.

This is not your average deck builder.  Yes, it is a very good deck builder (It has a built in mechanism to clear out junk from your deck, it allows you to save cards to the next hand, and you build from your own deck which is different from your opponent).  But the magic in this game is how the rules make sense with the theme and the depth of play.  One of the hardest things that I see for players is judging between the locations value and the value of just building an army with points.  You can over commit to a conflict or under commit.  Players of Warmachine/Hordes will have an advantage in that if the understand the universe they will get a clue to the value of an item.  Be careful how you spend your resources.  I am looking forward to the expansions.

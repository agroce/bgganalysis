Enjoyable light racing type game.

RATING: 7.5
A beautiful production from GMT. No corners cut here. Thick board and counters, full size cards and large custom dice.
For what the game is, it is top-notch. Cute, funny and down-right dog eat dog gamestyle. I read a reveiwers recommendation to play dirty and I agree. It's survival of the craftiest player. Better off explained that way to new players. 
The game is easily explained and moves fast enought to be played and enjoyed in about an hour. 5-6 players will take longer. 
Also it is a wargame at its design core covered in play and theme as a light Euro type game. Great job GMT, we're glad to have this one in our collection! Bring it on - "I'm King Of The Hill" oh wait "Pull My Paw"! 
Overall rating of 8.5 for fast fun steeped in a competitive setting. A favorite household game for us and I'll play it anytime.

Fun cutthroatish euroish game - but don't let the theme fool you, it could be seen as a great introduction to wargames. (if you want to introduce a new/young gamer to concepts like ZOC, Terrain Cost, Stacking Limits, etc.)

It's not a great game but it is a fun and quick one and there will be laughs and sound effects for sure.  Families will enjoy it as will wargamers fancying something lighter for a change.  I dare say some serious gamers will turn up their nose at it, but equally some may enjoy it.   There's enough going on to keep you interested, even though it is at heart an sophisticated roll and move.  The card and box are lovely and the rules well written (though as often the game is a lot easy to teach than it is to learn from the rules).  My copy will certainly get plays especially as a short opener.

RATING: 6.5
A quick and not so friendly racing wargame....eurogame.

With stacking limits and movement points, it feels like a hybrid of a wargame themed with the strangest lemmings.

The Eagles movement though subjected to the eagle player, does provide some decision on when to move your lemmings and when to get your lemmings into hiding.

The strategy cards are just some rules bending, to add flavour.

The whole game might be better received if the theme was changed to Zombies.

There are some really clever things going on in Leaping Lemmings trying to emulate wargame movement in a lemmings race off the cliff. I actually found its bits pretty charming as well. But the decisions just aren't very interesting. 

Decisions turn-to-turn are very repetitious and the strategy is extremely minimal.

Completely so-so. Nice bits and all, but I felt like it was too easy to get completely hosed during the game from bad dice rolls. Plus, it seems like you are better off just racing one lemming from start to finish rather than move multiples one at a time. I think I'd rather play Igel Argern.

Production quality is high and art looks good. The game itself is light and fast paced (or at least it should be). There's some decisions to be made but plans change because other players may and will screw your plans whenever they can.

Maximum amount of players with couple AP prone individuals did not increase the fun factor of this game. Game is more fun if you think less.

Only played once. Race your lemmings to the edge of the cliff and then perform acrobatic leaps to their deaths. But beware the eagles, who will eat them before their moment of glory. Each player take it in turn to control the eagles and the stack mechanism means you can be particularly nasty to the other players on your turn.

Appears to be a cute, light game. Hoping to play it with the wife and semi-gaming friends this weekend. Might be a welcomed add to the mix. Rules took all of 5 minutes to digest. Hopefully it only takes the same amount of time to explain them. 

Edit: Having now played it, I like the game for what it is - a semi-short, light strategy game. My wife liked it more than the other two people we played it with. At the end of the night they said it was okay, but they'd rather play Citadels or Cosmic Encounter. Fine by me, I like those games too. Need to try it with another crowd.

[b]Leaping Lemmings[/b] is surprisingly published by [i]GMT Games[/i], a publisher that specializes in war games.  But LL is definitely not a war game.  In LL, players move their lemmings across a field, while picking up food pellets and avoiding birds of prey, to a cliff where the lemmings jump to their doom and score points.  The player with the most points at game's end, wins.

I like LL.  It is thematic and it's fun to yell "Om Nom Nom Nom!!" when getting the birds to eat your opponent's lemmings.  However, my game group and family merely think the game is okay.

GMT has really been growing on me lately - mostly because I've come to see the light in the wargaming dept.  Besides publishing great war games, though, GMT just makes great games.  Nice components, great boxes, clear and concise rules.  I wish they published more Euros (and am happy to see they are moving in that direction).

Leaping Lemmings is such a move.  There is a lot to like in this one, and it has all the characteristic GMT facets.  For example, the movement deck is pure GMT - a random process, with a limited number of variables that you can calculate with.  There is also plenty of player interaction, while essentially being a race game.  While I'm sure this one is great with 4 or 5, with 2 it is still quite good, just less chaotic, with more space to jockey your lemmings without bumping into other players.  Really, this is the best race game I've played, because there are more choices than your average race game.  And the board is really great - I wish more companies would follow GMT's lead and print much play info on the board itself.  If you like Euros, or race games, or games with lots of players flinging themselves about in a mad dash, I would recommend this.

Good chaotic fun for a once in a while type game probably best suited as a gateway to war gaming. The pellets can really swing the points, though, so the strategy is not high. This is appropriate for the theme.

This was one-half of my present from Secret Santa, and all I can say is that it was an excellent choice. It's precisely the sort of game that I'd never buy for myself, but that I really enjoy and that helps break up the monotony of super-heavy games. I think it occupies a similar space in the collection as Snow Tails, but, at least initially, appears to offer much more interesting, challenging decisions. I'm really impressed with the design after just a single play, and I expect the fun level to ramp up with more familiarity.

Update:
I was willing to chalk the first game up as a learning game, and the second as a result of the low player count. But when it fails to produce as a 4-player filler during a lengthy game day, I have to face facts. Snow Tails does the same things better. Climbers fills the same need better. As cute and clever as it in in theory, Leaping Lemmings is a 5 on the table.

A very different war game from GMT.  A like the slightly goofy element of lemmings avoiding eagles so they can jump of the cliff (silly lemmings).  And I have a soft spot in my heart for GMT after their "free games" program for those that had lost their jobs.  Very cool of them.  And they make some great games too.

I'm not a Euro-Gamer, but I talked to a group of people playtesting this game at ORIGINS a number of years ago.  They were enjoying it.  I thought the game concept -- leaping from a cliff with style and elan -- sounded fun, so I ordered the game when it popped up as a P500 choice.

The game sat, unplayed, for a long time because my usual gaming group doesn't play Euros.  Last weekend, I played two games ... and was pretty disappointed.

I was looking for a really fun game, a nailbiter.  I didn't find it here.  There are some interesting mechanics and you can mess with other gamers, but it's not a very deep puzzle to solve.

Players move one lemming at a time, so one choice is:  move the same lemming every turn or try to get a whole bunch of them on the board at once.  We came down on the one-at-a-time side.

Do you wait for a good movement card before leaping?  Or do you go with what you have as soon as you can?  We decided going over the cliff as fast as possible is best.  (Waiting just makes your lemming more likely to be eaten, which gains the owning player nothing.)

That's pretty much it.  Playing this game with younger gamers might make it better, but it's not much of a game for a bunch of old grognards.

The younger kids really love this game.  The adults get a bit bored by it.  Fun to try and run your Lemming through the Eagle zones.  The GAME END CARD usually ends the game before anything exciting happens.  Would recommend you put the card near the bottom of the deck, or remove it and play once through the deck.

Surprisingly entertaining euro with a nice balance of screwage and wackiness. The rest of the table wasn't as enthusiastic as I was, but I can see playing this with non-gamers. One note - the rules are needlessly long and detailed, and could have been explained in about four (full) pages. Also hilarious - new legislation requires so much extra verification that the game is published as for 13+ when it could clearly be played by an 8 year old or even a particularly precocious 6 year old.

Players are racing their own squad of lemmings across a hex game board, avoiding the two eagles, and diving artistically to their doom (for victory points).  Players take turns being the eagle player, relocating them via the roll of the dice and potentially eating an opponent's lemming.  Then a movement card is flipped up to dictate how many hexes each player may move one lemming this turn.  Repeat for a couple of hours.  Not sure what to make of this one - nicely produced, the rules aren't too complicated, but it desperately needs some development to prune the playing time.  Seems to borrow some ideas from Igel Aergern (a 15 year old game that has stood up well), but I'm not sure it's better.  The fun to playing time ratio seems way out here.

This game has a nice risk management aspect to it, while being light enough that its approachable by almost anyone. It is by no means a heavy thinking game, but at the same time it is not devoid of thinking. It takes about 5-10 minutes to teach the game, and laughter always ensues since some of the lemmings meet an untimely demise as eagle snacks.

I find it best to keep the number of players to 4 or less, otherwise I find the downtime between players too long.

Leaping Lemmings has some nice decisions as far as where to move and what goals to go after and there's some fun screwage. Each turn the active player rolls the two eagle dice and moves the two eagles, then everyone gets to move one (and only one) of their 10 lemmings. Moving the eagles is interesting because you want to use them to eat other players' lemmings, of course, but even if you can't eat anyone, you can scatter lemmings who are safely hidden in the brush or block other players' movement. The eagles have zones of control which you can't move in or through.

Lemming movement is interesting because you need to take into account the turn order. Each subsequent lemming in a space gets stacked on top of the previous one there and only the top lemming in a stack can a) move (which is good!) and b) get eaten by an eagle (which is bad!). You're trying to move them over the cliff (board edge) with as many movement points left to get VPs. At the same time, there are these lemming pellets that you can collect for extra movement and VPs. There are choices to be made as far as to keep on moving versus stopping for a pellet grab.

The action cards you use on your own lemmings or everyone else's are quite fun, but each action card you don't use is worth a VP at game end. Since VPs are hard hard to come by, you really need to think twice about dinking other people with a card or getting a special action.

UPDATE: I ended up moving mine on as the unique nature of LL made it hard to find a group who would all agree to play it. Too long for a filler, not meaty enough for a main course, too mean for some. I'd happily play this one again though.

[1 play] A rather light-hearted sort of family game.  While there's a lot of fun ideas, it just wasn't really thought provoking in the right way for me.  There's a lot of ways to approach the game, but it's mostly tactical.  You just try to minimize your risk and hope a particular roll on the die doesn't come up.  I'd recommend it to people who enjoy a largely tactical experience, don't mind a dicefest, and can really keep a game moving (it tends to drag a bit).

A silly filler game that has a little more to it than the theme might suggest. There is a bit of a struggle for position when moving your lemmings from cover to cover, a bit of push-your-luck when approaching the cliff or picking up bonuses, and a fair bit of screwage, particularly in the special action cards. Good moves are fairly obvious most of the time, however, and difficult decisions usually have to do with whether you want to try your luck this turn or the next.

Der Spieler als Sensenmann: In LEAPING LEMMINGS versucht man einen größeren Trupp Lemminge siegpunktbringend an den Abgrund zu führen. Die von Todessehnsucht Getriebenen laufen durch einen Hindernissparcours bestehend aus Hexfeldern mit zwei Adlern, die über den Tierchen kreisen. Dabei werden die Bewegung der Lemminge sowie die der Adler jeweils vom Startspieler erwürfelt - zum eigenen Vorteil und Nachteil der Mitspieler. Wessen Lemming im Fangkreis des Greifvogels geschnappt wird, fliegt R.I.P. aus dem Spiel. LEAPING LEMMINGS ist ein taktischer Hindernislauf auf einer Geraden, an dessen Ende man als sterbender Lemming weit über die Klippe springen muss, um Punkte zu kriegen und landet in der Summe der Spielmechanismen auf einer besseren BGG 6.

A good light and fun game. I enjoyed it, but thought the card powers varied too much in effectiveness. Otherwise very well balanced. Would highly recommend for younger gamers, or as a game that a parent may want to share with his kids. Good introduction to hex movement, positioning, and the importance of turn order.

Not sure about this game.  It reminded me a lot of 'Wind River'.  But, in this case it flowed a bit easier and was fun.

I enjoyed the 'action cards', but there did seem to be a wide variability of how useful the cards were, so one person my have significantly better cards then someone else.

It did seem a bit long for a 'racing' game.

This game is daft, fast and fun - as long as it's played in the right spirit. I've played with people who have over thought it, were disappointed and have consequently sucked the fun out of it. It should play fast and loose, with a bit of banter, in under an hour. The lemmings all have stupid clans (Vikings, hippies, bikers etc) and individual names - it really doesn't pretend to be anything other than daft - so lighten up people!

It's cute, but a bit too light. Badly needs a vastly improved and increased deck of cards to make it a more interesting and chaotic gaming experience, as well as a regular supply of them - e.g. you automatically draw up to 3 at the end of your turn.

Neat little theme.  Simple rules to learn, which is always a plus.

My problem with this game is that is feels like it's aimed at more junior gamers . . . which is OK, except it's main mechanic is a 'you get to pick on some other player on your turn' effect (i.e., moving eagles to kill other player's lemmings).  And junior gamers often do not react well to being picked on.  In fact, many non-junior gamers don't do well with this.

So . . . the game design is simple, but solid, and the theme is cute, but this one probably does not fill any void in the collection.

I've played this with 2, 4, and 5 players.  With 4 and 5 players, I'd give this game a solid '6'.  It's fun, but not something I'm going to pull off the shelf and recommend to play (unless it's with the kids).

The 2 player game, however, is excellent.  Each player always being able to control an eagle makes the darts and dashes across the board grabbing pellets (and hopefully points) that much more tense and exciting.  It's a fun one for when you want something quick and challenging.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (November 2013)

Weird game coming from GMT, I was expecting something a lot heavier but I was disappointed. First of all I don’t enjoy the theme (killing off your own lemmings), even if is intended to be humorous, also I dislike racing games, and I did felt this was (mostly) a racing game. For me it is very simple, each turn you have clear cut decisions and it is mostly luck if you have powerful event cards or not, so for me, the winner is decided by luck (dice and cards).  I also dislike more and more the “attack the leader” mechanic inherent in this game. It takes way too long for what it offers, it is very boring and the downtime can be excessive. 

The game components are top notch, it comes with very sturdy cards and player aids, the lemming art is adorable.

In conclusion, this is a very simple game that I don’t have the desire to play ever again. 

Current Rating: 4.0

Two plays only

Touchdown your lemmings without them being eaten by the cicrcling eagles. Warning: a lot more are likely to end up in the eagles' bellies than jump over the cliff edge for points.

Best approached as a quick-playing blast with a lot of table talk rather than any with a lot of strategy (jump from bush-to-bush where possible and grab pellets where possible).

A solid family game... if you don't mind the goal of committing suicide stylishly and more or less random screwage by the action cards. There is some opportunity to take your fate in your own hands but in the end you need at least as much luck as skill. By coincidence, I played this together with Magical Athlete, another race game. Both offer the same level of fun and take about the same time to be played. Lemmings is the choice if you are looking for a fun game with some decision making, Magical Athlete is the option for hilarious mindless fun.

RATING: 6.5
Leaping Lemmings fits into an intriguing niche--it's a legitimate if simple wargame (hexes, zones of control, stacking limits) that's also a legitimate if somewhat elaborately detailed light and lighthearted Euro-style race game. The components are very nice and reflect GMT's trend of having mounted boards and thick counters--not that GMT had much choice in the matter if they wanted to reach the sorts of people who would turn up their noses at a paper map. The decision to write the rules more or less as wargame rules (particularly noticeable at times when phases or actions are introduced and discussed well before being defined) was perhaps a concession to the designers' and publisher's proclivities, but it may not have been a particularly good one if true crossover appeal is expected. While not difficult to understand, the rules have a certain unwelcome heft for what's basically an easy game to explain orally. Gameplay flows quite quickly, even with six, and there's still a pretty good feeling of control even with so many. Screwage is carried out by covering up competitors' lemmings with one's own, (normally) preventing them from moving, and (within the limits of dice rolls) by deciding the direction and target of the hunting eagles that prey upon lemmings not under cover. The rated play time of 10-15 minutes per player seems about right, though, as with most racing games, a certain amount of counting-out can slow things down. A nitpick is that the art for the bushes in which the lemmings can hide doesn't extend to the edges of the hex, meaning that the lemmings can fairly easily cover up the image. A more serious concern is that the "pellets" scattered throughout the board (which mostly contain VPs) may--and I stress may, having only played the game once--be too lucrative when the ostensible goal of the game is to get the lemmings to dive for points off of the cliff edge at the far end of the board. 

Provisionally, I would call Leaping Lemmings a modest success. In some respects, it may turn out to be 2010's version of Manoeuvre, a game that few preordered and many realized belatedly that they wished they'd bought the game while it was still in stock. I don't think LL is quite *that* good, but it could definitely slip under a lot of people's radars.

After three plays, I'd rate the game a 7 with four and 6 with five, the extra time added being the difference maker.

Don't take this game too seriously and it can be quite fun!

LIKE:

* The stacking factor of the lemmings is a nice touch.  Those underneath cannot move until the top one does...or until the eagle eats the top one and scatters the others.
* I like the poop chits are whatever they are.  They are either worth points or can be traded in for other bonuses.  
* Special action cards bring a bit of chaos and more vindictiveness to the game.  Actually, I both love and hate this feature.
* The two eagles moving around based on the die roll makes you play the percentages.  At the end of the cliff, you face the choice sometimes of being greedy or just taking a couple points and being safe.
* This is a GMT game that family can play as long as the meanness of the game isn't an issue.

DISLIKE:

* Game may take a little bit too long for what it is. 
* Cards bring a lot of chaos to the game and some seem way overpowered.

Who knew you could improve on Igel Argern!?

Actually a game of fairly high strategy with a smattering of luck from the special cards to break up the seriousness.

Perhaps a bit long for what it is if you don't use the short game rules, but fantastically perfect in it's shorter form even with a larger number of players.

I have to give a big not to the graphic design on this one; simply wonderful graphics.

An oddball theme: avoid the eagles so you can throw yourselves off the cliff. But it is quite a fun little game. You can make use of cover, grab special "food pellets" that give points or favors, block other lemmings. Watching where the birds can get to at any time is pretty key. Some players got their lemmings eaten a lot more than others...and those that did not managed longer jumps too. So there is clearly some skill to the game amongst the craziness.  The special cards add a nice dimension too, countering the bad luck (bring back a dead lemming for instance) and adding some tactical considerations.  Not a game to play too much, but it does not outstay its welcome and also the individual naming of every lemming is a nice touch.

Ok, if this is GMT's "dive" into Euro-style games then I can't wait to see their next venture.

The components are great, the board is awesome and the cards are top notch.  Illustrations are whimsical.  The gameplay overall is a "2" on the GMT scale but really, there's more complexity when playing the game with 3+ people.  

This is a great party game.  Fast to learn, fast to play and it rewards skillful play without making newbs feel like they don't have a chance.  Most importantly, this game shines if everyone plays aggressively.  Get DIRTY!  That Eagle Chow Pile better be heaping when the game ends...

The game is easy to mod and add variants too.  We've already played a few games with a five year old and modified rules that were fun and hilarious.

This is a fun little game about sending genetically modified lemmings over a cliff, with the most style, for points. I was quite surprised with just how good it turned out to be.

I like that in a game. Everyone feels like they are still in it.

RATING: 7
I've now played with five and six, and everyone had a good time. The rules are very straightforward and are well-integrated with the theme. The production values are fantastic - no need to shy away from LL because it's a GMT game. They did a very nice job on the art and components, and the box is one of these uber-boxes such as the one in which Commands and Colors: Ancients comes in. You could probably sit or stand on it and it would support you. I'm glad I participated in the pre-order. 

LL is a purely tactical game, with a nice element where players take turns operating the eagles which fly around and can be used to eat other players' lemmings. But because it is so tactical, and because the actions of other players significantly alter the landscape, you pretty much have to focus on simply making the best play you can on your turn. At least with 5 and 6 players, there isn't much opportunity to develop and implement a strategy. This is bad, because it's the kind of game anyone can win. This is good, because - again - it's the kind of game anyone can win. The tactical focus and chaotic elements make LL a super family game, and a pretty good game to pull out when you have a crowd of people which includes gamers and non-gamers. LL does have some nice "crap on your neighbor" action as well, which is sadly missing from most "family games". I like LL for certain situations, and I recommend it for families and playing with the kids, but I don't recommend it for a group of gamers. There isn't enough control to make it interesting for that crowd.

RATING: 6.5
A cute game (I like the artwork) about trying to get your clan of lemmings to make the best (longest) leaps off the edge of a cliff. It's a light race game similar to but more complictated than Igel Ärgern ([gameid=95]). Like that game, this is a race to get pieces from left to right, with stacking and random movement. But you also have special actions, favor chips, and eagles to contend with. Our plays, with new (or relatively new) players have been a bit longer than I'd like for this kind of game; need to try this with people who've played before.

Shuffle the GAME OVER card into the bottom 7 movement cards. Everyone is dealt 3 special action cards. Their lemmings all start on one end of the hex-grid board, which is open terrain with some brush scattered about. 2 Eagles patrol the majority of the board: they each have a large hunting ground that's divided into 6 areas (the 6 triangles in a big hexagon). The board is also seeded with chips each worth either 1VP, 2VP, or "favor" (value is face down). Favor can be used to add to your movement points (but not if you're leaping the cliff), buy an additional special action, or ___something____.

On your turn, you first roll the eagle dice (0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3) and move each eagle around its hunting territory that many regions. If it was previously feasting, it costs 1 movement point to take off. If it ends up in a region with any lemmings, it eats one (you pick) and scatters the rest; scatter = move out of region using shortest route available. Lemmings in brush, however, are safe -- they are not eaten, only scattered. Dead lemmings go the discard area and are one of the tiebreakers. Then, you reveal a movement card showing 2-5 movement points. In turn order everyone must move one of their lemmings using all points; you're allowed to make only ONE lateral movement, and may not move into a zone currently occupied by an eagle. There are stacking limits (in a 4er game: 5 for open terrain, 2 for brush), too. If you're the first lemming to LEAVE a hex with a favor chip, you win the chip! If you leap off the cliff edge, you earn VP = extra movement points spent (e.g., with 5 MP, if you started 1 hex away from the edge you earn 4 VP). That lemming goes on the scored lemmings area, and you immediately earn VP.

The game ends immediately when the GAME OVER card is revealed. Everyone now gets additional VP: 1/special action card in hand   values shown on favor chips. Most points wins!

RATING: 5
Amusing to see a "silly" game from GMT with wargame elements like stacking limits.  This isn't my cup of tea...the humor is not enough to sustain the game, and there is a lot of randomness and take that, and not a lot of scope for clever play.  Also it drags on for longer than it should.

Based on one play with five players i found this to be a bit boring. V cute theme but like all, but the greatest race games, the calculation and probability analysis quickly swamps the cute theme - which means you get annoyed if a 66.66% probably safe decsion keeps failing, then start calculating the odds of it happening four times in a row....I don't want to be thinking along these lines when playing a cutesy game, or thinking that the cards are unbalaanced. 

The game with five went on way too long and this is torture with AP players who are risk adverse.

Might be more fun with three as you have a bit more control over the Eagles.  

However, much rather play Jamaica or Fearsome Floors.

More than anything else, it reminds me of a bigger, badder Parchisi.  There's the same kind of tension between trying to run one of your guys all the way to the end and keeping them in groups.  Controlling the eagles is also good fun and generates cheers and groans.  Don't play this one with slow players, though.

RATING: 3
it's light hearted and innoffensive and so my rating will seem harsh. But it takes up way too much time for a game with this much randomness (our 2.5 hr game came down to who drew the best food chits) and there's too much down time in between moves, two problems that are likely to kill any game for me. The movement system is not elegant because the hexagons just offer several choices but ultimately you wind up in the same zone mostly, so there's no payoff for trying to think through it. The scoring system is also not very clever cause most people score 4 or 5 pts off the cliff so those food chits you pick up for 1 or 2 pts are not very valuable; then the options you get for using your special food chits dont seem nearly worth it: it should be better to use one "favor" chit to move one more space and thereby get closer to the cliff, using 2 "favors" to add to the cliff divek score seems less efficient but there is the risk of getting eaten so I guess it makes some sense. 

The fact you can only move one lemming at a time, means a a very great oppurtunity to makes this interesting and strategic was lost. The game slavishly adheres to that rule, although it bends other rules; dont lemmings follow each other in droves? Isnt that the whole lemming thing? What they are famous for? But I can only move one lemming at a time, how non thematic is that? 


So most of the game winds up as: spending a bit of time to think and see if you can maximize the movement of the one lemming only you can move; wait for several players in front of you to mess up your plans with randomness, throw in a card play to further mess up randomness and now it's your turn. So the game wastes your time and messes up whatever tactic you tried to play. About the only thing you can actually plan on is when the eagles are yours so you can actually your lemmings without danger, so that's the only real tactic in the game and everbody knows that...

also picking up food on your way to jumping off a cliff is totally non thematic, the special cards are interesting but also add more randomness and more unbalance the game, so many problems and nothing to redeem it.

This is a fun and kind of silly game with good tactical choices that can feel little arbitrary at times.  Humorously enough, it is a race game in which the players are lemmings in a race to jump off of a cliff.  The way to the cliff is perilous and deadly itself, so the lemmings are risking their lives in order to *really* risk their lives.

In all fairness, GMT went to great lengths to describe this game as easy and even package it towards children.  What they failed to convey was that Leaping Lemmings doesn't even belong in the GMT universe.  It is simple to play, tediously repetitive, and has no arc.  It cycles, ends, and someone wins.  Perhaps grognards can play it with their grandchildren?  Re-themed and properly shortened, it could have been a mini-game inside of a larger GMT title.

Friends bought this game at WBC.  Cute, but frustrating, as you try to get your little lemmings to reach the point where they can execute the ultimate flying leap off a cliff.  Very amusing, since each lemming has its own name, and your lemming clan has a personality.  Sadly though, too much time is spent trying and failing to avoid disaster (hungry eagles, annoying munchie-stealing opposing lemmings).  Don't think I will play this too much.

When played quickly and without overanalyzing every move, this can be an enjoyable family game. I think 6 players is too much and causes the game to overstay its welcome. Best with 4.

About [thing=29687][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=29687][/thing] is a weird game. Starts with its unique theme: each player controls a cloned clan of lemmings that have been specially trained to compete with the other lemming clans, all trying to scurry down a canyon and hurl themselves over a cliff, while also trying to avoid being eaten by two Eagles. This is done due to a $20 bet between scientists.

Then the gameplay is a mix of moving the lemmings forward (while not truly being a racing game) and avoiding the Eagles in the process. The main mechanic, I think, would truly be Take That. I wouldn't consider this beforehand, but now I do. Everyone will push their lemmings forward. The one that will fare better are usuallly the ones that can screw the others better, while pretending to be a nice person, with a bloody and dangling lemming tail coming out of the corner of the mouth.

And one person probably can't win without pushing some lemmings out of the cliff, so [thing=29687][/thing] require players to both be jerks and avoid jerk-ish acts against you. But will help a lot if you make some good movements.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
The player whose turn is rolls the two dice (one for each) for the Eagles movement, as must move them the number shown on the die. If the Eagle lands on an area with one or more exposed lemmings, it will kill one (decided by the player that rolled the dice) and scatter the others.

Then a movement card will be revealed. They range from 2 to 5 movement points. All players, in turn order, must move a lemming the exact number of spaces. Lemmings can never return with their normal movement (when scared by Eagles they can), only go forward. It is possible to keep a lemming in a given place and move other, as players have several lemmings available at the start of the game - but only one lemming of a player will move each round. Is possible that, during the movement, to enter in a space with a bush - it costs 2 movement to enter, but it protects the lemming from the Eagle.

If a lemming has movement to jump over the cliff, all the movement left after it reaches the border will count as points. Also, the first lemming to move out of an area with a pellet, takes it - pellets can be worth 1 or 2 points, or be a Favor, and favors can be used to increase movement, gain points or cards.

Talking about cards, players start with 3 of them, and can use them on their turn. Some can help you, others can hinder your opponents. Cards are free to play, bust must be played before moving your lemming.

The winner will be the player with the most points - from jumps and pellets mainly (one card can also give points).

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
- Where and when to move: this works both for the lemmings and the Eagles. And is the heart of the game - good movements can earn you protection (by staying in bushes, or keeping a distance from the Eagle), earn you pellets, block opponents (by stacking above them, as the lemmings bellow can only move after the lemming at the top does) and net you points, when jumping off the cliff. With the Eagle the decision will occur less, as you only move them when you are the first player, still, it is key to consider this in order to not only open a path for your own lemming, but also to hunt the others, making them pay for earlier attacks, stopping them from gaining pellets or points, or simply because;
- Which card to use and when: sadly, with only 3 cards to use during the whole game, this won't be a decision you will need to make often, but can be key in several ways, going from creating unexpected chaos to pushing your lemming faster, and passing by a big range of screw-you cards.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Unique theme, with a nice art to match;
- Easy to understand and to play;
- The focus of the game is making the experience light and fun;
- A good room for smart play.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Lots of "take that" moments, from cards and mainly from the bastard Eagles;
- Luck of the draw: not only the Action cards have a range of good to less good cards (for instance, one let the player return one dead lemming from the chow box to a bush in the blue section (second half) of the board, and other, almost same, but in the red section (first half)), but also in the Movement card - sometimes a 2 or 3 can really help you and be bad for someone else, or you can have a lemming at the border of the cliff and a 2 appear. Still, at least once in the game, you can use an special action and turn a Movement card, of whatever value, to a 5, only for you;
- Luck of the dice: since the movement of the Eagles must be exactly the amount shown on the dice, even with the odds on your side, you can have your lemming eaten. Also, regardless if the other person wants to attack you or not (say you are really behind in points), this might still happen;
- Not enough Action cards - I want more than just 3: they are fun, thematic and creates nice tension and moments.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
You know that nature documentaries in which a gazelle is running from a cheetah? Consider this, adding the fact that, the only way to outrun the cheetah is by going over a cliff. And, besides the cliff, there are a Russian, an American, a French and a Japanese given scores to the jump. It is that weird and mean.

[thing=29687][/thing] offers and unique experience, made to have a black humor, but not dark enough to be scary - more liking throwing snow balls at someone else. It is kind of mean to do it, and is throwing stuff at someone, but is also fun and mostly harmless, except for the snow (or the lemmings). And Eagles must eat also, after all.

The production is nice enough - not in the current level of graphic design of some GMT titles, but higher than several of its older games.

I can see that [thing=29687][/thing] will fall flat for lots of gamers, those wanting a more controlled environment, with less harming of others plays. Still, I can also see [thing=29687][/thing] working in family nights (it has enough luck and screwing, that even someone with more skill in playing can lose, by being hunted or just unlucky) and just to blow some steam in gamers night. 

It might just be a nice addition to several collections. And you probably won't already have anything quite like [thing=29687][/thing].

I bought this one completely on a whim, mostly because I was shocked to see it on the shelf at my local game store. I had no previous interest in playing it, let alone owning it. But I love a game store that takes chances on smaller publishers, so I felt compelled to support the cause. Now this is the #1 game on my "want to play" list. I can't wait to get it on the table.

a little dry on the first play-through; abstract/tactical/race/plinko style game to get to the end and score the most points with your small group of lemmings; your counters can be picked off by circling hawks if you are not careful; might go up in rating with more play-throughs

tension and interesting decisions, which becomes more tense and more interesting with more players (particularly the "get on top of the stack" decisions).  My rating is probably 4 plus (the number of players times 0.75), but I'll need more plays to be sure.

My only real complaint isn't about the actual gameplay-  as a family game, using 1"x0.5" chits as the primary moving pieces is a bit on the small side for youngster appeal/handling/stacking.

This is one of those games where there's a decent theme, but horrible gameplay.  Basically, every round, the current player rolls dice, and based on those dice, they can decide which player's pawns are eaten.  

The pawns race from the left side of the board to the right.  If they are eaten before getting across, then they score nothing.  

There's a little more to the game, but most of the extra rules to the game are designed to make the theme interesting, not the gameplay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fine game, nothing particularly special.  There's little in common with any of the other games from Rick Young here, which is a disappointment, even if it is expected given the theme.  The game works well enough, but it's an exercise in chaos, fit for families or light gamers.  The theme is great in a silly way, particularly the intro paragraph in the rulebook.

This is a game which really needed to be done by somebody other than GMT.  Although GMT did admirable things with the mounted board, thick counters, and quality cards, the spartan art style that usually serves GMT well doesn't really match up well with this kind of game.  This game cries out for a full-bleed board with beautiful color and nice chunky plastic or wooden pieces to represent the lemmings, much like [gameid=34635].

A pretty nifty take on a race game.  The theme and game pieces help set an amusing ambiance for the game.  It plays vastly differently with 2 compared to 4.  The 2 player game did not seem to work all that well for me but the 4 player game offered a much tighter game and is what I base my rating on.  I am eager to get to play again soon!

Leaping Lemmings is a humorous game for 2-6 players. Each player controls a cloned clan of lemmings that have been specially trained to compete with the other lemming clans, all trying to scurry down a canyon and hurl themselves over a cliff. Distance and style points are important. One lemming diving with style and élan is worth as many as five of the more mundane divers. But beware the hungry eagles circling overhead or your lemmings might not even make the cliff edge!
\13\\13\
Objective: The player with the most victory points wins the game. To earn victory points, players dive their lemmings over the cliff edge and/or collect Lemming Chow Pellets.
\13\\13\
The game board is a hex-based map representing the canyon down which up to six separate lemming clans will travel. The canyon ends with the cliff edge hexes, which are the lemmings' ultimate goal. Between the lemmings and their goal there are two eagles circling overhead hoping for lemming snacks.
\13\\13\
Each turn a movement card is revealed which will allow for 2-5 lemming movement points. Card luck is mitigated in that all players use the same card to move that turn. Only the top lemming in each stack is allowed to move, so covering your opponents' lemmings is one tactic that is used to slow them down. The down side is that the top lemming in each stack is the only one in danger of becoming eagle chow.
\13\\13\
Special Actions allow players to briefly alter the normal rules of the game to their advantage or to their opponents' detriment.

Mean-spirited and double fun.  If it were shortened by 10 minutes (with 5-6 players, at least), Leaping Lemmings would set the mammal world afire.  As it stands, it still generates a good amount of heat and spite.

Warning: Adults and young children who are repeatedly dogpiled and eagle-shredded may not come back for seconds.  My my, we do become attached to our furry friends.

Each round one player turns over a movement card. All players then move one of their lemmings that amount. The more movement points that you have left as a lemming steps off the cliff is the point total for that lemming. There are also some birds that attack lemmings, some bonus markers that give you stuff, and some special power cards. Pretty good race game.

I've now gotten in a play with my regular gaming group (they seemed lukewarm to it) and at a game night at the local FLGS.  I can now see that it plays quickly and is a great tactical race game.  I'm hoping to give it another go with the game group.  We'll see.

This game is in a class by itself.  I call it a racing - wargame.  You are trying to get your lemmings to dive off the cliff in the most spectacular way possible.  Along the way however, you are confronted by a pair of eagles who would like nothing more than to chow down on your lemming bones.  The wargame aspect comes about in using cover (bushes), movement allowance, and the hex look of the board (okay, that is a little thin).  This is a very enjoyable game for gamers and non-gamers alike.

I love the presentation of this game.  Little named lemmings, a chance to swoop in and chow down with eagles, the basic wargaming concepts masked in such a light romp.

A filler set-collection card game. It has a familiar bidding mechanism, but the market is interesting as other players can potentially grab another player's winning bid. Card counting gives an edge.

{many plays • 3-6 players} Well, since I really like Money and Katzenjammer Blues (Hmmm, both Knizia), it stands to reason I'd like a game that's kinda those two combined and reimagined.  Part of what's nice here is the length - it just feels right, even with 6 players, but especially with 3...  a point where Katzenjammer Blues kinda falls short (that game always feels like it's over too quickly, and I've since added mice to it, in fact, to extend game length).  Also, the decision to bid or not bid is nice in that it's interesting, potentially meaningful, but NOT that agonzing.  This keeps the game moving at a nice clip - something it really needs to do when playing with the full 6.  And that it works well with 6 is a pretty neat trick.  Especially since I learned it as a 3, and as a 3-player game, it works remarkably well.  A wonderful little game.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
The auction mechanism in this one is pretty interesting.  This scratches the same itch as For Sale, but For Sale is the better game (although this one would be good to swap in from time to time).  One that I do see sticking around, due to it being pretty fun, and in a small box :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Really cool little auction/card management game.  I was impressed. It's fun, some thought but again, it's cards too!  Not a long game and works as an excellent filler.  The way the auction works is interesting.  You can bid on the big lot of cards, but you are out and get last pick in the cards that were used for bidding.  Last bidder gets one card for free, but gets first pick of what was used in bidding that round (a batch of one color).  That, in itsself, really makes the game for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
The art from Doris is absolutely great! 

Byzanz is a good filler, fun with a nice and smooth gameplay. We played with three and works fine, because there is not too much downtime between rounds. I want to play with more players.

I got it very cheap, 3€ in Spiele-Ofenssive, and it worths every cent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An interesting economic game with dual purpose cards that serve as money (for auctions) and victory points.  Heavy on luck of the draw.  I didn't mind the luck because there were lots of tough choices regarding hand management.  Sometimes it's best to be last and to get the best pile from the marketplace after the bidding rounds (cards used as money all get dumped in the marketplace by color... and you pick one color and take all of those cards, then the 2nd worst player gets his pick, etc.).

UPDATE (7/2009): I like the dual purpose of cards, whereby payments become market offerings.  Getting skunked with a crappy lot that nobody wanted (because you were the unlucky first player to "pass") is annoying but just part of the game.  It's something to consider when bidding on earlier auction lots.  Newbies can mess up the balance of the game by bidding poorly.

Eh. Not a lot going on here; sort of a Traders of Carthage Light (and Traders isn't exactly a meatgrinder). Some interesting stuff, but like Ornella's other games, pretty soulless. After playing, I was virtually certain we must have missed a rule, but no, there just isn't anything here. Not terrible, but not one I'd play again either.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Works just fine, but as most fillers, it's a take it or leave it game for me.  The game basically revolves around balancing your hand to both maximize points scoring potential as well as bidding power.  I didn't feel like I had a heck of a lot of control, nor did I feel the bidding was particularly interesting, but the game still mechanically worked well and had some clever ideas going.

Components: Great artwork on quality cards.

Experience: I like the set collection aspect, and the way the market works, with the last-in player picking first from the market. The auction, though, is rather dull; partly because the advantages of winning a larger lot are so evenly balanced with the advantages of picking early from the leftovers that there is seldom incentive to bid high. Also, because we only need triples to score, there is no long-term investment in a particular color. Still, it's fun and I'd play it again.

Innovative enough new cards-only auction game. There is some strategy in being patient for later, smaller auctions, but there is also a time to snatch up the first auction. The game plays fast and has a good flow to it. Compared to some of the drivel that makes it into English, I cannot believe this game hasn't made the language translation yet.

A clever little auction card game.

A clever, simple card game with an interesting economics system built in, and very original rules.

I didnn't expect that a card game with so simple concept would make such a great impression on me. The idea of paying with the cards you have just acquired is not a new one (Money!, Weinhaendler etc.) but it's executed in such an elegant way.

And the graphics is - at least for me - a great one. It adds so much to the flavour of game and to the gameplay itself.

Great trading game, although you don't trade directly with others. You bid on available items for trade, so the highest price gets the cards. But if you're first to win the items, you'll be last to go to the market to pick up goods that would allow you to create better combinations of 3's which are necessary for scoring points. Pick the highest card from the 3's and those will be your points. Now go and see what's available for trade again and plan your timing to the market and you'll earn the most points hopefully. 

Game goes fast. Nice strategic way of defining your time to get the items for trade and when you want to hit the market. Can you be the greatest trader in Byzantium?? Very nice game.

An interesting auction game that I never want to play again (sorry!).

Each round, there will be an amount of auctions equal to the amount of players. The first auction lot of cards will be equal to the amount of players. The second card will be one less, third two less, and so on until the last auction which is just one card (the person gets that lot for free). Whenever you win an auction, you must pay the cards from your hand. Then you choose one card from the lot you won to put into the "market" area, and keep the rest.
After all auctions have been completed, each person, starting with whoever won the last auction, picks one color and gets all of the cards of that color in the market to their hand. This keeps going until everyone has claimed a stack. The remaining cards are thrown out.

Colour is meaningless during the auction, but is everything when it comes to scoring. Balance is maintained by having the lowest bidder chose first at the market... in our first game the scores were separated by only four points.  Will definitely play again... soon.

Byzanz is a neat little auction game.  I really like how the cards have multiple functions being used to buy and sell.  I also think it's clever how the player who wins the last auction gets to take the first action during the market phase.  A good game where the win always seems within reach.

RATING: 6
Good auction card game. Light. Not quite as interesting to me as For Sale and You're Bluffing, but it comes close. I think it is the limitation of having to bid from your hand that prevents this from shining brighter. However, decent, fast-playing six-player games are not all that common, so this is definitely worth checking out if you are in the market for such a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a bidding game in which you use your cards to bid on the cards in the main market. The cards used for payment go into a second market along with one card the winner selects from the first market. Players select from the second market in reverse order of the bid ranking. So the low bidder gets to select first. Thus there are two markets that give you cards. Then play in sets of three of a color and the high card scores.

RATING: 5
One of the few games that piqued my interest after reading the rules, yet failed to deliver.  I guess I shouldn't say failed, but it was less fun than I had anticipated.  The mechanics are all there and they work and make sense, but the repetitive nature of each round is a little annoying, since there's little build up, or story arc, as some people would say.  The final round is just like the first.  Maybe I'm just not too into set collection.

Charming/harmless little card game in which you use the value of the cards (1-4) in an auction to purchase an amount of goods equal to 1 more than the number of remaining players in the auction without regard to the goods on the card and then turn around and seek to collect sets of three of the same good and keep the highest valued card of the set.  Wilds also exist and are valued at 0, but if you turn in a set of wilds, will earn you 5 points instead of 1,2,3 or 4.  Plays very quickly.  Ultimately forgettable and I have other quick playing card games I prefer in the end.  Traded away after not playing for over a year.

Card-based bidding and group-collection game; makes an entertaining filler.  Cards are cash for bidding as well as the materials to score (collect three of a suit; score the largest).

RATING: 6
It feels like Katzenjammer Blues where you bid with your cards to buy more cards, the aim being to form a trio of cards in one suit, scoring the high card and discarding the rest. The innovation is the diminishing round aspect. In a 6 player game the first auction is for 6 cards, the non-winners then fight for 5 cards, then 4 and so on. The cards used to win the auction go into the "market", as well as 1 chosen discard from each auctioned lot. At the end of the auctions, players get to choose 1 suit out of the "market", starting with the player who 'won' the 1 auction (the last) and working up to who won the 6 auction (the first). Play a few more rounds and most points wins. The game provides a nice balance between winning early and winning late, allowing you to hold back if the suits you're looking to meld don't appear in the early auctions, knowing you'll get some compensation from the market at least. I suspect there's too much luck for it to be a staple. Like Don, the collection of cards that come out as a group can make or break a winning score, especially as you're forced to meld or discard once you're over the 7 card hand limit. There are some decisions to make on whether or not to give up decent cards in your hand for a different selection on the table. You can keep track of all the cards as they come out if you're that keen for a slight edge, but for mine the luck seems to overwhelm it a bit plus it gets a bit samey after a few rounds, especially with fewer players.

Based on one play: A very simple auction game where you must buy cards with symbols on them. The cards are randomly placed and then each player will get a set based on their bid (earlier bidders get more cards). Then sets of three identical symbols are sold and points awarded for cards with higher numbers. There is little thought and enough luck, but mainly, it is just dull.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
What a neat little auction game!  Each player is bidding on goods with a hand of goods--so players better make sure they're getting more than they're giving up.  Losers of a particular auction get to participate in the next auction, which has fewer goods but also fewer bidders.  You're trying to make and cash in sets of 3 goods of the same type, scoring the bidding value of the highest-valued card.  The game is simple, intuitive, and a lot of fun.  A large player range is an added plus.

Essen 2008.

Had this demo'ed to us at Essen & enjoyed it a lot. Good card game where the cards are the currency and the goods, so a fine balance is needed between spending & collecting. Sets of 3 goods are sold with the highest card retained as your points score. Highest score wins.

--Nov2010-- Amusing; light; entertaining.  It's not anything Serious or Important, but definitely a fun little game of provoking the odds.  Will you bid early for a heterogeneous set of cards?  Or wait until later to collect a pile of payments in one color?  There's a lot of randomness here, and a pretty fair set of groupthink.  But we had fun with it.

Fairly elegant card game with bidding for decreasing number of cards and exchanging fewer cards for a chance to be the first one to choose from the card that were bid. Nice design but should be a bit faster for what it is.

RATING: 5
Good game with four players - where there's some control and chance to evaluate what people will be putting into the market each of the six rounds. Not so good game with six players, where four rounds is too few. With six there's too little control and not enough suits in the market to make bidding early worth it. The result is that too many auctions go past with nobody bidding and then being forced to take the cards that won't help them. The prospect of an extra card is unappealing and again, the game being only four rounds long it's killing off your chances.

So, to summarise: Play it with four - the sweet spot. Don't go near the six player game. Playing with five or three is okay.

It's a shame - I was hoping for a good filler six player game. This ain't it.

Byzanz -- 

Played three- and four-player.

Involvement builds as play progresses.  In the initial auction, you just want to build your hand -- it doesn't matter much what cards are up for bid.  But that quickly changes.  Soon you're paying attention to not only the cards on the auction block, but also to the cards being bid, since they'll wind up in the market, where you may be able to get them -- if you can choose first.  When is it worth forgoing the auction for the sake of market-selection turn order?

This quickly joined my favorite fillers.

Cute set collecting auction game.  Nothing new here, but the parts are sufficiently mixed to make the game feel original enough.  This game really needs something to regulate a crappy starting hand.  If you start with all low value cards and zeros then you can't win bids and you just end up with what is given to you.  Now the game is very (too?) well balanced, so eventually you pop up into the pack, but in the meantime there just aren't any real decisions to make.  Because this is a filler, if you are going a couple rounds with no possibilities of winning an auction, then that is too large of a portion of the game.

Still, when you do make decisions, they are enjoyable.  I suspect that they make little consequence to the result, but the illusion of control is thinly maintained.

I can't help but feel that this is an Adlung-Spiele game.

Good fun if you fix the opening hands.

RATING: 6.5
It's an interesting auction, set-collection game ... sort of an amped up For Sale: use cards to bid for other cards which are worth points. Here, though, the VP gain happens throughout and requires you convert your ability to bid into VP. It plays pretty quickly (~25min) ... nice filler!

--- Summary ---
A deck of Item Cards (0-4 in several colors) is shuffled: players start with a hand of cards, and the rest are in a draw pile (a few are removed randomly if playing with fewer players). There's also a deck of Market Cards numbered 1-n, arranged face up with n on top. Each turn, reveal as many Item Cards as the top Market Card. Players use their cards in hand to bid for this lot of cards: to bid, place 1+ cards from your hand down face up in front of you. Go round and round, raising the bid (play more cards in front of your) or passing, until someone wins. The auction losers retain their cards. The winner places their bid cards, as well as one card from the auctioned lot, into the Market (sorted by type/color); the other won cards are added to their hand. The winner also takes the Market card. There is one exception: if everyone passes without bidding, the first person to pass wins the lot and keeps ALL cards in the lot (i.e., none sent to Market). This auction winner, with a Market Card in front of them, may not participate in the rest of the round. Repeat this process until all the Market Cards have been taken; the first still-active player to the left of the previous auction winner makes the first bid. The final Market Card is the 1: there is no auction; the revealed card is immediately added to the Market and the last remaining player takes the 1.

The round ends with players, in Market Card order, choosing one set of like-colored cards from the Market. At any time in the game players may, or if a player ever has >7 cards in hand then that player must, turn in a set of 3 cards of the same color (0s are wild); the lowest 2 are removed from the game and the 3rd is added to your score pile (0s in score pile are worth 5VP; others are worth face value).

The game ends when the Item deck is exhausted (finish the round). Players turn in their final sets-of-three, then sum the VP in their score piles. The player with the most VP wins!

Clever game that packs many interesting decisions in a small box.  I also ike the rule of drafting first if you won the last lot and vice versa.  Would like to play more since I'm not even close to formulating a good strategy yet.

Perhaps I'm exaggerating a little to make it an 8, but Byzanz did make a very nice impression on first playing with 6 players, and 6 players is a tough number to please.  Like many games, it is a scramble for numbers through a process involving an auction.  The scoring is efficient and the game a smooth one.  P.S. After three games of Byzanz, I'm upholding my 8 rating.

RATING: 5
[Amigo Spiele 08 edition] {Arabian market; bidding, set-collection; optimal 5-6?}  I am usually interested in Amigo card games.  They are usually cheap and fun.  With Uwe Rosenberg's strong recommendation, I bought Byzanz after reading the rule because it's the kind of bidding / trading game that I like.

However, Byzanz isn't fun very for me.  I only played with 3 / 4 players.  It feels bland and repetitive.  And, it's more luck than I expected. I will try it later with more players to make the final conclusion.  This game should be better with more people because it is more competitive and more cards will be recycled in the market.

Nonetheless, it is a solid filler - quick, interactive, easy to learn and lightweight.  The mechanic to recycle the cards is clever.  This forces player to think carefully during bidding, lest they will give useful cards to the opponents.  In addition, there is a nice balance in card taking - the player who gets the most cards collects cards in the market the last.  In this way, players collect more or less similar number of cards each round.  As a result, players have to decide wisely when and how much to bid for each set.  The 7-card limit is also clever to prevent players from hoarding cards; but this also increases the luck of draw and players may need to bet on which color would appear in future (good card counting would help).  The theme is only tenuous.  It does not enhance game experience.

The cards are the usual Amigo quality - linen-finished, sturdy and colorfully illustrated.  Nothing to complain.

tl;dr: ok card game

This is a hand management game. What cards to play to gain what cards? When to play cards, when to score cards... it all works pretty well and has some interesting choices. However, while I wouldn't mind playing again, I wasn't that taken by it. Maybe this is one of those games that gets better if everyone really knows the game well.
All in all I would say this is a pretty OK card game worth trying.

Byzanz is difficult to teach because cards have up to 3 functions depending on their position at the table.  It nearly begs for a board to anchor the proceedings.  But good thing there's not one, because this is fast, simple, German card filler at its best.

RATING: 9
Closely contested auction game that scales well, however, I think it is best with 3 or 4.

Byzanz features unique mechanics that simply sparkle and have stood the test of time far better than the more popular games of this genre - therefore it has earned the highest of grades.

Outside of the small initial hand that you are dealt,  all other game cards are accrued through auctions or the marketplace.  This mitigates the luck factor in this game,  essentially rendering it negligible.

It is borderline criminal that this is not more widely available.

RATING: 7.75
Has become our go-to game when we have six players and are looking for something shortish.  A little too long to call a filler (45 minutes), but it still has plenty of fun decisions and always ends up as a tight race.  The fact that you are bidding with the same cards that end up being your points makes for difficult choices.  The card artwork is (Doris) great, and the game feels like much more than a card game.  A lot of game in a little package!

Seems okay, if a little sparse. I do like the idea of going for a lot of early cards with the chance of getting little to nothing later, versus going later and getting first shot at the market. It just seems like there's not a whole lot going on.

One of my top fillers as far as fillers go. A real upgrade on for Sale. I rank it up there with High Society and No Thanks. This game is quite deep for a card game but not deep enough for analysis paralysis. A GEM indeed. Why is no one carrying this in the States?

Another "fascinating during the first play and kinda boring every time after" design from Ornella, who continues to frustrate with really interesting mechanisms in games that spin down too quickly in interest.

The cascading winning bid/one card from the winning lot mechanic is the main point of interest, which is interesting but not enough to maintain interest. A fine, but not great, auction game.

Cards are auctioned using cards as money, with successive auctions being smaller but compensated by earlier pick from the pool of spent cards.  Somewhat similar to Die Weinhändler and Knizia's Money, both of which I have owned and traded away, but this is better.

Played several times (strangely enough, always with 5 players, although not always the same ones).

A great filler. This is one of my new favorite light and quick games. There is enough strategy to keep this interesting but it moves quickly. It got a good reception with the family so far.

Update: I docked this a half point. I am not sure if there are any real strategies to this. I think I need to play some more. Still popular.

This game is pretty fun! My kids 5 and 8 had a blast playing it. Immediate request to play again. I get a kick out of it, too, and will definitely be keeping it as a filler to play with the right group of adults (that appreciate this kind of thing) and certainly as a fun one to play with kids. 

Dutrait's artwork, as always, is phenomenal. Really just perfect.

On ne compte plus les jeux où on doit aller chercher le trésor d'un dragon dans un donjon. Dans Dragon Run, vous avez déjà le trésor, mais le dragon n'est pas content, et il va bien vous le faire comprendre. Barrez-vous du donjon, sans (trop) vous faire cramer, courrez tête baissée, avancez prudemment, ou pleurez votre mère en espérant que le dragon ne vous entende pas.

Pour 2 à 5 pleureuses, pour des parties de 20 minutes

I don't want to die! Whaahaha!
Terribly fun little game and simple to play. 
Almost a co-op game, you're all running away from the dragon together, yet you want to be the one to get away with the most treasure. 
We had great fun bawling and playing the roles of our characters.

This game has great artwork & a very short & fun game play.. so why only 4?
Because the roles are clearly not balanced.. the thief is by far superior than for example the magician or the elf, as his action the thief can steal a treasure from another player, the others can only hope that their power will help them to find a treasure.. not the same.
Otherwise this would've been a very cool filler.

Very good game !
Easy to learn and fun "push your luck".
The "location" effects, the potion/talisman cards and the character's power (well balanced I think) give a good balance and enables the player to stay in the game... except if you really pushed you luck too hard and the dragon was the 1st card in the "location" deck ! (happened to me 2 times...)
Well it's only 15mn, so it's not a problem to be eliminated first :-)

RATING: 7
First impression: This is a fun push-your-luck game. The theme is a little stronger, and the push-your-luck is just a hair weaker than in other games of this type, and there are a lot of laughs and fun to be had. It's pretty heavily interactive and mean, but it's such a quick game that that just adds to the fun.

Push-your-luck with to little push. I love the artwork, but the game is even to light for me.

Really cool litle press your luck game. Neat artwork and
great how the mechanics work with the special powers.

A member of my gaming group has decided to start a "Cathala Collection" and so he picked up this cute little filler that I had never heard of.  

I enjoyed it, the art was fun, it was easy to learn, easy to play, and had a few tense moments.  In a weird way I wish it was a bit longer, to mitigate the luck a little.  If it shows up again at my table I'd be happy to play it, if I never see this game again I will probably never think about it or ask for it ever again.

It's been quite a while since I've played a game I've disliked, where to begin. Decisions are painfully light in this game, abilities seem rather unbalanced (the psychic's ability could hurt himself as much as it hurts others, while myself being the cleric had almost no downside from drawing more and more cards from the dungeon, only fearing the card that made me discard down to 4). The value of the money cards have a huge disparity (from one to at least 5). The potions almost seem necessary to have at least some strategy in this game.

Une mécanique déjà vue (et revue) et un thème que j'aime de moins en moins. Bref, pas très original, même si ça tourne.

Un jeu de stop ou encore familial, assez haletant en raison d'un thème certes peu original, mais toujours accrocheur.

RATING: 3.5
Un peu injuste de donner une note faible en n'ayant même pas fini ma seule partie jouée... Mais voilà le problème justement!: Ne pas avoir envie de terminer un jeu qui doit durer une vingtaine de minutes, c'est que quelque chose nous a vraiment déplu dans ce jeu!

RATING: 5
Fun with the kids (six and four) - it's the distillation of the search in the dragon's lair from DungeonQuest.  Draw one from a pile of ten cards and hope it's not the dragon! Not sure if it would get much play time with an older group but certainly quick, silly fun with the family.

Impeccable art by Vincent Dutrait.  His games are near instant buys for me.

played it... don't liked it - no control - a push your luck with too much thing to be really simple as it should be...

This could have been nice, if the explanation had been better. Light push your luck game, that isn't the sort of game we like, but it could be nice I think if you actually know what everything does.

Easy to teach/learn. Luck is the first word coming into mind. If your in the mood to play a luck game, then this is your game.

This is the game you pull out if someone wants to play Munchkin. It's fast, tense, and easy to learn. The basics of the game are pretty much push your luck, but the variable player powers add to the replayability.

Push your luck game with a Munchkin vibe but less chaotic and with a short play time.
Everything is functional here including gameplay, art and production value. 
What's missing is variability. The game is short, but the push your luck and hero powers are so limited that you won't want to play again.

A game of press your luck in an attempt to make it out of the dungeon with the most treasure before the dragon kills you character.  Players have the option of playing 1 of 7 characters each with a special ability.  On your turn you can do 1 of 3 things; charge through the next room (or card), sneak past the dragon by rolling a d10 (looking to get a number higher than the remaining number of rooms), or cry like a baby and take no risk at all.  Both sneaking and crying will cost you a specific amount of treasure.  The winner is the player who escapes the dungeon alive with the most treasure.  The sweet spot for this game is 4-5 players.

A quick and fun game.  The more players that you have, the more fun tho imo.

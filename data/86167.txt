I played the Historical Photo Edition on the behest of my gaming buddies while on a gaming session night and was surprised to learn that there's an anime version with scantily clad German women officers.  I can't imagine taking this game seriously with the anime version since the WWII theme and photos is what drew me in, but to each their own. 

 The game itself is another interesting take on Dominion/Deck Builders. The period photos draw you into the theme and the mechanic where the Brits counterattack is innovative and something that I haven't seen before in these type of games. The game is fairly aggressive since you will be attacking and defending, but it adds to the theme and flavor of the game. I don't know if I would ask to bring this to the table, but I wouldn't mind playing it if asked.

Photograph edition is a guilty pleasure of mine.
I did a supportpledge during the kickstarter for this but due to the troublesome theme and the need for someone to play it with i never upgraded. Apparently there are solo-rules available so I need to look this up again.

I'm addicted to this game!  Usually when I get a game for the eye-candy like this one, I don't expect a whole lot from the gameplay.  This game pleasantly surprised me by having quite fun and innovated game mechanics.  I'm a huge fan of deckbuilding games, and this one takes the genre to a new level by throwing in some random surprise elements.  If this is what's to be expected from Arclight, then I gladly await more!

Players recruit elements of the German and Italian army, and try to conquer North African objectives during World War II.  One of the more unusual deck builders out there, where players begin with some measly supply cards, and a couple of lowly regiments, and must construct an army that powerful enough to claim objectives.  It's now fairly typical deck building stuff, ramp up your economy (supply), purchase more valuable units, all the way up to Heavy Tank units, and send them into the cities.  Cities, as well as some of the units defending them, are worth victory points, which are totaled when the game ends (fall of Moscow).  This game shares almost all the mechanics with its sister game, Barbarossa, but is a little more complex as the British army can launch counter-attacks.   This game is also closely related to Tanto Cuore, in that you can get units out of your hand and onto the table (the front line), where the actual fighting is done.  The anime lady panty art is a nice, controversial, hook, but seriously you barely notice it during the game.  Your first game or two will take a while as you learn the cards and nuances, but play time will rapidly decrease.  Good, but almost going a little too far in terms of mechanics - I'll stick with Barbarossa.

The game box contains 362 cards illustrated with sexy manga gals wearing just the ‘necessary’ outfit. Each card has few rules on how it can be played, deployed and its effects during battle. Each player takes the role of an Axis officer trying to gather the necessary Italian and German forces so as to capture cities and eliminate opposition in North Africa during WWII. The game mechanics are smart and differ from various other deck-building games. The card play tries to simulate the footsteps of the Desert Fox. By amassing supply points you are trying to form a  force from various units (artillery, recon, supply, tanks etc). Each card gives you some benefits during play or combat. One should play a couple of games before getting familiar with the game mechanics and illustrations. The game AI is not idle but can counter attack while you are trying to get into cities or hit pillboxes in the desert. If you have the adequate force all is well, otherwise not only you but the other co-players take the burden as well. For each won combat the player receives victory points. Victory is earned by the one who has gathered the most points at the end of the play. An unusual card game but nevertheless it simulates an interesting and tense wargaming.

A good followup to Barbarossa. Same pros and cons as that game. Introduces an interesting mechanic in that the game fights back and can retake cities that you've captured. Makes you think twice before wiping out your forces to take Tobruk.

I have enjoyed both El Alamein and Barbarossa.  They each have their own flavor.  Barbarossa is a lighter game where you race for victory points; El Alamein puts you in a situation where resources are tighter and there are more consequences to gaining your VPs.  Both have their place in my game collection.

Limited replay vs Dominion, but better mechanics. Theme is cool, but the fact that every card has a picture of a girl on it makes it somewhat hard to identify each card quickly. For instance, the tank cards show a girl and only the top of the tank, making it harder to spot until you actually read the card carefully.

I think I'd rather play this over Dominion now (at least for a couple more plays)

Great game. It is a real strategy deck building game. I like it very much. 
Very special way of wargame design but one I really like very much. Supply and command issues are make here in very good way making El Alamain very good campaign game where you have to build and use all aspects of managing an army not only sending troops to battle.

RATING: 8.8
I finally got it! :D

Rating based on a solo play so far.

This one is heavier, longer, tighter and more tactical than Barbarossa: its older, more streamlined, brother.

It's a very good game. Because it depicts a war in the desert, the supply lines are much more limited and so it's very hard to get points to buy cards with. It gets easier as you deploy some Luftwaffe units to protect the sea transport a bit later in the game.

I love the British counterattack mechanism. It makes people think twice before going all-out to conquer an enemy city (and, because of that, the game is going to last a little longer).

I liked it a lot, but I'm not sure if it's better than Barbarossa. More plays will tell.

10 to balance the 1s that haven't even played the game. I think the theme is hilarious (and honestly would disgust the third reich and the game designer would be put to death). Anyways, this game is equally army and deck building, which I love. The theme is very well communicated in the mechanics, being in the desert with few supply points, useless Italian troops etc... haha. My biggest gripe with this game is, and it's a bit of a big one, the VP distribution. I hate it. I don't want to shuffle the VP I'll be drawing. You could conceivably take a majority of the cities and have most of the panzers, and your opponent could just trounce you by drawing five 4VP cards from one city and ending up with a bunch of sandstorms late game or something. The actualy victory tallying is flawed, but the rest of the game is awesome.

I'd say that Thunderstone is to dungeon crawling rpgs as El Alamein is to miniatures war games. Feels like a war game, with cards.

Weird and (possibly) wonderful. Only played half a game of this and didn't grasp the rules at all (haven't played any deck-builders before) so didn't enjoy the experience. However, I can see there is probably an interesting game in there so I'll read up the rules online myself and hope to try this again soon. 

The weirdness comes in the card art. I have to say I like the anime characters BUT feel uncomfortable about how this would be perceived by other gamers. There are women at the games club - are they put off by the sight of guys playing a game with such images? I don't know - I do know that many women actually like anime but I can also see that this will be offensive to some. 

My own opinion is that it's a fun and wacky idea, and if there IS a playable, interesting game in there I'll be happy to try it again.

A very playable, tense and exciting deck building game with card art that will either thrill or displease. Players play as the Axis, recruiting German and Italian infantry, tanks, artillery etc with the aim of racing against each other to defeat key locations, but the excitement lays in never truly knowing the full strength and capacity of the enemy...and if you survive...will the dreaded counter attack occur which could decimate you and your fellow players?

RATING: 8
Deckbuilding game. Unique and interesting theme. Integrates well with Barba Rossa.

My rant for people knocking the game for it's theme:
The Nazi references do not bother me because there are none. There's plenty of iron crosses and eagles, but there aren't any swastikas. The Hitler character is named Adolf and the SS are just a unit type. In this regard, it's just like playing Axis and Allies or any of the billions of other World War II based games.
If you still think the game is a disgrace for making fun of a dark period of history then Colonel Hogan and Quinton McHale would like a word with you.
If you're going to rate the game, then please do so based on gameplay.

Rules felt very ambiguous and and unclear at times. Pacing of the game also felt very wrong at different points in the game.

The game is probably not that bad at some point, but I can hardly recommend it over Dominion or Thunderstone.

Yes, I own the Japanese panty girl edition. I find WWII Nazis crossed with anime soft porn zanily inappropriate on so many levels and, at the same time, it reflects different cultural assumptions in an interesting way. 

Barbarossa, the original game, is also a very good and interesting deckbuilder.

I bought it, in part, as curiosity and also as a strike for free creative expression, as I'm sure there are lots of people who'd love to ban the game, particularly due to the sexualised art. It's certain not glorifying the Nazis - I doubt there are many of them who'd have liked to be depicted in underpants, suspenders and no trousers.

Would want to put a 9 there, but I'm hesitant and I need to play more before I can confirm. What I do know is that I find this is immensely more interesting than Dominion, because it applies the deck-building in a more thematic way and that I like a lot. But I can't rate Dominion lower than 8 because it's a great game too. So I guess this will rise to a 9, but it's the first time I hesitate.

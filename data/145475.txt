Surprisingly good fun when you are in the mood and the illustrations are excellent. The scoring system seems pretty tacked on though.

[2-5] Great storytelling game set in one of my all time favorite settings: a tavern in Middle Earth. The mechanics almost disappear as you play and the art is incredible.

For me, this is the ultimate LotR game as it lets players explore Middle Earth in a semi-RPG setting. It lets players focus on the human (or elf, dwarf, etc) interaction as opposed to war. Beautiful game.

A simplified, Tolkien-themed Once Upon a Time. Story-telling abilities not required: it's just a luck-fest. Nevertheless, it is kinda fun, especially if one is a Tolkien fan; just don't expect to be coming back to it all that often.

A much better idea would have been to simply make a purely Lord of the Rings version of Once Upon a Time. Perhaps copyright issues on both sides prevented that?

I love this game with the right players. It's Once Upon a Time in the Tolkien universe. Favorite theme as an excuse to tell stories in that world.

Abstrakta ludo pri la aventuroj de hobitoj.

Povas taŭgi kiel simpla rol-ludo, sed ĝi estas iom asbtrakta. Sukceso dependas de la pacienco kaj rakontemo de la ludantoj.

I play this solo since the hazard cards are basically played automatically anyways (I shuffle and pick one at random if there's more than one match), and I draw 6 new hazard with each adventure card.  There's no real winning or losing, just how well the story goes for me and in what condition I wind up in at the Inn at the end! Very fun to relax before bed.

intriguing story telling game.  great for a light gaming experience over a beer or two.  scoring is extremely and unnecessarily complicated, but the materials provide interesting opportunities for extemporaneous storytelling.

Creative players tell creative stories, others tend to go straight forward describing what they discover. Anyway, interrupting with hazards is always fun. Reward system is decent.

Storytelling Lord of the Rings card game.  Absolutely gorgeous artwork.  If you're a story teller, love Tolkien, and quick on your feet this is the game for you.  If not, enjoy the pretty pictures!

An underrated little gem with excellent production values. Though probably more suited to role-players than boardgamers. Doubles up as an add-on for your The One Ring RPG games.

Very interesting game, best to be played if everyone's good at storytelling. Also neat how you can incorporate the game into the RPG, as well as the recommendation to use it for fledgling DM's.

I enjoyed the storytelling portion of Hobbit's Tale. The mechanism by which other plays introduced hazards into the storyteller's tale is well done. It fits in well with my other storytelling games and I like the theme. As with most of the other games of this type, winning or losing is just an aspect of the game. The game has a mechanic for winning and losing, but the real fun in the game is in the telling a tale.

This is kind of a broken game, but that exactly is the games' strength. You tell card driven stories and the better you tell your stories the more points you get. Do not hink about this very long, just play it and have fun.

I love Lord of the Rings, but this game fell down and crushed my hopes for a good storytelling game based on LOTR. It is like complicated Once Upon a Time without half of the cards and interesting discussions.

Only french version is available to me, and although it's language indiependent, I think that French on cards would ruin most of the game for me... Also, storytelling to myself? Ok, I can live with that, but not with the French.

Curious game. It's a useful add-on to The One Ring RPG (Cubicle 7) that serves as a random encounter generator, which has also been marketed as a standalone game that plays like a redux Once Upon Time (Atlas Games). As a board/card game (rather than an RPG supplement), it's a game in search of rules.

Really fun story telling game.  Have to play with the right people, those who want to get into the stories.  Theme is great also.

Interesting storytelling game. Fun and challenging to come up with stories and counterstories to the pictures/text. Only wish the "listeners" would be able to play cards more often. The way the rules are now it seems it's a bit too easy for the storyteller to finish his/her story without interruption from opposing players.

Fun storytelling game, although the scoring mechanism is flawed. This game is best when you play 'just for fun,' telling stories with friends, rather than trying to win, since the point distribution is completely random. But if you're into just being creative together, there's a lot of value in the box!

I like this a lot, even as a decided non-fan of Tolkien fantasy. Unfortunately, people just never want to play storytelling games. *sigh*. Apparently it's just too much "work".

Hobbit Tales is a good game, wih one big caveat: you need good players to make it work. While other games can get away with mediocre players, Hobbit Tales can't. 99% of the fun comes from the minds of the players, if anyone is fully commited to the game, the entire experience will suffer from it.

Really fun at parties, very creative. This gets brought to all gatherings that aren't big enough for werewolf. Can be like a round of Apple to Apples or Cards Against Humanity you came up with yourself on the fly.

Laurel and I didn't enjoy playing this. There just doesn't seem to be much of a game here.

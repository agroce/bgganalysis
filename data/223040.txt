Good, but the game seemed to end a bit too soon.  There were so few turns in the game (5 player at least) that it seemed largely luck based.

I can appreciate the straight-forward concept of this game. The idea behind it is solid and this would make the game approachable - were it not for the rather convoluted scoring at game end. This impacts play as well - because you have examine the cards in your hand and those available in the display. So it makes for an unexpected brain-burny game. Some might find this delightful. But for me, it just is too much for what otherwise is a lighter expected experience.

Light filler game.  Needs some rules tweaks.  10 cards in the discard goes very quickly with 2-3 players.  Maybe with 4+ it works, but We go to 15 discards with 2-3.  Makes it a bit easier, but less frustrating.  Overall, good concept, but light, not a ton of replayablity.  Basically $14 for a 50 card deck and a huge score-keeping book.  Would rather it be $10 with just a deck-size box like Star Realms, which is a much better game.  But this is more a card drafting/discard picking up game.

Interesting hand building filler game.  All the cards are unique, and you are trying to create the best combo's you can by either top decking a card, or taking a card from the discard pile.  It works really well, and feels like just the right length.  If looking for a new filler, this is one is defiantly one of the better ones from 2017.

Reminds me a lot of Millennium Blades, but reimagined as a filler game. Really smart, but also very swingy potentially, definitely some luck thrown in there. But who cares!? It's the right amount of time for the luck it has (short) and it is a ton of fun in it's simplicity. (Played once at time of rating)

I've played this twice and it's really awesome. The game play isn't complicated, but I like how quickly it flows and I like how even though it's just a numbers game, they make sure to thematically match cards. As soon as I'm able to purchase a copy, I'll be picking this up.

RATING: 7
A neat little game where a ton of different cards combo together in various ways, and you want to end the game with the highest scoring 7 card hand.

The game is super simple: draw a card, discard a card. All of the discards are put on full display, and you can draw either from the discard area, or the top of the deck. The game is over when there are 10 cards in the discard area, and at that point, the game ends and everyone scores their hands.

Pretty fun for such a simple game; my only wish is that the game was a little longer. It didn't really feel like players got enough turns to really create nice combos in a couple games I played, as games can just end really quickly if the discards aren't being drawn. The game also takes about as long to score as it does to play, so I felt like the playtime could afford to go a little longer.

Overall, pretty neat, though, if you like combo-ing a bunch of cards in various interactive ways.

Behind this rather bland and uninspiring box art lies a little filler gem, for all those
Magic The Gathering  players out there. We were hooked after the first two
disorienting play throughs. Then things started to click and we became strangly
obsessed with trying to beat our previous scores.
  
May you all draft the perfect hand :
2 Candle / 3 Book of changes / 4 Shield of Keth / 5 Gem of order / 6 Queen
7 Sword of Keth / 8 Bell Tower / 3 Necromancer = Total 388 score

If anybody has gotten a better score please send me a geek mail!

Once you look past the generic title and art, this is actually a quite clever hand management game.  You're working to craft a perfect 7 card hand, facing a tempo set by the other player(s).  There are so many interacting and overlapping combos among cards, big and small.  Do you push to try and make a big one work?  When do you pivot to a new plan?  Do you keep pushing your luck?  So many good questions, and you'll never build the exact same hand twice.

The mechanisms in the game were fine. I'm just not very interested in things that contain a fantasy theme. Even though the theme is the least important part of the game, it's enough to really make me not interested. Without the theme it's just a gin style set collection and I'd rather play gin.

It takes a few plays to get to grips with this game especially the scoring. It does not take very to play, but without the app the scoring would take ages. Very reminsent of 7 Wonders in that respect. Still a nice filler that is quick to learn and great for newbies.

I usually don't share Tom Vasel's taste in games but his review of Fantasy Realms made me buy this game and I don't regret it. It's really simple mechanically. Draw a  card, discard one in order to build up a hand of cards with maximum points. But combining a working set of 7 cards has an odd fascination to it. I don't mind that scoring almost is 25% of the game. It's part of the fun here. The only drawback is that I don't want to play this with people who try to find an optimal set and work out 'the perfect hand' before playing.

RATING: 8
Dead simple to teach, you pick up a card from the face up discards (or draw blind from the deck), then you discard a card. That’s all there is to a turn, the whole game is centered around trying to build a good combo of cards in your hand and achieve the best in game scoring. The hardest part is actually adding up your score at the end!

A pure drafting game where you are dealt a hand of cards and attempt to adjust your hand by drafting from a deck of from discards.  Each card is unique an interacts with other cards. There is no "top-decking" as the game ends after 10 cards are placed in the discard.  

I played a seven player game of this and hated it as it took forever.  I might have liked it better if it was a 4 player game.  Like most card games, your initial deal is going to impact you and there is very little you can do in a high player count game. But even it a low count game, I suppose there would be issues in that some cards you need will never make it out. 

I found the game boring.  It is a bad version of Fairy Tale.

This is a fun hand management game that'll give you a different feel than other popular card games like Sushi Go and Fairy Tale. I've played with non-gamers who found the combos a bit "too much to think about it" but this didn't feel heavy at all to myself or my friends in my game group. I've read complaints that "scoring takes longer than playing the actual game!" That simply has not been the case for me. Maybe those players are just that bad at math. This game doesn't feel mathy, it's finding combos and trying to get them, it's a fun short card game. I'd still suggest Fairy Tale or San Juan over this, but luckily all three games are VERY different feels.

Wow, you wouldn't expect much from this what with the dull title, theme, and art, but actually it's really good. I can't even think of another card game that is this simple and yet so strategic. Scoring is a little tedious but it's not that bad and there're a lot of interesting choices to make.
The theme works, though it isn't very original. The art isn't bad but it's also not exactly exciting (reminds me of Dungeons & Dragons art from back in the 80's). That said, for a game that can play in 20-30 minutes and work well for 2-6 players (yes, it has a *good* 2 player variant in the rules) and which has this level of strategy and tactics, this may very well be the best game of its class. Highly recommend!

With over 100 plays of Fantasy Realms, it safe to say that this game was our filler of the year. It plays fast, is easy to teach, and has enough decision making to keeps things interesting. Sure, after 50 plays or so it'll start to get old as by then you'll know which cards have the best scoring potential. Although we're putting it into the vault, so to speak, I'm positive we'll revisit it in the future.

This game has dirt simple rules, basically just Rummy, but with every card being unique, and interacting with other cards in different ways to increase or decrease their points value, it elevates to the level of a 'gamer's filler'.

Despite my saying there's 'dirt simple rules', that doesn't quite apply to all the cards and how they interact with each other. I had a question about how the doppleganger worked with wildfire that wasn't answered except in the answer to a forum post on this site. There's apparently at least a mistake in the printing as well, where Wildfire's text should be labeled as a Penalty and isn't. Hopefully that gets addressed with a second printing and at least an official FAQ or Errata posted somewhere.

Fantasy Realms is the perfect filler for gamers. It's incredibly easy to learn/teach, and it can be played in about 15 minutes. Yes, there is a fair amount of luck in Fantasy Realms, but it's constructed such that no one will feel bad about losing, it's fast enough enough that the luck doesn't bother me, and trying to draft the perfect hand is oddly compelling.

I like how this game has all cards being unique, and it's the combinations of cards that help you determine how the final score will be.  Making sure you are not messing yourself up as you try for your maxed combos can be a bit challenging until you grok the cards in the game.  I wish WizKids would have put a bit more into the design and art...seems a bit bland (which prevented me from getting it initially).

First play impression: I can already see that this will be a keeper.

On a turn you draw a card (either from the deck or from any card that has been discarded) then you discard a card. Those are all of the rules. What makes the game, though, is the variety of cards. Every card in the deck is unique and they all score points differently.

At first you just draw cards and work toward improving your starting hand, discarding things that obviously don't work. But after just a few turns you don't want to discard anything because you've almost got the perfect hand of cards and you don't want to risk giving an opponent a great card for their hand.

It's just fun.

A couple of cons:
The MSRP is too high at $20. This is a single deck of cards (about 53 cards, I think). This should be in a Coloretto-sized box and sell for under $10. It also includes a giant score pad that is useless. It's far faster and easier to just use your phone or a calculator to figure up your score.

There is also already an errata. According to the rules a "blanked" card keeps its name, but it has been clarified online that the card is literally treated as if it were completely blank. I actually like this change because it makes things easier to explain, and I'll just have people flip their blanked cards face down. Before this rule change they had to keep the cards face up and remember that only the card name was in effect.

Eager to get more plays, and I could see this being a game that gets played a few times in a row at any game night.

Update: increasing my rating. This game is just great. After more than a dozen plays I still enjoy it and everyone I've played with loves it. It's almost mandatory to use this great scoring app: https://jpraet.github.io/fantasy-realms/. It's browser-based, but you can pull it up on your phone and select "Add to Home screen" in the browser options to save it as an app. Thanks to the author for the app.

Fantasy Realms is a fun to play hand management game, in which players take turns exchanging a single card for another (either a face up one discarded by a player or a face down one from the deck). By doing so, they collectively control when the game ends, after which each player’s hand is scored. Like the artwork, love the many scoring combinations. I am a little less fond of the fact that determining the endscores takes almost as long as the game itself, but I guess that is inherent to the game’s design. The game feels fresh and plays well with 5 players, so it definitely stays in my collection regardless.

Excelente juego en solitario como otros del mismo diseñador.
Algo complejo en las mecánicas pero se consiguen dominar poco a poco.
Buena sensación histórica de sentirse al mando de un bando, siendo bastante impredecible la reacción de la Inteligencia Artificial.
Recomendado pero con una dosis alta de dificultad.

Initial Impression: Let me start by saying that the production values of the game are not the greatest and are almost identical to D-Day at Omaha Beach. However, Compass Games' Customer Service has been outstanding. That being said, this game successfully delivers 2 solitaire CDGs along with a 2P CDG experience and I feel it's well worth the high price I purchased it at. In the system, cards are used to activate specific formations, similar to chit-pull systems, but can also be used to trigger events. The chit-pull combat system flows well, without bogging down the players in combat ratios and modifiers. For the German solo game, the AI is driven by 2 decks of cards. For now there's a fair amount of rules lookup but after one session I'm already beginning to see the light as procedures are being internalized. There's alot of game for me to explore in this box.

Ok, I bit the bullet and played the intro game.

WoW what can I say... The man who gave us Ambush, the DDay series, RAF, Voyage of the Pandora, Hells Highway, co worked on the Conflict of Heroes solo expansion... came up with this one...

Baffled. It should enter my top 5 games as a no brainer but just how HIGH it will get depends on one thing: I wanna play more of it...

Seriously this game should get to the highest ranking ever.

The solo design is historically correct - like the DDay series - but this is now on a scale never seen before. It is not difficult either. The rules are very well written and the flow is great. Like ALL Butterfield games it is fiddly and packed with narrow procedures but plays like the 7th of Beethoven: legendary.
From a design point of view this has to be one of the biggest milestones in the history of boardgaming.
A pity it will only be recognised by so few niche players.

John Butterfield has built on his D-Day series to produce a real gem of a game.

I have only played the German Solo so far, and have barely gotten out of the gates but I am really impressed with the depth of this game and the completeness of the rules.

Wow!  I know I'm a wargame neophyte, but this felt super streamlined.  Chit pulls instead of dice (which covers all terrain, tactics, and strength ratios in combat -- damn!), deck building to simulate changes in units over time, different cards available each day to simulate fog of command.  But it still has all of the varied unit movement/strength, supply lines, fuel, assymetry, limited activation of units -- all the stuff you'd expect.  Brilliant!

I don't know about 3-games-in-1 though.  That's a stretch.  Instead, I'd say that did an absolutely outstanding job creating and streamlining the bots.  This game should play equally well as a 2-player, or 1-player with a german or allies bot.  The bots function differently and to handle all the differences between 2-player, german bot, allies bot, the designer/developer/publisher created 3 maps and 3 rulebooks so that the game stays streamlined.  Super impressed with the game and Compass Games!

Initial Rating: 8 but it's got upward potential

German solo only: 

Stupendous solo wargame. Although the base rules are very streamlined and elegant, the game is very involved and very procedural when it comes to AI actions and deployment process. Thankfully, the rules are well written and for the most part super clear, and the player aids on the geek are exceptional. First impressions show a great system, and a surprisingly well-designed AI. 

The component quality is good, except the card vs. counter colors are a bit off so at times difficult to see the correlations. Overall, a fantastic game and a must have for serious solo wargamers.

Just finished reading the rules. Interestingly, this is a card driven game, with the cards also serving as a unit activation mechanic. Very cool blending of ideas there.

It's a one-mapper, and the counter density is relatively low, so it seems like a good medium weight game, probably in competition with games like [i]Bitter Woods[/i] and[i]FAB: The Bulge[/i], but [i]Ardennes 44[/i] is still the way to go if you want a heavier game.

On the downside, I'm not sure about that chit pull combat resolution system. While certainly unique, it just feels fiddly and slow, and I saw the German army get stuffed on turn 1 in places.

Update: Another play sort of confirmed my complaints about that chit pull system. I just don't see the Germans getting anywhere near winning this game or getting remotely close to their historical goals, at least not the 2p version, and I'm not the only one that feels that way.

It may be a simple matter of tweaking the starting hand sizes a bit, or even just modifying the chit distribution slightly, so I'm not giving up on it yet.

EA: Ardennes ushers in a new family of solitaire wargames (the next one in line is already under consideration) that I expect will be ensconced as a favorite among solitaire players. The salient aspects of the game are the novel take on CDG card play and the combat system. 

The well-worn Ops-Event dilemma is now a decision to use cards to activate formations vs for combat tactics (or events, yes, but they’re few and far between). Units that were activated in one impulse cannot be activated on the immediately following impulse and the decisions on how to use your cards – or save for a combat tactic boost -- are exquisite.

I like the combat system even more. No longer is combat simply about odds but rather about which factors listed on the chits you pulled. Did you flank? Did you bring artillery? Even the terrain is accounted for by the chits you pulled, and you don't know which factors will be most important in any battle until you're already in it. Your 8:1 odds won’t do much for you if you pulled a bunch of “combined arms” and “elite unit” chits. I love this implementation of the fog of war as it forces you to apply different tactics to your battles beyond just loading up on the odds. 

Sure, sometimes the chits go against you but so can dice. At least here we have considerations on how to add facets to our attacks that turn combat into more than just factor counting. 

At the same time... I do think this game lives on the border of being a lifestyle game. You know, one of those games that you play to the exclusion of everything else so as to stay on top of all the rules. The features of the game are great, but they come at a high price. Sometimes I sit down for a session and end up "playing" the AI much more than my own moves.

It's been on my table for almost a year (playing GS only at this point). I'm not sure if or when I'll get to the Allied Solo game since I have such an investment in the GS rules but I sure hope to. 

tl;dr Some days it's "a great game but an awful lot of work" and other days it's "an awful lot of work -- but a great game!"

As to the chits, they bug me because my fingers can't quite grab them so I use tweezers. I wish they were thicker and easier to grab but they’re no reason to not get this game.

Only played the two player game which is one of the best wargames I've played. For me it is the new benchmark for two player strategic wargames. It has the feel of combat commander at another level of operation: plenty of variation, with more 'balanced chaos'. Gameplay: engaging, swift, exciting, deep. Mechanics: the actual play and flow are served very well. For example: the chit draw mechanic replaces a lot of dry calculation and chart stuff for an actual exciting fase. Combat ratios are the only calculation needed. Well written and clear rulebook.  Rules complete enough for a realistic game without getting (too) complex. Components decent quality. Looking forward at playing the solo versions. Must be tougher ruleswise.

Just finished my first GS and won strategic on Turn 22.  Granted got some lucky situations but also some hairy ones that made it touch and go.  The key I think is always push west which creates the gaps and keeps the AI spewing Reserve A units versus killer Reserve B ones.  Getting adjacent to the Meuse (releasing OKW) and then across the Meuse (10VP's) is nice and a tipping point.  Getting that all done before XXX corps seems key.  Love it!

First impression underwhelming to say the least, with a lot of typos and misaligned counters.  Once I got it to the table, I did not find much narrative (or value) in the "bucket of darts combat" system and I hated that traditional CDG choices (drop Von Der Heydte or activate an entire German corps?) are present.  Put it down to taste divergence, as I expect it to be on most 'best of the year' nomination lists.

Excelente wargame tanto en solitario como a 2 jugadores. 

El sistema en solitario representa una evolución de la serie D-Day del mismo autor. Sólo he probado el solitario alemán me ha dado muy buenas sensaciones. Las ayudas de jugador simplifican algunas de las decisiones más complicadas (refuerzos).

El combate basado en chits está bien diseñado aunque, algunas veces, es realmente frustrante ver como grandes fuerzas son incapaces de derrotar a enemigos mediocres.

-(Strangely) I only played the 2P version-

The tandem Mr Butterfield/Foley creates another wargame and they delivered again. It's a terrific game (and I usually don't like an Operational scale), it's tense, beautiful, elegant, innovative, and I can't see any fault in it. This is a game that needs more love and recognition; so don't be mad and don't let that the price tag put you aside, it has all I love in wargames.
Until I play the other 2 solitaire modes, I can't be 100% sure... but I can sense that THIS can be the best design of mr. Butterfield so far. And that it's a lot.

Game is beautiful, gameplay is fun. There are 3 games in one box. So why pretty low rating? 

Because I love FAB: Bulge so much and I believe that it is better game in all aspects. Gameplay is much quicker and much more fun for me, I also like fog of war created by blocks in FAB more than by command cards. Also FAB does allow nice results with much more streamlined and easier to grasp rules. 

I must also say that while combat system is novel I did not like it that much as lot of chits seemed little weird to me and it led to some strange situation. Eg. I find really strange that if both players use artillery only artillery of one of them is resolved (I believe that it is artilerry of defender, but I do not remember it that well). I am also not sure about implementation of some events. Both players know from beginning which German formations may face issue with fuel. I would much more appreciate some random event for that or at least random event for day of this.

I also see potential problem with scenarios as some of those smaller (early ones) are not very interesting and replayable in my view. And given that main campaing is too long for me it somehow left me with no interesting options to play. 

And last I do not play solitaire games much lately.

Overall everytime I want to play Bulge I would rather play FAB which is one of my most favorite systems.

Sounds good for an innovative system - from combat to a system that can be played by 2-sides, solo on each side and thus the game comes with 3 maps for each setting.  Card actions play the AI.

I played both solitaire games. John Butterfield outdid himself with the AI in both versions, including the attacking Germans in Allied Solo. One negative aspect of this is that the AI maintenance is sometimes overly strenuous, though I suppose it's either that or dumbing it down.

German Solo is amazing. I prefer it both due to my preference for being on the offensive, as well as simpler, yet still amazingly complex and effective Allied AI. The further into the game, the better the AI is, and soon the player finds himself under constant threat of counterattacks, loss of supply and so on.

The Allied Solo is amazing in many ways but I do have to be honest: it felt a bit tiring. Maybe a few more plays would make implementing the AI movement easier (it already was much easier after a few plays) but as it was I often got annoyed, especially when Army or Corps cards for big Corps came in and I needed to implement a whole lot of AI movement and combat in one fell swoop.

All in all, I find German Solo amazing and easily in my top 3 solitaire games for now, while Allied Solo is a very good design that didn't fully click with me it seems (still, will likely play again at some point - it really is a good game). All in all - a purchase well made :)

Edit: candidate game of the year for me. Have played four German solo and one Allied, and several two player games solo. Does the seemingly impossible, a solo operational game, where both sides have to defend and attack. I would probably give this a '9', but it gets a '10' to offset the moronic '2' that someone gave it for no comprehensible reason, after probably not even playing the game.

Finally has arrived, after preordering years ago. Have punched counters and read most of the two player rules. Some cool concepts, especially army/ corps boundaries - very scarcely seen in operation games, for some reason. Seems like an innovative design, can't wait to play. And then there are the German/ Allied solo games. (each with approximately 70 page rulebooks)

Edit: after my first playthrough of the 2 player version (solitaire), this may leap into place as my favorite Bulge game ever. The solo games look excellent, diving into one of those next. I especially like the chit based combat system, where the attacker can control his level of commitment, and the cards with the dual use for formation activation and combat support. Also, the Allied Engineer Reaction event cards are sort of genius -- so you get the blocking off of roads, and disrupting German advances, without representing the small units on the board. And going off road for German mechanized units is generally not a very viable option. So good.

  I really don't like the combat system.  You draw chits to see how many hits the attacker and defender each take.  Each chit takes into account some potential aspect of the combat situation.  But if you don't draw the chits that deal with the situation at hand, nothing may happen, or a very unlikely result will occur.  This happens so often, that I find the game unenjoyable.  I have have had numerous examples of 3 panzer divisions attacking a lone infantry unit and nothing happens or the attacker takes 2 hits or some other nonsense. 
  I have loved all the Butterfield games and am very disappointed that this one is a miss for me.  I was extremely excited to pre-order this game, but now I will sell it.

Solitaire: played solo German version. Best solitary game ever played at the moment. Be carefully: it is not a simple system; Allied AI is very detailed with a lot to check and read carefully. Anyway fun and emotion you gain are worthy the effort. Thank to the booklet written by a player and downloadable from bgg (the same genius of d-day at ohmaha booklet :) Thank you! ,) the learning curve is not so steep.
2P version: Played once it has been a surprised. I believed it was a bonus only to justify the high price of the game. I was wrong: my friend and I had a lot of fun and tense action! Soon will be are going to play it again :)

Very enjoyable game. A definite evolution from the D-Day series of games that feels much more like you are playing an actual opponent. Enemy pieces move hex by hex rather than teleporting from area to area as in previous games. Defenders will retreat from less important locations on the map and fight harder for key positions. Cardplay is innovative and chit-play is also a welcome departure from the usual CRT and introduces 2-phases to each combat. You may abort an attack after seeing that it has started badly. Very cerebral - I can easily stare at the board for a half hour trying to figure out the best moves and be totally immersed in the game. Rules are a little bit fiddly and defy memorization, even with practice, but they work well and the rules and play-aids are excellent.

I've only dipped my toe into the Allied solo game so far but I'm impressed with what I've seen. The game generates a very strong narrative and it is very exciting to watch it play out. There's a lot of chaos here, so it might not suit those who like more control of their forces.

in the solo game there's a little headscratching over the artificial intelligence. The rules are comprehensive but you still find edge cases that require a little figuring. But the package as a whole is great and has so far delivered a powerful impression of the Bulge fighting. Another triumph for the sloop John B.

This great game requires serious commitment of playing time and learning time. The rules are well-written, but long, with several novel concepts to wrap one's head around: the random chit draw system for combat resolution, and the card-driven formation activation system. Both work fine and are interesting and fun.

Of course it's 3 games in one, with 3 separate rulebooks and maps. I soloed both sides of the 2-player game first (as recommended) to learn the basic concepts, then started playing the German Solo game (as recommended) as my first true solitaire experience with it. Playing the full GS campaign takes me a couple days! The AI decisionmaking is sometimes quick & easy, and sometimes head-scratchingly slow and tricky to figure out.

I enjoyed it enough to be motivated to create [[Enemy Action: Ardennes German Solo FAQ]] in the BGG wiki.

I owned this for 3 months, and then sold it having looked at the rules pdf. Why I didn't read it before I don't know. I just don't have the wargaming experience and the time to learn and play this.

This game is vastly underrated. It is definitely a task to learn, retain and master the rules and I wish the map and components where made by GMT but this is the solo war game I have been looking for. It's John Butterfield at the height of his craft. The AI systems, combat and general gameplay not only provide an incredibly entertaining challenge but also brilliantly reflect the history of the battle itself. I think this game is a masterpiece and cannot wait for more Enemy Action games.

Playtested GS and AS games.  Played dozens of times and I still play it frequently, especially the Allied Solo (AS) game.  Filled with clever mechanics and just plain fun, loaded with spills and thrills and plausible errors - both by players and AI.

Excellent mechanics, very challenging in solo play, historical and realistic feel to combat and strategy. Very good rule books.
One point off for splitting to map on crease line and some misalignment on counters.

Read 2 player rules and sorted out components. Very impressed by how far Butterfield has gone to get away from gamey-ness and immerse the player in the events of that December. Now we must 'soldier' through to see if the design plays well and hangs together in all 3 modes. There's a ton of new ideas in here. It's exciting!!!

Haven't played on my own yet but watch a couple of games, including one run by the designer Mr. Butterfield at Pacificon. The moment I saw this game in action I knew I had to have it. The mechanics are engaging and keep both players attention through the game.

Brilliant game for kids, clever use of hand management and strategy.  Lovely, solid components and beautifully designed.

My only criticism is that the rivers become a choke-point too often, allowing one person a clear run, which often results in a runaway leader.

But as far as being a wonderful game to introduce children to tactical game playing, this is a must.  And it works quite well as a cut-throat adult game too.

My daughter hated this game to start with to the point of refusing to play. Too much screwage, horses being sent back spaces, not being able to move because two cards played were the same (I know you can dampen that rule). I left it on the shelf for a while then slowly over time enticed her to play it again occasionally. 

With her getting older and more experienced with games she is handling the set-backs a lot better now. To see how far she’s come with this game in around 6 months makes me very proud. She isn’t there yet with being able to take set-backs 100% of the time but at this rate it won’t be long before its water off a ducks back.     

A great game for children and adults to play together, there is strategy to keep the adults interest. She started playing this game very much randomly but now I see her counting spaces to avoid obstacles and to try and land on other players. She’s growing into this game and I’m sure it will be played and enjoyed now for years to come.  

Children who can’t handle being messed with will probably find the game-play hard to accept. Once that part of life can be handled within a game though, it is fun. Has become one of my favourite daddy daughter games.

Giro Galoppo is a weak children game: its only point of interest is the rule about overtaking, that has both players involved switch their positions. Apart from that, the game plays quite poor.

Awesome game for families. Awesome components. My six year old can get a little upset at times if things don't work out for him. It is a simple game but there is a some strategy involved. This game might even be better, especially with kids, than Ave Ceasar. Play with at least 3 players. Game takes about 10 minutes. Once you are done playing, the kids will take the riders and horses and use them as toys. They go really well with the Brio train set...

RATING: 5
Pretty decent and quick racing game for kids!  The game requires a little bit of planning ahead which is pretty trivial for adults but good for kids.  There is also a little screwage factor in the game where you can send other players back a space or two sometimes which can be a little frustrating for kids not used to that sort of thing.  Overall, a fun little game though!

RATING: 7
Wonderful components and very good fun, shines with 4 players, not as exciting with fewer players. My daughter received this for her 5th birthday and at almost 7 still really likes it. Interesting for adults too, who will have an advantage in planning their moves. Unfortunately other games often get picked (by her older brother) which is why this doesn't come out much.

I love this game. It is no deep strategy game. But it is really great for what it is: a quick, fun children's game with lots of screwage and awesome bits. Makes for a great adult filler and is great for breaking the ice with new players at game nights. I had this rated a 9 for a while. I think that may have been a bit enthusiastic. 8 is more like it.

For such a simple kids game, there sure is a lot of inter-player screwage.  My young daughters do like it, but I could see this easily leading to hurt feelings given the very direct nature of conflict.  It is a fun kids game, though.

RATING: 7
This is a good, fast game.  I rate this a 9 for games played with adults and children. For adults, maybe a 5 or 6 (I've never played it with just adults, probably will never).  It seems like a shorter version of Ave Caesar (which I don't like as much, mostly because it's longer).  It feels like you're making meaningful decisions (quick and light ones), against the luck or chaos of other players' choices.  The luck or chaos adds surprise, humor, and challenge. So it keeps my interest, and the kids have probably as good a chance of winning as I do.  I gave it as a gift to my horse-crazy niece (1st grade) and she loved it--repeatedly called for us to play it, and to play it again immediately. There are, I think, a rules ambiguity or two, but it was easy for us to make house rules to resolve it. The colorful, chunky wooden pieces, the friendly board, the short time length, the meaningful-feeling decisions, and luck/chaos all add up to an excellent game for that difficult adult   child niche.  The rules are multi-lingual (including English) and the game is otherwise language independent.

Race game pitched as an adult/children's game.  Secretly and simultaneously reveal a movement card, and run your horses over the course.  Hitting other players causes you to bump them behind you, hitting an obstacle forces you to lose your turn.  Clever order of play mechanic where you resolve from lowest card to highest, which can have unforeseen consequences.  Great components.

RATING: 7.5
I rate children's games according to how excited I am to play them with the appropriately aged child.

The wooden components make this colorful game really visually fun to play:  Jockeys sit on top of horses--players choose their color of jockey and the individual horse--and 5 obstacles are placed around the board.  This means the board can change each game.

Players have a set of movement cards which cover 6 rounds before they are returned.  The child must plan up-coming movement taking into account the obstacles and possible movements of the other players.  

I was surprised many times despite my careful planning, how often the horses changed position by jockeying back & forth.  Therefore, 6+ is the right age as indicated on the box.  Younger children might not understand as their horse keeps losing its intended position or possibly turns. 

Even though the horses & obstacles are a nice size with reasonable bases, they do get knocked over unfortunately.  The game is such a delight, this poses only an irritation, not a deterrent to play. 

This is a delightful game that truly engages the child's brain for planning moves.  It is fun for me too.

This is not a bad game, but I still don't like the screwage element where you push people back. It seemed to be very chaotic. Maybe in a quiet situation I could remember what cards people have played, but when playing with 4yos who keep knocking the horses over that's not really an option.

RATING: 8
Looks can be decieving, and Giro Galoppo is definetly a textbook definition of the old adage.  This cute, folksy looking game is in reality a nasty, cut throat race to the finish.  Simultaneous action has never been so much fun. This pummels Ave Ceasar into the dirt.  Quick races leave a taste for more, as does the need for revenge.

2008-05-16 - better be careful which kids you play this with (young or old).  There's a major screwage element in this.  Put that together with the volatility of events (simultaneous action selection -- things change on the board by the time your card gets played -- kind of like cat 5), and it's utter mayhem.  So you may end up screwing someone you didn't intend to.

RATING: 7.5
A very good, fast kid's game.  There's a real, albeit light, game under the covers here.

Players have cards 1-6.  Everyone plays one card at the same time.  Lowest number goes first.  Landing on another players knocks that player backwards.  Obstacles act as a "lose a turn," and can surprise you when you get bumped.  After the 6th turn, everyone gets their cards back.  Unless there are a lot of collisions, it takes two hands to complete the game.

The pieces and production value are top notch.  Wooden horses, jockeys, and obstacles.  The brims on the jockeys' hats are even made out of felt.  The board folds flat and has a nice, smooth finish on it.

As a kids game, it benefits from having simple rules and deep gameplay.  Obviously, adults would be bored of it quickly but the amount of decisionmaking in a short game is impressive and it's quite nasty.  Also, its a great starting point to discuss future strategy with children.

Fun little filler/kids game.
Each person secretly selects their move using cards numbered 1-6. They can't land in an obstacle, and landing on an other player moves the landed-on player back to the closest empty space. Each card number can be used only once, until the hand refreshes. Plays fast!

Rated from a child's perspective.  They really thought the game was exciting, even though it may not be obvious for young children what the best move is, or how to anticipate which card to play.  Like many users have said, this game has the potential to be quite nasty.  If you're in the rear, you can easily play low numbered cards to mess with your fellow players.  I'd like to try this out with only adults to see what happens.  The play length is much more manageable than in Turfmaster, and it still kind of feels the same way.

Hmmm.

I like the components but I'm not sure about the grass at the feet of the horses.

The game is a bit strange for young kids as lowest number moves first.
In case of a tie the person who is furthest behind moves first .

If you finish your turn on a spot occupied by another player. That player moves back to a free spot as close as possible. If it finishes at a hazard it doesn't move at all.

That is a very difficult rule for five year olds. 
Perhaps next time the hazard means that you have to play a card but can't move the next turn.
I know also pretty hard for kids to grasp...


For adults it isn't just challenging and way to chaotic.

The 6 rating is because it has horses in it and my nieces adore horses.

I am rating this as  kids game.  It has quite a bit of strategy for kids (i.e. if I play a 5 will someone with a lower number send me back first, then where do I land).   There is jumping on other horses and sending them back (which I think is good because I want my kids to play games with some conflict later).  The componetns are very good.

Great family game - simple enough rules for the youngsters but don't let the pretty horses fool you - everyone gets a fixed number of moves so it's dog eat dog, er, or something.

RATING: 7
For my youngest's 4th birthday. Kids love the components and selection of horse and rider and like the board and game. Game itself is surprisingly brutal, and the kid who comes last tends to be exceptionally unhappy, much more so than many other games, so they clearly place large stock in winning. My youngest does well because he tends not to count obstacles when he moves and therefore always makes errors in his favour... the older two spot this but don't always correct him.

Excellent simultaneous selection game where you try to outguess your opponents and bump them backwords as you race ahead.

And I'm aware that it's a kids game, but I didn't feel like the simultaneous action dealie really mattered, which is of course all there is. And, I didn't see anything from my son that indicated much interest either. Glad I got to play this without buying it - a disappointment.

Odd game in that it feels like a nastier version of Ave Caesar but with a cuter, more kiddy theme and more complicated rules.

Components are excellent...though the cardboard front base on the horses' legs tend to fall off when moving pieces.  We pick (and name) horses and riders before each game - something the kids enjoy.

RATING: 6
It’s a horse racing game driven by cards which allow kids to have fun outguessing their parents. Each turn, players simultaneously select one of their cards and show it. The player with the lowest value (and for ties, farther back), moves first. If your horse and rider land on another player's figure, you displace them backward. If your figure's movement would land you on an obstacle, you lose your turn so you need to be careful. First & farthest across the finish line wins.

Nice horse racing game where u play cards to determine which horse moves 1st and how far. Got to be careful of obstacles and other players moving you behind. Straight forward play, neat little components for horses and obstacles. Does make a leap towards a good game but missed out by a nose to something even better.

Such a refreshing "kids" game. There is some tactical quality to your choices.

The components are beyond incredible.

UPDATE: going up in ratings.


It is great for kids but has some brutal strategy to it and kids pick up that strategy quick. Think "Ave Caeser" in a more streamline form. Great filler game for adults.

The components are top of the line and are something you would see in a very high end toy store.

Very good filler game. Good for gamers and not just kids. The end game can be anticlimactic, but there is a lot of action up to that point. The trick is to avoid getting in the position where you won't get hosed, but sometimes you just know it's coming. Production values are excellent and add a lot to the game.

Adorable kids game with amazing pieces. it is a race game and reminded me of a very simple [thing=7993][/thing]. Card selection to move and first one to the finish line wins. Pretty great kids game and an older title so it is harder to come by. Not a game I have to play again, however.

Amazing how a game with no random elements is so chaotic. There IS strategy, there IS tactics, and better players will have a better chance of winning, but similarly a kid playing a card at 'random' from his hand could win, too.

RATING: 8
The rating is based on it being a family game.  The components for this game are amazing, readily drawing in both kids and adults alike.  The moment I brought this out, my 3 year old daughter immediately wanted to play and was able to win (partly due to luck but also partly due to skill) on her second try.  A great game that I'm sure will be played by my family alot in the future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A game with cutesy bits to appeal to the child in you, but with cutthroat play to appeal to the backstabber in you, interesting combination.
Placement of the obstacles, can lead to some serious bottlenecks. A lot of "take that" as the trailing players aim to knock the leaders back. If a player can break away from the pack...

The scramble for the lead is what makes the game - so I would play with 4-5 players - more enjoyable that way.

RATING: 5
I wanted a game specifically for my four year old daughter to learn that woudn't be boring for the rest of us. I read in some review about a variant way to play where instead of choosing which card to play next you could just randomly draw one, which we're using for now. My daughter loves the figures, likes to play, but also tries to bend the cards.

RATING: 6
Has elements of Ave Caesar/Q-Jet with the hand management aspect of movement.  The tweak is the ability to bump back horses you catch.  This can impact their future moves adding a modest about of competition to an otherwise straightforward racing game.  For example, one hand of cards is 21 spaces - which just lands the horse on the space past the first river space.  Bump a horse back 1 space and they now land in the river and will lose a turn on the last card of the first hand.  So players might be racing to stay behind so as to have more control over their and their opponent's horses.

More importantly for me - games play quickly and can be played with children in the family.  But also a decent filler for adults due to its light competition aspects (see above) and quick playing time.

RATING: 8
Outside of the obvious wow-factor that the bits induce, this is a solid little racing game.  It is light, fast and fun, but the game play is like drowning men scrambling on top of each other trying to get to air.  The game is nasty, but it is so short that it doesn't really matter if you get really worked.  You can't keep hurt feelings for too long as you can usually immediately screw someone else over quickly enough.  Occasionally, it is tough to catch the leader, but who cares, it plays in about 10 min. Plus, you really want to play for Win, Place and Show.

Sure, it's a kids game that I've only played with a mix of kids and adults, but I'd play this with adults anytime. A very quick racing game (maybe 20 minutes) with some intentional screwage, some unintentional screwage, and a tight game. Probably my favorite racing game. The only downfall is that the jockeys and horses are somewhat unstable and they are easily knocked over.

Nice little racing game with cool bits. Designed for kids but ought to be fun for anyone. I've only played it with two; I suspect it would be more fun with more players, but still play pretty quickly.

--- Summary ---
Players have the same deck of cards. They simultaneously choose/reveal a card. The lowest played advances their horse as many spaces (must avoid obstacles). If land on another player, send them backwards! When anyone crosses finish line, player furthest ahead wins!

This is a 9 with young kids.  7 with adults.  It rewards planning when played with fewer, and is highly chaotic with more, players.  The bits are fantastic, the rules simple, and it is playable easily by 5/6 year olds with adults.

This is actually quite a good game with, like in our case, two parents and a child--the parents can play to mess with each others' plans which leaves the child open to play without as much worry--though there is still enough of a chance to get accidentally popped back, that it begins to teach how to emotionally handle that situation.  It's also good for learning by observing how the adults trade swipes at each other all in good fun

RATING: 6
A race-game version of Get Bit!: simultaneously choose cards from small decks numbered  1-6, lowest moves first that many spaces, if you land on another horse they are displaced back to the next empty space. In the good variant, as in Get Bit! no-one moves in the case of a tie.

Enjoyable bluffing filler (with adults).

Giro Galoppo is a children's game that promises enough meaningful decisions to make it entertaining for adults.  Indeed, it is far better than Candyland!

RATING: 6
Could this be another great sleeper filler game?  I would imagine that playing it with kids (as it is intended to be played) would diminish the fun of the game somewhat, as most of the fun is derived from the tactical meanness of the game.  It is a very simple race game.  It is not a game I'd want to play on a frequent basis, but for the occasional filler, it works surprisingly well.  Quick, easy to teach and learn, and it allows for great interaction.  It is pretty expensive, but it also comes with great wooden pieces.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice bit of hand management. Some love the chunky, toy-like pieces, but I don't. In fact I resent them a little because it makes the game too expensive for me to buy to play with my kid.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1

Racing game that is great for a mix of kids and adults.  Everyone starts with a hand of cards 1-6 and plays them to move his horse.  There is a lot of "take that" to the gameplay because you move an opponent's horse backwards if you land on the same space.  This makes it more fun in my opinion, and also means it could even work as a quick filler for a group of adults.  However, I could see some kids getting upset by this game's mean streak.  I've only played with 3 and 4 so far and it works well at those numbers -- with a noticeable increase in conflict with the additional player.  I'm not sure how it would play with 2 -- it could be either more strategic and interesting or just too wide open with not enough jostling for position, but I expect the latter would be the case.  I expect that 5 players would make it too random and chaotic (which isn't necessarily bad for a kids game, but one of the values of GG is that it rewards thought and planning).

so far seems like a great game for 6 year old girl, and playable with parents. but game play is not immediately captivating. the theme and bits were, but after 1 play was content to put it away not grab for it again for a bit. 

my second play elevates the game. i may have played the movement rule wrong the first time, though it is simple. clever play is available, especially for the trailing horses to make up the lead, while clever card play for the front runners can keep them in the lead. fun! my 3 year old had no chance of understanding what was going on, and somehow managed to randomly keep picking the absolute wrong cards, but he still thought he had fun!

This adorable little game is pretty much Turfmaster Jr. It's an extremely elegant pure horse racing game with gorgeous production values and even has superficially similar mechanics. Each player has the same hand of movement cards, and everyone simultaneously and secretly selects one each turn. The trick is that the lowest numbers move first, and landing exactly on an opponents horse sends them to the back of the line, so the faster you try to go, the more likely you are to get pushed back. Unlike Turfmaster, the game is deliciously short.

Great game for kids.  My 6 rating however is based on my enjoyment as an adult.  This is a fun and simple horse racing game that kids can really enjoy. The pieces are great and the game has very nice visual appeal.  Each player has a hand of 6 cards numbered 1-6.  Everyone simultaneoulsy chooses a card from there hand.  When the cards are revealed, low number goes first.  If the player lands on a hazard, they go back to where they started from.  If a player lands on another player, they push them back one space.  When six rounds have been played players pick up their played cards and continue.  First and farthest across the finish line wins.

Giro Galoppo is actually quite fun and has delicious moments of double-think and seeing people get screwed. Seems to potentially have a runaway leader issue but considering the game lasts 10 minutes I don't think it's a concern. I'm thinking about getting this.

Only played with adults, so I can't say how this is with kids. Great fun; I like that it's a simple game with no random bits, yet there's enough entropy in the system that it's still unpredictable. The decisions could stand to be a little bit more interesting, as any given turn you usually only have 2-3 good options (if any), but then again, for a game that should only take about 20 minutes start to finish, it's still plenty of fun.

A kids racing game with lots of screwage? Yes, that's what it is, and it's lots of fun too! Can be played lightly by randomly selecting cards, or you can plan ahead and play the cards that punish your opponents the most. And wow, the wooden horses and riders that you race around the track are great!

The game is best with the variant where if multiple people play the same card, only the player in back gets to move. This variant, found at the end of the rules, gets rid of the runaway leader problem and adds even more screwage for the nastiest (in a good way) children's game that I've ever seen. When we all play our "6" card at once, letting the last place player leap to the front while everybody else wastes their turn standing still, it's hilarious for everybody.

Rating assumes playing with kids. With only adults, it's probably a 7.

RATING: 7
I like to compare the game to Ave Caesar: altough not the same it shares some elements of it and is in some elements even heavier then Ave Caesar. Each kid plays a card face down at the same time and then all are turned up together. The lowest number goes first followed by the higher and so on... Every kid has their own card deck and playing the game requires tough decisions (or random play  ). Obstacles and the rule that one spot can only be occupied by one horse makes the game even cut-throat sometimes.
The kids I played with really liked the game and by the kids I mean boys and girls. The horses with their riders have their own appeal and even if it's a longer game and quite complex for a kid's game I seldom saw one not liking it.
The material is top-notch with lots of wooden bits and nice graphics

Key elements:
simultanous card selection
hand management
anticipating your opponents moves

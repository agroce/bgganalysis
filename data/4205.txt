I got this shrinkwrapped off of Ebay for $10!!!  I wasn't even going to get into this line of what appears to be great games because of the cost, but heck I have a good start now.  Do I have the balls to remove the shrinkwrap?  I will think long and hard on that one. I didn't have the balls. I resold it on Ebay for only $175.  Oh well.

Another fine addition to the GCACW.  This one is a treat to play. The Peninsular Campaign offers a wide variety of operational plans and the allure of doing better than "Little Mac" lurks somewhere in every gamers heart :)

RATING: 10
UPDATE: I recently completed my first play of the full OtR campaign game, and I must say, it was a lot of fun. While the GCACW scenarios are fun, you really get a sense of the broad sweep of these campaigns when playing the campaign games.

That having been said, now that I've played it, and even though I enjoyed it a ton, I don't have a huge urge to play it again. The Union is really hamstrung here, with the rules for activations making it hard to move more than a unit or two at a time, which means it's really tough to avoid getting wrong-footed by the Confederates, and so it can be frustrating. Also, for a game of this size, there is a surprising amount of luck - the Confederates really need to get Lee into the game in order to countr-attack, but doing so relies on the dice coming up right. Our game also hinged on a critical turn of hot Union dice as they detached one corps from their supply lines to make an end-run, U S Grant style, to take Petersburg and outflank Norfolk. Possibly would have happened anyway, and it was the culmination of an unexpected Unioin maneuver, but the dice allowed me to do it unopposed where the Confederates would not unreasonably have expected to be able to counter.

But that's why we play wargames often, to see the unexpected like this, and I'm certainly not calling it a flaw in the game. I tremendously enjoyed doing a campaign game, but in future I'll do one of the smaller ones :)

See my comments on GCACW in general. I like On To Richmond a lot because it seems more "balanced" in terms of the capabilities of both sides - the Union cavalry is OK, and you aren't always trying to figure out how to deal with Jackson. Interesting situation, too, one of the more compelling campaign games, along with a good variety of scenarios. One of the best entries in the series IMHO, just behind Grant Takes Command and up there with Roads to Gettysburg & Stonewall in the Valley.

I've always had a strange fascination with McClellan.  Awesome in mechanics AND aesthetics, OTR is a masterpiece.  It captures Little Mac's case of the slows brilliantly.  Different landing areas other than just Ft. Monroe is very cool, but I still enjoy a good plod up those muddy roads past Williamsburg and Yorktown.

My favorite of the series and thats saying alot.  Well crafted scenarios.  Interesting campaign game.  Streamlined rules.  Had to deduct a small amount because the quality of art on the maps isn't up to the same high standards as the others, but thats still a league above most games.

This is a fascinating, engaging system that does a superb job of capturing the period. Excellent components and some of the most beautiful maps in wargaming. I own six of the games in this system and every now and then I lay out all the maps just to marvel at the view of the entire Eastern Theater at 1 miles per hex. Wow. This specific title has excellent replay value, no matter what you pay for it. The Seven Days scenario has several viable strategies for both sides and stands up to repeated gaming. The full campaign is very long, but well worth the time. It's a superb history lesson and an excellent game at the same time. My only knock is that the rules seem a bit convoluted and make the system seem more difficult than it is. Once you get past that hump though, you find a truly elegant system. Great stuff.

The GCACW series is simply fantastic - very elegant and playable rules, a mile or two per hex, and division level units.  Playing the game just feels like you&#039;re reading a history of the Civil War, even if you are rolling a dice (!) for movement.  Brilliant series of games.

Gets the 10 for being GCACW but it also deserves a 10 for being that game where players can feel why McClellan did what he did. GCACW is a game of player morale, not unit morale. The system creates situations where players can get so caught up with their own constraints that they don't see their opponents having their own problems. Absolutely brilliant game.

At one time I had all 7 of the Avalon Hill's Civil War Series.  I ended up selling all 7. The last one I sold was On To Richmond, because I felt it was the best.  Some scenarios were pro-Confederate and others were pro-Union.

RATING: 7
It's my least favorite of the GCACW and still rates well. My beef is the map itself; that is, the coloring, which obscures the landing hexes and the outline of the hexes themselves. Still, it plays well, and if one wants a challenge, be MacClellan. You're more like Lincoln, trying to make something happen. Be careful of the Chickahominy Swamp; trying to get through that could get you munched by them Rebs.

This 1998 sixth game in the GCACW Series by AH is a delight to play. The counters and maps are wonderful as is the easy to follow rules. Two army's maneuvering to strike one another makes this an exciting game from start to finish. A great game for learning history, or just having fun.

State of the Art game on the Peninsular Campaign conducted by little "Mac" Napoleon -- Major General George B. McClellan. Great series with great production values!! It is about simulating all the campaigns of the American Civil War (ACW) at operational level. The series has a beautiful and natural flowing game system with the right balance between playability and realism. The rulebook is so informative and well written that every game mechanics is so logically explained that you hardly have to memorise them. The rulebook alone worths the whole game price. A day by day historical account and insightful analysis of the campaign with hex numbers of the key battle location and cities/ towns is included. Not even to mention the extraordinary historical game maps, useful summary of tables in the player aid cards, portrait of every major leaders participating in the campaign, lots of scenarios etc. Key features include: variable movement of battle force, leader initiatives, morale, force march, train movement, breastworks and fortifications, hidden force strength, logging of ammunition level, flank attack, supply and foraging, etc. Plus, all the game maps in the series can be joined to recreate virtually the entire conflict in the eastern theatre!! The Peninsular campaign is, before the arrival of Grant, the most important campaign in the East by the Union.  The best game series about the ACW so far in the history of wargame. Hats off to the veteran wargame designer Joseph Bolkoski!!

I love a game that combines historical reality, playability, and education.  This has all three.  Beautifully illustrates what McClellan "may" had been able to achieve if he had been more audacious.  The GCACW series is by far "THE BEST" games out there.

RATING: 9
1st class components, particularly the maps, and lots of rules, but in all honesty this is a really BORING game.  Slugging one's way up a heavily forested penninsula is just not much fun, although the game provides many interesting alternative strategies.  Compared with other games in the series (except Grant Takes Command, which is equally boring) this game moves at a snail's pace.  What I really love about the GCACW is its recreation of operational level movement, which is almost completely lacking here.  

Upgraded after several plays of the campaign. The campaign game adds so much more - particularly the naval and amphibious rules and the alternative starting points, Hopefully this gem will be reprinted soon so those who missed it will have a second chance.

Probably the best pre-20th century operational system. Ignore the weaklings who claim that OTR is slow. The real objective in this game, and in all GCACW games for that matter, is not to march around the map, it is to destroy the enemy in a decisive battle (nowithstanding the fact that that result was not achieved historically - it is what they were actually trying to do).

The Great Campaigns of the American Civil War series is solid gold in my book. I find the Civil War fascinating, but my main interest is European history. So it isn't just the period covered that makes it great for me. The games in the series are examples of wargames at their finest. The maps are very detailed and look fantastic, and the games are complex enough to give fine detail to the campaigns but not so much that they require huge amounts of time to play. They have a great mix of playability and meatiness. The historical simulation of the battles is excellent. All of these features combine to give players the needed substance to experience how these campaigns played out.

The GCACW series is the best operational games on the Civil War. The alternating nature of individual movements allows for concentrations and reaction to the concentration. The system plays pretty cleanly. 
The Peninsula campaign is fascinating. The large Union forces ooze closer to Richmond while the smaller more mobile Confederates look for an opening. 
Early the Union has the advantage since the terrain is restrictive later the terrain opens up giving the Confederates a better shot.

This is the best game in the Great Campaigns of the American Civil War Series. It is also one of the most complicated second only to Grant Takes Command, but it is well worth the effort. Great basic scenarios and an advanced game that is tense and unpredictable. If I could only keep one game from my collection this would be it.

The scenarios are a little longer, and have more special rules than others I've played in the series, but they are wonderful nevertheless. 

Good fighting withdrawal scenarios (Johnston's Retreat and Retreat to the James [Malvern Hill]), slugfests (Gaines Mill--from Skirmisher 1, Seven Pines and Warwick Line) and a mini-campaign (Seven Days).

The Confederates have a bit more of a handicap than in other games--their forces are separated under numerous commanders, which allows the player to experience Lee's frustrations in coordinating offensives.  The Union is hampered by the frequent inability to move all of its divisions within a particular corps, owing to special activation rules.

Fantastic stuff.  Worth every one of the incredibly large number of pennies I paid.

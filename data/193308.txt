I can't rate it more than the first version - IMO "2" as standalone game it is weaker, as the locations are more different from each other. 
...I like it anyway.

If you enjoy the OG you will enjoy this. The new locations are fine, but the inclusion of a second spy is awesome. It flips the game on its head a bit as a spy is playing dual roles, trying to ferret out his nemesis as well as dupe the group.

Very disappointed there are still no player aids though. Huge oversight in my opinion.

RATING: 7
One of the small number of games that allows up to 12 players, and is also a lot of fun. Plenty of social deduction. Lots of laughs. I recommend for ages 12 and up, as many children may not know much about some of the locations and it can result in poor questions and answers, or bog down gameplay. Kids tend to take much longer thinking up questions and answers, or they just give vague questions and answers that do not result in useful information.

In my opinion, this game is best when played by 7-10 adults. The more questions you can squeeze in the better, to accumulate useful information about who the spy/spies may be.

A very fun party game. I love playing with the optional 'roles' at each location for added hilarity.

I haven't played with the actual scoring though. It seems unnecessary, just play round to round.

My biggest gripe is maintaining the secrecy of the location on setup is very hard and requires a very specific organization that can be a bit hard to maintain during play. You also need to be able to reliably replace the location you've just played or the spy or spies can use process-of-elimination after a few rounds to guess their location.

It's a very quick social deduction game with a lot of humour that plays many. There's not a lot of those and this game fits a niche when you don't have time to play a longer social deduction game. It's a lot of fun to role-play characters and ask stupid questions, but some characters and locations are better than others and it requires the right group. I also like that there's plenty of zip-lock bags included and you can play as a cat!

Initial Rating: 7.5 (February 2017)

I really like Spyfall, so it is no wonder I also like Spyfall 2, furthermore if you take into account that both games are VERY similar. 

Spyfall 2 is not an expansion, but a standalone game. The rules continue to be very easy to explain, you can do it under 2 minutes and playtime is around 1 minutes or less.

I love that the game comes with 20 new locations (although I expected 30) and you can mix them with the ones from the base game, however, I´m not sure how to do that just yet. I haven’t read the rules and both games have a different number of cards per location, so it is very easy for the dealer to know if the location is from Spyfall or Spyfall 2 or for the spy if he gets the new art (female spy). 

With the new edition of the game, up two 12 players can play now and there is now two spies instead of one. The spies can play ignorant of the other spies or knowing each other!

I still prefer to play it on the range of 6-8 players, but I already played it as a twelve player game and we all had fun! In fact I cannot think of another game (other than Time´s up!)  that handles 12 players so well, this is a huge advantage.

As with its parent game, it doesn’t come with player´s aids and they are a must! There are some excellent aids here on BGG.

Bottom line, I like Spyfall 2 because it is a great party game, it plays fast, it is easy to teach, it can play up to 12 players and I love the bluffing required to win it. It is VERY group dependent though, I have a couple of friends who despise the game, but it is a keeper for me.

Spyfall is played over several rounds, and at the start of each round all players receive cards showing the same location — except that one player receives a card that says "Spy" instead of the location. Players then start asking each other questions — "Why are you dressed so strangely?" or "When was the last time we got a payday?" or anything else you can come up with — trying to guess who among them is the spy. The spy doesn't know where he is, so he has to listen carefully. When it's his time to answer, he'd better create a good story!

Spyfall 2 features the same gameplay as Spyfall with two important changes: (1) Enough location cards are included that the upper player count is now twelve instead of eight, and (2) two spies can be found at each location, giving all of the non-spy players more of a challenge when it comes to tracking down who doesn't belong.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not my favorite hidden role game, but maybe that's due to my gaming group. This game, I think out of most hidden role games, requires the most roleplaying to get the most out of it. The first few games my group was asking very concrete questions as if this were an Eye Spy kind of game, which I think is wrong. You really need to get into the head of the characters and locations to make this truly laugh-out-loud and fun. 

Like I said, not my favorite, but it will see action at my table from time to time for sure!

The double spy twist was a nice addition that didn't totally upend the game.  What we especially noted were that the variety of locations was a bit more specific.  Actually liked that this puts pressure on the non-spies to be clever with the Q & A portion, since it's more likely that spies will figure out what location you're in.

The location sheets is pretty small, and hard to take in everything in time, especially if you are the spy. The vague question asking rules, timing rules, and the accusation rules didn't really make it all that fun, and one player in particular had a tough time with coming up with questions and answers. Also difficult to roleplay in some cases which makes playing this harder. A nice idea that did not come off so well for me.

This is a very fun and deceptively tricky game. It's very quick to learn but does require multiple play throughs so everyone can remember all the locations. The roles at the location definitely add an awesome twist to the game, especially when players don't know their own roles. My group is not the best at thinking of questions to ask each other but we still love playing this game.

Light deduction party game. Group dependant, but really shines through if you are creative with the wording on your questions and answers. Can be used as a standalone, but I find it better as an expansion for Spyfall. Most of the locations are more outlandish (such as the U.N.) I would recommend Spyfall ahead of Spyfall 2 unless you like the option of being able to play more players. 

Still requires you to make your own player aid with locations :(

Want to note here I that I think this version is actually better than the original, as the lower number of locations makes it easier for new spies to win the game and makes it much more balanced with groups of a mixed experience level with Spyfall.

Still needs player aids (I have uploaded mine to the BGG page for this game)

FEEL the chaos !!! Totally Underrated Game. Yearn for the Contractor, you're gonna need it if you find yourself trailing!!!
Treat this as a WAR GAME and you will be fine. Just keep up with the least/most valuable blocks (use 2 custom markers) and the cards will work themselves out. It's really that simple.

RATING: 6.75
My experience with this is marred by a few card-related issues:

1. Cards in different packs (but same deck) are cut to different sizes. Thus, shuffling is a bear.

2. Cards are somewhat brittle. Folded the corners on two cards during a game by accident. This has never happened before. The material is a bit too stiff.

3. Cards have an odd coating and quality about them that causes them to stick. 

The game is fine, but I spent more time messing with the problems with cards (again, QUITE uncharacteristic), that they simply "got in the way." :(

We'll see what sleeving does for this one. I think it's mandatory, if I had to guess at this point.

Somewhat chaotic...and extremely AP prone with a long downtime. However, playing with the right people I don't mind much since you get a break for chatting in between turns, but would probably not touch this game with total strangers. Haven't made up my mind as of yet since I did enjoy my first play, but I'm leaning towards a 7 on this one. Will update.

Yes, it is long and this is probably the one quality I hold against it. But I think what I enjoy the most is the way the game develops over a play. It truly does build up into a crowded city with price and value fluctuating and wonderful events wrecking and rewarding everyone. The vocations are thematic and strategically important, the political offices are a joy and offer large end game points - and it plays very easily albiet driving you to complete analysis vapor lock. Highly replayable - this one is a winner for me. I just hope I can get it to the table!

Big disapointment. Dominant species is one of my favorite games and, as many, I had big expectations about this game, but the game takes too long, is fidly and too random. I know that randoness can be ameliorated and the focus of the game may change with experience, but I am not sure whether I will give the game a second opportunity.

I love to play it (vote 8) but.... shocked by the excessive presence of the Event cards (vote 4). Maybe they do not affect the final result overall but to play 2, 3 or 4 Events in a row moving money forth and back to the bank and other players in the same phase  brings me back to some 70s games. I would not allow more than 1 Event for End of player turn. Said that, the game is fun and interesting.... but.... in our game we saw the last player never able to recover and the first player gaining more and more advantage (vote 5).....

Plays long than it should due to the mathiness but does an adequate job of simulating the building of a city.  Events limit long term planning potential but don't significantly impact my enjoyment.  The contractor is a forced catch up mechanism that keeps players involved when they would otherwise probably be discouraged that there is no chance for them to win.

Rating based on initial play and is subject to change.

Lives up to the promise of being simpler and shorter than Dominant Species. 

Very volatile game. I went from dead last (zero prestige) to the lead in a short time with a few key buildings. Won at an end of turn were I gained an office that provided the margin.

Too much tactics for a 3-5 hour game.  Turn time got longer and longer - not because people were considering intracacies of their choices, but because it became harder to scan for what was possible due to the increasing complexity of calculating costs.  Also, it is heavy in event cards and good things/bad things happening simply because you are in the right place/have the right role at the right time.  All of those features are fine in a much shorter game.

I'm not a Eurogames fan. This one reminds me a bit of Le Havre with the multiple decks. It is nicely designed and the always shifting value of the blocks makes the game somehow unpredictable. The system of elections is the thing I like the most, because it allows players to change position of power in the game. It is a nice family game after all. I'm not sure I want to keep it though.

I'm sort of comfortable leaving it here. Like many others around here, I consider Dominant Species an excellent game.

Urban Sprawl's been getting dinged quite a bit more.

I don't mind the crazy randomness. I mean, a part of it is just knowing what can occur and also knowing what can best position you best for the events.

What does bother me about this game, though, is that it's not nearly as straightforward as DS. The rules are generally fine (not DS-level awesome, though) but it's way way more fiddly. And it's not like DS isn't fiddly. Keeping track of dominance is something you always have to be cognizant about (and it's best, for fairness' sake, to keep them up to date so somebody doesn't tip strategy by asking about dominance). But highest value and lowest value lots ... keeping track of neighborhood rule ... legal placements, etc. are all overhead.

Additionally, the buildings, really, the core of the game, only give you some semi-thematic one-shot and then it's just some cardboard on the board. You've got a middle school next to condos catty-corner to some factory, etc. and the only thing involved is what zone type, and only when placing the building. And then also the buildings are nothing else but some form of an area majority thing.

Also, the permits. They're one of the key parts of making a building, sure, but it's just really not such a big deal getting them. Yeah, I get that you need a certain number of permits, and they have to be of a certain type, and that you can discard permits for cash. But permits are overbalanced such that some of them are pretty much purely "discard for cash" and others are essentially worthless for cash, but they've got lots of permits on them. I get that it's for balance reasons so that every card is useful, but it makes the decision of what to do with a permit uninteresting. And then otherwise, the permits are basically indistinguishable ... just blah ... and it feels overwrought to have this big AP selection mechanism to choose them ... it's just another sort of uninteresting decision.

And, of course, all of the event cards. As others have said, it's a bit much when you get several events in a row, really slowing down the gameplay and changing the game state so dramatically and adding that chaos into the game. Like I said, the chaos itself doesn't really rankle me, but maybe more how it's added to the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like the general idea behind this game. The interesting theme is well implemented, each building has unique abilities and the various events are very thematic. High levels of interaction, great production values and a huge board. I really like the politician titles. They make the players compete with each other for the elections. The prolem is that the game is quite mathy and there is a lot of downtime (ohh, the horror). After you finish your turn you can't actually plan for your next turn cause you don't know what buildings and/or permits will be available to you. You just have to wait. Dont try this game with 4 players. I heard people complaining about the events being too random and chaotic but I disagree.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Was hopeful after one play, which was very much a learning game. However, after three plays it seems to me there's far too much randomness in the cards: what turns up when can be game-changing. I imagine one could overcome some of the randomness by playing this a lot and really getting a feel for the many ways the cards could play out, but realistically, for a game of this length I'm not going to play it enough. Not as good as I hoped... would rather play Dominant Species.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Managing chaos - this would be the most concise description of Urban Sprawl. The first few turns make a lot of sense, but with more buildings in play and the role assignment, it becomes increasingly difficult to optimize - which is a good thing. Then come the event cards which change ... well... pretty much everything. I won my first game without knowing what I've done right or wrong.

On the up side, the game is fun, but not typically GMT Games fun but haha fun :)

I will definitely play it again, but I won't bother to strategize so much, just go with the flow and enjoy the game, which I must confess it's quite difficult.

This is the follow up game to the brilliant Dominant Species?  

Yipes, this game is a major disappointment to fans of Dominant Species.  

Many, many, many, many (too many?) event cards make this game fun, I suppose, for gamers who like to sit around for hours and have random card draws send them on a wild and unpredictable ride.  

But for those who like games that reward intelligent, thoughtful play, this game is REALLY annoying.  Random events are augmented by randomized payouts of prestige and money. What? Why? Replayability? Unpredictablitily? 

As some have said, this is definitely an example of a game with some interesting mechanics that adds up to an experience that is far less than the sum of its parts.

Oh well, time to go back to Dominant Species.

Need to play more to figure out my feelings.
Known so far, I would never play it with 2 players again, and 3 does seem to be the optimal number.  
There are some large complaints about randomness leveled against this game, and I have seen parts of this myself, however I feel they are a very 'beginner' observation.  They appear, on the surface, to have more effect on the game than they likely do.

Really, really wanted to like this one, but it's just too hard to bring out these days.

This is a REALLY fun game.  Yes there is chaos.  Yes there are twists and turns.  Yes there is fate.  BUT you can also make your own luck, and the decisions you make significantly improve your chances of winning the game,  It does, take at least one game play to understand the strategy.  I really like the story-lines that accompany this game (like deliberately puttingthe landfill by your neighbor, owning almost all the towns elected officials etc).  I am now of the opinion you can't go wrong with a Chad Jensen game.

Initial rating which may go up once I make more sense of what is actually going on. Seems to be a strategic masterpiece which requires careful organization and planning within a semi chaotic environment. A game where the strategy is not obvious from the start but may take several games to form and try out. Either way, it is another great experience.

I'm a fan of Dominant Species and the whole Combat Commander series, both from the same designer, but I'm not sure about this one yet.

Some are complaining that the events add too much chaos to the game. I just find them too annoying, specially when the ones on the planning deck start coming, one after the other. So annoying that we are not using them anymore. It's just not fun.

The basic mechanics of the game (acquiring permits and choosing the best buildings to build) seems OK.
Urban Sprawl is definitely a very tactical game. Long term strategies have no place here.

Very good game.  The components are top notch - even the paper money is very high quality.  Theme doesn't matter as much, but there's a lot to think about and, despite having quite a bit of downtime, there's still some scoring to be done between turns.  I like it - it's maybe a bit too long, but a good strategic exercise.

I really like this game and I'm equally worried that eventually I will discover that I hate it because it is too difficult to plan ahead.

RATING: 4
A very negative first impression. The problem was that I felt the game was not so much chaotic as uncontrollable: you have a general idea of what's going to happen (even if not when) and you know what you need to take advantage, but often there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. 

To give an example from my game, there are lots of events that give 1 point and 1 gold to the player with the media vocation, and its ownership is established after the inital purchase round. So one of us got it, and kept it the whole game, getting lots of bonuses, because there was no way for the rest of us to take it from him. Finally a building shows up that allows it, but is immediately removed due to a deck change...

So it felt that above the randomness of the cards (which I'm ok with for the most part), the control structure of the game, particularly the property prices, is too rigid and hard to control. Its changes pop up not only at random points, but also too seldomly, and often favour the same person because there's no chance to change things.

Maybe some of these problems will be solved with more experience with the game and a better idea of good strategies. But after such a bad first impression, I honestly have no wish to play it again.

I am absolutely adoring this game.  I have played 3 times (well, 2½; the first one was aborted) and I like it more each time I play.

Before my first play I was reading/watching reviews and came across the nice and comprehensive one from doubtofbuddha (http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/719051/urban-chaos) in which one conclusion he draws is that there is too much chaos in the game for him.  This review caused me some concern, making me wonder whether it would be too chaotic for me.  After these initial plays, I can most definitely say that it is not TOO chaotic for me.

The Metropolis deck does have some crazy powerful stuff going on in it.  But it seems clear to me that familiarity with the decks is going to yield a huge advantage in planning.  I'm already seeing some trends in the cards, like the fact that the Mayor is probably not the best politician to have in the City deck or the fact that those powerful Metropolis cards (as well as many City cards) require 3 or 4 permits.

The flow of the game is very smooth and turns seem to go by pretty quickly after the initial shock of available choices wears off.  Though I haven't played with 4 players, looking at the differences between 2 and 3 makes me think that the more players you have, the less strategic/more tactical the game will become.  This could lead to some analysis paralysis among those inclined.  I will also say that the staggering number of things that can happen at the end of each player's turn -- because of payouts and events -- can make it easy to lose track of whose turn it is.  A computerized version of the game would probably make that go much faster, but I would probably lose that close, tactile feel of what is going on in the game.

Each time I've finished playing the game so far, I've had that urge to play again as soon as possible.  This is the same feeling I've had after first playing some of my favorite games, like Le Havre, Race for the Galaxy, and Twilight Imperium.

My "9" rating for this game is provisional (I feel like it could definitely go up) and is relative (to my other games).

I've played this with my 10-year-old son all three times; he's beaten me twice.  I think experience will likely turn the tide there in my favor (since I don't foresee him doing the deeper analysis that I find myself doing), but the actual mechanics of the game are uncomplicated enough for him to play with almost no guidance from me.

Some notes I'll put here about strategy pointers that I want to share when I teach the game, as far as where to build:
- Try to build next to other buildings of the same color.
- It's very important to have the most valuable buildings in a color (at least by the time the City deck opens), for the politicians.
- It's very important to have the most buildings in a given row, for payouts.
- It's good, but somewhat less important, to have the most buildings in a given color, for certain events.
- It's important to grab any contract that will let you place one of the wealth/prestige payout dots.
- It's probably a good idea not to spend all of your permits all the time.  (This is the idea I'll be trying in the next game.)

In short: Fantastic.  I love this game and have no regrets about the ~$60 I dropped on it.

If possible, I'm liking it even more now than I did three weeks ago.  I've now squeezed 7 (6½) plays in; for a game that takes over two hours, that's an impressive feat in my schedule.

This has the potential to be one of my top games.  The feeling I have about it, the excitement to play again and again, is one that I've only had with a couple of games previously, Twilight Imperium and Le Havre; I considered TI my #1 game for years, and consider Le Havre to be so now.  So US is in good company.

The way I've jiggered my ratings is to have a more-or-less sequential list of games, using tenths of a point to differentiate them and with only 2 "10"s: one for a heavy game and one for a light game.  Until I resequence them again, though, I'm putting US as my third 10.

19-11-2012: El mejor ejemplo que me hace pensar que la mitad de la gente no debería tener derecho a opinar. Se le ha achacado que no está a la altura del Dominant Species o del Combat Commander... Pues a mí me ha encantado, es decir no me parece una maravilla perfecta porque existe mucho down-time entre jugadores. Para mitigar este aspecto se me ocurre jugarlo como mucho a tres jugadores. Solucionado. Tres horas de partida que pasan en un riau!.

También me molesta el hecho de ser incontrolable totalmente. Es decir, que me deja la misma sensación que El Grande, hacer una jugada estupenda y que de repente alguien te mueva cubitos, o números o incluso te robe tus edificios... pero bueno, asumiendo desde el principio que el juego es así, no creo yo que sea mucho más problemático, la verdad...

Por lo demás el juego es estupendo, destila buen rollo, componentes más que perfectos, mecánicas estupendas (me chifla que con un vistazo a la carta de permiso de construcción sepas perfectamente todo lo que te ofrece (y ofrece mucho!)), me gusta que se pueda preparar con malicia un turno medio malo a tu compañero, las cartas con sucesos, lo pensado que está el juego, dificilísimo quedarse completamente descolgado... Un juego maravilloso.

El juego no transmite la sensación de estar construyendo una ciudad, pero hay momentos en los que soy uno de los ciudadanos de la urbe, esperando que se reparta el periódico con las últimas noticias, mientras apoyado en las vallas de una obra, veo como la bola de hierro destruye edificios sin compasión... Ya lo dijo Freddie Mercury, HAMMER TO FALL!!!!!

US is an experience game.  The game plays you as much as you play the game.  The journey is absorbing.  I undoubtedly had more fun being last and getting the two extra (8) Action Points and the abilities to build over my opponent's plots.  There are  some major swings in the third deck.  Each game is likely to be different due to the card mix.  Happy to play again.  Probably preferred to CJ's previous release Dominant Species, even though I much prefer DS's theme.

I'm not sure why I didn't care for this game too much the 1st time.  Maybe I just didn't get the feel of building a city.  I just felt like I was chasing after points.

I'll give it another try someday!

RATING: 6.5
When commenting this game, the first thing to point out is: it is not Dominant Species!
While both share a great degree of the sensation of riding a wild beast with very few control on it, Urban Sprawl seems much more random than Dominant Species. This is due mainly to the fact that in each game only portions of the decks will be used (in DS the smaller deck is also the "clock" of the game, so each card will see play in each game). Both US and DS are almost tactical with no chance to long-term plan, but the wild ride in Dominant Species is player-driven, while in Urban Sprawl is game-driven.
Having said that, I feel that Urban Sprawl is a very good and enjoyable game, although it is less enjoyable as a competition thant as a fun game. It is a game in which players need to minimize their risk as well as manage the chaos. I like the theme very much, and I will gladly play it again to explore its recesses.
Initial tentative rating is a 7.5.

Update september 8th, 2013: the randomness and fiddlyness are not problems for me, but the game is too long. If the gameplay time was half than what it is, I'd play more often and rate it higher. New rating is 6.5.

I can recognize Dominant Species was a good design, even if I don't care for it. this one is 'objectively' bad - huge downtime, absurdly chaotic, HUGE points swings, greatly random, and in the end most likely will be decided just by who got to move last. there are some good ideas, but there is too much bad in here to ever replay.

This is a really fun game, for about 1/4 of the game.  The other 3/4 of the game you spend waiting for other players to complete their turns, calculating building points, and stewing about how some completely random event just destroyed your best building and scored your opponent 30 points.  This game is way too long for this much randomness and down time.

Urban Sprawl ("US") has a city building theme and unique mechanics.  US will not be for everyone as there is a great deal of chaos and direct conflict.  It may also be a little long (3 hour playing time) for many players.  That being said it is a real brain burner and I enjoy playing it as a two player game.

Edit - As a four player game I find there is too much down time and it is difficult for players to plan ahead.  Further the chaos that feels manageable with two players feels random with four.  I did not love it as a four player game.

I wanted to like this game so badly. I'm not a huge fan of dominant species, but the idea of a complex city builder was (is!) alluring. It's a very simple game with layers and layers of cosmetic complexity, little to no control over what is happening and too much downtime (even in a 2 players game).

It won't stay on my shelf.

This is easily the worst game I have played in years. Any decisions made during play are easy, and irrelevant. Random events during the excessive downtime between turns have a far greater impact on your score than any move you make in your turn -- Roullette is less random.

I played once with 4, and I literally spent 2.25 out of 3 hours wandering the game room watching other people play better games. Yes, the downtime between turns is completely oppressive. There is NOTHING to do that helps your score in any way, Then, it's your turn again and you solve the puzzle, make the moves and turn it over to the automated cleanup where random events will often as not undo the moves you just made. Then you get to sit by while your opponents suffer the same fate.

This game helps answer the question "what if Settlers of Catan was more complex?" You'd get unplayable dreck...and name it Urban Sprawl.

I really enjoyed this the deeper I got into. Cannot wait to play it even more to see if it has sticking power.

Game gets better with repeated plays; thus the higher scoring.

RATING: 8
Mechanics are fairly easy but the levels of strategies and choices each turn combined with the need to maintain a constant level of flexibility make this a much deeper game as you get into it. Down time seems to be an issue but I use it to examine options that are available without getting too attached to any card until my turn actually arrives.

RATING: 5.5
I don't know. This should have been, should be a good game but it felt too long, played way too chaotically, had too much downtime.

Sure, there are some clear tactics and there is the obvious PR element of "compete with the person on your left not the one on your right", so it could be really enjoyable at about half the length and with about half the "event cards", but the overwhelming weight of the chaos and the temptation for every player to drift into AP just drove the fun right out. :(

I love city building games.  This one has meat, an excellent look, and a lot going on.  It's a game of surprise moves and screwage (later in the game).  The first play might seem random but I would call this chaos management.  I can see after some more plays, you know what to expect from the event cards.  Hell, even during the first play, you are reshuffling the planning deck so you see some of the same event cards coming up.  I know now that Media can get you little points all the way through the game if you can hang onto it.  It's area control and tile laying.  I have to play it again, soon.

A quote that I think is appropriate for this game:  Luck is where preperation meets opportunity.

Update: pushed up to a 9.  The last game was so different than the others.  Plots got expensive very quickly.  Huge commercial district.  Very fun.  After five plays you know what cards, for the most part, are in the deck and you can plan appropriately.

A perfect example of thoughtful, expansive, tight game design.  I definitely need to explore more of Chad's games to find out what else I've been missing out on!

I think the event cards are pretty chaotic and end up determining the winner.  perhaps we just need to understand all of the cards beforehand so we avoid certain at-risk situations.

For the love of God, stop saying 'chaos' and 'Urban Sprawl' in the same sentence.  Sure, there's some randomness in how the cards come out... Through the Ages has randomness with how the cards come out!  Agricola has randomness with how the cards come out (and you might not see all of the occupations in a game)!  If the game were 30 minutes shorter, there would not be a single comment about 'chaos'!

Phew!  Now onto my comments.  Another hit from Chad Jensen, who is making me want to try out one of his Combat Commander games, despite being disinterested in war games.  It has a really good theme of city management, with individual players falling into different roles/vocations depending on what kind of buildings the build.  I'm a little disappointed that the buildings lose their identity after being built (while retaining their type), but that's really an aesthetic thing.  Brilliant game.

RATING: 4
I love Combat Commander and Dominant Species so maybe my low rating is the result of very high expectations.  I love chaos and tactical games, but this is way too chaotic for it's length.  You can't really plan and the game can swing heavily at the end- it feels like there's really very little control.  This would be fine if the game were an hour or less, but not in a game of this length.

Urban Sprawl is tough to rate and comment after only 1 play, but I'll give my impression so far. Great production value! The gameplay is interesting and very tactical with some subtle strategy at first, but I think it's deeper than some people give it credit for.

I think the "randomness" of the events mirrors well the theme of urban planning, and I've noticed that the most valuable property is rewarded and the least valuable property is typically penalized. The roles also played a bigger role (no pun intended) then I first expected and really have a long-game effect.

Some thought it was too chaotic or too mean to the person in last place but I think a lot of that either fits thematically or can be fixed with an adjustment in strategy. There was quite a bit of AP in the game (again no pun intended) so a 4-player game dragged a bit. I defenitely think it will be better with 3.

Ok game. Wanted something a bit more concrete on the
subject matter, but this one allows everyone to stay in
the game. But, that also means that the tactic of hiding
in second (or lower) place is the best move - at least 
within groups that aren't experts at the game. Too much
effort to pay attention to all the buildings and options
for my tastes, but (because of the ease of catch-up), you
don't really have to work too hard at early position. At
least it's less painful than DS, and doesn't have any 
ridiculous topical contradictions.

Still, the kind of randomness and the like would
be much better suited to a game which really felt like
you were building a city.

cards (as they slide down in cost), funny card wording, catch-up mechanisms,
election roundel, etc. Be interested in variants that reduce/distribute the
chaotic luck of placing/moving the row markers. 
Definitely one for many replays!

RATING: 7
A decent game that, like Seyfarth's Airships, particularly suffers from comparisons with it's more illustrious predecessor due to being both lighter and, consequently, a tad more random and less gamerly.  While the randomness isn't as bad as it appears - specialisation is rewarded, though there can be timing issues with that - it does mean that the scope for planning is limited and your turns are primarily reactive and tactical - driven by the cards that are then available.  The result is that it's a bit on the long side for what it is.

A pretty neat design that almost ends up being as much of an experience game as anything.  There is some control in the area majority portion of the game, but overall, the game is very chaotic.  On your turn, you build whatever works best for you at the time, and hope it pays over later, but with nothing guaranteed and not a whole lot of  planning ahead.

It helps that the rules are actually very simple, which was surprising to me for a Chad Jensen game.  It's definitely the most accessible of his designs, while still maintaining a good variety of options and scoring opportunities.

That probably doesn't sound like a ringing endorsement, but I did find the whole exercise to be pretty darn fun!  In the end, I wasn't sure if half of my decisions ending up mattering a ton, but all I knew was I had fun making them and seeing what happened!

I can't decide on this game - all I know at the moment is that your moves look very obvious as your play your turn. Usually there are only certain places you can build due to having only a certain amount of money available and certain permits and certain buildings. The three combine to mean there is not as much to do as you though you might be able to do. I would however, like to play it again as I may have missed some of the gameplay. Just seems like the game decides who wins and not good gameplay. 1 Play

There are a lot of things I like about this game... and one thing I don't.  It takes too long.  I've played it a couple of times and one time (3 player) it lasted the 180 minutes advertised.  The other two were four and SIX hours.

There is a lot of randomness, but I don't mind that too much as it ebbs and flows.  Some of it can be controlled by being willing to spend big AP on the right cards, but it still happens.  Since all the cards come through the channel, everybody knows what's going to be played... eventually.

Yes, I'll play it again, but next time I'd like the shorter variant.  In addition, there are a number of spreadsheets that allow tracking of the value of the blocks, which would be helpful to know them at a glance.

Ugh.

So, like many, I played Dominant Species and loved it. Then saw this game was arriving and was excited about the theme. Then I got it as a gift. Then started reading the reviews and the number of criticisms about the game. then played it... ugh.

Although Urban Sprawl has some things going for it (the theme, some interesting building placement, the politician roles, etc.) its critical flaws really undermine the whole game. Specifically, waiting for someone to spend 6 APs and select cards on a turn, knowing that you cannot plan for your own turn, is pretty brutal. I would dread playing this with four players. Also, the sheer randonmess of events that ultimately (and mundanely) pay out cash or VPs is very ho-hum. I feel like the decks are playing the game, and I'm just watching... for 2+ hours. When people start building stuff, and I don't care what the cards say or even what building it's supposed to be, then it's time to set this sucker on the "for trade" list.

Update: ...and that's exactly what happened. Traded this away in a math trade for Commands and Colors: Ancients.

RATING: 7
I want to like this game more but the chaos is not a good thing in this game.  The rich get richer and it can be tough to catch up to the leader.  Though a random event can put you back in the lead, it has more to do with luck than strategy.  Only using half of each deck lends to great variety between games, but it also seems to unbalance things: the cards that might be used to tackle the leader may just never come up.  The random ending borrows from Dominant Species but again is too random compared to that game.  At least DS still allows you to react and plan for the end as someone has to actually execute it as an action.

I will keep playing because I want to like this and I hope some strategies develop.  But it is not quite the game I had hoped it would be.

RATING: 4
Update: The more I think about this game, the more it bothers me. Rating 7->4. I made a list of the issues:

1) Negligible ability to plan anything beyond current turn. (And yes, this is what makes the time between turns painful, but I have no problem with the time in and of itself. Downtime doesn't bother me in games I find interesting.)
2) Events that target (for better or worse) specific industries. Can you imagine in DS if there were events that came up that gave huge bonuses to whomever controlled the most forest?
3) The need to really know all the events to have any prayer control. This is mainly because unlike DS, where you see the cards which WILL take place...
4) ...in US the events happen when they are revealed, with no chance for anyone to react before they take effect. Typical event: whoever has the most/least/best/worse gains/loses money and/or prestige. 
5) So many different events, which benefit/hurt specific industries, and yet of the three contract decks (the most impactful events), you only burn through about half the deck of each. (And the events are balanced to all industries anyway.)
6) No idea when the events are going to fire. There could be none between players' turns, there could be 5.
7) The ability to place new scoring numbers is too strong. And it happens as the result of an event, so again, you can't see it coming. Whoever gets to do it simply places it where they have a clear majority. And they will always have a clear majority somewhere.
8) The Contractor catch-up mechanism is annoying. The ability for the player in last place on the prestige (vp) track to be able to bulldoze other players' buildings seems like a phoned-in rule when playtesters complained about a run-away leader.
9) Money is too loose. By midpoint, it's almost a non-issue, at least for some players. Without even trying.
10) Because all of the contracts have some sort of conditional effect, you really need to pay attention to not just what's good for you, but what's good for the next guy. And you might need to take a bullet for the team to avoid letting the next guy from getting an awesome card. If there's any player that doesn't do this, the player to their left wins. And this level of processing is not fun either. It's not like the DS cards, where it's fairly easy to tell how good it would be for each player. In US, you have to do some mechanical plug-n-chug analysis to figure exactly how good each card is for you vs the next guy.

When you are running something as large as a city you really are managing chaos, which is what this game does. This is not a bad thing but the game is unworkable with four players - try three and it is perfect. 

The game does go for a little longer than I feel it should. I also would not recommend to someone who likes absolute control over their games (hard-core Euro Players) - they should be reminded that managing chaos is a skill...

There are pluses, the game is fun, but there is a lot of downtime where you should be planning your moves and a lot of fiddly upkeep (okay by me as a wargamer).

Worse than Kill Dr. Lucky syndrome when

Watched the last place player win as he said; "I get VPs for stuff I
didn't plan for"
Needs a lot more -VP cards like Slums. That was the highlight of my game

Fun system, but Chad's other games are stronger. Basically, this is a good simulation of building a city together, but the constant onslaught of Event cards creating unforeseen rewards based on arbitrary timing of who happens to be in the lead across about a dozen metrics at any given point hurts its strategic potential. Very tactical -- I like tactical, and it's fun, but a lengthy 2+-hour game for a competition that often has you wearing blinders doesn't feel as rewarding as his other excellent designs.

1. Start with a bunch of "buildings" that are nothing more than Tetris-like bits which were given names.

2. Pour in a large dose of randomness of the Chance/Community Chest variety.

3. Shake well and practice your adding skills over and over and over and over again. (Literally. To play even remotely competently, you will be adding rows and columns continuously... so boring.)

Did not enjoy in the slightest. Huge letdown after the wonderful Dominant Species. (That game, too, had some tedious calculating... the constant reassessment of dominance. But in that game, there's so much other great stuff going on that the tedium is worth it. Here, not at all.)

Clocking in at 3+ hours in my two plays so far, this is a heavyweight. It's the most Ameritrashy Eurogame you've ever played. Plain-cloth Euro backbone tempered by unmitigated chaos and heinous fuckery. Thoroughly, frustratingly, masochistically fun.

I call Urban Sprawl "Mitigated Strategy," the opposite of mitigated chaos. In a game with mitigated chaos, your strategy will defray the gross consequences of the chaos. In a game of mitigated strategy, the chaos derails your carefully constructed strategy, so the best you can do is stick to the plan and roll with the punches, to mix a metaphor or two. I think that's what makes it so fun/frustrating. To truly enjoy Urban Sprawl, you have to loosen up and let go. You won't have absolute authority over your game. Sometimes you get fucked, but if there's consolation in commiseration, everyone else will get fucked, too.

On saturday evening we played a 3 player game of Urban Sprawl. The Designer already had a great hit with Dominant Species. This game is another great game, with the card mechanism it is so random that planning your next turn is not so easy. However due to this mechanism the game is really very entertaining since the event cards can really provide a nice twist to someone's turn. Certainly when the additional numbers are added to the board.
This game will provide plenty of challenges for the years to come.

One play in, meh, not thrilled with it. There's no long term planning possible, you just optimize your turn based on the options presented to you each turn. The result is precious little decision making beyond some micro optimizations here and there. It doesn't help that some of the actions are way too expensive.

It wouldn't be so bad, except the game is way too long. All the constant VP scoring and elections require constant board analysis which really bogs the game down and results in lots of down time. If this game were 2 hours or less I could live with it. But at 3+ hours, GTFO.

- The theme is good and pretty well realised.
- Production quality and artwork are excellent.

Con's
- Too much chaos for a game that has a playing time around 3 hours. Card draws swing the game radically with no real way for the players to exercise control.
- Board position and cards available change so much between turns it's pointless thinking too much about your turn until it is your turn. The consequence is significant downtime and only the ability to respond tactically on a turn by turn basis.
- Some things seem overpowered - the roles, which it is possible to get locked out of and which appear to have the ability to create a run-away leader, and the placing/moving of scoring tokens.
- Just wasn't that much fun - despite playing with gamers I like playing with.

A little unfair rating a game like this after one play and it's possible my rating will change as the chaos may become more manageable with experience - but, it's a long game to play which means it may not get enough plays to gain that experience. If I do play again I think I would want to see the number of events in the deck reduced from the start and for no events to be reshuffled back in. I would also probably try with only 3 players next time.

Way too random (in a bad way) for me. Why plan at all when it really doesn't seem to matter? The run-away leader problem didn't help either.

Very interesting and very chaotic game (at least after the first game...)
Long term planning is hard to do, since the building cards can destroy your best plans. Also, since not all cards will come out, you can't count on a certain card coming out and be played.

I really, really like this game, it's easily my favourite of 2011. I like that it has a relatively unusual theme - and am surprised nobody has tried to do anything Simcity like as a board game up to now. While I do like it a lot, I could not give it a 10 due to a couple niggling points. First, the game does seem a bit luck-centric, as some of the negative effect cards can really hit somebody where it hurts - especially if the most cash-strapped player happens to be the mayor when a bunch of disasters arise. Secondly, it would have been nice to have more permanent effects for building certain buildings - though I can see the downside in terms of rule complexity, the idea of perhaps having distinct tiles for each building might have been nice. As somebody else has noted, it's fun to build a housing project right next to a celebrity home, but there's no way to keep that memory active.

In general it is easier to play while using the Calculator I wrote in Python (calculates current values of every block, finds the cheapest and most expensive buildings of any type).

Firstly, I really like how this game looks. Secondly, I love the way the game plays and its tactical nature. It feels a bit random as to what to place where, but I think some strategy will emerge with more plays and learning the cards.

[i]Thoughts on different number of players:[/i]
[b]4-player:[/b] Lots of downtime, but this may lessen with experienced players. I won this first play, but I can't say it's because I knew what I was doing so much as luck of the draw.
[b]2-player:[/b] It's nice to get payouts more often than in a 4-player game. I lost this game horribly, but again, not sure if it is because of me playing poorly or (bad) luck of the draw. Having played a couple more times now, I do enjoy the 2p game. It still makes for an enjoyable experience.
[b]3-player:[/b] Definitely best, especially when turns move quickly. Playable in about 2 hours. Very enjoyable experience.

RATING: 5
A highly thematic city planning game, the board itself is very abstract but the gameplay feels like a city is being built around you. It takes some planning to pull off a successful advantage over the other players, as there is a lot of strategy lurking in this game. The events happen in quick succession and often throw the balance of the game completely. I'm not necessarily against this, but it requires too much recalculation of all the numbers on the board, which can be irritating two hours in.

I have only played the 2P version. The comparison with Dominant Species is inevitable because both are created by Chad Jensen and has some similar play mechanics.  

I own, have played and love them both.  Urban Sprawl is less combative and complex yet is still highly engaging.  The other person in most of my 2P games loves US because it allows for a tremendous amount of choice without being overwhelming. Her interest in DS is quite low.

I see many more games of US in our future.  

Update 12/4/2011

Played a couple of 3P games.  This game is fantastic.  It is quickly becoming one our favorites.  Folks in my gaming group who were once pushing for more Power Grid and Dominant Species can't get enough of Urban Sprawl.

Sigh, well I'm finally breaking up with Urban Sprawl. We had a rocky time together, and I felt we could've had something, but in the end, US wasn't available for what I wanted. [i]Con te partiro.[/i]

I'm disappointed in this game because I think it could've been a great game instead of the ambitious failure I find it to be. There are elements to like here, but as hard as I tried to like this one as a whole, I just can't. My group soured on US from the get-go. There just wasn't enough control amongst the chaos for players to stay interested in the game or want to revisit it. Everyone -- including the players who won each game -- felt they had no idea what they did right or wrong.  The opportunities for big moves where either there on their turn or they weren't. When that's the case, people don't feel excited to try the game again. They feel like the game is playing them.

While there's a lot to like here (I love the whole AP track and am a big fan of TtA) the game feels too much like a lottery especially for a 3+ hour game. The battle for the elections and selecting buildings for their special powers and placing them on the board is a lot of fun, but your hard work is often undone by the capriciousness of events and which cards come out on other players turns. Furthermore, we all felt burned out by recalculating building and block values. We thought the game would do well to have numbered chits you can drop on each block so when you're considering your move, you can quickly see how much things will cost and such. As it is, players need to spend time figuring out where they should build or what the effect of dropping a new row bonus chit will be (as this is muy importante) and it becomes tiresome. Many people commented that it would be better off as PC game so it could calculate things for you.

But even so, the game often punches you in the gut by forcing you to take your time to calculate a move that will have major ramifications on the board while everyone patiently waits only to then have that move undone randomly by a subsequent card that comes out. Decisions that take several minutes for a player to formulate should be more long-lasting or they should be easier to make such that the game doesn't slow down since they're going to be undone anyway. Since the cards that come out are random each game, you just don't know which way to go for endgame bonus points, thus creating the lottery effect. 

The coup de gras was that every game we played ended up not just with a runaway leader but with players on separate VP panels (ie, not even close to one another). Even with the Contractor as a "bash the leader" mechanism, roles got locked down and the leader became even more powerful sucking in more and more money and power. The tension in the endgame was obliterated and it felt over before it was over. 

Update: I tried the solitaire variant, "Taking on The Donald" and enjoyed it very much. I raised the rating from a 3 (multiplayer) to a 6 (solo). In solitaire mode, the game's chaos works great as a constant threat and becomes part of a wild ride. I highly recommend trying it out whether or not you like the regular game. Look for my instructional video in the video section.

Rating is only after a two player playtest and then a full 4-player short game.  Unforunately, I have to agree with most of of the other comments about the unacceptable level of chaos in this game. My concerns are two:
--It seems that there is very little way to deal with the random game shifting events and buildings that come out in this game.  This probably gets better with fewer players and with better familiarity with the cards, but still it gives one a real sense of lack of any kind of control.
--There is just too much scoring.  Most every card seems to trigger some kind of scoring, which breaks up the flow of the game and slows everything to a crawl.  This gets especially frustrating when several events and scoring cards come out in a row.  Half as much of all of this would seem better.

I had hoped to play this and explore it more, but had to be realistic that I would probably never it get it to the talbe again, and I let it go.

UPDATE: Played recently with three experienced gamers. We found we had little control of many things in the game. I got out to an early lead after Airport and never looked back. It seemed no matter what the other players did to me I could not shed my lead. I thought I'd never say this but this game was almost too random. It was not even worth planning your turn in advance because too much would change before it got around to you. Each turn seems very scripted. Try to buy the most valuable type of a building....but before you do that here are five random events. 

Cool mechanics and great theme. But I need a little more control. 

I don't think I would ever play this again. This was a miss but I wanted to like it so much.

Busy, involved game of building a city with permits, buildings, elections, vocations, money, prestige, and kitchen sinks.

The game feels thematic, like you are building up a city. But there are just too many moving parts and random events and scoring for it to all work. Cutting out at least one or two elements of the game would have made it much better. Such as vocations, or community bonuses, or elections (just give bonuses at the end). 

On top of that, the random events and building effects don't seem well calibrated. You spend a lot of time resolving events for a dollar here, a point there. Then I build a building for a game-changing two dozen points? Then a bunch more events for a dollar here or there, and then an event that gives one player a dozen points? 

It's too bad that they didn't print the names of the buildings onto the chits, so that as the city grows, you could identify which buildings are what. It would have no effect on gameplay but would help the narrative of the game a lot, by providing more of a story to the city that you are building. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Tentative rating after first play. I think I see how the game functions now and I'm excited to play it again. It is a fun game, but difficult to predict. Money is crucial. The vocations are not as important as I thought. I wish there was a bit more screwage earlier on in the game. I can see this one maybe getting up to an 8 but will probably flatline there. It could also end up as a 4 or 5.

Two games in and still don't know how I feel about it. Vocations seemed much more important. I think one aspect I dislike is that the main way points are scored late in the game is by building certain cards, which often has nothing to do with board position. Wild swings in points coming out of building one building. It also starts feeling like the game is all about comboing cards. The two games were also complete blow outs. I think I see more of the strategy of placement and card management, but I'm not sure it is enough to overcome the tactical focus of the game.

OK I played it 3 times. I tried to figure out how to maneuver to minimize negative effects and maximize good ones but in the end there is just too much chaos and luck. Sorry Chad but this one is a pass for me. I also don't understand why a game about urban planning seems to have so much randomness. That is a big disconnect between theme and mechanics.

I love this game.  It is frustrating, contains every game design no no, takes a long time, and has a lot of math but for some reason I love it.  It is a very intriguing design that is like no other game I've ever played.  There is a beautiful narrative arc to the game, and seeing the city unfold is magnificent.  I like this game immensely.

RATING: 5
Tough to give this a fair shake after one slightly-truncated play, but I seriously doubt I'll play again. High luck-based chaos factor + heavy brain burn is exactly the wrong combination for me. I like thinking hard, but I like to be rewarded for thinking hard with a certain degree of predictability in the results. This game has some solid, innovative mechanics, but ultimately the card draw seems to create huge swings in results no matter what you try to do.

As a huge fan of Dominant Species (easily my favorite area control game) I wanted to like this, but I found our game to be a largely un-rewarding slog (even though I was leading the whole way).

I was really excited about this game, but it ended up disappointing me in several ways.

(1) For a game about urban planning, it seems odd that Urban Sprawl has very little ability to plan ahead. The queue of building contracts cycles so quickly that you can't look ahead and see what cards might be available to you next turn. Nearly every aspect of the game is highly chaotic, unstable, and tactical rather than strategic.

(2) The constant barrage of randomly-timed events is tiresome. You will sometimes draw four or five events in a row before you get to an actual contract card. That seems a little silly and unnecessary to me. And you can't very effectively plan for the events, since you'll only use about half the cards in each of the three decks.

(3) Small amounts of money are constantly flowing in and out of players' hands. That's frustrating, both in terms of the amount of upkeep required and in the way that it undermines your ability to plan. We immediately switched to poker chips after the first few turns of the first game.

(4) The theme just doesn't really come through in the way it does in Jensen's other games like Dominant Species and Combat Commander. I don't feel like we're building a city. I feel like we're moving cubes and tokens and money and victory points around. Why do I want to have the majority of buildings in a given street or avenue? Do I even care?

Very Good city building game from Chad Jensen.
Some people might have a problem with it because it's chaotic.  Others might not like that players cannot plan ahead what to do on their turn because the cards that will be available are reveal only after the previous player turn is over.  This does not annoyed me.  I have fun when playing this game even with 4 player.  The events make this game chaotic and exciting.
I like the elections for the politicians that gives special powers.  I don't usually like paper money but this game has thick paper money that is very good quality.

This is a great game. This has the potential to be one of my top games. People may argue that there is a lot of randomness in the game, but the purpose of the game is to handle this randomness. It is not a luck game. It is a strategy game. A game where you need to think ahead and gamble on the opportunities and resources you have each turn. And what's the best - The uncertainty that comes into play before each players turn. You will have a great time for 3 hours. I've only player to player games with my wife, and she likes the game.

I have only played this once and I am undecided on how to rate it. I found it interesting. There is more going on than I normally like and a bigger dose of randomness than most serious gamers will be comfortable with. However there are only so many games of this class released a year, a heavy weight 3 hour Euro that has been well produced with passion put into the design. It really is a miss based on my one play, maybe a "5" but I think I owe the game a second try, points also for the unique feel. Nov 2011

I think I've played the game eight times now (I haven't been keeping up lately with recording plays) and I've given the game as much chance as I'm going to. I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying it and I have no doubts that the game reflects the designer/developers' intent. It took several plays before I could articulate my issues with the game, but I don't think my initial suspicions after one play were far off.

My issues aren't about the AP, the playtime, or the chaos, it's more a combination of these. There are times after the midpoint of the game when a player should take five or ten minutes on a difficult decision. If you're moving a scoring marker you could change two offices, maybe all of them. That could be a massive swing in the game. I think analysis is completely justified for crucial moves. What bothers me is that the very next card could move another scoring marker and that ten minute turn feels pointless.

A friend of mine put it well, he said that it feels like good decisions don't "stick".

I also don't think you see enough of the cards in an individual game to justify long term planning. There could be three houses or none, the "Richest player moves the 12." card could come up first turn and never again or twice in the last five turns or not at all. I'd like to move the Airport, etc. cards lower in the deck, but that would lengthen the game and probably do more harm than good.

I think it's a well crafted, well designed game that people who like heavy games should try. But if I'm asked to join a game I'll politely decline.

RATING: 6
First play: We stopped playing after the Airport event (more specifically after refilling the contract and planning cards after the Airport event).  It was just to get a feel for the game, since I felt like this wouldn't suit my SO's tastes.  My impressions seem to follow other reviewers attitudes in thinking this game seems too chaotic for such a time investment.  A player can only make some optimal choices on their turn and the rest is completely out of their control.  This game also has a lot of maintenance and fiddly bits.  The constant payouts seem to make investing planning cards viable only for the first and maybe second turns.  It might have also been my huge expectations with Dominant Species that's making it hard to appreciate this game, but I'm sure this isn't the last play.

Urban Sprawl tiene un defecto imperdonable para mi: Urban Sprawl no resulta divertido.

En el juego desarrollamos una ciudad en 3 fases, la primera es un pueblo, la segunda cuando pasa a convertirse en ciudad y la tercera cuando se convierte en metrópolis. Este tema es bastante interesante y como todos sabemos ha sido explotado innumerables veces en juegos de ordenador como la saga Sim City, lo malo es que en ningún momento te da la sensación de estar desarrollando una ciudad, el arco narrativo es muy debil y el resultado final se acerca mas a un juego abstracto que a una ciudad, y aunque todo tiene su lógica, le faltan fotos a las cartas y un mejor grafismo que te haga ver que estas construyendo una ciudad porque contruyes un Hospital y simplemente pones un tile rojo en el tablero, al final queda eso, tiles de colores con cubos de madera encima del tablero.

Pero este no es el único defecto achacable a este juego. El desarrollo de tu estrategia no puede ser planificada mas allá del turno en el que estás jugando a mas de 2 jugadores debido a que las cartas que ves disponibles para realizar tus acciones van a ser completamente distintas cuando te vuelva a tocar el turno. A dos jugadores puedes planificar un turno por delante (quizás), lo cual provoca que cuando no es tu turno no tengas realmente nada que hacer salvo chequear tu cuenta de twitter, esta falta de planificación provoca que las estrategias de los jugadores sean las mismas: construir en los bloques mas caros o hacer que las zonas donde estás construyendo se conviertan en la mejor valoradas y en tu turno te dedicas simplemente a optimizar tu jugada basándote en las opciones que se presentan en ese momento justo lo cual provoca que tengas escasas decisiones (el coste de algunas acciones no ayuda en nada a esto) a la hora de escoger cartas y realizar algunas optimizaciones aquí y allí para arañar puntos de victoria.

El juego también peca de un sobre analisis absurdo, continuamente hay que calcular y recalcular en el tablero cuanto cuesta contruir un edificio y cuales son las zonas mas caras y mas baratas y sinceramente resulta un verdadero coñazo llevar cuenta de todo eso.

También me pareció que si despegas es dificil que te alcancen y al que va el último le es muy complicado remontar incluso con algunas ayudas que otorga el juego.

A 2 pasable, aunque la verdad no me veo metiendome en otra partida.
A 4 jugadores este juego debe ser un infierno por los tiempos muertos, la falta de planificación y llevar la cuenta de los costes de los bloques.

The game can play like a steamroller sometimes, especially with how the high value markers get laid. The catch up's are kinda chaotic. This game can move slowly (kind way of saying it triggers AP). But it is cool when it moves fast.

Nice game, but took far too long for me. We played with 4 players, and stopped after 4.5 hours. The problem (for me) was not the duration itself, but the long downtime between turns. Maybe it's better with 3 or only 2 players...

Two big problems with this game for me: the amount of luck involved and the game length.  I wanted a heavily thematic city-builder.  However, as soon as you place a building, it becomes just a colored piece of cardboard with no thematic impact.  Skyline 3000 does a better job with this aspect and fills that niche, even in a much shorter time.  

The only way to anticipate or mitigate the randomness in this game is to have played enough to know every possible card that can come out.  It is too dry and too long to get to the table.  I would rather spend the four hours on a game like Twilight Imperium or play some other medium/heavy games that are more fun and balanced.

Traded 6-2-15.

RATING: N/A
Urban Sprawl is almost Monopoly for grownups, except it's a lor better than that implies.

The game models a growing city, abstractly, by identifying building powers only at activation, and then genericizing buildings by color and broad function.

Buildings are valued by row and column, and these values sway up and down during the game, by the placement of several value modifier discs.

Depending on the time in the game, several cards in one of two active decks determine random effects: payouts, expenses, events. The same decks are populated with cards enabling builds or describing buildings to be built.

Because the cards come up based on a random shuffle, there is a certain degree of luck, but preparedness and canny planning can greatly help to plan for and manage random events.

In the first game, I'd to say it went a little long for what it is, but will say again it was a learning game.

My initial impression from having read the rules and really looked at the game is that [thing=123260][/thing] does it better. We'll have to see after I play it, but I can already see myself sticking this back on the trade list as I already have Suburbia.

[b]After first solo test play:[/b] While on paper it has a lot of Suburbia's feel and mechanics, it doesn't feel like Suburbia when playing it. If anything, it feels like a card game. It does make me wonder how much my wife will like it then :-/ For my part, it was just a bit too random and very, very long.

The town cards change so much you can't plan much ahead of your turn, so when you go you have a lot of thinking to do. The downtime between turns was too much. Also the cards seem very random, but this might be mitigated with more experience.

I've played this game once, but all I can say - it is AMAZING. This is truly a strategic game where you need to think ahead, gamble among the opportunities and resources you have each turn. And what's the best - The uncertainty that comes into play in before each players turn.

Probably after second play I'll give all 10. It is just perfect.

I actually like this game more than Dominant Species.  IMHO the hype about too much chaoes is over blown.  I think Dominant Species has just as much and perhaps even more deadly chaos.

RATING: 5
After 1x3-player game and 1x2player game.

Total lack of control and chaos created by event cards are exaggerated by many people.  I'm sure that overwhelming majority of them played once only...  Hence, the hasty hysterical reactions.

The level of control is debatable (quite significant, IMO), but - I must state it clearly - NOT sufficient for me.  You can prepare for much, but mechanics of the game itself prevents you from preparing for much _enough_ to experience a satisfying play.  Sad :(
On top of that there is an enormous pure agression factor.  Uncontrollable, in reality.  Unlike in Dominant Species (I love DS).
All this makes US a futile exercise to some degree.

The second problem is that the game is too long (and requiring too much of brainburning) for this level of uncontrollability.

All in all - many great ideas here (in fact too much of them (which results in unsatisfactory control)), but as a whole the game is a wasted opportunity for a true gem.  Pity...

Sold.

Cancelled my preorder based on Jesse's "Urban Chaos" and Curt C's intelligent reviews and my experience with Dominant Species. I like to be able to at least somewhat plan and to couple not having that with useless downtime killed this for me. 

It's a bummer, because there was a lot to like with DS, just not enough to counter a few huge luck imbalances, length of play time and pure chaos. My instinct from what I've read here tells me Urban Sprawl would disappoint me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Decisions points keep coming, and they're all important.  Mechanics tend to prevent runaway leaders.  More tactical than strategic - you can plan a couple turns ahead, but not much more than that.  But that's OK when there's plenty to chew on each turn.

More accessible than Dominant Species, but provides almost as much "zip".  They feel very similar.  I love Chad's designs, and this has several of his hallmarks.

Components are great, particularly if you're used to more flimsy wargamer fare.  Very dry and utilitarian, but they really get the job done.

Better with 2 or 3 than with 4.  Playing with 4 really shines a spotlight on the downsides here - too much downtime between turns, too much chaos makes you feel less in control of the situation, etc.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (June 2012)

I was warned by a friend, that I would not like this game because it has extreme and uncontrollable randomness, fortunately he was wrong. I DO like this game although it has a healthy dose of luck BUT I still feel I have a lot of wiggling room, so the random events doesn’t bother me that much (In fact I found them very fun to play :D). With more plays, I think I will know more about the events, thus reducing further their impact on my plans. This is a meaty game, but the rules and gameplay are surprisingly easy to teach.

The event deck is well balanced, in my plays I have not found yet an event that took me out of the game, and that is the main reason I accept the luck inherent in it. But I know it can be frustrating when 3 or 4 events came in a row and all affect you adversely.

The game components are good, the theme is ok too, not one that excites me but not one that puts me off either. In fact the game made a lot of thematic sense with the events and the political offices. It is great to see how your real estate begins to appreciate (or depreciate :devil:). I DO feel like I’m (trying) building a city. 

The play time can be on the longish side (a little long for what the game offers), with 4 players I begin to feel the downtime, so I prefer to play it with 3. The game is tactical in nature, but it has (little) room for some long time plans. 

Urban Sprawl is a good game, not one I want to play every time, thus the 6.5 rating. Also, as other BGGers  have said, it has a lot of “uncontrollable chaos”, your ability to plan ahead is very reduced and each turn you have to take the best move available (tactical). Play before buy but I have had fun playing this and I won’t hesitate to play it again.

Current Rating: 6.5

I expect to be writing a review in a few more plays so will keep this short.

Good game, potentially too chaotic for some people's tastes, especially Eurogamers.  (I like Euros myself so that's not pejorative.)  There is comparatively less one can to do manage the randomness of the cards than in Dominant Species, though less does not mean nothing and there is substantial room for skill.

Fantastic thematic integration.  Among the best I've seen.

Theme is enough to bump this from a 7 likely to rise to 8, to an 8 -> 9 in my eyes.

Played this once a while back with someones else's copy.  Ran away with the lead enough enough to the point where I thought it MUST have a runaway leader problem but I had so much fun that even though I thought the game might be too chaotic, it might still be playable at a strategic level.  Will edit with further plays.

Update: Just had an incredibly close session of this game.  The difference was one turn.  If the olympic games would have come up one turn later, the win would have gone another way.  Such a fantastic game.  For now this goes up to an 8.5 and I could see it going to a 9 or higher.

REALLY FUN.  But hard to get people to commit to it because of the varying length.  Some games will be three hours.  Some will be five, maybe more.

I will most likely only ever get a 2-player experience, and I think 3 players would be AMAZING!

Urban Sprawl is a city builder that means business. This beast of a game isn't for the faint of heart, nor is it for those who like things neat and tidy. This game is a whirlwind of chaos--and it is a thing of beauty to behold. Players face an array of decisions each turn, and the constantly shifting board state means anything goes. The event cards add just the right amount of randomness and unpredictability to the game, mixing things up but not breaking them. The permits, elections,   payouts, and building abilities all weave together for a rich, memorable gaming experience. Once you Sprawl, you can't stop.

RATING: 6
Straight-forward majority game where majorities are defined by rows and columns, so every placement works in potentially two directions. The value of the rows and columns are adjusted in-game. The game is driven by cards from essentially two sources - a planning deck (which is a form of currency) and the contract deck (contracts are purchased to enable board placement). The cards from both decks are displayed in continuously descending order of value, a la Through the Ages.

The game is fairly luck-driven as players hope for an affordable, complimentary combo of contracts and permits to become available on their turn. I am also concerned that the "Contractor" tile is too powerful a catch-up mechanic, especially in a two-player game. I'm usually very forgiving of a poorly illustrated game, but it looks like this game was assembled completely from a file of standard clip art. Ugh. The game is okay, but does not really justify its length.

RATING: 7.2
Pros: 
-Interesting "building and development" design with massive replayability due to subsets of events, different order of cards, etc.
-Nice mechanic/theme integration.  I like the appropriate effects of the various buildings etc.
-I like the organic city-wide patterns that emerge as the game board develops based on zoning etc.  Similar to the countryside that develops based on strategic play in Carcassonne.

Cons:
-Little long for my taste, lots of downtime w/4 players.
-Constantly calculating most/least valuable real estate felt fiddly.  Time will tell if it becomes as intuitive as the domination in Dom. Spp. or not.
-Politicians always seemed to bunch up with one person.  Saw this in both 4 player and 2 player.  Time will tell if this is a beginner's effect that can eventually be combatted.

The crux of the matter is the long playing time (3-4 hrs) combined with highly chaotic gameplay and proneness to AP. While it is an entertaining ride I'm not sure if there's enough payoff to all the thought and effort I put in this game beyond the mere one-time experience. Every card draw is a crapshoot if your schemes come to fruition or your precious constructions literally break down on your head. I'm not sure if I could enjoy this if I end up mostly on the short end of the stick.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
While I have rated this a 6 and continue to think this appropriate after four or so plays, I really do like it and would recommend it to others with the caveat that the microtransactional model used in it--continual payouts of wealth and/or prestige, based on continual recalculation of block value--is a pain to implement, and I only feel like playing Urban Sprawl when I'm "in the mood," consistent with BGG's 6 rating. It's otherwise enjoyable, and I suppose if I were on the ball I could work up some additional markers to help indicate most valuable blocks. (There are some high-/low-value markers, but there aren't enough to cover all building zoning types, which is where the recalculation issue comes up most often.) If the game were an app, I'd probably play it more, which is probably not a compliment.

I do agree with others that the game does not feel in any way like a sim, in that the city doesn't feel organic in any sense. The individual buildings *are* often theme-y, in that you have to (going on memory here) have to put a gravel pit by the wilderness borders. The town-to-city-to-metropolis transition does feel somewhat real, as the buildings tend to get bigger and the types of buildings are more appropriate for a larger city than a smaller town. But apart from the neighborhood bonus encouraging single-use zoning in areas, you end up with buildings of all types thrown together along with gaping empty spaces that could be anywhere, including near the city center. Ultimately, it should be judged as a game and understood as a Euro; those seeking a sim should look elsewhere.

I was looking forward to this game after my experience with Dominant Species, but it is just very problematic. The graphic design is atrocious, making it one of the ugliest games I've ever played. But I can overlook that aspect. The big problem here is the game length. This was also a problem with Dominant Species, which feels about an hour too long. But at least with Dominant Species you feel engaged. The time commitment is simply too great for a game with such crazy amounts of chaos resulting from the cards. Players can also gang up on the leader in a way that just feels wrong. If this game lasted an hour, I'd probably like it (graphics aside). At two hours I would be hesitant. At over two hours, I just can't ever see myself wanting to play it again.

There are no shortage of City Building games these days so there just is little place left for one as long and dull looking as Urban Sprawl.  It's place is exactly where it is though.  At GMT Games as a gateway for those who play long and complex wargames to 'possibly' get into some eurogaming as well.  To that goal it might work well.

The problem with the randomness is that many things can be both good or bad, so you don't know what to fight for. Do you want to be the mayor? Yes, unless the -6 point card comes out, which it may the turn after you become mayor, right before someone takes it from you (happened but not to me). Do you want the most Civic buildings? I guess, unless you really don't. 

With what things you are rewarded for being random, there's no real incentive to do anything but dogpile for the most expensive building of each type, trying to make the most of all your other actions and money in a very superficial way. 

The game goes way beyond the length this amount of strategic depth can justify. I would like the game much more if it was distilled into something like an hour and a half.

There's a lot going on in this game...not sure what to think overall yet although I think I prefer Dominant Species...

LIKES:

* Spend AP to acquire permits.  Spend more AP and permits to buy buildings.  Then place buildings in a legal location.  At times you can build over someone else's building(s) as long as building rules are still in place.  Whew!
* Different buildings bring in special actions.  In some cases these are vocations which potentially grant money and can help towards becoming the mayor.
* Different political offices add in special bonuses to the person who has the highest value building in the city of a certain type...except for mayor where it is given to the player with the most vocations.  

DISLIKES:

* Card draw probably evens out over time, but can be frustrating depending on how cards come out at times.
* Can be extremely difficult to dislodge the person with the highest value building of a certain color.  
* Game takes a bit too long for one where you have limited ability to effectively plan ahead.

RATING: 6
This is a rich game with a lot of interesting card interactions.  The main knock on the game is that the players are often at the mercy of fairly random card draws that can seriously impact their success in the game.  I do have to say that my first play did give me that feeling of only having very limited control over my own destiny.  Perhaps a bigger knock for me is that there is little to do on other people's turns as the cards available will often shift radically by the time your turn arrives.  This leads to a pretty long, random game with a lot of downtime.  Perhaps it is a testament to what the game does get right that I still rate it fairly highly.

Played it once and really loved the randomness of the cards and how they affected game play. I have played it again and I don't think its going to go up, but I don't think it'll go down either. A neat concept for a city builder. Lots to do takes a special mind to play it. Also felt like it dragged on after the 3 hour mark.

Another Chad Jensen game - which is both good and bad. Just like Dominant Species I loove the theme and basic mechanisms. The building and board positioning is challenging and interesting to do, but the amount of randomness is to much in my opinion.

For good game value (the social part: can I get people to play it) random events should even things out, rather than polarise the spread between the leading and trailing players. This may be a better [i]simulation[/i] of the subject, but it's not great replay value in my book.

In my first play (only Martin had played it before), I got the mayor in the first election, and kept it throughout the game. This helped to get a very strong board position, which kept income and prestige generation flowing. I trailed Martin until about halfway through the metropolis deck, where I overtook him and kept going. 

Very polarised game, scoring-wise. The leaders got rewarded, the trailers got penalised. Possible fixes? remove all the random events from the planning deck or limit the number of random events to one per player turn.

Still: I want to play this again!

US is a game of focusing on building in the most valuable areas in order to reap the greatest money and points. You have to be careful to focus not only on single blocks but in entire rows for majorities. The major complication is that of the zoning rules. Building in such a manner as to facilitate not only early game but also late game plays is important otherwise you will not be able to adapt. All of this is also a key in gaining control of the different roles in the game. 

At first blush the game seem VERY random yet there is a subtle balance in the events over the entirety of the game. I have already seen, and predict in the future of this game, that most will play once and be completely turned off. It's a shame that Mr. Jensen's games require multiple plays, more so than almost any other designs that I have tried, in order to begin understanding the play, the "story arc" of the game, and indeed how to play competitively. 

With two plays under our belt, our last game being VERY close and back and forth on all players parts, we look forward to more and I foresee the rating rising.

Fantastic game. Plenty of interesting choices are combined with an incredibly well integrated theme and tightly designed take-that gameplay. The little things are what really make this game, though: political tiles, vocations, planning investments, and constant wealth and prestige payouts.  All of these mechanics are easy to play, but work well with each other and the city-building themes. The components are solid and attractive, but most importantly well designed -- the bits make the game as easy to play as Chad Jensen's rules do.

A very swingy affair with this game. You really need to watch who has the advantage in this title and take measures to prevent them running away with the game. Urban Renewal is very important and if the contractor isn't taking down the leader it is likely the leader will begin to make big gains. It can be a bit random at times and events tend to clump together for some reason but the theme is enjoyable and the game play makes for some fun and interesting decisions also.

After 3 normal games and 1 short game with 3-4 players, I think the importance of the end game scoring of politicians is much more important. The scoring through procession of vocation markers is diluted in short version, because of the length of gaming is shortened, the number of times the markers score is decreased.

Winning a game tends to make me view it as more strategic than it really is, so my perception of Urban Sprawl as a pretty chaotic ride can either mean that I’m spot on this time or that it is even more chaotic than it felt. Somehow, I doubt that the latter could be true, because you do have a lot of options available that allow for planning, from the predictable and potentially very decisive election cycle to the efficient use of your favor space. Nevertheless, the events and - even more so - the selection of available cards can mess you up good.

What I enjoyed immensely (apart from winning) was how smoothly the game ran after the first two or three turns, which is quite a feat considering the many levers you can churn. Only making roughly half of the building decks available is a smart idea, since it prevents fixed strategies. Again, however, it’s an aspect of the game that can leave you hanging dry if you have a very lopsided selection of buildings. But somehow all these opportunities for bad or, occasionally, good luck make for a very thematic package, especially if you’ve ever been somewhere in the vicinity of council politics.

After one game, it’s probably too early to tell, but it feels as though this is another winner, and the most pleasant surprise is how the only shared characteristics with Dominant Species are the design quality and the excellent development.

Update: after another game with three and one with four players, I have to add the caveat that the rating of 8 is a good deal too high when playing with four. Increased downtime and significantly more emphasis on luck makes for such a big negative shift that I now very much want to try the game with two.

A great game experience. It's just fun to build up a city with a group of friends. At first play, the winner will not know why he won, but further plays will show more strategic play. I think this can be a very competitive game with 3 or 4 gamers who know the game well, but at first (like Twilight Struggle) players will be grasping in the dark. Despite that, the game will be fun for new players.

US has an old-school feel. Flip the cards, see what's gonna happen, make some money, lose some points. I love playing this game.

Only one play in - first game was four hours with rules explanation on a four player game.

You can tell that a lot of love has gone into the various mechanics and location cards.  

The events seem to drive a lot of prestige points.  Sometimes you get a windfall and other times you don't.  And just when you spend a fortune to get the best locations for each colour the prestige chits change rows or columns and mess everything up.

I haven't tried Dominant Species yet - it has some followers in our group... but I am awfully worried that design will be as chaotic as this...  In a longer game I want at least a sense of control and that solid play will lead me to victory.  I am not so sure if Urban Planet will reward me accordingly.

Hoping my second try will give me some aha moments.  Until then I am on the fence...

Good game. Yes, it's a bit long, and it's actually way too long if players A.P. too much, which can spoil the pleasure.

There can be massive swings in the game, just like in Dominant Species. It all seems thematically apt though. I can see why people don't like this game: especially players that need a feeling of control might get frustrated. But I feel you can learn how to adapt to the game and play it well, so I like it and want to play again.

I looked into this game heavily and it just doesn't seem like a game that would get played much. It has a long play time and is fairly random with event card drawing.

disappointing as the game just does not suck you in like dominant species.   i felt that i was playing a game with potential, but never thought it was great or amazing.

i think that a few more plays will help players understand the planning/building combos and being able to take advantage of events, but i am not sure players will give it a chance.   i think players fall into the trap of just picking up plans and building what is immediately available vs planning for the big lot buildings available in the late game.

Contractor catchup method seems a bit of a meshup and feels a bit out of place.  

i'd like to give it another couple of plays to really explore the system, but not sure i can round up the crew to do so.

A lot going on in this game and a single play at two players (which is obviously the worst player count) leaves me unable to judge it properly. The dramatic swings of valuation changes and events are both exciting and punishing, so may appeal to some while leaving heavier strategists cursing the wasted hours. The game may be too long to justify these swings. The catch up mechanic is especially unsubtle and powerful, as if the first half of the game was a euro city builder and godzilla showed up at the half to wreck up the place. Two players felt weak to me but I feel I should give it another try at three or four.

This game I think falls under the category of less than the sum of its parts. It has a lot of good ideas and the mechanics are mostly well-executed, but it is VERY long, with a great deal of down time. I think that eliminating or modifying perhaps one of the parts of the game would streamline it and make it more interesting. Like Dominant Species, there isn't quite enough game for the time invested. It might be a better 2 or 3 person game, but with 4, it's just too long (4+ hours and we still weren't finished).

I don't know what to make of it. With the official rules, the events are too frequent and random, the rewards and punishments feel arbitrary. We've been experimenting with variants, so far we've been having the events previewed then executed in a semi-random fashion, triggering on the Mayor and Treasurer spots on the election wheel. A friend suggested letting the events come out on the board to be bought with AP just like the other cards.

It's a unique game. It's quite chaotic still, particularly for a 2+ hour game. My wife really enjoys it, and we're continuing to fiddle with the rules.

Update: this one just had so much potential that never quite materialized. We tried various fixes and variants, but I think the game is just too long to sustain the randomness it throws at you (for my own tastes anyway).

Pre-ordered sometime in April 2011 because I have a friend who is deeply into urban planning as a career.  He approved.

It's more chaotic than Dominant Species. Especially in 4 players game, there is no way to plan a head. By the time your turn comes, most of the contract cards have been replaced by the newly drawn ones, and not to mention random events that will come out. Another down-side is the long down-time, in a 4 players game, approximately it will take about 20 minutes before you can do your next turn. It is a heavy chaotic game that does not worth the 3 hours playing time. It will be more appealing if can be played within 90 minutes. 18xx fans should stay away from this one.

Having played once, I think I would approach the game differently.  Much is left out of your control due to unpredictable scoring occurring right after your turn.  Knowing the cards can help in terms of planning but it's not a given that any particular scoring will occur and some may occur more often.  It's an interesting take on area control and money versus points.  I really enjoyed my first play, most likely because I wasn't brain burning too much.

Fascinating game! Similar in length and strategy to dominant species. Need to take a few breaks with this game. Also, when you think there is no hope and all is lost... It is possible to just have one amazing play and pull out a win.

Building the city is clever and intriguing. I wish there was some way to label the buildings ss you build them into the city, so that by the end of the game you could see the city you created. I always feel like, I built a high school and a landfill...I wish I could remember where I built those...cause that would be cool. Not to mention building that shopping mart next to the landfill, probably won't be good for my opponent's political campaign. Anyway, this of course doesn't effect game play at all. It just goes to show you that you really get involved in your city planning...such a good game.

It seemed fun to play.  However, myself and most people I have played with found the game totally random due to complete chaotic random events.  You have no idea which buildings will or will not come out in a game, and you have no idea which events will come out, you cant really plan ahead at all or have any kind of strategy.

Downtime is high because the cards on offer change so quickly that you cant think ahead at all of what you want to do on your turn until it gets to you.

A points collection game. You get 6 actions to acquire permit cards and use these to build contracts to get your cubes on the board, where both permits and contracts are available from drafts, with the oldest requiring 1 action, next 2 actions, and so on. With only 6 actions, it's going to take a super special card to take anything but the cheaper stuff, as the name of the game is to get as many buildings out as you can. There's an attraction to erecting buildings that require lots of permits as they give better building bonuses. After every turn, the replenishment of the drafts will cause all sorts of events to happen, which randomly award or punish players who have the most or least of the various types of buildings. So it's pretty random what buildings and permits will be available on your turn, and then its pretty random whether you'll be punished or rewarded via events while its not your turn. Making for a fairly random game, meaning the attraction is in the theme, which isn't bad, but the components really let the game down, just building little colored tiles instead of an actual house for instance like Big City does. At the end of Big City, you can admire the magnificence of what you've collectively constructed, which generally overcomes any shortcomings the game has. Here, all you get is a bunch of colored tiles with cubes on them, turning it into an abstract affair despite the cards doing their best to bring the theme to life. The game mechanics are clean and easy to teach, and individual turns themselves were enjoyable, if a little long trying to work out the optimal spot to place a building that you can both afford and will get you closer to earning a cube majority in both the row and the column it's in (as majorities earn money and VP payouts throughout). These decisions each turn are the crux of the game. Unfortunately, the game just doesn't deliver enough theme to overcome the randomness and its abstractedness.

RATING: 5
The game has a nice theme and interesting mechanics, but it's a bit broken since if you don't watch yourself you can end up with serious "running away leader" and/or "loser left behind"

It's also a pity the quality of the cardboard pieces are VERY low, they fall apart or at least get split edges immediately. Comparing to what you get, and how much you pay you'd expect way higher quality. 

After a few more sessions its established that the control of the game is about placing and/or moving the red & yellow value markers. They are just too strong and can lock out the loser-left-behind and escalate the run-away-leader. Sorry to say but I'll have to downgrade my initial "6".

An excellent strategy game that just has too much randomness in the events and payouts.  If the chaos were reined in a bit -- and with a few house rules I think it can be -- this could be a solid 8.

Can't see this being the first choice of people i game with but I can see it being pulled out every now and again.

I like the game though it can take a little longer than expected, reminds me of plying SimCity as a kid just no option in US to release agiant robot on your city!

The special powers from the roles add some spice to what could become a dull game.  As I said before I like it but it's a try before you buy type of game.

A very nice looking game, but quite chaotic since events occur often and are quite random. You collect building permits that allow you to build buildings while also looking out for elections, vocations and events. The events are mixed into the permit and build cards and can cause large fluctuations in points. Also, the build cards often have events attached to them, so you can get lucky and have cheap cards available that can give you a lot of points. The game is frustrating and the 2 hours plus drag and often have wildly varying scores. I am not sure if you can really plan ahead or develop a strategy, just go with it or play something else.

Need to play this one again.  It's possible to dig yourself a huge, insurmountable hole--I know, I did it.  However, I feel like different decisions would have resulted in a better game.  Much less on-the-fly calculation than in Dominant Species; if you know what you're looking for, it's not hard to assess the board position.  I'm concerned about the quantity of events plus other people's buildings affecting you: while being in a better position is almost certain to help you out, it seems like the ratio of you playing the game versus the game playing you is somewhat low.

Comment: Such mixed reviews for this game. Really reminds me of Dominant Species in the sense that you need to ride out the chaos and plan ahead for it. People mentioned quite a bit of luck and while I agree, I feel like most of it can be planned ahead for. Knowledge of some of the cards really helps, especially knowing what to avoid. Great game, a bit long and can get really mathy without the web app.

Rating may change after I have a few more plays (particularly with more than two.) I very much like the concept of the game -- basically urban planning-- and the mechanics of it, which are well thought out and reminiscent of city politics fit the theme very well. For the first two-thirds of the game everything was very even... but then there was a runaway leader situation when one player got most of the politician cards. Also, the urban renewal card isn't terribly useful in a two-player game (at least in the final third of the game) since due to the contractor role. More plays may prove me wrong and show this was all a fluke. Overall, I like the game, but wasn't quite as wowed by it as I was Dominant Species (which is one of my few 10's.)

RATING: 4
Rating after 1 play: 8. In some ways this felt like DomSp, but it also has a unique flavor. There is perhaps more randomness in the way that card actions are executed as soon as they are revealed. There is also much less downtime (based on my measly one play of each). 

Area control on a grid was interesting. Rather than just controlling a region, a player is trying to control "rows," or the area between 2 streets. Thus, playing on a single block will always influence two rows. I really look forward to trying this again.

As a Dominant Species - fan I had some high expectations of this one. When I played it, I found it a good for the first 2 hours (dispite the big chaos the event cards can create), but the 3rd hour was a bit too much for me. It was clear that I would win and the gap between me and the rest just became greater and greater;

There is a variant in the rules for a shorter game and maybe that will be perfect for this game.

Construct a city and try to own the most valuable properties while also having the most cubes in each row of the city grid. Very harsh, game routinely helps the player in the lead, which normally I hate in a game, but for some reason it works here to the game's advantage, as players scramble to stay out of last place. A lot of city builder games try to do what this game does, and don't do it even half as well. One of the amazing things about this game is that the player who winds up with the Mayoral role, has to hand out special and powerful effect cards to the other players.

The game does flow a lot better with a simple spreadsheet showing what the current values of each row are, so that you can quickly at a glance discern which spot on the grid is most and least valuable, as this is frequently used by the game's effects to either help or punish a player.

Fantastic game, that isn’t about building a city, but about placing buildings in the most valuable locations (area control).  The types of buildings you control will put you in the running for a politician role and determine how random event cards affect you.  This one keeps you on your toes. You have to make sure you are improving your presence in the valuable locations, or you are constructing over opponent’s buildings in those locations.  Rule set is simple and every detail has been carefully crafted by the designer.  Appreciate the limited options of what can be done in a turn, which keeps the game moving.  Enjoy how the 3 decks of building contracts progresses the game.  Great components, especially love the think paper money.

A disappointment, there are a lot of good ideas and it could have been a great game However, it became another game where the total is less than the sum of its parts. 

I very much liked the way the Town, City and Metropolis decks interacted. However, I would have to agree with the variant not to flush the existing cards but only activate the new deck. The flush of cards can introduce to many events at one time and give too large of advantage to the next player in line.

I liked the 3 legged component of needing contract, permits and money to build. Having the specialized events activated by building was procedurally straight forward and enjoyable. The vocations bonuses derived from building work out well.

The events in the planning deck do not work as well. The spew of events during the end of the first pass of the planning deck seems to have broken almost every play. Couple this with the City deck firing in about the same time. If you can get through that horrible first pass the game actually settles down.  

The Politicians in concept is a nice idea - however electing all at once at the airport event is unbalancing especially coupled placement of the higher value chits whose initial placement seems to occur during the same time. I found that one person monopolizes. Subsequent elections then become geared to pry the politicians away from that player. During the play only the union boss and district attorney seem to be unbalancing the others have relatively modest effects.

Procedurally to keep up with the high value building in each class, high and low value blocks especially as the additional chits appear wore me out trying to keep up. I think that and the lengthy end of turn to calculate payouts, reposition politicians are the reasons it doesn't capture the players interest for the duration. After trying a few methods of tracking using a computer assistant spreadsheet is a must.

I find it has a ridiculous run-away leader problem - the rich get richer. However, even the recipient of the runaway could not state what was the cause other than having the right card come up, or to be just ahead when the spew of planning deck events fired. 
I found the higher value wealth placement to be crazy strong - so strong it decided each game in the first third (during the planning deck / airport event rush). All the events seem compound the issue of the leaders getting stronger. Spending most of the game trying to bash the leader from the first wave of events and elections does not make an interesting game.

Hit the sell-trade pile.

Kevesebb a ráhatás az eseményekre, mint a D.S-ban, mert ott a dominancia kártyákat előre tudtuk és fel lehetett készülni, itt viszont nem tudjuk mikor mi jön ki.

Unpleasantly long.  I am glad I enjoyed the company of the three other players and that I only had to play once.

Distressed to have to rate this game so low. It would have been excellent as a 90-minute or 2-hour game. At three hours and up, it seriously overstays its welcome. The unwanted extra time is entirely from performing fiddly match calculations and waiting endlessly for other players to take their turns. You can't even plan ahead much during other players' turns, because the board changes too chaotically. You have to wait and see what your opportunities really are before you can think very hard about what you want to do.

Perhaps this improves with familiarity, but at the moment I have little desire to become more familiar with this game. (Later: After a second game, my opinion has not changed. Way too much chaos, way too much randomness in the cards.)

The game feels arbitrary, or perhaps simply chaotic to me. Without memorizing the decks for each age, there are so many random "i took all your money/stole your property" effects as to make flipping in new cards potentially contradict your strategy on very turn. Did not like!

Although not as epic as Dominant Species, this is a solid economic game of city building and area control, using tile placement with relative value calculation as well as a card drafting mechanic that uses action points as the currency of choice. With a multitude of zones, permits, contracts, and payout bonuses to track, as well as bonus tokens that function as "power tracks" and ways to "improve neighborhoods" during the course of the game, this is a strong, comprehensive design that is solid but somehow lacks that "wow" factor. The artwork could be partially to blame, but the production is absolutely top notch.

Not as fun as I had hoped.  I pre-ordered the game thinking it would be a fun SimCity like game, but the randomness of the card draw really makes the game chaotic, you can't really plan out the next move because by time it is your turn all of the cards have changed (4 player game) so you can't plan out what you want to do until it is your turn.  Made the game really slow.

It is a great game with a lot to like.  The action point system and the way all the different scoring is amazing and does so Chad's genius much as Dominant Species does.  However, the game is long with a little of little fiddly scoring/income steps that on this first play dragged it down.  I think it will improve with more play as Dominant Species did but will have to see it.

Nevertheless, even when [i]Urban Sprawl[/i] shares some elements with a few of them, it feels original and fresh at the same time, and earns itself a privilege place in the category. Players get wealth or points for constructing adjacent to buildings of the same kind; for having the majority of buildings in every row; for getting vocations associated with buildings; for being elected in political offices, that is for having the most valuable building in each of the categories or having the most vocations; for having money at the end of the game, and for the most amazing and unthinkable card effects. There is a lot of luck involved, perhaps more than the acceptable standard for a game of this weight and lenght, but somehow this time it just feels that it fits ok with gameplay, at the point that I'd say that it doesn't seem to be more important than good play in order to determine the victory. This is not a game of planning ahead, even when there is some of that, but to optimize your turn earning the most points or valuable positions with whatever you found at the table. Most of what you do is spending action points to get the building permits that allow you to construct. The game is as simple as that, and it is enough to give the players a lot of meaty decisions to think about. Nice and functional components. Even when I dislike paper money, this time it is so thick that it works perfectly well. The official variant for shorter games seems to be mandatory, at least in the first games, and I wouldn't play it with more than three players, cause the duration could banish the interest and fun away.

After my first three-player game of this I can say I am eager to get this back to the table again.  I've heard it referred to as chaotic - but that's not quite the right word.  Random?  Yes, it can be - but as the game progresses, the randomness seems to even out and I think that on the next play it will be even better.

With three players once the game gets going there is almost no down time especially as we chose to have one person move and flip the Planning deck cards and another handle the Town/City/Metropolis decks.  Just be sure you keep track of whose turn it is when those events start showing up.  Oh, wait, that's why they gave you the Active Player marker.  ;)

I wanted to like this more than I do but it's just way to chaotic, no way to plan your moves ahead of time, the last third of the game needs work especially the way the contractor can turn into a king maker by bashing the leader.

In a 3 player game one guy was out ahead from the start because of the way the numbers came up for scoring and having the media marker.  There wasn't a chance to take it way for a long time and when the right card came up he was able to build and keep it.  For two thirds of the game he was 50+ points ahead of me in last place.  Second was 30+ behind.  How we both can ultimately catch up and pass him in points is rediculous.

About as chaotic as I'd expected from what I'd heard. About as long as well.

I felt like the events came out too often and were too swingy. I would have preferred to see a separate Event deck, which would have like 0-2 Ballot boxes, 1 or 2 Income/prestige payout lines to resolve, and some event - so you get 1 per turn, not between 0 and like 7.

Also, some of the events, and I guess some of the contracts as well, were very swingy. I was in last place by like 15 points or so, and after 1 turn-end crazy event resolution stuff I ended up in the lead, and it only went uphill from there. I won 207-95-70, and while I can point to several things I did that seem good and on purpose, I definitely don't think I did anything to deserve that big of a win, and I definitely saw other players do great stuff only to have their points ripped from them by random events.

Among equally skilled players, luck will play an important role in a game of Urban Sprawl, since it is very important which cards are available at a player's turn. Also, if you are expecting Urban Sprawl to be a pure Eurogame (as a lot of people did) you will most likely be disappointed after your first game. This game cannot be categorized solely as a Eurogame, since it also includes direct conflict through razing of buildings.

I was aware of all this before playing the game for the first time, so I was pleasantly surprised with its thematic and engaging gameplay. If you like thematic, card-driven games and don't mind a moderate dose of luck in a game then you should definitely try this out.

PS: I always play this game with 3 or 2 players. I would only recommend this game for 4 players, if they are not bothered by large downtimes between turns.

My merciful God!!! Don't make me suffer anymore!! I believe I've lost most of my valuable brain cells. I don't think I want to play this again! Terrible downtime, no need to pay attention to the others because you don't know what will be the case in your turn, very random elements.

RATING: 2
Very wild game. Only played a 4-player game, and you got nearly no control about the development of the city nor the game result. "Stuff" happens, and you can't do anything about it. What sounds like having the potential of an entertaining rolercoaster ride, due to unpredictable ups and downs, is more like standing a storm on the high seas. The game lasts way to long, to be entertaining.

RATING: 6
City-building-themed game: tile placement, rotating bonuses for various in-game achievements, and random events transpire over the course of three eras of urban development.  Game's winner holds the most points of prestige when the card is drawn that concludes the game's final era.

Upside: Well-written/illustrated rules, decent artwork, and good development of theme yields a game that can appeal to mixed gaming groups.  Even those who vow to never read rule books can pick up the basic premise in a single observation.  Game play is diceless.  3-hour play time allows for a single-evening session with experienced players;  Good replayability for those willing to get past some of the game's shortcomings.

Drawbacks: Beware of players with 'analysis paralysis.' Even in the absence of this, there is too much dead time between turns in a 4-player session.  Some people have aptly described elements (the event cards) of game play as "too chaotic."  A proverbial worst-to-first comeback is totally plausible--something the more causal gamers may actually like, while the more serious strategists in your group will feel their blood boil.  Anchor your table if there are hotheads in your fray!

Reduce the number of these game-changing event cards in play--perhaps by employing some house-rule variations-- and Urban Sprawl just might have enough charm to earn another point on your BGG rating scale.

RATING: 5
Revised rating from 8 to 7 to 5.

Revision 2: Have officially given up on US after 20 odd plays. Game removed from car boot to look pretty on the shelf.   

Revision: I still like US and want to stick with it to figure it out beyond that of just playing it but I'm pretty sure my gaming group universally think it contains too many 'unfair' situations either via a stream of event cards coming out in succession, to the game abruptly ending without chances to finalise things, to the unsatisfying end game scoring. Pretty sure they're not willing to sit through another 3 hours to play this when there are other 3 hour titles out there.

More approachable than Dominant Species and a shorter playing time too at around 3-4. However I better appreciated 4-6 hours of DS because I could plan myriad devious things during the downtime. The cards change too drastically by the time it's your turn again in 4 player US, although you can still sketch out a couple of probable actions you'd like to do. There's a bit more randomness in US but overall, the game is still as deep and fulfilling as DS.  

It really helped that I played with a great bunch of people. We spent most of our down time joking about how our city was progressing (the pink player had settled his residentials in a poshy part of town and had just opened a textile factory nearby :D).

Hoping to try this game again with 2 players...something dodgy happened whereby I had the media and all the roles including contractor...didn't sit well with the other player.

An interesting concept. 

The components do this one no favors, as the concept would really benefit from some colorful pieces. As it is, it plays rather dryly, and I can't get my group interested in trying it again.

RATING: 7
Flavours of Dominant Species, a sort of strategic surf boarding through chaos and cut throat property management - a great ride! 

I am a sucker for card drafting games and Sim City so I do have a bias.

However, of the four other people I know who have played it all dislike the game - with tales of wild randomness in the games they have played.

In my first game I recognised the value of risk management and min/maxing the area majority part of the game and the bonus points from the politicians which, I think, helped me win the game.

What I did not love though was the constant small payouts via events and the Media vocation - it slowed the game down.

I want to get to know the game a lot better and I think to do so I am going to need to know the event cards well - some change the game. With Dominant Species there are only a limited number of game changers so they can be pointed out at the beginning - here there appears to be a lot more

2nd Game - i really enjoyed the jockeying for control of the Politicians and battles for the prime Prestige scoring rows

The game is quite tough though - new players can get crushed and miss some of the things you have to do - you must must must have building permits at hand to cover all eventual draws from the building deck, you must also be prepared to negative draft the buildings deck (I think this is key)- and the favour space is needed for that. The other thing difficult to guage in the first couple of game sis the balance required between VPs and income, I think its a mistake to worry to much about income - it can be got through building permits, whereas a steady dribble of VPS is gravy. The other thing to note is the changing importance over time of the different type of buildings, so res. is great early and the larger civic building later.

I still feel that the game is too long by 30 -45 minutes and I think this can be managed by thinning each building deck by 3 or 4 cards

3rd game 2p - prefer with 3. Noticed that pace of game does feel off, to slow maybe compared to DS?

 I really want to like it but in my one play with 4 players, the downtime killed it.  I don't generally mind downtime, but what I don't like is downtime where there is nothing to do.  THe game state changes way too much by the end of each players turn to allow for any semblance of planning.  

This is unfortunate because I really do think that this is a really good design.  Next time I play it will be with less players.

I have now played with 3 players and wow, what an awesome experience.  I'd still say there are 40% too many events, but the gameplay is top notch.  I have played this a few more times now, all with fewer than four players.  The two player game actually holds up well but the contractor makes little sense in a two player game and even in a multiplayer game I think it is too much of a kingmaker.

RATING: 4
I really enjoy this game.  People who look through my ratings might ultimately be confused why it is rated so highly when I tend to hate games with a lot of randomness and chaos.  Well, given the right theme, any mechanics can be good for a game, and this is just one of those games.

I absolutely love how building permits, what can be built, and even who gets elected is basically entirely random.  This is an excellent simulation of what real-life urban sprawl is like.  Just like a speculative stock market, people rise to and fall from power almost at random based on the whims of a populace too responsive to even the tiniest of social changes.  Buildings rise and fall as idiotic investors give money to contractors who undercut others, then do superfluous or outright deficient jobs, requiring the homeowner's association to spend more money fixing up the mess.  It's a very cynical take on real life, and I love it.

UPDATE:  Game downgraded to a 4.  Repeated plays have revealed an ugly side to the game.  Although the chaos can be somewhat mitigated by effective play, I absolutely detest someone getting ahead by sheer luck of the draw.  For instance, if you go first in the game and one of the first cards you can build gives you the 11 or 12 wealth token, you pretty much win the game, especially if it comes up slightly later during the game.  This is because you will place it on a block where you will almost always get the benefit from it when it pays out.  Unless a card comes out where someone can move it, nothing can be done about it.

To put it in perspective, my uncle had been faring pretty poorly during his first game against us experienced players.  I realize that the Prestige Point track isn't always a good indicator of who's winning, but when the score is like 40 to 5, you have a pretty good idea.  However, he got the 12 point wealth marker and because he placed it on a row where he had 3 of the 4 building types in the current high-value block, he became three of the politicians at once.  This was not poor play on our parts; many of us were poised to change the high-value block as soon as a card came out.  Because it came out on his turn, though, it meant he was able to swing from worst to first in uncanny fashion.  Also, because it was the highest-valued wealth marker, it meant that nobody could change which block was the highest-value unless they could pull a card that would move the marker.

This design makes me detest the game.  What is the point if the game is basically decided by who gets the best cards when?  The game needs to reward good play more and not so much being the lucky guy to get a good card when it pops out.

It's interesting, a bit chaotic.  So far I've only played solo.  I'm concerned that my friends will not enjoy it - there is some calculation to be made on a regular basis, but at the same time the board can shift dramatically from turn to turn.  Sounds fantastic to me, but we'll see if they like it.

All the elements mesh nicely together... into a long, chaotic experience that is less than the sum of its parts.

The game is subject to what I think of as "the Le Havre problem", i.e. that really good play is impossible without knowing the details of a hundred separate building cards. But on the other hand -- and this is the worst defense I have ever heard -- play is so tactical that it hardly matters. You can't plan more than one or two turns ahead at most, and said plans will as likely as not be frustrated by random drawing in the meantime.

If it played in one hour instead of three, my feelings would be very different. But the weight of the game does not deserve its length.

Theme feels somewhat pasted on.  Game is fairly easy to learn but may take a couple of plays to get everything.  Game play is very chaotic.  For a game that is about planning construction of a city, it is somewhat difficult to do any planning.  The luck of the draw factors in heavily too.  Components are excellent - colorful mounted board, thick chits, and durable cards.  game length is 2+ hours and feels a bit long.

First game feels quite "chaotic" (in the game designer language sense of the word) and "random".
With repeated plays, however, you get some idea of how to let your actions and gameplan "flow" with the game.
Somehow reminds me very much of Air Baron, although these two are totally different games.

Very accessible and fun game - I was hooked on my first play. The theme is strongly integrated into this design.

Components are really top notch (I did toss the cardboard insert to open up interior box space). Eurogamers and wargamers should have no problems here.

Play escalates with each deck, and titles (e.g., DA, Treasurer, etc.) are important (especially so at the end-game scoring).

Criticism of too much chaos fails to comprehend that the events are the oil that keep the game engine running.

There is no run-away leader problem either, as in US it's pretty much impossible to be too far behind (unless play is very poor). The Contractor helps level things, too.

Too much downtime? Nope. Pay attention to the strategy of others and ensure that they are calculating things correctly (it's easy to overlook or sum rows wrong during the excitement of play). Events often affect non-active players, too - keeps them engaged. And you can start to plan your next turn once the player before you uses his AP's and chooses his cards.

The only complaint I have is that some of the cards could have been worded better (more clearly); it's hard at times to tell what text affects only the active player and what text affects the entire table.

There's a good balance between luck (chaos) and strategy (tactics) here. This is a fine design that I wish we'd play more often (3P being the preferred option, but good also with 4 also if you have the right group).

So near yet so far. The first hour of play felt great, and then came the long, long slog towards game end. I guess things do change a bit between town, city & metropolis decks but they don't change enough to leave you with a real sense of progression through the game.

The randomness and seemingly arbitrary events didn't bother me at all (although to be fair, I was generally a beneficiary). I just wish it was all compressed down a bit. Three hours would have been fine. Our game was a lot longer.

RATING: 8
Impressive city builder with tile placing, area influence and card drafting mechanisms. The aim is to construct different types of buildings on the board which represents a grid of plots in a city. To achieve this you need to collect permit cards that allow construction cards representing buildings to be played. This is turn allows the player to place tiles (buildings) onto the board. Some areas of the city are more valuable than others and prestige (victory points) are awarded to players having constructed the majority of buildings in certain areas. The game is nowhere near as random and chaotic as some people have claimed and careful placement of buildings does reap rewards. The one qualm I have with the game is the catch-up mechanism that allows the player in last place to demolish other people's buildings whilst being immune to such an action from other players in return. It feels a bit clumsy, rewards poor play somewhat and provides an excellent opportunity for kingmaking. Overall though this is a deeply strategic game and engrossing to play. Kudos also for the production quality of the game, which is excellent - the 'paper' money is thicker than some of the cards in other games I've played.

Tentative rating based on one play aborted during the 'Metropolis' stage.  (Due to three of the players not really enjoying the game)

I enjoyed it...at first.  But rapidly, it started to get a bit annoying, having to deal with the four-way cross of property values, making it difficult to track what it the most valuable and least valuable.

The strategy struck me as a bit obtuse. I realize that it's clearly possible to formulate a strategy, as the fourth player (who was kicking our butts) clearly had done so (and had played once before).  Like I said, it's tentative. I'm willing to try it again.

Played with four players. Lengthy game. Never able to catch up after a few high value row markers were placed by a player. Lots of addition (4 directions) on every potential placement. Lots of plays benefit other players more than yourself. Never saw what strategy worked, besides holding offices near the end of the game. Just not very visually appealing to me, but I can see it appeal to math and graphing fans, who don't like actual visual representations of things.

A whopping monster of a game. I really liked how the game played still I have some negative points. 

It just doesn't look like you're building a city. In the end there are just coloured squares on a big square. I think it could have been easily possible to make individual buildings printed on the tiles to place on the board. It would just look so much better if the Fire Station is recognizable as one and not just a red square.

The other problem I have with the game is the luck factor with the right cards showing up which is in my opinion too high for a game that plays 3+ hours.

Played once - would try again.

Well, I won the first game but I am not by any means sure why. I played specifically to getting the media marker at the start of the game. I played to high value rows when I could afford it. I didn't really pay any attention to what type of building I was building, I just did what I could on my turn.

And then a bunch of events happened that benefited me more than others at the table. Towards the end, the game ended up un-fun for the other players because they were so far behind. It was the first game, granted, but the thorough and apparently random butt-whooping they received will make it harder to get this to the table again.

First Impression based on a half play:

An area control euro game, that I didn't like in almost every possible way. 

I can accept that it may be a working design. I can't disprove that based on half a play.

I really don't like the theme on this one. Combined with the dull artwork, the overall experience is a bad one, as the game is highly unimersive. In addition, the area control chaos is reinforced by a series of mechanics that failed for me, including random starting contracts, random scoring, random payment, random events and so on. The overall chaos created is beyond what I care to consider manageble. The game also suffers from downtime, as the "map" will change a lot before you play.

Overall it's a thematically dull, chaotic, heavy euro attempt. I can stand thematically dull games (hansa teutonica). I can stand chaotic games (roborally). I can stand heavy euros (terra mystica). What I can't stand at all is the combination.

RATING: 5
My reaction to this game was pretty lukewarm, and can best be summed up as "why would I ever choose this to play over Dominant Species?". And that is coming from someone who appreciates DS but is by no means a huge fan of that either (rating of 7 currently). US suffers from two issues for me. First, the amount of chaos created by the cards and player actions makes long term strategic planning difficult to impossible. This would not be a problem if the game were significantly shorter and/or less calculational, but tends to suck the enjoyment out of a game this long. One wants to try and keep calculating and anticipating everything, but it is a bit pointless given the chaos. Second, US just has way, way too much upkeep for what is basically an area majority game. And it is an area majority game that is neither as thematically integrated nor as cleverly executed as Dominant Species to justify the time spent on all the upkeep and calculations. So in the end, I'd rather play either a simpler and shorter area majority game with a higher enjoyment-to-time ratio such as the mask trilogy or Dominant Species which at least gives a greater payoff for the time, effort and brain burn involved.

I've read the rules and it looks like everything you would expect from a Chad Jensen Euro. Simple rules to follow, but more than enough depth to satisfy even the most hard core gamer. Received my preorder from GMT on November 9, 2011.

* Finally got to play this. Essentially an area control game with a few interesting mechanics like the election track and the scoring of areas based on the refilling of the card tracks. I like what I see here. I'm afraid it might run a little long with 4 players.

Very chaotic and long for what it is. Sometimes feels too much like a game of 'do the sums' when calculating values of buildings.

Initial rating of 5 based on a 3 player game that I didn't enjoy much at all but I can see there is some hope of a game for 2 players. I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt based on that and go to a 5 rating.

UPDATE: Played a couple of 2 player games and it's better. I think I'd like to play around with the game length and positioning of those trigger cards some to find the right ratio that works for us as a 2 player game. As of now going to keep the rating at just a 5.

Simple and elegant rules result in a city development game. This is a great game. People will argue that there is a lot of randomness in the game, but the purpose of the game is to handle this randomness. It is not a luck game. It is a strategy game. You will have a great time for 4 hours. It has the same stochastic behavior as Dominant Species. I prefer for now Dominant Species mainly because of the theme. In both games, you play against your opponents and a system of randomness. You have to take care of both!!!

I feel like I should like this game more than I do.  And there are aspects I do like.  But the game length, analysis paralysis, constant recalculating, reward the leader problem, and general chaos just make it not a good experience.  You can work towards having the best buildings and if the 'move the 12' comes out on the wrong player's turn, you're screwed.

RATING: 7
[thing=62220][/thing] was fun to play and way more easy to learn than I thought. Basically the players have 6 action points to spend every turn, and this is used to pick building permits and buildings itself to build. The player chooses a place in the board to build, pay the costs and activate the building power (always a one shot deal, as, once the build is put, it only serves as a type of building - civ, commercial, residential, etc). There are lots of possibilities, as each building is unique in its one-time effect, the size of it (which requires different permits), its type and, also, the place it is in the track - as the higher it is, the more AP it will require to be taken.

The game is somewhat prone to AP, since it is difficulty to predict your actions before your turn, as you can be sure of what permits and buildings will be available once your turn is up (not only because of what is already showing, but also because new permits and buildings appear just before every player's turn). So, once it is your turn, it that you really start planning what to do. And, in between turns, when cards are being revealed, will happen, sometimes, random events, which can have a big impact also in your plans.

[thing=62220][/thing] sure have a good deal of randomness - which is, basically, the main complain of many against it. Not only the events happen at random (though, with more plays, you can know what they do, but, even with this, is hard to actually prepare and benefit from them, as is not a sure thing which ones will occur, as there are event cards that makes the deck be reshuffled, therefore, some events can happen twice, while others, never - for instance, in this play, the event that gives points and money to whoever has more residential buildings occured twice, while the one for most civ buildings, not once). To counter somewhat this, the game has political roles (mayor, district attorney, police chief, etc) and the Contractor, which is given to the player with the least prestige (points) - this role allows the player to build over someone else's building, which can make a whole lot of difference and is, basically, the catch-up mechanism in the game.

One thing I found weird is the end game. Sure, the other random things may harm, but they aren't all that major, and one player can recover from them. But the game end also happens randomly, whith the Olympics being shuffled in a part of the deck (so players have a ballpark guess as when the game will end). And is totally possible for the game to end with some players having one turn more than others, and this is huge, specially with the big one-time powers of the Metropolis buildings - in our final turns, each play would net 10+ points, and this in a game of around 100-120 points, or around 10% of the total points of the game. This is the only part of the game I don't liked.

One thing I thought would bother me somewhat was the fact that, once the building is built, is just one more token on the board, without any sort of function or uniqueness except for its color and a cube of the owner on top of it. But, considering the sheer amount of different buildings (in different eras - Town, City and Metropolis) it would be crazy hard to keep up with all the different buildings if they were, well, different. It works pretty well being just a token on the board, for scoring (for money and for prestige) purposes, and way less fiddly, since the buildings, once on the board, don't have more uses besides scoring, and would be a hassle to hunt for the 1-space School tile, or the 2-space DMV and so on. In the end, it was the right choice for the game.

Overall, I enjoyed quite a bit my play of [thing=62220][/thing], but I can see that some random events and, most of all, the end game can have a huge impact on the game, so I can't give a higher rating. I do recommend the fast game, as you basically can do all the same things, and, being shorter, the swings of luck will bother less. The bits are GMT-style: not great art, nor awesome graphic design, but it fits well and do the job perfectly.

Good game, just takes so long between turns. I like area control games but weighed down here a little by constantly having to calculate values of plots.

[u]Update May 2014:[/u] still haven't got back to play, and unlikely as it's overhead & mania subverts the beautiful idea of city planning. But I'd still would like to try it as a 2- or 3-player and houseruling the frenetics. Salvaged, it could be great.

[u]Original comment:[/u]
While the first 4-player was rocky as we didn't grasp it's levers & it spun into a terribly drawn-out & random affair (exacerbated by some rules mismanagement), the ambition of the layered mechanics, spatial richness, & thematic beauty were fascinating & pleasurable. I remember the early (and ongoing) initial exposures to [b]Innovation[/b] stamped it with a 'chaotic' meme rather than finding the sustainable tactical depth and drama it reveals with more play & expertise. My hope is Urban Sprawl has solid underpinnings to be discovered and I can enjoy it's exuberant edge that differentiates it from other Euro games.

I cannot tell if some early reports are hasty and that Urban Sprawl takes some patience to unpack, or if it's too ambitious & will need some creative houseruling to contain it's unruliness. My rating represents high value in finding out.

I agree with geekbuddy Dormammu, who says the upkeep related to chaining events is just too much, prompting groans when one after another was flipped from the contracts deck. The game can't enter a flow, these interruptions are frustrating. 

Given a chance, I'll be exploring putting Event cards into a separate deck & either flipping one or two after each round of turns, whatever tempo fits the game incentives. City events to be shuffled in when the City contracts deck enters, etc.

Urban Sprawl is a game for 2-4 players. Urban Sprawl abstractly models the growth of a town into a thriving city into a teeming metropolis.
Players assume the roles of entrepreneur, tycoon and politician -- each helping in the development of a hypothetical "Anywhere, USA." Wealth and Prestige will be earned and spent throughout the game. Buildings will rise only to later be demolished for better and larger fare.
Throughout the game players will gather valuable Permits. These will result in either a wealthy Investment or the foundation of a new building Contract. Players will strive to become dominant in one or more building Zones in order to acquire beneficial political offices.
All of this eventually leads to the end game - a vibrant metropolis that is revered around the world - when the player with the most Prestige will be crowned the winner.

A well-balanced and lengthy Euro-style city builder, which requires quick-thinking players balance several resources to successfully construct additional buildings in a growing city. Several mechanisms built into the game prevent any one player from seizing early control and cruising to victory. However, the game is unnecessarily complex at times, and the city never feels real, as buildings on the board end up as just different colors on city blocks, even if the builder built a zoo or an airport.

Great theme with an ambitious but flawed game.  Urban development as city planners and not as real estate tycoons is an underutilized theme, even if there's very little 'sprawl' in this game.  The events and buildings feel appropriate for the city.  The game's biggest feature and also one of its biggest flaws in the district valuation.  The fact that the district prices fluctuate wildly is cool, adds randomness to the game, and alleviates the already significant runaway leader problem.  But at the same time, it makes the game unpredictable, ruining careful planning in ways that are impossible to predict.  It's nothing like [gameid=62219] mechanically or thematically, but it tastes like the same 1 hour experience in a 3 hour game.

I enjoyed my one play so far but I felt that the end game took a bit too long.  I understand you can take some cards out to speed it up a bit.  I think that would improve the experience for me.  Overall, I loved how the game played and how the mechanics fit together, it just took a bit too long to wrap up.

Be careful of getting elected Mayor. The randomness turns off some of my group so this doesn't hit the table as often as I'd like, but I really like it nonetheless. Jensen's uberfocus on tactics becomes a weird, zen-like approach to strategy after a while. Can't quite explain it or even fully understand it yet. Need. Moar. Plays!

I'd only really want to play this game again with 4 people. 3 I would still do it, but a 2 player game wouldn't be so fun. There's a number of offices that you can hold within the city at any given time, so it works best when multiple people can hold multiple offices. Also, the urban renewal (aka bulldoze) cards are pointless in the 2 player game, yet still included. Anyway, this game will take you 3-4 hours, and you'll feel a bit mentally exhausted at the end. Turns are simple, but the decision tree gets really complicated, really quickly.

The theme is compelling and ambitious, but the mechanics at best don't live up to what "sim-city the board game" could have been and at worst are downright problematic. Specifically, the card system spawns an inordinate amount of chaos with all the random events and payouts that happen, with no ability to predict whether certain cards will come up once, a bunch of times, or not at all(!). The card drafting system, which IS the game, is also excessively tactical and one-dimensional, creating way too much "rinse and repeat" for a game that exceeds 3 hours, not to mention it hands out and limits opportunities at random depending on what cards are in the queue when it comes around to your turn. A disappointment, which strangely made me downgrade my rating for Dominant Species after seeing more clearly how this designer's sensibility doesn't match up with my own.

My main complaint is that it doesn't feel like a game about city-building, more like fitting tiles on a board in order to maximize profits. Apart from that, however, it seems like a solid game, even if really too long for what it is.

Chad Jensen have mixed Ginkgopolis with Through the Ages, developing the Dominant Species idea in the oposite direction. It's as tactical as Dominant Species, but now the action is in the cards, not in the board. You have to get a good position in the board in order to gain prestige and income, but you also have to know when to play the right building card in the right time, to get as much reward as possible. It's a very good game with constant interaction and lots of strategic possibilities.

Urban Sprawl is a pretty solid effort at bringing the Sim City experience to a boardgame. Although the process of building the city is fairly abstracted, the various event cards and property valuation system allows the city to develop in a memorable way every time the game is played. It does run a little long, mostly due to the difficulty of planning out your turn ahead of time. The available buildings are constantly in flux, so often times any attempt to plot out your moves before your turn ends up being a complete waste of time.

Despite that slight bit of chaos, I like it. Even when it's running long I still feel engaged all the way through. There's enough disaster cards in the mix to keep everyone on their toes and enough direct and indirect interaction to make almost every move interesting. It's no Dominant Species, but it's still a very good effort by Chad Jensen that I'm glad to have in my collection.

Ottimo gioco sulle speculazioni edilizie, altissima interazione anche perchè è pericolossissimo non controllare il gioco degli avversari.

Where to start? The game should be called 3 Hours of Chaos. 

Major AP, Runaway leader problem, very little strategy, mostly reacting to changes by other players and waiting for your turn to come around, hopefully there will something for you to do.

RATING: 6
Way more abstract than I expected. No sense of a city or any permanence. Lots of minor accounting, and very, very tactical.

Still, some good ideas, and I think it will have the (paradoxical) virtue of being enjoyable when played infrequently, as you'd have to be a real masochist to study it and try to play it strategically. You get on, enjoy the ride, make some "choices", and see what happens.

As a strategy game, though, I'm deeply skeptical.

Initial impression:  this game rocks!  There is a lot of chaos flying at you, but it feels like good play matters.  This game has the same sort of interacting majorities as Dominant Species (here it's majorities on rows vs. majorities on colors) as well as working on maintaining a good number of vocations.

The theme is well-integrated, and I like watching how the city develops.  Individual buildings are amusingly themed and so are the politicians.  End game scoring is important but not overwhelming.

Looking forward to more.

Rating after one play. Mid game I would have said the rating was much higher. Late mid game if felt like we had a run away leader that we just couldn't catch. I'm definitely willing to play at least one more time. I want to read the rules for myself and look over the cards to get a better feel for the game. I almost feel like a few tweaks could have made this a great game. I love the theme and visuals. Not sure if this will stand the test of time or not. The jury is out.

Think I like this better than Dominant Species. There's definitely just as much swinginess as DS, and more luck, but the decisions are more manageable because your range of options is smaller, though the considerations in making that decision are still large.

After two plays I'm not sure quite what to make of this game. Certainly it's not great with two players, but this isn't unusual for games that claim to be for 2 or more players. I suspect Urban Sprawl will be better with three or four players. I was enjoying the game during the Town phase, but once it progressed into the City phase the fun rapidly drained away, as the game became increasingly fiddly and random. There are some nice ideas in Urban Sprawl, but I don't think that they work together as a coherent whole. Laurel liked the game, but still thought that changes would improve the gameplay. The game definitely felt too long, especially given the fairly chaotic nature of the game. Reducing the number of cards that are in the decks above the airport and olympics cards would shorten the game and possibly make it more palatable. I've given this a 5 rating for the moment, but this may change (either way) after a game with three or four players.

Mechanisms sounds great. There are many interesting ideas... But the game is much too fiddly and chaotic (even with modification that events don't come into play until reshuffling of the deck). If calculations were made by a computer this game could be great but with 4 or 5 payouts each turn plus some events it's starting to drag after the town phase and fun just dissapears

You had me at SimCity the board game.  Of course... as someone who enjoys SimCity more when I turn off the disasters the random events this isn't my favorite... but looking past that you have an interesting game of balancing your permit and wealth resources while trying to get the most bang for your buck out of the special effects of your buildings.  Add in fighting for majorites in the best payoff rows and trying to have the best building to gain key offices and you have a lot of intersting, tactical decisions to make on your turns.  Sometimes its frustrating when you can't makea good move (or any move) based on the combination of buildings and permits that come out of the deck... but I'm enjoying watching the city grow and finding the best play every turn when I play all the same.  So something I won't play a lot... but do enjoy while I'm playing.

I got in a hole early on and never recovered - and still had fun the entire time.  Maybe it was the sense of exploration and the sense of the unknown.  "Wow, look at what that building does!" was heard several times throughout our first game.  I look forward to playing again, and soon.

I've played this game both as the far behind loser as well as the runaway leader.  This game has no balancing mechanism and constantly rewards the leaders so it can be nearly impossible to come from behind.  The ability to influence the game with strategic decisions is too often overwhelmed by events beyond your control.  Significant events occur without warning and can have large prestige shifts.  Payouts are unpredictable so you can't try to maximize your payout.  Cards played by other players can cause you to lose all of your money and destroy your plans.  If the powerful cards never show up on your turn you are out of luck.  I would not mind some randomness if it was dampened a bit, but as it currently exists, the cumulative effect overshadowed many of my decisions.  This game can be incredibly tedious if you have bad luck, but not very satisfying if you are doing really well because the right cards came up for you.

Very complex game that borders on pure chaos sometimes.  Has a luck element that can be hard to mitigate but is really a "screw your buddy" type element.  If the player sitting in front of you in rotation is a guy who likes to hose you out of your options rather than do what's best for him, this could easily become frustrating.

Those quibbles aside, I think this game is great.  Not quite as great as his Dominant Species, but it's a wonderful ride.  Complaints about it being purely luck driven are drivel.

After 1 Play: Way, way too much chaos for a game of this length.  First, it is almost entirely tactical, which isn't a good thing for a three hour game.  You simply have no idea what options you'll have next turn.  Second, the random payouts are annoying throughout the game.  They are probably pretty even through the deck, but you only go through about half the deck each era, so some players are probably going to be screwed.  Third, The card effects get increasingly crazy as the game progresses, and in the final era they will, quite frankly, determine the winner.

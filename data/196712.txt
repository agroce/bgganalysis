"1 squares and 28mm plastic figurines.....a huge power armor figurine! 
Ship speed got cleaned up, runs smoother and easier to understand. 
New special abilities and a purge of ones that no one used. 
There is a solo play, but I like running this for friends, family and at cons. Not much use to me, but others will like it.
Quick start rules, I don't need them but they will be nice to give to my new or beginning players at conventions.
**Advanced rule book**
All the rules, expansions, and species in one place.
New art.
New missions and some 1.1 version ones.
300 pages

Been playing the game for 14 years and I can see myself playing another 14.

RATING: 10
I love Battlestations - it really can be either a simple and straight forward board game, like Imperial Assault or Descent (one versus many), but it is a much more rewarding and incredible experience if everyone gets into the story and the cooperation and role plays a bit, with the Enemy player as game master slash enemy. A massive achievement that needs to build a larger base.

Played through for the first time, and had a blast. A lot of fun. After the first game I am looking forward to playing with the full rules and made characters. It looks like a real winner!

Fantastic edition of a very unique classic. This game is huge and expansive in scope, and the tutorial walk-through in the new boxed game is fantastic.

If you have the previous versions of this game, I'd wholeheartedly recommend you upgrade pronto.

I thought this was hot garbage, not helped by being "taught" the game by somebody who didn't really know it. Constantly having to make super-high die checks to do anything useful at all is a formula for pure frustration. FTL: The Board Game seems like a great idea, but this is not the way to do it.

If you believe dice are all you need for a foundational game mechanism, and that absolutely any amount of content (stories, abilities, equipment, weapons, etc.) can and should be piled on this foundation, this will be a goldmine for you.

Picked this up to play solo (as the box stated 1-9 players).

In a nutshell, as published, the game CANNOT be played solo.  Here are some of the reasons:

#1 Only a tutorial is included with the base ($85) game

#2 Solo rules are available in the "Advanced" rule book, available for another $50

Wrote to the publisher/Designer as the 1-9 players listed on the box is misleading, not to say false.

Jeff responded as follows:

The 32 page book is all that comes in the box.

You can play solo by managing the enemy characters and playing your own characters. Enlist a friend for secret information as needed.

There are more elaborate rules for solo play in the advanced rulebook.
--------------
It goes without saying, the need to "Enlist a friend" clearly demonstrate the base game cannot be played solo.

So I spent another $50 to get the "Advance Rule Book", as it contained "more elaborate rules for solo play".

Here again, major disappointment:

#1 There are only 3.5 pages of "Solo" rules (in the 300 page rule book)

#2 Although the cover is thick, as one would expect from a hardcover book, the binding is mediocre at best; my copy arrived with the cover and "book" held together by the first and last pages...  There was very little glue on the binding, which resulted in the front and back cover splitting from the "book".

For a 300 page book, bad/cheap glue spells disaster.  Was expecting better quality for $50...

#3 Better sit down for this one....  In the solo rules under "Secrets", the following is mentioned:

"If the mission contains secrets players aren't meant to know, one player must become the Oracle.  The Oracle's job is to read the 'Enemy's Eyes Only' section and only reveal information from it as they deem necessary during play."

**Here again, if you need another player, the game cannot be played solo**

#4 There is but a single page of "Tactical Doctrine Flowchart", which are listed point form (ie. there is no flowchart).  The IF-Condition-Then system is fairly basic.

In conclusion, the game cannot realistically be played solo, even with the Advanced Rule Book.

As a solo game, my rating would be a '1', as the game REQUIRES a GM or, as suggested in the Advanced Rule book, an "Oracle", to provide the "secret" mission details at the appropriate time.

So if your intent was to play solo, save yourself $135 and pickup another title.

Why did I rate it a '4' ?  The overall production quality of the game's components is pretty good,  especially when compared to the first edition.

Time permitting, and if I don't trade it beforehand, I will be writing a more in depth review, for the Solo Boardgamer group on FB.

I purchased this title at Origins 2017, and was very impressed with not only the game but the designer Jeff Siadek. Jeff sold me on the title, he took the time to teach my daughter how to play and that made all the difference. We had the first edition and this new second edition release is top shelf quality. This was well worth the price and Jeff signed the rule set.

This is not only a great game, but an excellent tool for aspiring GMs who wish to sharpen their skills at running an RPG!  

Playing as the Enemy in my first game of this was a very rewarding experience for me.  My opponent who was playing the part of a Tentac Marine with 3 Non-Sentient Bots by her side was a great time for her as well.

The first mission Rebellion was a nail biter from start to finish for the both of us.  It was like an epic game of tug and war whilst absolute chaos erupted all around us!

She achieved a well deserved Victory and we are looking forward to playing through the 8 mission campaign in the Rule Book.  

Then after that comes the Advanced Rule Book for me and...WOW!  I'm speechless...Literally, any question I have, anything I wonder about doing or adding into a game is in this book!  

I estimate in a few months from now, we will both embark on many epic campaigns where literally anything can happen; only limited by our imaginations!  I would rate this game beyond a 10 if I could!  Hands down the finest example of how to go about blending the world of high adventure RPGs into a board game!

Battlestations is a tabletop starship simulator – a multi-map board game that simultaneously features ship-action in space AND the events on board the ships involved in the conflicts. It is also a roleplaying game in which your characters grow throughout campaigns, picking up experience points, upgrades, and new abilities.

The game rules are very simple but they allow for complex RPG-like imaginative choices like teleporting to an enemy ship, hacking their helm controls and steering their ship towards a black hole before ejecting yourself out the air lock. Inside the box is an infinity of alien worlds to explore, rickety spacecrafts to upgrade, and a rowdy crew of lifelong comrades to adventure with.

Excellent, have played the first version and this is modernised, exciting and the only game I can find having the cross between roleplaying and boardgaming.   Ideally is the roleplay element a sort legacy idea that Roleplaying has had for a long time.  Give this one a try.

Disclaimer: Initial first impressions

Heat Signature and FTL the board game essentially. ( However this game was around long before FTL and Heat Signature )

Better than the previous edition. Still has issues. Still has rules that after all these years are not completely hammered out, but it's much better than it was. Combining all the rules into one book is much appreciated. Organization is still not fantastic but better. Still the odd rule hidden here and there through out the book which can make looking up a certain specific rules a pain initially. Rules are still a bit old school in their design. While nothing individually is complicated it all comes together feeling like it could have been streamlined better with more modern design choices. 

I believe the primary issue is that the game is designed like an RPG trying to be a board game instead of a board game trying to emulate an RPG ( like Gloomhaven for instance). This feels like a Paladium books RPG trying to be a board game ish thing. The rule book certainly feels more RPG rule book than board game. The thing is it didn't have to be that way.  While improvements have been made the rules could have been more concise and I think more skills and certain aspects of the game could have been stripped away that don't add much value to the game play. Like most co-ops I think the game plays better with fewer players rather than more ( more decisions per player to make).  Like an RPG a play session lives and dies by the scenario design. Also a note to designers: Please don't combine the rules and the scenarios. Keep them separate.

I absolutely love the concept of the game and it seems to have inspired other recent games in the indie video game space which I have enjoyed. I like this game with the right scenarios and it can be quite memorable. But it can also be frustrating and fall flat at other times. This game is so close to being completely awesome, but it just continues to miss the mark which can be frustrating. I find myself tooling around with the rule set and making my own modifications and streamlining. That said I still greatly enjoy this game despite the negatives as the good experiences can be really great. This new edition is superior to the old one and people with the old one should upgrade.

This game can be a 10 but short comings in it's design hold it back. Perhaps 3rd edition will finally nail it. OR maybe I just keep expecting this to be a board game and that's where I'm going wrong? It really is a very light RPG? I don't know... I'd say be a RPG or be a board game. Don't try to straddle the line otherwise you disappoint at both designs.

As I learn and play more of this edition I will be altering these thoughts. Currently I rate the game an 8 and an improvement over the last edition. The rating could go up or down.

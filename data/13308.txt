Been playing this a lot lately!  It's a great introductory game because the components are so pretty, and the game play is thematic as well as fun.  If you only have three players, definitely have a dummy player who just flips a card over, so the river is more unpredictable!  [update]  I do really like this game--one problem is that the winner can be a by-gone conclusion, especially in the round after everybody's tiles get replenished.  I'm pretty curious about the expansion to this, though, since I've played it enough to want some added options.

Reasonable game with beautiful parts, and I like the 3 ways to win.

There is a lot of second guessing as to what others will play (as this affects how the river will flow).  With more players, the river flows more slowly as a rule (more chance of a low number), but you are more likely to have gems stolen.

You have to scratch your head a fair few times to work out where you are likely to end up.  The river always seems to flow down one side then the other alternately so you can get a feel for where you are likely to be at the end of the turn be with good planning.  Knowing when to use your weather cards (perhaps when both of your boats are ashore or way upstream) and low and high cards is a critical skill.

I would say that the game works best with 4 players, though 3 and 5 is ok.

I've even played this as a two player - you can do this two ways.  Either have a dummy set of paddle cards and turn them at random so that there is sometimes a lower number than the numbers the two real players play.  Or knock one off the flow of the river if it is 2 or above.  If you don't do one of those things, then the river flows too quickly with 2 players.

I am looking forward to playing this one with my kids.  They are 5 and 7 and have already shown some interest in it, but I think we'd have to play in teams right now until they get a little older.

As an adults' game though, I think this is ok, but that's all.

RATING: 6
Feel this is probably best with 3 or 4. I don't know if the resource amounts change but with 6 it's incredibly hard to do anything other than collect 7 different stones than a single set or single colour. There's also quite a lot of "you have to stop this person winning" towards the end and it comes down to getting lucky with who can stop you.

Wonderful cute little game. The idea of driving the canoes on a flowing river, risking to loose them down the the waterfall is really unique. The game is just mean enough to make it challenging and force the players to plan their strategy. The game has just enough luck components to grant surprises even for the best planned strategy. 
The game pieces, down to the gems and canoes and especially the board with the river disks are very nicely designed.

Played this a couple weeks ago with my wife and parents, and we were all very pleasantly surprised. They've already said that they're interested in playing again. Very accessible to new gamers (altho reading the rules to learn it was a mistake), but with some nice choices in there as well. Definitely will be pulling it out again.

Further update: traded away.  The movement rules are too fiddly for me to justify keeping.

Update: Downgraded from a 6.  Not getting the strategy in this--so chaotic.  Not sure I WANT to get it.

Neat mechanism!  The river is WAY too volatile with just three players.  The three different end conditions always causes the end to sneak up on you.  Minor gripe: you don't keep your gems on the board, so it's really hard to tell (without standing up) how many gems the opponent(s) across from you have!

Physically attractive, super attractive.  And the game works well: simple, no explicit luck elements (other than simultaneous action selection), a nice balance of control vs. chaos, and of planning vs. interaction (stealing gems).  Multiple victory conditions which are all valid and meaningful.  Works well within the stated range of 3-5, but the players need to take the faster river flow in account when playing with 3.  Strong theme, simple and fun for novices, strategic and substantial for gamers.

RATING: 6
I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Nice family game with a pretty good visual presentation. The artwork, the wooden pieces, the acrylic gems are all very nice but even more I like the gimmick of using the box as a mount for the board and the one that makes the river actually flow.

Gameplay-wise the game is very straight-forward, but it allows for some simple choices and some interaction as well. Therefore it's not hard to understand why this game won the Spiel des Jahres. Yet, even though I recognize Niagara to be a good game, I didn't particularly enjoy it. I was absolutely entertained by it, just maybe not really impressed. The reason being that I felt the game to be too long for what it offered, even if it's actually pretty quick. Maybe if the game had something else to spice things up, I would have enjoyed it more.

Niagara is a nice family game with excellent components, that surely works for the crowd it was awarded for. Just to me it seems a little forgettable in the long run. Still decent, but definitively not great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun game with beautiful components which greatly enhance the experience.  Not real deep in strategy, but has enough variables to keep you guessing, and fine-tuning your plans.  Far too often you're up the creek without a paddle.  This works as an excellent filler after the main dish, and as the main dish for family gaming.

A pretty simple game with a small amount of depth.  You play cards to determine how far your boat moves, but you have to be careful which cards you play.  You have to use up your cards before you get them back, so if you use your high numbered cards at first, you will be playing low numbered cards later in the game.  The river moves you a certain number of spaces each turn, and if you have no high numbered cards left when the river is moving at high speeds, you will fall over the waterfall.  The components are great, and the way you move the river is done spectacularly.  A+ for components, B for gameplay.

A big "eh" from me on this one.  Gameplay didn't even seem interesting enough to use as a gateway game.  Sure, the bits are nice...but the river movement mechanic (while cool) is fiddly and not enough to save the game from a rather bland ruleset.  

That, for some reason, required a 12-page rulebook.

{1 play, 4 players} Well, It's Zoch, so you know it's gonna look cool and have fun, maybe innovating stuff going on, design-wise.  But is there a good game there?  Sort of.  For me, this one is a fish with feathers - it looks light and should play light, yet the meat of the game is kind of heavy.  Okay, it doesn't *have* to play heavy - you can play ANY game light and fast if you want to - but regardless of how you choose to play this one, Niagara can *support* heavy.  It's not that light a design: some bluff, second-guessing, hand management, different victory conditions, damage control strategy, turn order advantage, stealing... whew.  I mean, that's kind of a lot to ask for from a game in which you'd might forgo winning if it meant getting a chance to see your opponent's canoe go over the falls :)  I know some will appreciate this complexity, but it didn't fit for me.  A game this fluffy-looking should be simpler, and lest you think that means dumber, I think High Society is simpler than this one... and at the same time, maybe more deep.  I *want* to like something this cool-looking, but, for me, the game design does not deliver the "fun" that the board promises.

RATING: 7
Arguably, the components and the river mechanism have novelty that aids this game in its general appeal.  Behind the glitz lies a mild strategy game with a twist of risk management.  The stealing rule makes game play less formulaic, but may result in frustration by beginning players still struggling with the basic aspects of the game.  The game has a light look and feel, but tends to take longer and require more thought than initial impressions reveal.  This can make the game feel slower.  [GTI Code: TPSL]

The river mechanism is gimmicky, and if you like gimmicks, this one delivers.  It's fun to move the river, but the game itself is kind of wanting.  There are better race games, but this one has a slot for innovation.  I won't ask to play it, but will play if it is suggested.

I'm really not enamored with this game and think Manilla (or something else) should have won the Spiel des Jahres in 2004. Essentially a gimmicky game that might play well with the family. Best strategy is to start with low paddles and then finish off with highs and then go through that cycle over and over until someone wins. The game only gets interesting in the 2 or 3 go around of tiles, as the initial setup and best starting strategy is always the same.

I own The Spirits of Niagara expansion.

Initial Play: 10 Nov. 2007
The game isn't actually bad at all.  The game is light but it is actually pretty cool.  I like the paddle mechanism because you have a set amount of speed per round.  Either you paddle hard and fast this turn and get where you want to, but pay for it as you are going to have a hard time paddling up the river so you don't go down in the Falls.  I am surprised how much I liked the game.  It is simple and fun.  This is a solid 7.

My boys (6 and 3) absolutely love this game. They always pick this for family game time. We have to help out the 3 year old, but he really loves it for the waterfall, boats, and crystal collection. Like a toy playset. My husband likes it because of the strategy and he usually manages to win.

I really like this one.  The simultaneous card selection helps to keep the game moving and creates the tension of wondering just how fast the river will move.  Great mechanics and theme!

[COLOR=#959595][SIZE=7]Deutscher Spiele Preis 2nd Place 2005[/SIZE][/COLOR]

[i]Posted: 10/11/05, Rated: 9[/i]

I got this game as a gift recently.  I requested it because I want to try the various [i][geekurl=/wiki/page/Spiel_des_Jahres]Spiel des Jahres[/geekurl][/i] and [i][geekurl=/wiki/page/Deutscher_Spiele_Preis]Deutscher Spiele Preis[/geekurl][/i] winners.  The concept and box art are a bit cartoony, and there appears to be a fair amount of backlash towards this title here at BGG.

After a couple of incomplete games played with my family, I am definitely in the honeymoon phase with it.  The river mechanism is wonderfully novel.  The rules aren't written very concisely, but in practice they are clean and elegant.  Gem stealing can be ruthless, but it can also be left out.

The real challenge is in trying to guess which tiles my opponents will be playing, so that I can plan my moves accordingly.  Often I have to plan three or four rounds in advance, trying to figure out how I can ride out the river until the tiles are refreshed.  Then I can play a five or six to return to shore.  I like games that allow for advance planning, and the limited turn options available in [i]Niagara[/i] allow me to do just that.

A game with a novel mechanic, that plays well with the family, that can be as confrontational as you care to make it, and allows a player to plan several moves in advance.  A very enjoyable combination!

[i]Updated: 3/31/06, Rated: 8[/i]

PROS: All the same as mentioned above.  Still a great game for getting people back into board gaming.

CONS: Even with moderately-experienced players, [i]Niagara[/i] feels like a very scripted experience.  Rush for the purple and white gems.  If everyone [i]doesn't[/i] do this, then one person is highly likely to win the game by getting four gems of one color.  Perhaps fewer gems should be used when playing with less than five people.

Fun, though I like a bit more randomness and player interaction.  I've only played with three and my niece refused to allow anyone to steal gems from other players. I expect it'd be more interactive with more players and/or more larceny. (2007)

Updated Oct-2014 - Well, I found out we were playing by the wrong rules and it's actually much better than I gave it credit for.  Will probably sneak into my top twenty.

There's a lot more to this game than I expected.  It's especially hard to manipulate things well enough so that you can pluck off the rubies near the waterfall without going over!  This game has a unique mechanic for moving the canoes downstream, and I like the way movement is determined here better than in Caribbean, even though the two techniques are similar.

Great looking game but the rules leave a lot to be desired. The different victory conditions are not balanced at all. In our experience the four of a kind is way to  easy and much quicker than any of the other goals. This is even more the case when playing with 3 players. Still because of the looks it still is an okay game to play with younger children once in while.

This not as light and fruity a game as it seems. There's definitely some depth to this. I think it might be found somewhere in trying to make your two canoes work differently and efficiently enough in a)prediction of your opponent's move resulting in a successful steal and b) service of your own pick ups. Timely play of the weather card also seems key. I'm definitely intrigued. More to follow...

This game is pure eye-candy, and it actually has some decent strategy to it as well.  I love the way you can choose to row down fast and snatch up the hard to reach gems, or you can row slow and let the river push you along to the gems you want.  There is also a ruthless edge to this game that you don't realize right away.  Stealing gems is almost a necessity, and forcing the river to flow faster in order to doom an opponent is a smart move as well.

The components are absolutely awesome, and people just have fun watching the river flow along.  Learning the strategies of when to influence the weather may take a bit more time, but I still think there's enough here to attract most non-gamers.  What makes it even better for non-gamers is the very short play time.  A game really does only take about 30 to 45 minutes.  And I have yet to see someone win by gathering 4 purple gems, so don't let the haters scare you away, there's not one sure path to victory.

Initial ranking. We played it a tad incorrectly, with everyone showing their bid at once, which definitely had an impact on the game (and not a good one). The design is so cool, two of the other four players went out and bought this later that week. Would like to try with the proper rules, and then see how I feel about this one.

VERY pretty pieces, including a working waterfall.  There [i]is[/i] skill to this game, including deciding which gems to go for, when to go for a steal, and when to play your high and low paddle cards to control the flow of the river.  However, as usual, with more players, the skill does decrease as loss of control increases.

UPDATE: lowered my rating from an 8 to 7.  The mid-game can be a bit longish, especially if someone speeds up the river.  Also, although the river CAN be used strategically, often times it feels as if it's just slowing the game down (like your walking up the down escalator).  Also, adding to what I said above, I think the game may be best as a strategy game with 3 players. Above that, and it's more of a more-chaos-than-control light family game.

Very tactical game of shuttling gems to the safety area.  Really fun, tho.  Not a lot of long term planning, but you can plan a turn or two ahead and see if the plan works to your favor. The river and the production value really add to the fun factor.  Did I say fun factor?  Well, I enjoyed it and looking forward to playing again.  Glad I finally played this one instead of trading it.

Personally, I love this game.  The colorful bits, lack of luck, quality components, and moving river mechanics makes this game a hoot.  While the strategies are fairly simple, the tactics are not.  I have not played this game with five yet but have played it with 3 and 4.  I liked 4 more than 3 and think I'd like 5 more than 3 as well.  I think this game does better with more player interaction.  With 3 there is too much chance for everyone to be in the same position adopting the same tactics making for a repetitive, frustrating game.

OK, this is sort of interesting, but often seems to end very abruptly.  Not sure if it's because we're not good at seeing when someone is close to winning.

All the wins I've seen are by getting 4 of a kind, from the first or second gem spot.  I guess it's important to ensure that no one person can get 4 gems from each of those spots.

I'm OK with playing this more, but it's not something I'm dying to play.  My rating could improve if I play it enough to get better at it.

I went into my first play of this game having heard so much whining and negative comments on it that I'm almost certainly biased against this game from the outset.   Seemed pretty bland to me, but the components were good and the decisions not entirely trivial.  The part of the game that seems a little broken is that the incentive to go down near the end of the falls seems limited.   It appears to me that it's far easier/safer to get 4 of a crystal or 7 of different ones.  Not only do you have to worry about falling over the edge for the bottom crystals, but you have to worry about theft on the way back up too.  Not at all sure it's worth the time or risk to pursue the strategy that the game appears to be trying to push.

However, the main mechanics of playing a limited, identical set of hand cards simultaneously is better executed in games like "El Grande" or "Salamanca".

Well first off, obviously props for novelty factor / production values.

That aside, this a pretty good light game. There's some interesting decisions to make, tension, and a little bit of screwage. Good stuff all around.

Feels like it could be too easy to steal from people to prevent the win and draw the game out a little too much, but this is addressed in the expansion as there's more gems moving around.

Slightly boring. There are some strategic moves moving down river and what gems to grab. I would like more variables in the game. I like to have more going on, however, this is a great family game and good for an occasional game with gamers. It's nothing I would seek to play but would play if that's what everyone else wants.

We have only played this with 2 players.  We now use a dummy set of cards and fewer gems (as suggested here on bgg).  Before pushing the river each round, 1 dummy card is turned up and factored into the river's speed.  Without this, the river flows way too fast and it is very difficult to make any progress up-river.  With the normal rules, the river's speed is determined by the lowest card played, so the movement of that player is essentially negated by the river's flow.  The dummy card really helps to even out this frustration.  This is a great looking game and really like the river concept.  This game has alot of family appeal.

Simultaneous movement selection followed by a group-think driven mechanism that really can hose you. Great production value and seemed fun in theory. Something was missing in the practice. Either you overthink the permutations of the simultaneous selection or you don't think it through at all. The game doesn't justify the deep analysis, but the game disappears entirely with no analysis.

Bought for my 8 year old nephew.  Played a starter game with nephews, and it looks like a great choice!  Great bits, excellent mechanics, strategy, etc.  A fun game I'll likely always agree to play.

This game is a lot better than I expected. Its got a wonderful concept with the river/waterfall.  The components are very engaging. I had expected a light family game, which it CAN be, but there's more in the box than that.

The multiple paths to victory and the theiving possibilities vs the risk of finding one's canoes too far down-river make a nice tension. With shrewd gamers, this one can come to life as a short tense game of bluffing and gambling.

Unfortunately, with better (more cut-throat) players, the game will tend to get longer than I want it to. Its best if played as a light family game, which, I suppose, is why it won SdJ.

Nem értem hogyan lett ez Év játéka díjas...
Egyébként rendben lenne, de az "akciószám" választás legtöbb esetben egyértelmű, ha valaki belekerül egy rossz helyzetbe, nagyon nehezen jut ki belőle (ha egyáltalán kijut). Ráadásul mindig az nyer, aki hamarabb összegyűjt 4 ugyanolyat a legközelebbi drágakövekből... Ha dolgoznának még rajta, tetszene, így nem tudom hányszor fogjuk elővenni...

Viszont nagyon szép játék és a hangulata is fantasztikus.

Tökéletesen alkalmas, hogy a gyerekeket bevezessük a játékok világába. A 4 éves kislányom oda van a kincsekért, és mivel ismeri a számokat a csónakokat is tudja mozgatni (felhő lap még nem játszik).
Bár a szél még nem fúj, de a meteorológusok szerint idővel ez is bekövetkezik :-) Illetve a Niagara is még csak allóvíz.

Felnőttekkel játszva jó hangulat alakul ki, izgalmas játék.  Az evezőlapokat jól kell használni, mások előtt kell járni gondolatban. Segíti a taktikázást, hogy befolyásolhatjuk a folyó sebességét, viharfelhőket küldve a Niagarára. A lopás nem egyszerű, de nagyon hasznos tud lenni. Jól le lett modellezve a folyó kiszámíthatatlansága (de mégis a magunk malmára hajthatjuk a Niagarát).

Great fun!  Fantastic idea to have the clear discs sending the canoes down the river, though they do need a little help sometimes.  Have only played once with the kids so far, but looking forward to more plays.  Haven't yet tried out the rule where you can steal gems from other players (the kids hate that rule), but obviously that would add a lot to the game.  Looking forward to playing with adults who can "take the heat".  :)  The discs don't always work perfectly, but they provide an interesting mechanic nonetheless.

RATING: 4
Iguazu was never meant to end up in my collection after I tried to play it with the Knizia-trick (2 players playing for 4). The basic strategy is quickly learned: low numbers are to be used for going downstream, and for upstream you want to hold on to the biggies. So far so good. It gets even better as people begin to see how the river 'flows', and sending a boat over the edge of the falls is always cause for much 'delight'. But where it begins to break down is that the game with the basic rules takes far too long. There isn't much variety in what goes on, and then the winning conditions seem awfully hard to obtain. 4 equal gems is hard (and easy to block), 5 different gems is nigh impossible as the red gems are [i]very[/i] sought after and thus easily nicked, meaning that the game is most likely to end with the 7 random gems-condition. Getting 7 gems ashore will take a while. Quite a while&mdash;and that's the only thing which stands in the way of Iguazu becoming a good game. 

So how did the game end up in my collection? A sale at the distributor netted me this title at a whopping discount, and my intention was to present it as a gift to others. But that never seemed to happen, and when I moved house I decided that spending two years in foil was long enough, and opened the box. In the meantime, some variants had appeared: some clever geeks have come up with an idea to make it less of a chore and more of an interesting race by altering some of the victory conditions. I played several times with that variant, and it seems to work okay in that the game now ends in a reasonable amount of time. To say that this is a good game is too much praise, but to take it out once every while with the family suits its nature perfectly now.

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español]** El Niagara a medida que lo he probado me ha gustado cada vez más. Muy bueno para gente jugadora y no jugadora.

Es muy simple y repetitivo pero es un juegazo con mucha interacción con el tablero y con jugadores.

El mecanismo básico consiste en tener que calcular en sumas (número de la paleta) y restas (la cascada) con el objetivo de conseguir en varios turnos las gemas. Se podría decir que es un juego en el que no existe la suerte o es casi nula, muy recomendado para 3 jugadores y para más se puede decir que es un poco caótico o muy difícil de "calcular". Dos horas es una exageración pero se puede alargar un poco más de lo normal en algunas partidas, en cambio, otras se pueden acabar en 10 minutos. Esta larga duración entiendo que al ser un juego en el que hay que razonar que paleta jugarán los demás, y así jugar la mía, puede que este razonamiento llegue a ser en muchas ocasiones con jugadores avanzados a ser una deducción, algo que creo que le mereció en su momento ganar el premio MENSA.

Que es simple nadie lo duda, tienes que conseguir ganar lo antes posible, aunque a no tendrás que dejar de lado al contrario. Es un juego para 10-30 min. y hacer dos o tres partidas, siendo muy rentable el tiempo invertido en este juego.[/COLOR]

Production: Beautiful board, with grooves for both the river and for the gem deposits.  The gems are nice, irregular shapes.

Play: Fairly quick, fairly chaotic.  One can budget one's hand to a degree, but the river will move a certain amount based on the tiles chosen by others, making it difficult to predict the location of one's own canoe.  Definitely a game of predicting what one's opponent's will play. (3+1+2) (3 plays)

A game with a really interesting gimmick:  the river flows, and your canoes ride with or fight against the current.  Simultaneous selection from a set of possibilities determines your paddling strength each round, but you must use each selection once before being allowed to use any a second time.  Different win conditions (4 of a kind, or 1 each of the five different kinds, or any 7) means you have to keep an eye on your opponents, or they'll sneak up on the win.

Looks nice, but nothing new. Another game in the 6Nimmt, Piranha Pedro and Edel, Stein & Reich series that seems to have a little more strategy at first sight.

At third sight, the more I play it, the more I dislike it ; usually when you try to stop the leader, you blow your own chances.

What I liked:
* Nice concept of having the river flow pushing you further down the river.
* Nice components
* Good use of theme

What I didn't like:
* Poor instructions
* End game scoring - very easy to have more than 1 winner
* Pushing the disks didn't work to0 well at the "tounge", disks often get stuck or just went down one side (happens too often).

Despite a few issues that are pretty serious, I had a lot of fun playing this game and the theme is very apparent. With a different scoring mechanism this would easly go up another rating!

Man, those gems are so kewl, I wish they were in a different game. ; ) Honestly, I've only played it once and can't comment too much on the gameplay, but it seemed pretty fun. I guess I'm not as enamored with at as some are, but I'd play it again.

Looks great and the flowing river is well represented. It also had a lot more tactical depth than I expected. But it is a bit of a bluffing, double think, chaotic game which had little staying power with me.

I was very intrigued by the clever aspects of thie game including the way the river moves and how it falls off the edge of the board.  I even think the game play is clever.  A little random, but fun and clever.  The game might even go up in my rating but I'd have to play it more to be sure.  I only played it twice and I it was great fun both times.  I just had the feeling that after those two games, I had played enough of it.

As it is published by Zoch, I was expecting something light but fun for the kids, but this game was a surprise. Though you can play it without much deep thinking, playing it well requires some significant tactical planning and has a nice mix of available strategies. The mechanics are very clever and produce a real feeling of fighting the river. Easily the best game I know for the 8 to 12 age backet and enough to it for adults to really enjoy it.

I played this one with a friend to learn the game, then I sat down & played it with the family.  After our first game, my eldest son said "Can we play again?!?" - an obvious indication that this one is a keeper.  It would be on my top 10 family games list, but can overstay it's welcome.

Great game with lovely tension as the boats get closer to the Niagara Falls, and actually fall off the clever board and down the falls at some points in the game.

Played once since getting the game. It's a beer and pretzel board game.

Rules are rather simple and there is not a lot of decision making. This game shouldn't take 3 hours!

Second game was completely different from my first game a while back. Impression I first had was different. Rating dropped.

Mediocre. This gets a lot of grief for some reason, but I think it's a okay little game.  Who doesn't like watching the little canoes go over the falls?

This rating is for the base game without the Spirits of Niagara expansion.  The physical design of the waterfall and components is brilliant, but the game is just so-so.

This game is chaotic and can last quite some time when you lose your victory resources to get your boats back.  It fills a gateway niche but there are easier games to learn and are more fun to boot.  It does have the benefit of having very low luck but it sometimes feels so chaotic that it doesn't really matter.  Avoid this in favor of my gateway choices: Ticket to Ride, Aquädukt, Keltis, or Drakon.

Hay que tener cuidado con la caída y para ello siempre es bueno guardarte algún movimiento largo por si las condiciones climáticas empeoran.Es muy importante intentar robar a los demás pero también es muy importante que no te roben a tí. En cuanto tengas la piragua cargada descargala lo antes posible.

A fun game with a nifty mechanic about pushing canoes over the falls.

RATING: 9
Very impressive game. Lovely bits, very nice uncut gems, lovely mechanism, the sliding river, the switching left and right, nice timing mechanism, trying to out-think the others, trying to group think the round. Slightly confusing rules about when you can steal, and having the river up on box means you can't easily see the other players' winnings. But the theme really really works. It really felt like you were desperately paddling against the sudden torrent to stop going over the waterfall. I think this has got SdJ written all over it. Nice bits, nice play, clever play, fun. It's a winner, a must-buy game.

Looks pretty.  Kind of gimicky.  Not horrible though.  In fact, I generally have fun playing it.  There's just not much too it.

RATING: 7.5
Niagara has beautiful, high quality components & a good game flow. My only beef with the game is that the board is designed to sit ontop of the game box with the waterfall hanging off the edge. The circular discs push one another & any pawns ontop downstream. This is a great novelty, however the board crease 9 out of 10 times for us causes the discs to slip over one another & you have to hold the game board down as another player slides the discs. It's a frustrating thing, but a minor criticism for an all over pretty sweet game. Maybe this will improve after the gameboard gets worn in. I look forward to adding the expansion pack Spirits of Niagara in the near future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Played 1 time with 4 players. We got all the rules right, but we got the spirit wrong. The instructions are very intimidating for what is a simple pick-up/deliver game but I have to admit to having higher expectations. But the main problem was us: the players always wanted to prevent everyone from bringing gems home, so the river stayed at full flooding most of the game...which meant no one could bring anything home...whic meant the game took about 30 minutes longer than it should have. This game would be fun as a 30-40 minute family game, but as a 60-75 minute game, it's horrible. So you've been warned: don't flood too much. Then you have a fun race/delivery game that is light, fun, and gorgeous to look at. Chunky gemstones, big cheerful board, nice big canoes, etc.

RATING: 6.5
When played with 3-4 hard core gamers, we all loved it and had a blast.  When played with 5 or more non-gamers, hated it--after 1 hr+ of play, no one had any jewels & end of game no where in sight.  Played with another group of 3 and they hated it.  They said it was too repetitive and they got angry because they were getting nowhere.  I have played on 3 different game boards, two of which worked fine.  Mine just doesn't work.  The circles pop out of the river and I can't figure our why.

Wow, it won the SdJ. Ick. Anyway, Niagara is a strange turkey - player move their boats up and down the Niagara, trying to pick up gems and deliver them to port. They try to avoid getting their boats tossed down the falls, and gems can be stolen. All in all, this game is a chaotic mess that takes too damned long. When playing with the max number of players and everyone plays defensively, Niagara can take two hours to complete. The heck? It rubbed me the wrong way so much that I won't play it again anytime soon. Too bad, it looks great and all, but I can't stand it.

O jogo é bem fácil e divertido. O que chama mais atenção é o tabuleiro que é formado com a caixa do jogo. O jogo ocorre em um rio com cachoeiras perigosas e nos somos índios, aventureiros e mercenários atrás de cinco tipos de pedras preciosas escondidas em cavernas. Para chegar até elas temos que utilizar canoas e navegar no rio que se movimenta de forma inesperada. A mecânica de movimentação da água do rio é muito curiosa e divertida. Quem coletar ou roubar mais pedras, ou a melhor combinar seus tipos, vence o jogo. O ponto alto do jogo é a hora que nossa canoa cai, literalmente, na queda d’água. Bem legal.

This belongs to my daughter. We love collecting the shiny gems and shoving people's canoes over the waterfalls, but I'm not convinced we have ever completely paid attention to the rules.

Egyszerű, öt perces szabály, szép, ötletes kivitelezés. A hangulattal sincs semmi baj. Nincsenek benne túl komoly döntések, de még ezzel se lenne baj. A baj az, hogy az időjárás skálát nem gondolták át eléggé. Ha egyszer bekerül +2-be, akkor gyakorlatilag soha nem lesz vége a játéknak, mert akinek a legfontosabb, hogy csökkenjen, az nem csökkenthet, mert lepottyan. Ha csak +1-ig lehetne tolni, akkor vagy esetleg a felhőt rakó játékos fixen meg lenne mentve a leeséstől, akkor 6.5-öt adnék rá, mert egy hangulatos, gyors, családi játék.

RATING: 6.5
Nice light game, it's great to see canoes plummett over the edge.  Not knowing how fast the river goes, adds excitement of will my canoe survive this round if i get close to the falls.  This game is a great filler, but something you wouldn't want to play every week.

The waterfall is a great idea.  Collecting gems anywhere near it makes you feel really nervous!

Gorgeous bits and neat gimmick but game play is flat. Playing with cut-throat players makes the game agonizingly difficult.

Fairly typical SdJ winner. Light family fare, in this case with the waterfall as an extra gimmick. The water flow (moving the water tiles each turn) can be a bit fiddly at times. The expansions improve the game quite a bit.

02/20/07--Solid, light, goofy filler.  Visually nice looking, and there is strategy involved.  Too light to be SdJ, but then again, I think that we'll pretty much only see light games as SdJ from now on.  If I hadn't gotten this for a discount, I wouldn't have bought it, and might have actually been disappointed.  Fun, though, I'd gladly play it several more times in the right company.The board is a bit fiddly in terms of not always working as advertised, but after pushing a few discs across I noticed it seemed to flow better, so maybe the board needs some "working in."  EDIT:  Played again...despite everything "cool" happening in our game--players teetering on the edge of the falls, multiple boats going over at once, gem stealing left and right--it still felt pretty flat.  And the damn river still doesn't work as advertised, takes a lot of "guidance".The "four of one color" gem win condition is busted.  There's no reason to go for anything else.  If you can't go for that, that means someone else is going for it and is close to winning.  Just too many gems to choose from, even with four players.There are some things to like here, but this officially ended my consideration of the SdJ winning game as a "must try".    EDIT:  Traded away.  Buh-bye.

First off, AMAZING components - everything to expect from Zoch. Gameplay was occasionally tense, but overall things were either too predictable to care or too chaotic to worry about. Decisions were 90% of the time too limited and 99% of the time too obvious. The game was very repetitious - which is okay for a family game but it did get boring after awhile with the little choices to be made. I don't think any of us really enjoyed ourselves other than when we got to play out the gimmick, which I really liked. I wish the rules were a little more bulky, because the presentation is so good on this one. Too bad.

Really good game for non gamers and families alike. This is one of the best gateway games out there. Beautiful 3d board and, a really easy and innovative system. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
This is awful. I've played twice and couldn't wait for the game to end either time. The rules make no sense and are more a list of things that make sense that you can't do. The basic game without the Spirits expansion is particularly unplayable as there is no motivation to slow the river down enough for people to be able to retrieve any gems. I haven't had any fun playing this game, but I have bashed my head on the table a lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun and exciting light family game with a strong "wow" factor - those 3D boards and transparent "waterfall current" tiles helped me convert many non-gamers into boardgame fans. Contrarians who like to "go against the current" (heh) seem to excel more than most people at this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Niagara is a fun family friendly affair, with enough screwage to keep it afloat.  The group think in addition to the very cool river mechanic make for a light but not brain dead experience.  This is a title that fills that group chaos itch which Roborally used to, but with far less play time so irritation due to bad draws (leading to inevitable feelings of helplessness) doesn't set in.  The only luck however in Niagara is in what your opponents play, but that is minimized by the knowledge of what cards everyone has and awareness of positions on the board .  A solid and extremely attractive production.

This is a family game.
Everyone is always ready to play this.
Good one for a first gameboard play initiation.

Nice colors, graphics, pieces (diamonds) and gameboard ( like real water cascade).
Best with 4 players or more but playable with 3.
Too easy with 2 players.

I love this simple family game.
Take a laugh by playing the 'cloud tile' as your very first action of the game when playing with a bunch of newbies. They tend to plays high mouvement tiles at first. So, you fasten the river at  1. If this is the case, a lot of canoes will falls this turn. After laughing a bit, restart this first turn, they are now aware of whats going on in this game.

RATING: 5
Fun game. You really get the feeling of fighting the river to avoid the falls.
It's neat to move the boats, gems, and of course, the river.  Game play is generally fast, with the slightly varying paths to victory making things interesting.

It can be frustrating to some to fight the river all game, and at the end you feel you've survived, more than you feel you've won or lost. Rating could go higher on repeated plays.

Somehow, I never feel like playing this one again though... Replayability suspect.

Great kids game but brings a lot of fun to adults as well. And the look of the board - unforgettable :-) I enjoy it the most with 5 persons but 4 is also OK. Less - I do not recommend. It becomes very static.

If you show it to the family they probably won't play anything else. That was my case :-)

RATING: 7
Fun game with a very nice visual element. More varied than it seems at first, as doing well requires good resource management (you don't want to get caught in a bad place with your worst number cards), reading other players and manipulating the board to your advantage. Best with 4 players.

RATING: 7
PILE OF SHAME - Ran through the rules and played a dummy game against myself to see how it worked - now very keen to try it out as long as we can find a third to join us. The way the river moves faster the more people try to leap down it is very clever, as is the actual physical design of the river with the transparent disks sliding along the grooves.

Suspect the kids will enjoy the little gem pieces, too.

Cool components, quite good gameplay for 2-3, more chaos with 5.  Family game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great looking game that goes down well with lighter groups/players. And there's more depth than initially apparent. The core is in balancing the river speed/paddling speed and choosing between collecting and stealing gems. I need to play a few more times to firm up my view and rating. Update: After a few plays I find it a bit boring. Also the gems are impossible for me to tell apart (red-green colour blind) and I have to use substitutes, which spoils it a bit for me. Down to a 6.

Well, they certainly did a lot with the production of this game.  I had no idea that Niagara Falls was in the desert, and that there are magic gems to be had!  I am definitely going to have to go there someday.  The mechanic of the river is a little gimmicky, but it's a darn amusing gimmick.  The other Zoch SdJ nominee was Manila I believe, and I like that one more.  Still, this is a fun game.  I can't see playing this without the expansion, by the way.

The kids love this game.  I would rate it higher if it did not require an adult to supervise the game.  Kids seem to need constant reminders regarding the paddle cards, collection and stealing rules, as well as assistance with river movement.

An ingenious game with some novelty value as well.  The box converting into a waterfall is a cute touch which also adds some tension and drama to what is basically an elaborate rock-paper-scissors/outguessing-your-neighbour game mechanic.  The strategy is around trying to be first to meet one of the three victory conditions while attempting to prevent your opponents from doing so.  Keeping your boats alive helps, but bringing them back after letting them sail off Niagara Falls could sometimes be strategic.  Well worth a look.

We had an awesome time with this one, unique theme, beautiful bits, great with 4 or 5 players.  It seems it would be easy to misinterpret the weather mechanic: it's only to be used at the end of each round to move the river, it doesn't modify how individual canoes move each turn.

Let's face it, the waterfall mechanism / prop is pure theme and I love it. That said, the game seems to be missing just enough to keep it from great game territory. - I'll play it more and I hope to play with the expansion too to see if that moves it up a notch or two. The game would be very good for kids because of the massive visual aspect and I have to rate it at least a 7 because of that alone. Component quality is out of this world, theme is great, some of the rules are... well... need tweaking.

Very interesting game. There's not much else like it that I've played.  The moving game board concept I'm sure has been done before, but I haven't played any myself.  The mechanisms are simple enough that my whole family can play.  It's a little more cut throat than you might expect with the gem stealing would be the only negative, IMO, and only then for family play.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Great artwork, great set up, it really catches the attention of anyone  when being played. In every one has to calculate his movement, his gems but most of all the speed of the river. But after some plays I believe it loses much of the interest as it tends to become repeatable.

Very lightweight, but loads of fun to play. Kids would really love this game. The waterfall mechanic adds some level of suspense as does the guesswork of trying to gauge how many action points opposing players will use on their turn--which also affects the speed of the river.

Has a clever and novel core mechanic, but it may lack replay value. Victory conditions don't seem balanced, with five of a kind being much easier than one of each kind.

3 plays at 3 players with many different people and each game has played completely differently despite not having any of the fancy new board game trends like variable setup etc. A lot going on for such a friendly-looking game - player interaction is balanced perfectly with strategy and short + simultaneous turns comprising a larger strategy game make this a winner. 

It's exciting to see what other people flip as this could sometimes completely spell your peril if you guessed wrong.

I also really like the idea of having boards that are necessary for game play as opposed to just a placemat for game components.

Rating is for gamers.  The game has great visual and tactile appeal, but with a group of gamers it simply does . . . not . . . end.  The problem here is that it's far too easy to stop a player who is close to winning, leading to a stalemate.  The game could be delightful with a group of players who are content to do their own thing and mostly ignore the other players.  I'm not one of those players.

A thin veneer of theme over a number shuffling game.  We had multiple winners in every game we played and no-one enjoyed the experience very much - it doesn't seem very hard to get a winning set of gems home, and we haven't had one canoe go over the falls in four games.  Trading it away.

Fun family game, with a neat (sort of) 3D board, wooden canoes, great looking gems and artwork.  Play is light as players play 1 of 7 (of 6?) tokens with different movement for players and the river.  They're trying to collect gems of different colors and combinations for points and return to camp at the top of the river without getting taken over the falls.  Neat idea for a family game.

Maybe great for families, but it may drag quite a bit with experienced players. The only random factor comes from simultaneous action selection. That is more manageable with fewer players, but then it is also more boring. There is some room for tactics, but it is a good idea to decide what you are going for - equal or different gems - from the beginning. The game is very pretty and the mechanic of moving the river is really nice, but not enough to sustain interest after the novelty wears off.

Look, so there are mechanics and stuff, right? And a lot of it is arbitrary movement rules.
But that's not the point. It's a game designed around a physical gimmick--the layered board and the plastic disks--and the copy I played on didn't quite work. It didn't work! They jammed and flipped up. 
I wanted a toy. I came away disappointed.

There's a touch of El Grande (cards) but with novel game mechanic. Moving the river is the most fun of the game! This is easily an entry game for newbies, and its 3D and tactile elements are very eye-catching for those passing by.

RATING: 7
There is a lot of strategy and psychology, plus the bits are fabulous. I also like that of the three paths to victory, I have seen people win every way multiple times. That is a hard thing to balance. This does get a bit stale, and an inexperienced player can give someone a win, but overall, pretty good.

[Initial Impression: 5]
Niagara suffers mainly from being too one-dimensional - you play a card, move your boats and pick up gems, and move the river - that's it.  There's some strategy in trying to decide which winning combo of gems to go for, but it's just a race to see who can get one of the combos first. (I could imagine it being more fun to assign differing values to the gems - with those closer to the falls being more valuable - and seeing who can score the most points.)  The majority of fun in the game comes during the blind bidding aspect of card play (which determines both boat movement and the river movement), as you're trying to guess what cards (of those they have left) each player is likely to play and then waiting for the reveal to see how the river will move.  One of the main paths to victory is to let others pick up the gems you need and then to steal them, which can get everyone upset because you're constantly targeting one another.  There are some annoying issues with actually getting the river disks to move, as we were constantly having to hand guide them through the transition between the two falls.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Rated so high simply based on the novelty of a moving board. While the game can get a little tedious and predictable as a two player, it is still a great lighter game. A great family game for casual gamers.

RATING: 3.5
Massive disappointment - it has lots of promise; an SDJ game with a reasonable movement mechanic, interesting weather idea, nice river flowing mechanic...

So what don't I like? Well for a start the randomisation of which way the river flows is crude and biased by the person who's pushing it. It would be fairer to use a dice. You could for instance say 1-2 follows the previous flow, 3-6 changes it.

I also dislike how easy it is to steal. Wouldn't it be much nicer if the steal action was one of your tiles? That would limit you to 1 steal per cycle.

Finally who designed the gems? 1 of every colour? I have NO idea what colours I have... They all look the same. Use cubes instead.

Deceptively simple mechanics, with some subtle tactical and highly entertaining play. Watching the canoes go over the falls is hysterical. Getting the last gem of five to win the game is priceless. Accessible to both young and old. One could play it mindlessly for good fun, or do a little thinking to see which way the wind blows (literally). Great fun with five.

Update (01/14/12): People just don't want to play this anymore, as they see it as too random and chaotic. I sense there is some strategy, but I can't convince anyone. Downing it to a '7' from an '8'.

Beautiful children's game of environmental plunder & riverine piracy, though I'm honestly not sure how well this would work with children, as the stealing part can lead to hilarious* king-making situations.

[size=7]*Actually, not so hilarious.[/size]

[imageid=2244055 small]
[size=7]Fig. 1 — [i]I chose Sayyid Billy, 'cuz he's the[/i] true [i]Lion of the Desert.[/i][/size]

Also, if you're making the river move by veeery carefully using your padded gaming tongs—[i]easy does it![/i]—to gingerly place the next river disk like it's a silicon microchip wafer and then gently—[i]oh, so gently[/i]—moving the entire thing a millimeter-per-minute with ouija-board-planchette fingertips....

[imageid=3173030 small]
....being sure to STOP! the moment anything binds up and then analyzing the logjam with a three-votes-out-of-five redundancy check before deciding which way the river will deviate YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.

This is a goddamned [i]river[/i] and we are goddamned [i]men[/i]:  you have to cram the disks in like rounds through a machine gun breach at the Somme—God wants all that water over the falls RIGHT NOW, and the rocks below hunger for brains and marrow—there's no such thing as time to think when rapaciousness will have its due.  No one should be able to contemplate whether or not their thieving bands will perish—it's just rush, flight and the crunch of the long work of hands and wombs in the roaring chaos below.  

When in doubt, do it like an eight-year-old boy whose little brother just got the game for his birthday would do it.

[size=7][b]Important note:[/b]  You know that the native magic that allows us to control the weather didn't come from them, right?  They only heard it from the Whispering Stones, the ones that [i]predate human existence[/i]—and so when we stroke our mummified monkey paws or shake that sack of baby bones or whatever to coax water from the sky what we're really doing is widening the crack that will see an end to everything we have ever loved.[/size]

Overall, a very nice game.  Components, art and design are all very well done.  The canoes, gems, gameboard and clear river spaces are excellent.  The mechanics of the river movement is innovative and works acceptably well.  I think it adds a lot of interest and a little luck into the game.  The rules are a little confusing in that they never explain the value of the stores at the tongue of land (as has been noted on BGG already).  The theme is well suited to the game design.  But, for some reason, it's just not a lot of fun to play.  I am going to continue to play it and, hopefully, it will grow on me.

Rating due in large part to the look and feel of the game.  Players control wooden boats, positioning them along a moving river and picking up glass gems.

First played June 28th, 2007.  Quick learn (<5min) and quick play (~30min).  This is a nice change of pace type game.  It does get a bit tense as the river flows.  We played as a 4 player game.  It has a nice mix of strategy and luck th the game as well.  Enjoyable and somewhat relaxing considering the possibily that your canoes may go over the falls.  I'd recommend giving the a game play and consideration to play every now and then.

Description: Sail down river to collect valuable jewels. Compete with other players to modify the weather, and steal each others' jewels.

Pro: River speed makes for tough choices, and constant tension. Captures the feel of flowing easily downriver, then struggling back upriver. 

Con: Weather can be brutal if players push it to severe levels. Basic gameplay is simple, with little variation.

Go with your canoe on a river and try to gather gems.
You can either go collect the gems yourself or make it yourself easy and let other ppl take the risks and steal them while they paddle back to prevent going over the waterfall.
Fun game, nice concept, and it definitely gives you that feeling of paddeling against the stream.
Downside is the gametime; if you play this game with ppl that all go for the glorious win and nothing less the game can take alot longer then the box indicates.

This game is really growing on me. It grows with the players. When you start, everyone makes with the big paddles and struggles in the later parts of the game to get back to shore. Everyone smartens up and plays small paddles early--the river will carry me--now it's about stealing. Once you know it's about stealing, it's about NOT GETTING STOLEN FROM. People make "suboptimal" plays to mess up later player's thieving plans. Now you plan two moves ahead--or play "flexibly". If she goes here, I'll steal her gem, if she goes elsewhere, I can stop and load up for one myself. 

The game looks great, the rules are easy to remember and there's enough randomness and interaction to please most everyone. I could see my rating tick up and up as the months pass.

I totally dig this game. It's easier than Settlers, say; and everyone thinks they've "figured it out" after about three turns. Then the river goes the same way twice in a row and they're done.

Only played the once, and 2 players at that but it's a fun game. (Played with a third dummy paddle card to reign in the flow a bit, and only five gems of each type.)

Update: A couple more plays 2P and a 3P and this game is really stacking up well. I should take this out more often with groups.

RATING: 8
After multiple plays my rating has gone up.  Zoch is known for its lighter fare and children's games, but this game seems to surpass that.

It's a great middle-weight set collection game with a very unique board.  Some might call the board a 'gimmick' but it does serve its function, and just the thought of having one of your canoes go over the falls makes every move where you play a high number risky... and you have to do it eventually.

Careful planning is  rewarded, especially after the blue and white gems have been collected.  The 'screw your neighbour' factor is high... I recommend this to anyone who likes a tense game with a moderate amount of complexity.  Well deserving of its 2005 Spiel des Jahres award.

The expansion adds even more to the tension... highly recommended.

This game was a pleasant surprise after all the negative press I'd read. It's a charming game. Playing a limited selection of cards for movement is always a good mechanic, and the added twist of river movement makes the mechanic even more interesting here. I played with the expansion and I think the expansion is a must buy if you own or plan to get Niagara. I could see how this game could get old quick without the additional challenges. Only with the expansion does this game deserve the SdJ.

Best with five; don't play with fewer than four. Plays fast and there's a lot of room for macro-planning of your turn sequence and anticipating your opponents. Waterfall mechanic is entertaining. You can actually start to feel like you're "up a creek without a paddle" in this game. That's gotta be worth something. 

This game is excellent every once and a while. It's a goofy game that works, but not one that you want to play again and again.

I think this game is very underrated. It has simple rules with a varying degree of strategy. It could play great as a nice family game with its very nice bits and novelty of the river movement, but given the right group of critical thinkers it becomes a deep strategy game.

There aren't too many "canned" strategies, but if you're the type that likes simple rules with alot of room for creative and adjustable tactics, this game's for you.

There are plenty of hard decisions to make and a fair degree of "take that" player interaction to add to the fun.

My only gripe is that the game can easily drag on if you play with people who have no interest in winning and only want to make things difficult for their opponents. But as long as you have the right group to play with, this one can be alot of fun.

RATING: 5
I generally enjoy the light SdJ fare with Ticket to Ride being among my favourite games. This one is one of the less remarkable SdJ games of recent years. When integrating the box into gameplay, the 3D waterfall is a very nice gimmick for one or two plays. The most remarkable beyond that is the confrontational element of stealing gems from your opponents in a German family game. There is not very much variation in gameplay as the game setup is identical each time. Still it's fun to play occasionally with less seasoned gamers.

Has grown on me now after my unimpressive first game. I do like the clever river mechanism and the length is good. Appeals to younger players due to all the physical stuff going on, plus it doesn't matter too much if they play their cards semi-randomly. Seems to be a good gateway game.

This is an interesting programming style game about waiting for a key moment to make your move, since it can be difficult to move up the river. The rules are written in a somewhat confusing manner and the leader can be given help by someone playing an incorrect card, but the multiplayer determinism is enjoyable

Light and competitive game with [b]emphasis on hand management[/b]. Great mechanic to use the game box as the game itself. I'm sure I can easily introduce this game to many non-gamers.

As for gameplay itself, it's [b]extremely euroish[/b]. You play to help yourself get gems but it's alot easier to steal other player's gems. The river mechanic throws a twist into the game that can frustrate beginners.

What's funny is that moving fast doesn't always mean you'll move at all. Interesting concept since it's [b]heavily influenced by indirect player interaction[/b].

Though the theme doesn't make much sense, it's still creative.

I was soured on this game on my first play of the game.  I made the mistake of playing a 6 on the first hand (to pick up a gem), and spent the next hour trying to not lose the boat.  Wasn't much fun at all.  I believe we played a rule wrong (I don't recall what anymore).   

I picked up the game later and gave it another try.  It was much better.  The first game was fairly quick and light.  The second game took much longer with people trying to block one another by stealing and preventing the win.  I think maybe the gems should be hidden to prevent too much of this because the game can drag on.

I like the idea of the game, I like the looks of the game. There is one problem though. The "water" won't always move smoothly and you have to hold the game together when the water moves or everything falls apart.
Apart from this it's a fun game with several aspects of strategy. I wouldn't play this with only adults though. This is a true family-game.

Nagyon szép és hangulatos játék igazán egyedi ötletekkel. Bár nem különösebben szeretem, ha a dobozt is használni kell a játékhoz (pl. Dixit), de itt remekül működik a vízesés szimulálása. Maga a játékmenet kicsit felemás élményt nyújt, könnyű rossz helyzetbe kerülni, a rablás egy gyerekjátéknál mindig kicsit veszélyes lehetőség, és ha túl gyakran esnek le a csónakok, bizony az is csak egy ideig vicces. Az időjárás befolyásolása is jó ötlet, csak aztán ha nagyon beindul a folyó, akkor....:P

Acquired in 2005. Total number of plays = 20. This has been a hit with a good number of people, gamers and nongamers alike. The river mechanism is nifty but not wholly interesting given that it almost always parts in the same predictable way at the fork. There'd be more tension with it. Endgame can be slightly anticlimactic. The cloud and the jewel-stealing options keep the game fun and interesting. I enjoy it more than I thought I would from reading the rules.

Lovely components. However, this is a bit unusual in my game collection because confrontational play is essentially mandatory. When we play with 3 players, any player can quickly win by collecting the four violet gems unless they are blocked. Similar to a fool's mate in Chess I guess.

Personally I find this a weakness in the game design, which otherwise would be easy to play with non-gamers.

This is one of those games where the gameplay is so-so, but the components and theme make it quite enjoyable.  The river is moving!  You might fall over the edge!  Boats go boom!

Yes, it would be nicer if the petri dishes didn't get stuck.  Personally, I would prefer if the water flow was predictable (i.e the dishes split left and right one after the other) but people I have played with prefer the random split, where one end of the river can move faster than the other.  I like more predictability in my games.

Either way, this game is fun to play.

I've played once so far.  We had four players, which some consider ideal.  It has a very cute physical mechanism for advancing the waterfall, and the components are all nice (especially the sparkly gems).  We had a very close game, but it was best to take the game lightheartedly in any case.  There are planning elements that aren't quite as unpredictable as some have suggested (e.g., the minimum paddle value is used as the river speed, so you can always place an upper bound on that speed), but I understand that it's meant to be a light, friendly game.

RATING: 4
Looks brilliant, but is just average family game. The River-mechanism is fun at the beginning, but later on you just get frustrated, when those river blocks get stuck in the section where it should go left or right. Very luck-driven (well, that's not so bad thing), but what is the biggest issue is that the game is actually very boring.

RATING: 7
Niagara is set in the not particularly safe world of rushing waterfalls. In the late 18th Century, the Shawnee and Iroquois Indians pointed white Desperadoes, Mercenaries and Adventurers in the direction of hidden caches of valuable jewels, in the hopes of turning them against one another and away from their territorial expansion ambitions. Players play as some of those Adventurers.

The first player to be able to claim ownership of five jewels is the winner. But the chase after the riches has some snags. The speed of the river is always changing, since the speed depends on the decisions of the players and the changeable weather. And once a canoe goes over the falls, it's a hefty investment to replace it. And there are also the Desperadoes to contend with, who aren't above trying to plunder the riches from Adventurers returning home. Niagara is distinguished by an innovative movement mechanic as well as a beautiful three-dimensional rendering of the waterfall setting.

The game's highlight is that it is very impressive from a visual standpoint.  It has a novel idea and I personally prefer to play this as a "party game" or if everyone plays it briskly and intuitively.  It's not heavy enough for me to play as a medium strategy game.   (Sometimes it was difficult to discern what the color of the crystalized gems were when they sat inside the players' colored canoes.  You had to lift them up to see b/c of the background color of the canoe mixed with the actual color of each gemstone.  Gems should've been made "distinctively different (shape)" and/or the top of each canoe's color should've been white or neutral.)

A játék szép és az alapötlet is jó, hogy mozgásban van a játéktér bejárható része, a folyó. Azonban sokszor úgy érzem, hogy még tesztelni és finomítani kellett volna a játékot, nem pedig kiadni - az év családi játéka díjat így szerintem nem érdemli ki.

Gyakori érzés bennem játék közben a tehetetlenség. Az, hogy nem tudok a megfelelő kincslelőhelyig evezni, mert nincs megfelelő evezőlapom. Hogy ha közel kerülök a vízeséshez, szinte kizárt, hogy kitudnék vergődni a partra, hacsak nincs 6-os evezőlapom. Az 1-4-es lapokkal nem lehet felevezni a folyón, előbb-utóbb elvisz az ár, csak kínlódás van körökön keresztül. Miközben a többi játékos a legfelül lévő helyekről elviszi a kincseket pillanatok alatt. Nem tetszik az sem, hogy két csónak használatakor mindkettőt ugyanúgy lehet irányítani: vagy párhuzamosan mozognak, és ezzel szinte felezik a játékidőt, vagy egymástól függetlenül, de akkor külön kell őket vízre engedni, ami időveszteség, és a kincsek partra szállításánál úgyis megint összefutnak. Csak ritkán fordul elő, hogy komoly interakció alakuljon ki, például kincslopás a másik játékostól. Teljesen tervezhetetlennek érzem, hogy mikor melyik evezőlapot lenne érdemes kijátszani, kivéve, ha egy megrakott csónakkal akarok kievezni, és pont van akkora (vagy nagyobb) evezőlapom.

Engem nem győzött meg a játék. Dolgozni kellett volna még rajta kiadás előtt.

Attractive and different light family game which relies a bit on managing a hand of action cards effectively and timing when to rush downriver for the gems and when to retreat.  Influencing the river movement by manipulating the weather gives you a bit of control over an otherwise chaotic game factor.

Played only on BSW.  There's a lot to admire in the design of this game, but for some reason I don't find the decisions in it very interesting.  I think the card based movement system may actually be too restrictive to make it a really good gamer's game.  I think it might be good as a slightly heavier than normal family game though.

UPDATE: Not playing Niagara at all anymore, so i'm dropping my rating to a 4.

UPDATE: Blech.  I'm basically done with this.  Aside from Diamant, I am pretty much fed up with light-middleweight games built around simultaneous action selection.

As a game for adults, this game would be okay (I've only ever played with kids). As a game for kids, this game is great. The physical aspect of pushing the water over the falls is great for kids and builds suspense. It's one I enjoy playing with my kids. It's out of print now though, so good luck finding it for a reasonable price. I'm surprised there hasn't been a re-print.

Fun rather quick family game about gowing downstream in a canoe and picking upp diamonds in hope of collecting the correct amount for winning, but avoinding goin over the edge at the waterfall. It could easily be used as a filler game as well. Good simple mechanism with bits of bluffing in it for moving up and downstreams and a hillarious thrill to se the canoes flow towards the fall at the end of each turn. 
Puls raising for kids in all ages as well as a good spent half an hour.

Gorgeous production and potentially a great game, but severely let down by the daft scoring rules (going for the easy colours is a valid and often successful strategy - how boring is that?).

Das Spielbrett weist ein vertieftes Flussbett auf. Als erstes entscheiden die Spieler, ob sie ihre zwei Boote bewegen oder das Wetter beeinflussen wollen. Dazu steht jedem ein Set Paddelkarten zur Verfügung, welche die Zahlenwerte von eins bis sechs oder eine Wolke enthalten. Reihum decken die Spieler ihre Paddelkarten auf und führen die Spielzüge aus.
Anschließend wird der Fluss bewegt. Die Flussgeschwindigkeit ergibt sich aus dem Wert der niedrigsten ausgespielten Paddelkarte sowie dem aktuellen Stand der Wetterwolke. Das unterste Flussfeld fällt den Wasserfall herunter. Darauf befindliche Boote sind verloren und können gegen einen bereits eingesammelten Edelstein zurückgekauft werden. Wer am schnellsten eine bestimmte Anzahl Edelsteine gesammelt hat, gewinnt das Spiel.

We have played this a few times and have enjoyed this game, but are not terribly passionate about it. The dynamic of the moving river adds a lot of fun to the game. Somehow, however, the game play is not terribly exciting. We will give it some more time, but we don't find ourselves reaching for it that often.

I also have to say that the board design is really not all that good. If we set it up per the instructions, it is nearly impossible to make the river flow without having the islands ride up on top of each other. The only thing that works for us is to lay the board flat on the table. The problem with this is that you loose the fun of the physical waterfall to fall off at the end.

In the end, we traded it away.

2-5p, 45m. 2004. Zoch Verlag is on a winning streak (I like Manila too).
One of the interesting features of Niagara is the total lack of randomness--but there is lots of chaos and bluffing.

Fun to hear the entire table groan when the weather gets stormy and the river flushes several boats over the edge.  Evokes the urgent need to save your strength to paddle upstream.

Okay, not our favorite.  Theme really feels silly (wife is from Niagara Falls).  I really don't enjoy it at all - except my kids do, so I play.  I will never play this by my choice.

Odd thing I noticed - the game is in the category of exploration.  I must have missed that part or it is so abstract that I can't see it.  I wonder if there is a way to change the category of a game.  This is not an exploration game.  Not in the least.  Closer to a straight dice race game than it is a game with exploration.  Meh.

Maybe we are both too stupid and too cutthroat, but with the rules as written, the game just wouldn't end. We finally reached a point where we decided to just start over and make it such that you didn't have to pay any gems to get your canoes back. Once we did that it was an alright game, and at least it ended in a reasonable amount of time. It's a shame since the production looks great on the table.

What a clever physical game mechanism to represent moving water!  Top notch presentation overall.  Get the nicely re-written rules from BGG though.  The original rules are a bit of a muddle to wade through.  Fun factor improved after playing more games, as people stumbled onto alternative strategies.  You will probably find things a tad slow going at first as you try to figure out the whole water/canoe movement thing, but it's a pretty fun game with the right light-hearted crowd.  For younger kids, it may be frustrating to not collect the gems as easily as they'd like.  Likewise, older kids may not like the theme.  For the middle range, it's a good, fun time.

Came from a friend in trade.  Decent family game with a nice 'river' mechanism, and some thinking to do.  Nice use of the box as part of the board.  Sometimes the acrylic tiles got caught and did not wash over.  In the end, everyone done after a few plays, so not much staying power.

This is one of my favorite filler games. It looks phyically beautiful, is simple enough to teach my 5 year old, interesting enough to play, although I do feel the winner is pretty random. I have bought the expansion, but have never used it as it looks to add too much strategy and difficulty to the game, which is just not the itch I would use this game to scratch.

Light, fluid and novel game perfect for a family. There is some amount of strategy in deciding what movement card to select, as well as a little screwage factor with the stealing of gems and changing the weather. However I found gameplay to be somewhat repetitive and not that engaging; while the movement of the river is brilliant, the other mechanics don't fit it/gel with the whole as well as some other games of the same weight out there. Will play this with my sister/father, but will pull something else out for satisfying fillers.

RATING: 5
Only played it twice with 3 players and both the other players hated it because their canoes kept falling over the river!  I thought it was good though, with some light strategy.  I think part of the problem was people were being overly aggressive/greedy and using large paddle numbers to go downstream and grab gems, when really you should be letting the river do the work.  Got tired of the bitching and shelved the game in the middle of the second play.  May play again if I warn people of the above.

Edit: turns out we were playing it all wrong.  Will comment again after playing it correctly.

The current favorite around here. Has replaced Settlers and Ticket to Ride as the game we almost always play. There is no clear 'master of the game' around here which is good, since that is a sure-fire way to kill a good game. Usually plays in 30 minutes and we are all still discovering new tactics/ideas. Love the moving river and 3d board. Limited cards is frustrating at times but adds more strategy. I can't believe there is no luck in this game. Usually they are brain burners...but not this one.

Gyönyörű és rendkívül egyedi kivitelezésű, könnyed, családi játék.
Sokak szerint a bgg-n kaotikus és szerencsefüggő. Szerencse?? Nem nagyon értem hol jön be a szerencse. Az, hogy a játékostársak milyen lapot tesznek az nem szerencse, megfelelő taktikával pedig megelőzhető a baj (bár azt aláírom, hogy a vízesés közeléből nehéz a visszaút, nem kell odajutni!). A lopkodás viszont sértődősöknek nem kedvez..
A folyó sodrása és annak befolyásolása zseniális, a kivitelezés pedig egyedülállóan szép! Bár az elágazásnál tényleg néha akad, rá kell érezni a "tolásra".
Igenis megérdemelt SdJ győztes!

The expansion adds a lot to this game, although for new comers it is easier to explain it with out it, then introduce the features.

Didn't like it. It's just tactical counting and nothing more. A skeleton of a game, completely abstract for me, the wrong way. It looks great so it could be satisfying to lay out, but the river is somewhat awkward to use and there are too many rules for such a simple game. It's not even a filler. I guess this is a family game. I played Reef Encounter just before this, so...

Like Ticket to Ride, this one was very popular with non-gamers and has proven to be my 2nd best option as a gateway game.  Using plasitc discs on a movable board (simulating the rushing river of Niagara) is a great mechanic that makes for a fun and exciting family game.

A fun game with great components. Although this could be played as a hugely competetive 'Brain-Burner' (e.g. virtually no luck, second guessing), the design is geared towards presenting a light-hearted  game. A must is the house rule that player made sound-effects are mandatory when falling down the falls (otherwise pay an extra gem to get the canoe back).

On a unique gameboard, players control two boats. Each turn, players play down a movement card allowing their boats to move 1 to 6 spaces. Players may only move in one direction, picking up gems or stealing gems from other players. After one complete movement turn, the river flows downward, which may potentially push some boats over the falls. Players can pay a gem to recover a lost boat. Winner is the one with 5 unique gems, 4 of the same gems or 7 gems. It's a nice gameboard, light and fun with the right crowd. There is a bit of strategy, but lots of luck.

I've gotten a few plays in with some friends. Fun little game. You row your canoes up and down the river, collecting certain colored gems. Of course, the river is constantly moving you downstream, so if you aren't careful in your planning...say "Hi" to the Maid of the Mist on your way over the Falls. 

Turn order cycles to keep things even. Win scenarios are collecting 1 of each gem or a majority of 1 color and returning them to your campsite. You can steal gems as you pass opponents on the river, but can only carry 1 at a time. A fun little thematic game.

RATING: 4
Great components, but really not a game I enjoy. It requires more strategic planning than most kids could handle, which leads to frustration and extended play times. The Spirits of Niagara expansion speeds up the game considerably, gives players more options, and makes it considerably more tolerable (my rating would jump considerably, to a 5.5). Probably my least favorite SdJ winner.

RATING: 5
This ranks with Villa Paletti as one of the worst SdJ award winners! Completely over-produced, this amusing but forgettable guessing game showed just how weak the year was for great family games (i.e. there were none). I still haven't had a chance to play Himalaya, but I have to think it will be a better game (though it IS put out under the Tilset name... shudder). Not that I think the following games are deserving either, but I would have easily chosen them as SdJ winners over Niagara: Amazonas, Australia and Der Untergang von Pompeji (the latter is the game I've enjoyed the most in a light, family-game kind of way). Oh well... I guess we can't get a Ticket to Ride every year, though it sure would be nice if we did!

Supper light.  More of a toy than a game, but what fun.  I think the design of this game is award winning caliber.  Can't say enough about the theme and concept.

For more advanced play, I might make it cost a movement point or two to steal.

UPDATE - Ok, this game is deeper than I thought, and I now enjoy it a ton.  The expansions make for a more competitive experience.  Also, I think I was playing the steal rules incorretly, as onine I can only steal at the end of a turn, not at the beginning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good enough game but don't like the fact that, after 3 plays, all games have been won by player gathering 4 purple gems. I guess this means that everyone has to go for purple right off the bat if for no other reason than to deny this victory.  Does this then mean that everyone has to go after the clear gems next?  This formulaic approach, if really necessary, will dink the rating by a point or three. I hate games that have to be played the same way every time - something that even Puerto Rico suffers from (to a certain extent).

I like the game's flowing river gimmick mechanic. The game itself is a good one with a little outguessing and mostly a tactical play. Works well with whole range of 3-5 players.

The second Spiel des Jahres for Zoch within four years, Niagara lives up to the expectations raised by its name and publisher: it's a wonderfully produced family game about gathering precious stones lying on the shores of river rapids. The only randomness in the game comes from the player's secret choices - the turn order is important as well, but otherwise players have got enough room to think and decide. The play is relatively light with the length of a game never surpassing an hour, but some choices can be really nasty as well. In addition, the tactile element in the gems, the boats and the disks that simulate the river flow makes the game attractive for younger players.

Update. With minor rule-tweak it works ok with my 6year old. River moves down 1 + X space, where X is the number on the weather track. Pumping up score a bit with that rule in mind.

Although there are some rules clarification problems to work through, once that's settled, this game's a blast to play, with gorgeous components. Also, it offers lots of choices to make along the way vis a vis what others in the game are doing and where their canoes are situated at a given time. The more the merrier, too--up to 5. More than any game I've tried, this is one with which it's best to just sit down and start playing rather than try to read through the rule book and figure out first. As others have noted, it's not as hard as it seems by first reading the rules. Just start playing it and with the exception of a rule here or there, it will start making sense--and, it's not as complicated as it might seem at first. For example, my 9-year-old (2008) picked it up quickly on his first play, and by our second round he and I were both playing our tiles pretty quickly. This game gets more cutthroat with more players, both with stealing gems and putting canoes over the falls. Lots of laughs along the way. Sold, December 2010.

Plus an x-tra Diamand Joe Boat from Essen 2008.

Fun idea with the floating pieces. Easy as an introduction to the new board-gamers. the game has on the other hand some sudden-death effect : Oh, it's over already. Practical box to, although i'ts a rather big one to take with on vacation.

This is one gem of a game! We play with the Spirits of Niagara and the Diamond Joe expansions all the time now. I don't know what we would do without our saviour Diamond Joe. Take your canoes, down the river, discover some gems, and get them upriver to your campsite fast, before you go over the edge of the waterfall.

Fun game.  Played it with 2 first and not nearly as fun.  I can see how that appeals to the total information fans, but the game is themed for a fun time with some mild calculations.  Play to win, but enjoy the very cool waterfall mechanic (it's genius how they engineered that alternating fork--seriously) and seeing canoes full of gems get washed away.  We had a lot of fun with our group joking and persuading people how to use their cloud cards.  We had fun trying to outguess the others, but I don't feel this is a game to take too seriously.

RATING: 7
One of the players in my first game back from Essen called this a 'one trick pony', which is somewhat apt but doesn't do the game justice.  It's a lot of fun to move your little canoes about the board, and the game really is flat-out gorgeous.  The rules are clunky and too long for what they describe - this is a game that should be explainable in less than 10 minutes.

The game is interesting to look at, and has okay game play.  Where it really shined for us was social gameplay.  We heard a few different sets of rules when asking how to play, and then read the actual rules which were different than anything that was explained to us.  The result was starting over 3-4 times and a very enjoyable hour of heckling the game and other players.  It will never live up to the first play through, but I will probably get this just for the fun the first play was.

For a light SdJ winner, it's not too bad. It'll never be a favourite because of the simultaneous revelation mechanic, but you get choices on whether to play your own game or try and outguess other players to steal their jewels. And it is a nifty component design, for sure.

Fantastic looks and great playing mechanics make for a very appealing and light-hearted strategy/family game for when you don't feel like sizzling your brain with the likes of Warrior Knights or Caylus... And it look sooooo bloody gorgeous... One of the most beautiful games I know of.

I have just risen its score. After a long break on this game, and playing it with 5 players it suddenly started to develop into a really mean little game where you can really try to screw other players and actually have a really good strategy. Definitely a game that starts to shine when played by experienced players! Excellent stuff!

This game gets a bad rap by many.  I think it's a great game that's deserving of the Spiel des Jahres!  And having the little discs that represent the stream is just brilliant.  Making the current go just fast enough to make your opponents' canoes go down the waterfall is satisfying.  :)

The river flow mechanic is very clever, though most of the time it just ends up alternating directions.  Like many simultaneous action selection games, the results of your moves often appear pretty random, though there is some strategy in the game.  Sometimes the game has mechanical issues--the river tiles just won't push past the fork.

More fun than I anticipated.

Niagara is a light and reasonable quick Family-Euro that gives some chances to screw your opponents. I love the unique moving-river mechanics and the possibility to impact the speed of the flow.

Excellent bits, but the wordish and lengthy rules could have been much better (and it is just enough to make me choose a "2" instead of a "1" on the weight scale).

Much air in the box, could have been half the height.

尼加拉瓜是這款遊戲的名字，正如其名，大瀑布是這款遊戲的賣點，藉由將圖板放在遊戲盒上，營造出河流尾端的瀑布(尾端忘記照了)，配合圖板上的透明圓形盤，於每回合結束後，依該回合的河流速度，將圓盤往瀑布方向推移，此時原盤便會於圖板尾端的瀑布掉落，若圓盤上有玩家的船隻，呵呵，就會被一起衝下瀑布了。玩家在取寶石時，必須小心計算其前進或後退步數，否則一不小心，便會連船帶貨一起被沖下瀑布囉(大砲)

Played this game on BGA. I am surprised that this game has won the SDJ in 2005! Maybe it didn't have good enough contenders that year. I feel Jambo should have won the award!

It is a very light game, to play with little kids. It shares the same mechanics in Get Bit, where you want to guess if people will play the weather card to screw you. In Get Bit it is a bit different but the concept is almost the same.

It is a bit longer than what it is. I feel the game is too light and should have been more than a filler game. It outstayed its welcome.

I wonder if I really like this one.  Has some very cool mechanics and some nice tactics to it.  Also doesn't take too long to play.  Seems like it should stand up to repeated play.  Not as cutthroat as I thought it'd be.  Gets bonus points because the wife really likes it.

There's a good bit to like here:  non-violent theme (though there is stealing), nice components, a clever river movement system, and some interesting choices.

Cool and simple. One drawback is that you can make it drag if you really try to stop the leader. I also seems that going for four purple stones is the way to go. Against my usual parameters, I will try and read to see if others have found similar problems. On the functional aspect, the moving river does not move every time, a bit of fiddling may be required.

Gorgeous and fun family game.  The river mechanism is genius.

Stealing and the aggressive use of cloud makes the game more interesting.

Takes a little too long in my opinion.

A little fiddly if you are color blind.

And the rules are written in a complex fashion when they are actually pretty simple.

In the end, this game wasn't played much and I gave it away to a co-worker.  I'd rather this game be played than sit on a shelf.

The most beautiful-looking new game of Essen.  It takes just 60 seconds to explain the rules, you move your boats up and down the river and try to collect gems.  First one to meet one of three gem-collecting conditions wins.  But at the end of the round, the water starts moving depending on weather and cards people have played....and your boat may go over the falls!!  It's a total family/kid game but enough tactics for gamers.  The box says 3-5 players but, it's probably best with 5 - the less players meant less control and more boats over the edge.

Second play in and now the rules are clear(re:gem pick up before or after movement and stealing only at end of movement upstream), I appreciate the calculation and memory involved.

Nice canoe bits and gems and an interesting water flow mechanism... but I'm sure glad I didn't buy it. Play was essentially boring, guessing how far the river would flow to be exactly in the right spot to pick up gems. Stealing gem 'screwage' just pissed people off, not a good attribute for such a light game. Going for a set of the same gems seems the only way to win. The physical components are all that prevent this from rating a 3.

Who knew collecting gems along a raging river while the powerful Niagara waits to consumer your canoe could be so hum-drum? Everything works well enough, and it looks great, but there's not a lot of excitement until the end when everyone attempts to collect the pink and blue gems at the edge of the waterfall and canoes start capsizing. My daughter likes it but I can hardly play the game to its conclusion. This winning the SdJ was the equivalent of Shakespeare in Love grabbing the Oscar for Best Pic. Travesty.

Thought this was for 2-5 players but box says 2-5 in one place & 3-5 in another! Having tried it 2 player only so far, I don't think this works as such. After advice from one of the links here on the geek, we tried it with some dummy hands which made the game better. Lovely river mechanics & pieces, a nice idea, but will need to try it with more players to see if my rating goes up or down!
***UPDATE***
Have now played with more players (4) and it worked well & was enjoyed by all. Rating upped slightly; may increase with more plays.

Got quite a few plays from this but ultimately not thrilling enough to keep in the collection. Sold!

A game that appears to be centered around the gimmick of the waterfall is actually fun and engaging.  There are things to consider but not too much to lock up your ability to come to a decision.  Fun game, enjoyed playing plain and with Spirits expansion.  I've adjusted my rating down recently due to feeling like the game was too random.  I want to play again soon to reconsider that notion.

RATING: 3
Very boring...I coudln't wait for this game to end. I think it may be aimed for kids, and I was playing with adults - who seemed very earnestly into this game - I own't play this again, unless some really cute kid begs me. It was just to simple: go up the river, go down it. Get a jewel, don't go over the falls, bring your jewel back.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Players are collecting gems along the river and trying to avoid their canoes being swept over the falls.  Clever mechanisms for the river's movement and challenging strategy of selecting your own movement number and the psychology of trying to outguess your opponents.  There's fun interaction in stealing each other's gems.  Lovely components. Great for families and more serious gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Beautifull game design. The gems are nice and the river flow is great. It resembles a real river that slows down once it splits in several smaller rivers. This delta gives the opportunity to survive even with only low cards, but getting through the upstream part may turn out to be very difficult. 

The game is light, more a filler, taking a little over 30 minutes with 4 players. Keeping track of the score of your opponents is extremely important if you take this game serious. And that's where the game board is a little impractical. (Derk)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great components. Negotiate rapids through limited movement for pickup and delivery of gems. The user influenced rapids can change in strength and direction to thwart your plans, or even drop your canoe off the edge of the waterfall.

RATING: 6.8
Played with 3 and we seemed to be bored and frustrated by the game. It seems too repetitive and it feels like your getting nowhere(we almost quit in the middle of the game). The circles pop out of the river and because my too halves of the boxes are not the same height.  Put on a Starcraft box and it worked better but occasionally they would still pop out.  Might need to pick this up again because i think we might have just been really bad at this game since it took 2 hours too play.  Gorgous board with a very nice idea with the river circle though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.4
Have only had it for a short period of time.  Played a few times with family (4 and 9 year olds and my wife).  Takes a little while to get the rules straight.  Not sure exactly how to use strategy yet.  I picked it up for 50% off at Barnes & Noble.  Don't think I'd recommend it at full price.  Kids like the mechanic of the river flowing.  There are at least 4 or 5 games that I'd recommend for young families before this one, but it's still some fun.

Update (Feb.'09): Knocked down from 7 to 6.  Never play it.  Would love to trade it away.

RATING: 7.6
On my first game of this I plunged one of my canoes to its doom. The game is fairly light, with players moving canoes to collect gems, trying to avoid being pushed to far down river and over the falls. The movement (by secret selection of move cards 1 to 6) and the river (pushed along by a conveyer belt of discs) are both clever mechanisms. I doubt the game has a huge amount of depth but it is definitely challenging on an irregular basis.

RATING: 7
The whole family enjoyed this, and my just turned 5 yo begs to play (YMMV - he can add and subtract single digits numbers in his head) He can't get the more advanced strategy points, but there is room to "grow" into it. And the game is just GORGEOUS.

Based on a handful of BSW plays.  Yes, I did fully understand the rules.  I don't like (among other things) that it doesn't have a 'natural end point.'  In other words, the game doesn't end until someone fulfills the victory condition, and players can be pulled back and lose their progress.  In other other words, in theory it could continue infinitely, and in practice it feels like infinity anyway.

Games tend to play quickly which is a nice feature.  The river movement nicely adds to the decision of which paddle tile to play when.  Often one finds oneself drifting down the river without good points to spend, but the river only moves with the lowest paddle, so you slow down the river at the same time.  Good looking game that is fun for the occasional play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I played this once and I'm just now getting around to a review. It's not bad. It has an interesting mechanic, and it's fun to get those gems. What remains to be seen is just how much strategy is there. Is it better to simply steal gems? Is it better to go for all the same or split it up? Not sure yet how all those ideas fit together into something that is fun and relatively short.

The rating is a bit unstable right now due to the number of plays.

I should try this variant (due to user rseater):

In every game of Niagara I've played, the winner won by collecting a set of purple gems (the easiest). Players trying to get a set of 1 of each have more fun, and may come in close, but never win. This is a shame, because a lot of the tension of the game comes in trying to get those pink gems down close to the waterfall.

However, there is a simple fix.

In a 2-3 player game, cut 2 purple gems and 1 clear gem.
In a 4-5 player game, cut 1 purple gem and 1 clear gem.

Reducing the number of easily-acquired gems encourages more risky strategies. If you try to go for all-purples, there's a good chance they will run out, so its a much less robust strategy. The comparative risk of getting close to the waterfall starts to look more appealing, which I find to make things much more fun.

Ok.  I've played this game twice now, and hated it both times.  While the moving river is a novel mechanic, I find myself wishing the weather could go to  10 and that I had 5 more cloud cards.  Maybe Im just a poor planner for this type of game.  Stealing gems is annoying and any gamer worth half his salt can screw with the other players moves.  I know that I am playing with 'gamers' so I wont write this off as a family title just yet, but good luck getting me to play this one again on a 'gamer' night.

OK, maybe one of the coolest looking games I've ever seen. Strong theme, too. But the game itself? Something's missing here, don't know what- too heavy for a kid's game and too shallow (no pun intended) and slow going for grown ups... Well, I play it with the kids, by request. I don't know about the other expansion, but Diamanten Joe doesn't change a lot neither. Typical Spiel des Jahres.

I purchased this game solely on the strength of its SdJ win.  I find that it certainly makes for a pleasant family game.  My two girls really enjoy this one, requesting it fairly often.  This despite the fact that they really are no good at it.  I think it must have something to do with watching things go over the falls :)  At any rate, there is enough strategy and tactics to keep me interested.  I could certainly see how this game could get even more interesting if we played with the theiving rules.  So far, we have not tried that.  Maybe when the girls are a little older.  As it is, they are cutthroat enough.  [08/10/2007]

A játékosok a folyó partján ékköveket gyűjtenek, amit a folyó forrásához kell visszaszállítaniuk. Különböző fajta vagy mennyiség begyűjtése és leszállítása után lehet győztes valaki.

Every time someone would say "that's it, the game is over next turn", things would happen to change that prediction.  Very cool.  The game generated a number of fantastic situations that had everyone getting really loud and excited.

Gets an 8 for "fun" alone. BSW play is terrific. A sense grows that you're actually fighting a river. Three varied win conditions. As your TAB (turns at board) grow, subtle strategies and tactics will emerge. Game grows on you.

RATING: 7
For a game that is essentially one dimension, it is quite nice. There are some rigidities, like the movement cards cannot be reshuffled, but other than that -- they still can steal your red stone just before you're ready to land! It is worthwhile to set one's goal right away -- bring 4 purples, or collect all five, which is actually not that difficult if you count your moves right.

Has a fun mechanic that can be very frustrating if you don't plan well... but that's a good thing. Moves very quickly and there is very little downtime.

This might be on the top of my list of "games I want to like and I'm trying as hard as I can to". After playing it quite wrong the first time due to the hideous rulebook, I tried it again this month and even with playing it right, I came away with an 'eh'. It's gorgeous and family-oriented and light-strategy -- all things I LOVE in my eurogames. But I can't help feeling that it could go on FOREVER, and the aggravation involved in trying to get your boats back is at times hideous.

Great game to play with adults and kids.  With the 6 year old, we eliminated stealing, and play with only one boat per player, but otherwise use the same rules.

Tactical and fun little game -- all strategies are valid for winning, at least with 5 players.  have not played with fewer than 4 players but I feel the game might not hold up as well.

Be prepared for a long game with skilled players--there will be stealing and gem dumping and river manipulations that will make the game run upwards of 2 hours.  Seriously.  It's still fun, but played seriously it is a tight battle that will ebb and sway.  And you'll likely end up with more than one winner.

This is a "don't try this at home, kids" kind of game about canoeing in front of Niagara Falls.  It's easy to learn (if you track down the re-written rules from this site) and fun to play with any number of players.  Of course (as has been mentioned innumerable times) the rules are very poorly written and whoever wrote them completely forgot to include the element of making the gems closest to the waterfall the most valuable - otherwise I would have made my already high "game design" rating a little higher.  But if you look up the rules and variants on this site (and I strongly recommend doing so) you will find some fantastic variations that include rules for two-players, a point system for the gems, and other variants that make the most hazardous gems the most valuable.  I'm looking forward to trying Niagara with the expansion.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7/10

Delightful physical presentation makes it a game you'll get a kick out of playing once or twice, but that tired old business of everybody playing out their identical hands of numbers one at a time means it's a game lacking originality at a fundamental level, bringing it down to a clever novelty when, with the idea of the moving river and the charming way that has been rendered, there was a chance it could have been a lot more.

I have revised my initial rating down 1 point on this one.  At first it was a lot of fun and a very novel game.  Over time it grew a little stale for me.  This doesn't mean it is a bad game, it just doesn't have the long-term replayability that I thought it would.

[many plays] The reason I got this game was to play it as a family game.  I tried playing it with my kids a couple time (ages 5 and 8)  The kids loved the look of the board.  The 8 year old caught onto the rules really quick but I think it will take him a few more plays to get a solid strategy.  The 5 year old really struggled to understand the game.  I think the number of choices and thinking make this game too hard for a five year old.    I played a couple times with guys at work.  It got a good reaction from the guys, we are eager to try it again.  The game has guessing but nothing is "random".  The game is really a much harder game to play with kids than I thought it might be, but it works better for playing as a fairly serious strategy game against adults than I thought it would.

[Zoch 2004 edition] {Adventure, treasure hunt; blind-action selection, set collection; optimal 3p} Niagara is a thematic and accessible family game. The rule is clear and intuitive for me. It has a very good player interaction and is full of joys and excitement.

The board, canoes and gems are very attractive and durable. Components are nicely crafted and very practical.

Though Niagara is not a great game for me, I think it is worth the awards. It does provide some mental challenges to the players - deciding attack or defend, pursuing which goal, playing which paddle cards, anticipating how other moves, etc.  It provides enough tactical moves for the players. The number of choices decreases as fewer cards are available; therefore players have to plan wisely how to use the first 2-3 paddle cards. Nonetheless, it is chaotic to form a long-term strategy; esp. in a 5-6p game due to too many random factors. Yet, I don't think it's totally out of control - at least, experienced players are much more likely to win. Finally, Niagara has the good character of a family game - everyone can win, but clever one can win more.

This is an excellent game for first-time designer.  Keep up the good work!

[Expansion] The Spirit of Niagara expansion adds interesting elements to the game but I don't think it's a must. The Diamond Joe can be ignored. (One can always use a remaining canoe, if any, as the Diamond Joe, if needed.)

This is a pretty good game for introducing to new players, as it's got a beautiful board and easy to grasp rules.

I was really blown away by the components.  You use the box top and bottom as a base, then place a river board on top with the Niagara Falls hanging over the edge.  The river is set into the board and splits into 2 paths near the falls.  Each player has boats that get placed onto these clear disks, then the river current pushes the disks downstream and potentially off the edge.  Very cool components!

Components aside, the mechanisms are solid as well.  You each have a hand of 7 movement tiles and you can't play a tile twice until you have played all 7.  The tiles are selected simultaneously but resolved in order.  The programming combined with limited choices and a moving board gives this a similar feeling as [thing=18][/thing], which I really like.  But it did lack some of the zaniness and hilarity of Roborally, so I don't rate it as high.

It's actually quite an interesting game with interesting choices and a little bit of deduction and "card counting", but the English rule book was disgraceful. I don't know why it can get so many rules wrong, as if someone used google translate to butcher the whole gameplay without engaging a qualified translator. I had to read the German rule book to make any sense of it. Real estate in the game is not very well played, because there is really no space to display your gems for all to see. The discs often get a little stuck, but we can live with that. I would like to play it again more aggressively with more stealing and +2 weather dial. That should turn the gameplay quality up a notch.

An absolutely beautiful game with incredible bits and an innovative board design. Game play is simple but fun. The chaos factor may be a bit too high with 3 players ... with 5 players the games settles in and becomes a bit more stable. Update: Niagara is lovely but now has simply sat on the shelf looking nice for years. On the few occasions when I've suggested it, nobody will play. I guess a family-weight game with lots of chaos and screwage doesn't make the cut with my group. Rating downgraded a notch and placed on the trade pile ...

Eye candy game for up to six players (with the Spirit of the Niagara expansion) where players traverse their canoes up and down a river collecting gems and bringing them back to the head waters while avoiding the falls. Players use blind selection to make their moves from a set of 7 cards (move 1 to 6 spaces or adjust the weather/speed of the river). The expansions allow for more selections. Can be an easy way to spend an hour or so. Probably plays best with 4 or 5.

I love this game - unfortunately the rest of the family aren't so keen, mainly due to the fact that I usually win.

The mechanics of using movement cards and the flowing river are so well executed, and the game board and pieces are very satisfying to use. 

The game combines strategy with a bit of a memory game (so you can remember which movement cards your opponents have left).

It's not so good when you're playing with people of different skill levels!

Great stuff.

My 6-year old nephew, Luke, was able to follow the objective well, but not really comprehend some of the strategic planning. I'd say it works for 8 years and up if your 8-year old is bright.

TRADED AWAY - Niagara is certainly an innovative game with nice pieces and an interesting mechanic of the moving river, but the gimmick wears thin after a few plays, choices are very limited, and the game sometimes drags toward the end.

I revised my rating upwards half a point after having played the game a lot more and with a wider selection of people.

Niagara is set in the not particularly safe world of rushing waterfalls. In the late 18th Century, the Shawnee and Iroquois Indians pointed white Desperadoes, Mercenaries and Adventurers in the direction of hidden caches of valuable jewels, in the hopes of turning them against one another and away from their territorial expansion ambitions. Players play as some of those Adventurers.

The first player to be able to claim ownership of five jewels is the winner. But the chase after the riches has some snags. The speed of the river is always changing, since the speed depends on the decisions of the players and the changeable weather. And once a canoe goes over the walls, it's a hefty investment to replace it. And there are also the Desperadoes to contend with, who aren't above trying to plunder the riches from Adventurers returning home. Niagara is distinguished by an innovative movement mechanic as well as a beautiful three-dimensional rendering of the waterfall setting.

The perfect first family board game, Easy to learn,fun,looks great,kids like the waterfall and moving river. enough depth to keep adults happy while letting kids choose their own strategy. (Nothing worse than a game you end up playing on your childs behalf its boring for them and you). If you wanna get the kids off the PS2 and thinking for themselves this is a great place to start.would not recomend for the under 9/10 age group as there is some reasoning and logical mathematical thought required.

Nice family game with beautiful components. With four players I felt that I only had limited control over my fate (gambling and guessing plays a big role), but the game is short enough to get past that.

This is a very light game and fast paced. Player interaction and actions are often intertwined and the pace is fast.

A good game overall, but in small doses and sometimes, a little luck goes a long way.

This is a pretty cool game, and I've played 3 times.  I'll be 100th person to comment that the waterfall mechanic is great, and that the game is gorgeous.  The game also has as a merciless dark side to it.  There is a bit of a screwage factor in that you can steal gems, but there's more.  In one game, we all gambled that someone else would be sane, and in the end, every canoe except one in a 5 player game went over the falls.  That's nasty.  Despite a few painful moments, I still want to play the game because I don't think it will always be like that.  If the game continues to feel that way, the 6.5 stands, but I feel that more experienced play will reveal a tighter game.

This is another one of those things where I'm glad there's a game to go along with the fun waterfall toy, but really the main enjoyment comes from the toy and not the game.

A very fun game that would be great for a family. Simple rules and wonderful bits make it great for all ages. There are strategic decisions to be made and it can seem like everyone is using the same paddles (high numbers used first then everyone making a mad dash to stay away from the falls when only having low numbers). Still a refreshing game that works well!

You *really* need to flatten the playing board to enjoy this one.  It deals with a moving mechanic that players can to a certain extent control.  The object of the game is to shuttle gems along a stream back to your home base with out going over the edge of the falls (hence: Niagara).  Kids like it, so we play it on occassion.

Good gateway game.  Beautiful, tactile, and has a familiar move/collect/return mechanic.

Cool concept, but I don't like the winning condition.  Going for same-colored gems (4 needed to win) slows you down.  If your opponents work to make your same-colored gem win impossible, then your only choice becomes achieving 7 total gems.  You'll be so far behind those working on the "one of each" that you can't possibly catch up.

I have a difficult time placing this one.  It plays short, it's beautiful, and it has a lot of characteristics that I usually like, such as limited card play, groupthink, and chaos.  However, something about Niagara just misses.  Perhaps it's a lack of control.  Even when I win, I feel like it was as much due to luck as it was to skill.  Other players' moves are just a hair too unpredictable to make for good planning.  This feels like filler that's trying to masquerade as a big box game.  Could be improved with a variant that makes the gems at the end of the waterfall worth more, but I'm not sure that even that would tempt me into playing it.

RATING: 7
Rated after 20 games. All of the games have been very even, there have been either several winners or the winning marginal has been very small. There is no random events in the game, so it's all about speculation what others will do and trying to remember, what they can do (meaning what they already have done). The river mechanic is nice, but the overall look of the game is much lighter, than it really is. It is easily considered as a kids game, which it is not. One thing I like in this game, is that I'm quite good at it...

There were almost three years, when I didn't play this game at all, before yesterday. I think I should drop the rate a little bit, but on the other hand I would definitely want to play this game again. So I'll keep the 9.

With five "quality" players the game might get quite lengthy, when everyone is playing it safe and taking care that nobody else can win the game and so on. Then everyone has quite a lot of diamonds, but not enough and there are basically only hard-to-get pink diamonds on the board.

Updated after the latest play, four "quality" players this time. It was quite fast this time, less than an hour, and quite nice to play. However I was forced to drop the rating from 9 to 7, because this is not a great game. It is an okay game, but I probably have too much feelings for it... :)

We played this one with three players, and I think that having so few players affected the gameplay is a negative way.  There wasn't a lot of competition for gems, and we didn't really have any opportunities to steal gems because there were never many boats out on the river.  I'd like to try this one with more players to see if that improves gameplay.

UPDATE:  Played this with four and there was more competition for resources and more crazy movement of the weather token. Still not the [i]gem[/i] of a game I was hoping for (so terrible with the puns!), but a lot more fun with a higher player count.

Niagara is the shortest board game I've ever played, so I really like how it can take the place of a card game.

I like the mechanic with the waterfall and the movement of the canoes down the rapids..quite unique. Having only played the once so far I found it an awfully long game for our group..I think that was because like some other comments, the weather turned bad most of the game so the current was too strong for anyone to make it back to the rope line to drop off their gems..perhaps if it was played faster and less cut throat, and the game time were halved, I would improve my rating.
Update: it was, it did, and I upped it one notch and picked up a copy

A game largely without an audience.

Niagara tries to pass itself off as a family game, yet it fails on two counts:  (1) the movement rules are laden with exceptions and special cases, the result of which is that the basic mechanics are too detailed for younger children to grasp thoroughly, and (2) the game, when played properly,  is far too mean-spirited.

In addition, many adults don't like Niagara because of the luck inherent in the game's blind bidding.

The game's appeal is therefore limited to older kids and chaos-tolerant adults who don't mind fiddly rules and thrive on screwage.  I happen to fall into this category, but many don't.

I love the river mechanism and the idea of the game but it is an exercise in futility for me. I do think it is a very good family game. The Diamond Joe expansion is a nice addition.

Played a few times face-to-face and on BSW. The discs are a great mechanism and the game is nice-looking. However, I have not enjoyed the gameplay much and have found the game rather long, repetitive and boring. I might try it again some day - maybe with the expansion?

A very nice balance of racing and take-that interaction.  Just enough decisions to be interesting but not bog things down. The moving river is a really fun feature and he who masters the river control will definitely have an edge.  An underrated game worth checking out.

Nice physical components.  Players are trying to navigate a river while trying to get their opponents to go over the falls.  Doesn't seem interesting after only a few plays.

Neat little set collection game with a fun movement mechanic.  Collect treasure along a river while avoiding the waterfall.  Every turn, the river flows at varying speed depending on the movement cards that are played.  The river flowing mechanic is a little fussy and requires care to keep the river flowing propery.  Also, the english rulebook is clearly a translation from another language and is needlessly verbose and is rather difficult to follow.  Once you are past that, the game is easy to understand and plays quickly.

RATING: 6
Roughly 5 plays, all with 3 or 4 players.

Like: The board is so much fun! Even if the plastic discs get stuck at the end sometimes, the river physically works very well. In a game of this weight and length, it's also pleasantly surprising that there are no random factors in Niagara. I like the system of choosing secret movement tiles for each round instead of rolling dice. Niagara also gets very wild when the river is at its maximum flow rate (2 discs per turn) as you have to plan quite carefully to make sure you have the right movement tiles left in your supply to prevent your boats from going off the falls. Stealing gems from other player's boats is mean and fun. 

Dislike: The game's victory conditions are just not balanced properly. They need to be much more nuanced. House rules would fix this (or the expansion possibly, as I have no idea what the expansion contains) but Niagara is not a good enough game to buy at its standard price. The problem is that there are 7 purple gems, and these gems are by far the easiest gems to collect in the game (though the clear gems are also not too difficult to collect). The three win conditions are to have 4 of one color gem, 7 gems total, or one gem of each color. I have never seen anyone win with the last condition, as what happens is that all of the purple gems are distributed among the players first, then either one player has collected 4 purple gems or else the game proceeds with players collecting gems from the next closest source until someone reaches 7 gems and wins. There is no game incentive to go after the gems near the falls, despite how much harder it is to get them. Thus the strategy of Niagara comes down to "grab as many purple gems as you can as quickly as you can" with no serious alternative. 

My other main issue with the game is that I don't like how there are rounds in which no player has a choice in what movement tile that they play (each seventh round before players collect their used tiles). I think the game would be much better if players had at least two choices of tile to play in every round.

Push your luck, pick up and deliver, and set collection game with a BEAUTIFUL setup, gorgeous to look at and friggin' cool board, it moves, you are on a raging river. You can fall off a waterfall. WIN. WIN. It's so easy to play, but there is so much room for tactical decisions. This one always seems to fascinate people.

The flow of the waterfall, while nice, feels somewhat gimmicky. There seem to be only a few main strategies, so replayability is suspect.

Great looking game, as are most Zoch titles, and with an innovative board. The insert is fantastic, everything fits very nicely.

Gameplay's fun and fast, and good family fair. However, the game is definitely best with more players. With 3 it can drag out, as the river tends to move much faster, and having two canoes on it at the same time is really a big drawback.

I was able to get the expansion free with the base game at GameHole Con and went for it hoping it was something the kids could play with me.  It seems a bit complicated for them... but is a pretty good game night game.  Its tricky wrapping your head around letting the river movement do some of your work for you... and because of that we ended up having group think powered canoe flotillas go flying off the waterfall with some regularity in our first game.  I'm looking forward to giving this another shot now that we have a better feel for how to make the cool moving river pieces work in our favor... and add in the expansion tiles.

Usa tus balsas para recoger gemas tanto río abajo como río arriba. Las más valiosas están cerca de la casacada pero son más difíciles de conseguir pues el clima puede aumentar el caudal y hacer caer tu balsa.

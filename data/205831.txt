A more visual take on the [b]Spyfall[/b] mechanic.  It's a little clunkier here, but perhaps more replayable.  Great quality components from Zoch, but the box size is outrageous to me.

RATING: 7
Spyfall/fake artist meets dixit cards. Gameplay however seems much more shallow and less creative than fake artist where figuring out what to draw  can lead to lots of creative solutions. The plusses to this game are that there is never a person who is the game Master and there isn't the down time of setting up all of the fake symbols.

1 speler is een mortal, en de andere zijn de goden.
De goden plaatsen steentjes in het heelal om een kaart te symboliseren.
De mortal moet raden over welke van de 4 kaarten het gaat, en zich best niet laten ontmaskeren.
Pff, hiervoor moet je goed smoelen kunnen trekken, en dat kan ik niet.

In short, if you enjoy Dixit and Concept, you will want this.

The idea of having players construct a zodiac sign from a random and often abstract image, together, is really good to begin with. But then having one player not have a clue and having to fake it, that's genius, and really adds a lot of fun to the game.

Was a random chance-buy at Essen 2016. Happy I did, one of the best games I brought home from it.

Indeed this is a mix of Dixit and Fake Artist Goes to New York. It doesn't have the charm of either, but it is clean and playable. And it is somewhat surprising what kind of mind melds you get from just placing stones on a field. The scoring seems a bit broken though...

Les images ne sont pas tous belles et la direction srtistique est moche, mais le jeu fonctionne tres bien. Fait penser à Musterium, mais en plus rapide, versus et possibilité de bluff.

RATING: 5
A clever adaptation of the "find the faker" genre (e.g. Spyfall) but for some reason left me numb. Maybe because when, as a god, someone accuses you of being the mortal, it feels like they're saying "you are bad at games and also at art" PLUS they are letting the real mortal get away and continue to inflict bad art on the cosmos.

I don't know, I didn't read the rules, maybe there's some metaphor involved and it's not literally a game about rogue sky artists. Nobody tells me anything, probably because they keep thinking I'm the mortal. Those jerks.

Sorry, got distracted. This had moments of brilliant mental interplay when the gods silently arrived at the same clever diversionary strategy, but I still didn't like it.

RATING: 5.5
Game is in same category as Dixit (so more social experience than game) and is really nice but may be a little bit to long and won't work with everyone (unlike Dixit).

I rated it lower not because it is bad game, but because it won't work with everyone.

An excellent entry into the hidden role category of games combined with abstractness in the style of dixit or mysterium. Loses points in that it's not particularly fun with less than a full compliment of players.

RATING: 5
A game I thought I would like very much. It had interesting idea- placing crystals to explain yourself to the other gods and show them you're not the mortal. In reality, the game felt very strange and not interesting at all. It was like Dixit without the social element, and the social element in Dixit is.... everything!

A Fake Artist Goes to the Stars. Players demonstrate their knowledge of which Dixit-esque card they are portraying with just a handful of neutrally colored gems on a blank canvas. It is stark, yet we were surprised by the amount of expression we were capable of in the medium, and even more so by the differing interpretations of the cards and stars themselves. A worthwhile experiment, even if just once.

Sort of like silent Dixit, but it's not as important to read minds.  Until a group comes up with conventions, the game could feel broken.  I think I like it more than Dixit though.

This was a lot more fun than I had thought it would be even though I only played it as a 3 player game for now. I can see this being a lot more fun with 6, or maybe best with 5... I like that you never really know how other players are interpreting the cards so that the reasoning behind their star placement is always a strange one and makes for debate afterwards.

Very neat little game :)

A mix of [thing=135779][/thing] and [thing=39856][/thing]. You are creating constellations which is such a cool idea. it is a party game to figure out the liar. I actually liked it well enough. I think it lasted a bit too long but it is a beautiful game with interesting pictures. I love the rainbows for player colors and I like the star (gem) placements.  It generated a lot of laughs- so I think it was overall a pleasant game for everyone, even if we all agreed it was probably better left on someone else's shelf. I would certainly play again, maybe to less points though.

Definitely has similiarities with games like A Fake Artist Goes to New York and Dixit. I feel like not very many cards translate well into constellations and the scoring mechanism might need some tweaking, but this is still a very solid party game. The confusion involved with interpeting everyone's abstract star placement is surprisingly entertaining.

A little tricky to get use to playing but after the first game or so, it is a lot of fun. Leads to a lot of those conversations after each round about what some player was thinking. 

Recommend to those who like Dixit and/or Spy Fall

Making constellations of pictures is a really fun idea.  Playing up to 16 points can be a bit long though.  I would recommend house ruling the number of victory points to win to a lower number.

One player does not know the secret card, and tries to not reveal himself. All players place stones on a board and discuss their placements how they please. Not for me, and even then I would probably choose another game.

They told me this is "like Dixit but better". We tried to play it, we laughed at how silly it is, and we didnt like it that much. I am among those who tried to defend it, just because it is somehow original and elegant (graphically speaking) but... it seems pointless and with a strange point distribution mechanism. Probably the fun part is when you try to use your stars but yet... it really seems pointless

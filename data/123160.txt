Refreshing -- a big winner. Beautiful presentation and very well-integrated theme. 

Mechanics are more subtle than they first appear -- card-play is agonizing in deciding which cards to keep or play in an attempt to build a strong hand (they are definitely not "merely random" as one low rating states). Pleasing tug-of-war effect on each soul -- dramatic and engaging. Relics offer welcome unpredictability. Fantastic 2-player game. (Haven't tried it with 4.) 

Methinks those who enjoy The Road to Canterbury will enjoy Battle for Souls, and vice-versa (fine art, religious theme, strong 2-player gameplay, etc.)

Great theme and great artwork make this an interesting game to play for the experience of it.  As for the gameplay itself, after one play, I am on the fence on it, not sure whether to like it, or dislike it.  The game works, but its mechanics are not particularly compelling for me, not bad, just not fully engaging or exciting.  Nevertheless, I can envision myself playing it again, at a minimum, just to read and study all the beautiful cards!

Cool 2p game that keeps tension especially towards the end. Relatively luck prone where the one drawing the right cards at the right time has the top hand, but strategy does make its presence felt..great real-life artwork on good quality cards, i don't see this one leaving my bookcase anytime soon.

Cooler components instead of cubes when compared to the first edition+presence of a playmat cloth. For the card stock, I much prefered the first edition's linen finish, but the second edition is not too shabby either. All in all, an improvement but not when you consider the doubling of price this entails. Still, I enjoy the game so I will keep this version instead and spread the love by passing along the first edition.

I've enjoyed the solo play on this.  The decks are evenly matched, so you will need skill and "luck of the draw" to win.  I've not played 2p yet, but it seems that is where this game will shine.

Also, the artwork that was picked out goes great with the theme.

2 player: This is brillant game.  I've moved my rating from a 6 to a 8 because of how good it plays. It has a "tug-o-war" feel that feels and plays so much better then that sounds.  Edit: became same-y. Probably our play style.

RATING: 7
There are a lot of fascinating things going on here that are really interesting to deal with between hand management, set collecting and how/when to counter your opponent. Also, this has one of the most beautifully integrated themes I think I've ever come across. Components and artwork are top notch as well (save the soul cards, which I wish were slightly thicker and more durable)

OK tug-o-war 2p card game, but with a great theme and good production values. Due to the negative points below, I am not anymore interesting in keeping it.

+ rich tactical choices depending on special abilities in play
+ uses poker hands with an interesting payout table
+ daring and engaging theme
+ well produced

= lots of luck of the draw, which balances out due to the game's length

- terribly long and repetitive
- special abilities cards with small text need to be read/memorized across the table to play well
- special abilities seem uninventive and situational

Making Poker hands with colors is boring already and add in the fact that there are way too many of the clear the board cards to make strategy interesting.

This game melds quite a few mechanics into a very satisfying 2p game. The (mostly) historic art lends weight to a very old-fashioned theme: good versus evil, with souls at stake. The two sides are largely symmetric, but different abilities in the form of holy/unholy relics and sins/intercessions will be available each game.

RATING: 9
A unique theme and concept for a card game. The cards have splendid graphic art. The rules are precise and leave no room for ambiguities. Each player tries to affect the morals and merits of a human soul. The HELL side using his Devils will try to corrupt souls; the HEAVEN side using Archangels will try to bring them on the right path. When the humans pass away, based on the Holy or Unholy points accumulated to their souls they will end up either in Hell or in Heaven giving victory points to the respective side. Each side has a variety of options and can take various decisions to attain their goal; they can augment their accumulated points to a soul or they can thwart their opponent's plans. The never ending battle between Good 'n' Evil.There is some luck involved concerning spiritual matters, some tactics in the way you are going to use your cards and lots of fun trying to manipulate human destinies.  Nice work, good and clever gaming.

The solo game of this is decent, but ultimately unsatisfying.  It ends too quickly, and certain elements that I can see being wonderful (long-term planning with the accumulation of devils or angels; dilution of the deck with victory point cards) are absent in the solitaire game.  Having said that, the artwork and component quality is phenomenal, and there is enough excellence evident that makes me greatly look forward to trying this with another player.

Played twice 2-player.  Fairly disappointed.  It's not a bad game, it plays smoothly, and the mechanics are sound, but it's just not that as much fun as I had hoped.  It gets quite repetitive.

Simple poker variant of Heaven battling Hell to acquire Souls (as the prize). Players try to hold sway over souls by scoring points & influencing them by turning in different (poker) hand combinations whilst using other cards (Holy & Unholy Relic cards) that are used to modify their powers. The art is wonderful- all types from different periods, the game is easy to teach, and the theme is somewhat unique. It's worth going to the download section to print out Heaven & Hell player mats to help organize cards.  As some have mentioned, I would enjoy the game more if Kickstarters' faces weren't on the souls cards (kind of ruins it a bit)- bad idea & kills the theme temporarily (we just put those cards aside, sometimes). If players draw the wrong cards, can get a bit agonizing after a time.

Heaven and Hell play poker for the souls of the soon-to-be-departed!  Fun!  Components and Renaissance artwork are beautiful and very evocative of the theme, although I can do without the backer-themed "D" series of soul cards and silly promo relic cards (Mystic Cowbell and Holy Hand Grenade).  Two-thumbs up for the selectable game length, as you can play anywhere from one to three sets of 7 soul cards for longer or shorter games.  Be mindful, though, that playing a very short game with ony a single set of soul cards exacerbates the "luck of the draw" factor in this game; longer games tend to spread out the luck factor and enable a bit more strategic planning.  A good filler.

The game as a whole looks and plays well and I'm very pleased, but the set collecting randomness is a worry (the luck should even out over a longer game i think? ie. at least 14souls). I can't help thinking that the game would have been better if a different more euro style mechanic had been used to determine what gets done each turn.

2014-06-14 - This is a neat, simple area control game in the form of a reasonably simple card game. It can feel a little lucky (you will occasionally have a hand of cards that you can't use at all), but it's fun. The different special cards add a really nice element to the game.

2017-11-06 - We sold this one after a while. It just didn't hold our interest after enjoying the initial play.

This review is based on a single 4 player game and a warm up solo session to get used to the rules. 

I had a horrible experience and did not enjoy the game at all. As with several other reviewers I found that the game was luck heavy from the souls (major victory point cards/battlefields) to the card draw - if the latter did not match what you had in play then that was tough luck. The worst part for me though was that the game lasted well over 90 minutes and not the 40 minutes promised for a 2 set game and that of those 90 minutes on average my turns lasted about 5 seconds maximum whilst those of my opponents on the opposite team was between 1-2 minutes a piece, this was an enormous amount of downtime and not something that I had much chance to affect.

The driving mechanism of the game is collecting sets similar to poker hands which allows you to make power plays, however with 7 suits and a hand limit of 8 the chances of powerful combinations are not that great and once an opponent has dibs on a soul, trying to swing it back to your control is very difficult. Once our opponents had control they were quite effectively using the HP (cash) to purchase power cards, however on our side with only 1 soul to influence the lack of choice meant drawing a specific card – which I failed to do time and time again, so whilst our opponents were collecting power cards we were picking one up every other turn and only if we were lucky. Even when all three souls were swept away and 3 new ones appeared my side was stuffed because the accumulation of power cards on the opposing side meant they immediately gained control of 2 new souls and we were back to square one on our side.

For most of the game I had no control and by the ¾ stage of the game I was horribly frustrated and wanted it over. I do not think I have felt this badly about a game for a large number of years. On the other hand my opponents enjoyed the game immensely, they had plenty to do every turn, and were able to set up and play through chained events. 

Now if you forget for the moment the luck factor, lack of control and general imbalance in the four player game I can move on to the positive points. The mechanisms work and mesh well together and seem on the face of it well balanced, with the right card formations you can set up chains of events which will capture souls quite quickly and give you a feel of control. The artwork on the cards is amazing I expect a lot of effort went into getting the permissions required and the rule book is complete and well written leaving no room for rules lawyering. There is every chance that this is a good solid 2 player game but I will not be playing it again, oh and just in case other readers say we were not playing it correctly – yes we did play the team game with the special rules regarding sin/intersession, relic cards and  discarding – and yes it was still imbalanced and for me was a tortuous experience.

RATING: 7.5
Battle For Souls is a card game pitting the seven archangels of heaven versus the seven princes of hell in a fight for the eternal souls of humankind.

Guiding a soul to complete purity or complete darkness before death and final judgment adds a new archangel or prince of hell to a player's arsenal. Influence on souls can be spent for more powerful cards that have special abilities, and allow a player to gain souls more quickly.

Many strategic decisions impact play. Strategies include focusing on gaining more help from heaven or hell to increase your power, working to reap souls quickly from the start with little intervention from the angelic and demonic hordes, or balancing your play to ensure victory.

After a video review: This is basically a 2 player game, some mechanics are interesting, you are basically playing set of cards poker style to pull on your side the soul of characters that you try to acquire.

From my perspective, the poker suites seems very confusing to use, you need to remember the effects of each combinations. As for the theme, some effects does not make any sense, Like you can reduce your control of a character to buy sin or unholy artifacts. it's Ok to buy those with poker cards, but by changing corruption status, it feels weird.

Sure there are some mechanics in there that could be reused elsewhere.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I'm not overly fond of the theme or the theology behind the game (although I recognize this game is not likely making  a theological point and some things such as souls getting destroyed and being removed is about game mechanics, not theology). Concept wise, the team game was interesting but there are other games that do the team thing better which I'd rather play.

Battle Line is a classic Knizia game I've always wanted to like more than I do. I like the tug-of-war aspect of it, but the gameplay was always very dry and uninteresting to me. Battle for Souls is sort of built on that foundation (it's really not a great comparison, but it will do) but adds some thematic and mechanical depth to it. You are Heaven an Hell, battling for, well, souls, by claiming them through virtues and vices. The artwork, provided by various grand masters, is fantastic, and the package as a whole is well done. We struggled through the poorly-written rulebook (which does include a hilariously overwrought section on backing up play to make a change) and I think both of us weren't too excited at first, but once we got going, I really enjoyed it. There's a lot of back and forth, a lot of possible nasty card play, and some fun thematic elements. I'm glad I got a hold of this one.

Unfortunately, I think Omen: A Reign of War is a better game of this type.

This is one that a friend Kickstarted that I really enjoyed playing. I love the theme, particularly the use of the seven deadly sins. It has a lot going on, but it's all thematic and actually works really well together.

In this two player game, you're either Heaven or Hell trying to win the game primarily by recruiting souls of the dead. You have a hand composed of the seven deadly sins and their positive counterparts where you're trying to collect the best poker hand and use it to corrupt/redeem souls. Depending on the level of influence, souls are either sent to heaven/hell, go to limbo, or even ascend to a higher level, giving you an archangel/greater demon that gives you ongoing bonuses. There are also items that you get with poker hands that have small benefits. Basically, you get to play God.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
PROS:
- Great theme/artwork and components although apparently it is controversial to some. 
- The card play is simple, especially if you're familiar with Poker hands, but there is enough going on to engage both players and offer some depth.
- The direct interaction during the "battle for souls" in the middle of the table. Whether to spend your soul points on sin/intercession or holy/unholy relics is a good decision point. Acquiring those cards will give you different abilities but sometimes you risk losing a soul (VP) to your opponent. Timing your Reap cards is also crucial, sometimes it's best to send everyone to purgatory or give your opponent a soul rather than let him/her continue to harvest soul points round after round. The game ends once all the souls have been either sent to Hell, Heaven or Purgatory so you also have some control of when to end the game with the Reap cards which is another interesting nuance. 
- Rewards multiple plays against the same opponent. The game really flourishes when playing the same opponent often because you start to second guess each other and create a little meta between what each person likes to do or is likely to do especially when it comes to Reap cards.
- quick playing.

CONS:
- I enjoy the theme but it is apparently controversial to some.
- It's a good game but lacks a little bit of excitement to elevate it. That lack of dynamics means that it maybe doesn't get to the table as much as it could for it's play length.
- Sometimes the card font can be hard to read in less ideal lighting conditions.

I've only played it 2 player and don't expect to ever try 4 player (that mode seems a little tacked on anyway) but overall, it's a very enjoyably thematic, quick card game with enough strategy and tactical elements to keep me entertained.

RATING: 9
So far we are finding this to be quite fun and engaging. The more we play the more we find other paths to try to win. You can get some streaks of bad card draws but if you play with 3-4 sets of souls this tends to not be as much of a factor. Each player has times of regrouping or building up cards for better plays.
No doubt you must get some sin/intercession and holy/unholy relics to enhance your abilities. Not only that, but they can add to your victory point totals. Early on we tended to focus too heavily on just trying to capture souls and not use some of your holy/unhloy points to buy the sin/intercession and holy/unholy relics. This meant some pretty dull game play and very slow progress. Once we started stepping out and  getting other cards the game really opened up and got far more interesting.
Wonderful 2 player card game, terrific art on the cards, all in all a well done game!

I like the theme and the looks. Gameplay is Battle Line or Blue Moon with a few extra layers. The theme fits very well I think. Too bad I can´t get enthusiastic anymore over games that has the player opposite you laying out cards with important text that you forget as soon as it is read out loud for you.

After 3 solo plays and a two player game, I can say that I really like this game.  Both play very differently.

Components are excellent (although the box is oversized), great theme and well implemented with the influence mechanic.  There is some initial rule complexity to teach new players, but easy enough to get down and then things really start to shine. 

Combination of poker-style set collection based around the 7 heavenly virtues / deadly sins with hand management and position control.

Merry XMas game of Battle for Souls. This game seems to have a lot of potential. After a game, I wanted to play again to try some new strategies and see more of the powerful cards.
It plays fast and has a fairly easy rule set. I love games that balance building your own strategy with foiling your opponent. This game does it very well. I am impressed with the beautiful components; perfect artwork and theme!

RATING: N/A
Rating is based on a playtest with the designer on an early prototype. There was art on the cards at the time, but nowhere near the quality that the final product will have, so my rating is based almost entirely on the gameplay. 

Battle For Souls is one of those great games that is quick to teach and learn, but requires several plays to understand and enjoy the depth available. I look forward to getting my Kickstarter copy so I can explore it further.

The theme certainly has the potential to be controversial, but I never blinked at it because I can't remember the last time I played a game that didn't involve killing and/or stealing; these are just games after all. I'm not sure what this one seems to strike a nerve with some people but to each his own - for me it's a great game with an interesting theme, and the final art is going to be amazing.

Fun every single time. The more I play it the more I like it. My wife absolutely adores the game! The only thing i didn't like was a few of the soul photo's showing kick-starter sponsors ruined the theme of the game at times. Mainly the guy in a lab coat standing in front of an MRI tube. The other guys (or gals) did good, a few even great,  or were at least unobtrusive. Just a bad production decision, otherwise great!

RATING: 7.9
Average rating for this game was just too high. People seem to really like it. They say it plays well with two players. Super cool theme. Looks fun and awesome. In theory, thematically I already have claustrophobia and I already have a lot of good two player card games now, nightfall, draco magi, netrunner, etc, but this looks cool and I got it as part of the kickstarter a long with draco magi. Hope they don't expand the hell out of it. Hoping it has a relatively easy set up and take down, hope it's fun to play and has a lot of replayability. Cool art and good reviews but don't know anything else yet.

UPDATE:

I've played this game now and it really fits well into a fun two player card game that is high strategy, easy enough to teach and doesn't require any deck building or card collecting. I like how overkill the box and inlay is. I love the disturbing old timey art and how well it fits. The theme comes to life better than at first glance but you have to use your imagination. The mechanics are unique and interesting and though there's a poker like element to it, it didn't remind me of anything which is a nice element. There are so many viable strategies but luck is still a huge variable (which I like) and has to be accounted for. This game is more fun the more you play it and the worst game you play will probably be the first. Being able to play solotaire as a hand management, race against the clock type thing is fun enough. I can't really imagine wanting to play this 4 player, but as a two player game its great and being able to adjust the length of the game based on number of souls is awesome.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---

Push your luck card hand management.

I don't like the artwork or graphic design, it doesn't follow a theme, just a compendium of famous masterworks. Too serious for a game.

The theme is well integrated into the mechanics and the game feels consistent and solid.

But at its core, it seems too dependant on getting a nice draw, or getting the cards you need to make this combo you're looking for, etc.

It's also a bit long.

The theme is catchy and the game play well done. It is a mix of strategy and luck, as card draw is a significant factor. This game is easy to learn, and you can get the mechanics down the first time you play. We have played quite a few times, and I think there are multiple ways to win, so that makes it interesting. It is really nice to have a fun game for two players! 

I think the artwork is nice...I don't know if its excerpts from Rennaisance art, or just in that style, but I would say if the "naked" persons on these cards offends one, be careful visiting The Louvre or The Hermitage or other similar fine art museums because you will see the same kind of thing.

Very good 2 player hand-management tug-of-war card game. I LOVE the artworks/choices and graphic design; they really really really add to the gameplay and feel. This of Kosmos game caliber.

Games can play under an hour when players know the game. Some of the hand management is of Poker nature.

The original artworks may be a turn-off for some people, but I enjoy classical art, so it is a bonus for me !

Solo play is solid, and difficult.

The rulebook could be clearer on how the die on the neutral position is actually a value of zero hp/up. Also, it is easy to miss that Intercession cards with victory point shields are a one time use.

I have the 2017 Kickstarter expansion cards (but not the U.S. Presidents).  The game can be exciting and fun if both players are getting decent draws and combos.  However, it can also be a frustrating slog if the luck of the draw is consistently bad for one or both players.  Traded my second copy for  Twilight Struggle as part of a U.S. only math trade (1/21/14).

Played two player version in Charlotte and print and play version solo. Have not played the 4 player version.

Every game of the two player version I played was within 3 points, so it's a very well balanced game.

The art is amazing.

You have good options with every hand, but pushing your luck can pay big dividends or leave you with nothing. Highly recommend spending points you earn on souls. Even though it cost you points early in the game, it makes you more powerful for the end game.

Excellent, fast and tense game with an amazing theme!

This was the first game I ever kickstarted. It's a good medium-weight 2-player card game, pitting heaven against hell - despite that, it's not particularly assymetrical, as there are comparable effects in the cards both sides have available. You're playing poker-style card combinations (and also trying to build them up) in order to influence souls - this influence not only helps you claim them for victory points when a "reap" card is played, but can be spent for access to powerful cards. This creates a really interesting dynamic to the game, especially as you're not allowed to increase your influence on a soul unless it is either already under your influence or neutral. All in all, this isn't a game I want to play all the time, but it's a really interesting - and pleasingly thematic - 2-player card game that would ideally reach a larger audience than it has at the moment.

I think this is a game where people confuse calculation with choice, card balance with contextual luck, and production quality with theme.

Also, there is simply a LOT of luck in drawing sets of cards of the same color, and arbitrarily choosing to play cards of colors you aren't about to draw.  Mono-sets are good.  Mixed sets are a consolation prize.

Maybe a bigger hand size would help, plus more info about your opponent's hand, plus more souls, plus a shorter play time, plus an entirely different game.

A satisfying two player game with interesting decisions and replay value; this is one of my favorite shorter two-player games. It's easy to adjust game length by competing for fewer or more souls.

Kickstarted, P'n'P edition. Card game based on poker hands. Not the game I will play every day, but it is fun when I get it out of the box.

Good thing is that you basically need only 50% of the cards, since it is a solo game and you get to chose sides, and I believe most will play just hell.

Heaven is symmetrical to hell, so for game play it doesn't matter, just the feeling of the game changes. And it feels good to be bad :)

Excellent card game with poker-style hands.  You have to balance the risk reward of trying to draw cards to make stronger hands or building up holy/unholy points in hopes of using those to buy relics and sin/intercession cards.  Easy enough to teach to my almost 8-year old.  Wonderful game with classic art that incorporates a usually touchy theme very easily into gameplay.

2 player game. 

One player is trying to get human souls to heaven and the other player is trying to send them to hell. It really is a battle for souls!

There are a lot of things I like about this game. The theme is great, the game mechanics are unique and interesting, the artwork (using famous paintings from the Italian Renaissance era), and the balance between intensity and fun. I like that you can choose the number of souls to play (1 to 4 sets), which determines how long the game will last.

This is a 2-player area control-ish game where one player plays the side of Heaven and the other the side of Hell battling over the souls of different characters.  Each character has a certain sin or virtue that they are susceptible to and you attract them to your side by playing poker hands of cards of that sin or virtue.  The better the poker hand the more you influence them.

The game is essentially a tug-of-war and can be really really lucky depending on which sins/virtues the characters that flip over are susceptible to and what cards you draw or have on your board.  The poker hand mechanic is pretty neat though, something you don't see too terribly often.  The game also plays pretty quickly, even the full game using the entire deck of characters.

The theme will certainly put some people off who can't handle this subject matter.  Also, even if the theme doesn't bother you, I've seen some just not want to play the side of hell because of the gruesome artwork on the cards.

This game was a very pleasant surprise. Has enough layered depth to keep my interest. The theme is aptly applied. Plays fast too. Luck can play a significant role, but in a game like this that's OK.

Except for the insert, production values are excellent; I especially like the linen finish cards and extra thick box.

I really appreciate the flexibility of separate (A, B, C, and D) soul decks, plus the solo or 4-player option.

There's thankfully a small dose of humor in the game, as well.

The solitaire game lacks some of the tension of the 2-player contest and quite a few of the cards have no effect, but it is quick and fairly engaging.

One of the better 2-player PvP titles out there. Flexible and fun - nice job!

I got my copies today. Played a solo game to learn the rules. I agree with much of what has been said. The theme and game play are great. Which for me are the most important factors. The box is also very sturdy. The cards feel thin, but shuffle very readily. It actually makes it very difficult to shuffle the smaller decks (intercession and relics). My insert is half destroyed on opening as well. This is unfortunate since I really like the organization in the box. I'll try and do some repair this weekend, but I think it may not be salvageable. My biggest problem is that a majority of my cards are pretty significantly miscut/aligned. Many of them have a few millimeters of border at best on one side and better than a quarter inch on the other. This is true for the backs as well. Since the cards for each of the decks were not cut the same, it's really easy to tell the difference in cards based on the backs when I am drawing. The wild cards and a few of the other virtue cards have huge borders on the opposite side as the others. Props to Robert for the great art, layout, and design. Shame on Panda for the low quality control. I've noticed a significant decline in Panda component games in the last year. People used to tout that Panda was a high quality manufacturer, but I will likely steer clear of their products in the future. The linen finish feels nice, but I find sometimes makes the text harder to read. The fairly large amount of naked bodies and somewhat graphic art makes me less likely to bring this to in for my students to play at my high school, and certainly something I'll have to hold off on playing with my daughter. Sorry, lots of ramblings that seem negative, but should reiterate, great gameplay and integrated theme.

I have really no idea how to rate this game.

There are aspects of it that draws me in and there are parts that I just cannot make work. I am perhaps afraid that it might be group-think on the part of my wife and I so I am eager to play again to try different avenues.

Therefore, the rating is likely to change over time, though perhaps most likely in the upwards direction...

A beloved favourite of mine. Battle for Souls is a 1v1 card game that has two players fighting over souls on earth. One player plays as heaven, while the other is hell. Souls on earth will have different virtues and temptations, such as one soul being humble but gluttonous, while another might be chaste but wrathful. Players will have a deck of cards that can tap into these virtues or temptations, (depending on the side they're on) which will be utilized in the form of poker hands, such as two pair, three of a kind, etc. Playing these hands will also grant the opportunity for players to purchase abilities that can turn the tides when they're in a tight spot. What really sells this game for me, however, is the art. The gameplay is already great, but the cards themselves (most of them at least) feature renaissance art, which really adds to the theme. The components are also great quality, seeing as each card has a nice linen finish. All in all this is a great game that I feel deserves a lot of love, highly recommended.

With more plays, I have lowered the rating from an 8 to a 6.  There seems to a be a large advantage for whichever side adds the first point to a soul.  Because you can use sets of different cards to add points and add more points faster than you can subtract them with multiples of the same card, the person who adds the first point usually gets the soul.  Furthermore, rarely does it seem to make sense to invest points for an upgrade card.

Its too bad because this Kickstarter was run really well and the game components are nice quality and have good artwork.

Best at lower player counts as turn order bidding becomes a dance in it's own right with the two turns per round. Beautiful game with lots of decisions about possible ways to score points, and a random start. Tough to tell who is winning until the bitter end which is a particularly nice touch, and there isn't a strategy that just breaks the game (it's much more important to tailor something based on what the board tells you, and what you opponent does). I think in terms of non-interactive euros, I appreciate this one, even if it does fall out as a puzzle plus a jockeying game for turn order.

I was really stoked to try this game out at BGG.Con 2014 and after two plays ended up buying the last copy on the final day of the con. My wife may end up being the only one in our group who will play it with me, but it's a unique game in our collection and I'm happy to own it.

Very mathy and analytical, it ends up being more fun that it has any right to be - the mancala elements and the djinn help a bunch with this, but ultimately the simple mechanics combine well enough to make a proper, fully fleshed out game with enough depth to satisfy most anyone, but without a particularly high barrier to entry.

I love this game. I have only played at the two-player count. I really like the (very controversial) double-moves that are possible in two-player games. We use two house rules to tighten up the experience for two players: 1. replace the Viziers with Artisans, and 2. play on a slightly smaller grid of 6 x 4 tiles. I adjust down the number of meeples and camels accordingly.

[I]tl;dr - Five Tribes wraps a really interesting game around mancala, and the fact that you WILL be leaving good stuff behind for other players to pick up. Don't play with AP-prone people, but this is a great hour-long game if you like tactical games.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Five Tribes is best described by its uniqueness. You use a reverse worker placement concept, where you are picking workers off of existing spaces, then moving them elsewhere on the board to conduct an action and use the meeple's abilities. Meeples can buy you goods, help you court the favor of powerful genies, assassinate other meeples, and earn you victory points towards the game end. 

Five Tribes is an incredibly tactical game. Every turn, you will be scoping out the game board for the best possible turn, and then bidding on the turn order (which brings in some nice bluffing and planning -- it's possible to entirely overbid as happened to one player in the latest game we played). Because of this, it can be prone to analysis paralysis, but this doesn't happen often if you keep players moving. 

I love Five Tribes because it presents so many difficult decisions as well as so many paths to victory. I sprinted to a tight win in our latest game because I specialized on the market almost to the exclusion of everything else. I've seen other players win with Djinns, with conservative bidding, and with great area control on the board. The great part is, you need to focus on multiple victory point engines in addition to your primary one, because one specialty won't be enough to bring you to victory. 

If you love tactical games, beautiful artwork, and a great, elegant game that plays in under an hour and a half, Five Tribes is for you. I couldn't think of another game that better uses worker placement in such an innovative fashion, and it's one of my go-tos when we want a medium-heavy game to play. Highly recommended.

[thing=176677][/thing] [b][BGCOLOR=#00CC00][COLOR=#00cc00].[/COLOR]10[COLOR=#00cc00].[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/b] - the best way to expand a game. New mechanics are introduced, but they aren't ridiculously overpowered and don't add needless complexity. With the exception of teaching newbies, I think I'll always play with the expansion since it feels so . . . natural. It adds a bigger game board, with a few obstacles (mountains and the void), and the Artisans are a great sixth tribe. Adding the magical items to the base game works out well as well, and it can really be a viable path to victory.

Very beautiful and I can see how others may like it, but I want to burn this game with fire.  There is way too much open information to be able to actively consider on a turn.  There is often a best move that can be taken by a player.  It then becomes a where's waldo game of trying to find the best move.  It's difficult to plan on your turn as the board state changes between players.  Wanted to quit half way through (even though I ended up winning).  Will not play this again.

I believe this game is great with 2 players. EVERY move you make matters, there have been several games where the ending score are less than 10 points apart. Even though the ending scores are as high as 200! I would rate it with 8, if just considering 2 players.

When I first played Five Tribes, I loved it but worried about analysis paralysis. However, I love this game more every single time I play it and it is now one of my favorite games, even if it's not one that gets to the table constantly. The beauty of this game is that it is relatively simple mechanically (the only real mechanic in the game is the mancala, so once you understand it, it's just a matter of what the different tribes do and what djinns and market items are available). Despite this simplicity, this game is full of strategic and tactical depth. You are both required to plan long-term to create a cohesive strategy and you must be tactical and respond to opportunities that arise (and avoid creating opportunities). While long thinking times can be an issue, this game plays very well once everyone is familiar with the game. Familiarity tends to shorten the thinking considerably and players who are used to the game are more comfortable with waiting for a while for players to put together their move. As a result, this game is perfect for when you want to play a heavier game but also want to socialize with those around the table. As long as everyone sets a personal mental timer for themselves, giving themselves only a limited amount of time to find the best move, the game plays very well. Strangely enough, exactly because the options for moves are often so unlimited, players are more willing to let go and make a 'good' move that gets them plenty of points without spending an eternity seeking out the 'best' move. Perfection.

4 plays / 2,3 players

LIKE: Great production, tangible game bits. Many good choices, almost too many, but some minor strategies can be found. I enjoyed the base point scoring, modular boards, and djinn powers.
DISLIKE: Board changes between every turn which induces analysis paralysis. If a player doesn't think about setting other players up, and only focuses on their own point goals, the game can go by quicker. Oh, and there is no need for the slave cards, as the theme is thin. Use the fakirs.

OVERALL: Although my wife didn't care for it, too many rules for her, I was able to teach it quickly to others. Some people find the game too much of a puzzle, but I think that is part of the fun. Not a game for over-analyzers, but a timer can help.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A favourite of my wife and I.  After about 20+ plays we both still love it.  It works well at all player counts, but I like it best at 2.  

I've played twice with the first expansion and found it good but unnecessary.  It adds some randomness to the game which isn't an improvement.  With that said, it probably makes the 4 player game a bit better since the game is longer and you have more chances to score points.

I've also played once with the second expansion. It's okay, but I don't think this game needed take-that genies. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It is in fact very good. I was worried about the AP possibilities in this one - and it is overwhelming for a moment with all the meeples and tiles. But once explained, I think it's pretty approachable. The paths to victory are surprising. And the scores are generally very close. My second game was 141-139-139 and I don't think a one of us traveled down the same scoring path. It certainly was surprising. Gorgeous production, plenty of replay with Djinnis and my version (second printing?) replaced the offending 'slaves' with 'fakirs' - much appreciated for approachability makes for a great experience. Love it.

Five Tribes has very interesting mechanics for action selection. I found it rather refreshing. The downside is that every turn players have hundreds if not thousands of possible moves. You can imagine how a game will turn out if you played with someone prone to indecisiveness or with a will to analyse the situation completely before making any decisions. Good quality components and pleasant graphics.

The gameplay is more of seizing the opportunities rather than of building your position. However, there is some room for long term strategies and cunning which will definitely delight more experienced boardgamers.

If this is not THE best game out there, it is at the very least easily my favourite.
Lots of roads to victory, many decisions to make and a very, very original game (with superb components) make this a must buy. Also, you get two games for the price of one, really, since the two player game is so very different from the 3/4 player game. And I love both tremendously.

My favorite Bruno Cathala game so far. Five Tribes is a mechanism cocktail but most notably the area control and mancala mechanics are the big gears that move the game. Yes there is card drafting set collection djinns with triggering powers etc etc but those are all added meat on a solid game design that make a good game better. I really enjoy this game. You spend most of it dropping five different meeples mancala style on each module of the board. The last drop triggers one of five different possible powers and possibly gets you ownership of the module, you obtain land, djinns and special sets of cards to gain victory points and win the game. As play progresses and available moves diminish ap can creep in to the game and slow it down but this is a minor issue. The art is also gorgeous. I am jot surprised that the game is getting so much recognition and accolades. Also, if feeding old people and slaves to djinns to make them use powers isn't your thing, the BGG store is currently selling substitute cards to swap out the slaves for.

One of my favorite game. I don't think i would refuse a game of Five tribes. It's a game of opportunity and there is not one single strategy that will alwys win.

People have described it as Mancala with new rules, but I can't do that.  The gameplay is similar in terms of you pick things up and drop them, but it isn't similar anymore after that.  I love the mechanics, I love the scoring and I love the Djinns!

I've taught my mom (non-gamer), my dad (gamer), my wife (gateway gamer) and a few of my friends it.  It has yet to be declined by any of them and after the first game, they all wanted to immediately play it again.

I love games with easy rules, quick turns and the non-solitaire feel.

A good, solid euro.  The mechanics are pretty straightforward but the strategy is deep enough to keep me engaged.  I like the variety of choices and how everything pushes and pulls on the rest.  Nicely done.

Of course this is all balanced against the inherent paralysis of all those choices and how advance planning is almost entirely fruitless (one player's move can totally destroy and/or change your options).  I can't fault others for delays when it's their turn because I end up the same way - reanalyzing and reassessing.  The dynamic nature of the game is its downfall.

I will play this from time to time, but a 4p game has the potential for serious delay.

FAVOURITE GAME - this game reinvents worker placement and meeples: the game begins with the meeples already in place – and players must cleverly maneuver them over the villages, markets, oases, and sacred places tiles that make up Naqala. How, when, and where you displace these Five Tribes of Assassins, Elders, Builders, Merchants, and Viziers determine your victory or failure. It is an enchanting game, but the planning phase can take up a lot of time.

1st play: Enjoyable, mid-weight game. Lots of opportunity for AP, but as long as it's played with the right group I think it will be fine. The art and presentation are excellent, Days of Wonder, so no surprise. The Djinns are all unique and interact with the board in interesting ways.

2nd play: The game plays quite differently with 3 than with 2. It's more tactical with 3, and AP could bog the game down. It didn't in my group, but I have to be very careful who I play this game with. It doesn't live up to the hype, but very few games could. A good game I'm happy to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Great game, I read a lot of people complaining about the AP, I played the game in 4, with 2 friends that are known by their apness and simply the game passed the test. We managed to play this game in about 50 minutes. Very interesting game, good mechanics, simple, with enough depth. The art is amazing, like almost every art from Days of Wonder.

Edit: After a game in 2 players I decided to give it a push forward on the rating. Great game in 2 players, plays a little different, you can make powerful combos that make the game even more interesting.

Edit: It is a 9 rate, great game, very different strategies and variability of gameplays, a lot of interaction, after a couple more games I can say it works fine in 2, 3 or 4, probably one of the best games of this year.

[b]18.09.2014 - after 1 play[/b]
Five Tribes is a "heavier" game from Days of Wonder, compared to the usual "TTR"-ian difficulty of their previous games. 

Graphics-wise, it doesn't look too spectacular. I might say that the background of the tiles is too samey and too brownish (yes, I know the setting is a desert one). On the other hand, the Djinns have unique and gorgeous designs. The components (other than the squares that form the modular board) are solid and nice to the touch. 

Theme is completely pasted-on. This game could have been about dinosaurs or SF explorers, still would have played the same. 

Five Tribes has the not-so-used "mancala" mechanism (I don't know any other modern game, except Trajan, that uses it) and this is the core element of the gameplay. The other aspect of the game, the set collection one, can deliver many points at the end of the game, especially by card sets. Also the biding for turn order feels ok. In our game, the Djinn cards were almost never used so I don't know if they are useful.

Plus: the "still" fresh mancala system and the components.
Minus: the AP that the mancala and the biding bring to the game. Because of the ever changing board status, you cannot plan for a move, unless you are determined to bid for first player (at least in the last half of the game). Also, some of the players may leave opportunities for the ones following them, but this is partially handled through the biding every turn.

Although there are more minuses than pluses, I enjoyed the game and would love to play it more, so that I can form a FINAL opinion.

Really good, really beautiful and really brainy. It has the mancala system as a basis, but it's utterly unfair to call it Mancala 2.0 as it adds so much to it. It has a few paths to victory, but i feel that the set-collection is the most important and if the group let a player persue it alone he/she will probably win. It may induce AP. How about the components quality? Man, Days of Wonder awesomeness in a box.

One of my favorite games. I love the 2p mechanic of bidding for two turns in each round. Have also played with 3p and it is equally enjoyable. I loved Mancala as a kid, so the core mechanic really hit home with me. The differenr djinns and some variety. I feel like I always have a lot of options and finding the optimal strategy is a great challenge.

A pet peeve of mine is games in which you can't plan.

Welcome to my own version of hell.

Every turn, after each player takes his or her turn, you are faced with a new board. There are random elements that are not significant but can influence the game play, and the game may simply disallow certain options by virtue of the random nature of the board.

If you are good at (or enjoy) managing random turns of events, this game will appeal to you. If herding cats sounds like a thankless task, well, move along then.

I think this is a 9.5 because I am always desperate to play it. I find it fairly hard to get to the table, but enjoy it a lot every time.  Great game with 3-4 players!

Two negatives:
1) this can get super thinky for some people and they might take forever on their turn.  Those people MAY be mostly me.
2) I feel it is a bad 2 player game.  The two player rules create MANY scenarios where you go twice in a row.  That is not only super powerful, but also exponentially increases the difficulty of optimizing the first of those two moves. It also makes the bidding much harder to calculate.  When bidding who wins the game often hinges on who can calculate the value of taking two turns in a row on the current board state.  That is a VERY hard mental calculation to do well on.

A very nice blend of strategy and tactics; you do need both! 

It's essentially a victory-point salad sort of game, and filled with AP; but it's not a long game, so the AP is endurable.

My only major complaints are about the art and presentation. First of all, I fear Five Tribes may present some challenges to the colour-blind; and the similarities between the appearances of the various non-meeple wooden pieces make it difficult even for those who happily live in a kaleidoscope. The artwork on the djinn cards is beautiful....and the art everywhere else is fairly bad! It's hard to believe it was all done by the same artist.

OK, this one is entertaining and good-looking to boot. However, since this is a typical Euro, the theme is painfully pasted-on. Also, rules are totally arbitrary and don't follow any sort of thematic logic (you control tiles by emptying them?): this could have been a game about mice in a maze, collecting different sorts of cheese, or whatever. As for the look and the components, everything is gorgeous and nicely made, but I am a bit puzzled by the clash in the illustrations for the Djinns, which don't fit the rest of the game's look. My last rant is that setup is a bit complicated, and the game is definitely on the long side (it could be called "The Djinns of Analysis-Paralysis"). All that being said, all my criticism does not matter: this is a very good game, well-designed and fun to play, and I highly recommend it to everyone.

I fear playing this with those prone to analysis paralysis.  The mancala mechanic is intersting, the theme is cool, and the tactics are challenging.  It's got some "points salad" feel to it, but it's fun.  I'd like to try it with 4 players.

Uno de los mejores juegos del año 2015. La mecánica principal es la ejecución de movimientos en el tablero (mancala) para llevarte puntos de muchas formas diferentes. Subastas y set collection son otras dos mecánicas presentes en el juego. A pesar de las subastas, el juego escala perfectamente incluso a dos jugadores. Un must have.

A little long to teach, compared to the rather fun and friendly game play (ignoring the slavery aspect), and I hate the single-sided money when it's time to hand them out.

But, if everyone knows how to play and you feel comfortable asking them to help set up and take their own money, quite a good game.

I like the mechanics, but the inability to do any sort of long-term planning really gets me.  It falls too much on the tactical side for me to really enjoy it, rather than being a strategic game of investment - you really need to do whatever gets you the most points now rather than worry about big plays later in the game.

RATING: 9
while many deride it as just "another mancala" game.  It does it very well. While the complexity is the highest at the start of the game and simplifies as you go through, I find it very rewarding to be able to find that great move. You should prep players however to avoid pointing out better or more optimal moves, and to just let the scores do the talking at the end of the game. The two player variant is very strong in this game and I think I prefer it to the 3-4 game play.

A great game that hits a lot of my buttons. Wonderful puzzle-game-esque movement, many different paths to victory, great art, and a reasonable play length. It's definitely a game where AP can be a big factor, not just because of the wealth of options but also because the board state changes rather dramatically after each move. Still, if a couple lets-call-them-questionable thematic decisions regarding slavery(!?) and human sacrifice(!?) don't stop you from checking this out, by all means give it a shot.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
Pick up all meeples on a tile, then drop them one by one, [thing=2448][/thing]-style, on all tiles leading up to your intended destination. The color of the meeple which ends the chain activates all other like-colored meeples on said tile, allowing for a specific action. The available action on the final tile is also activated. Repeat until all meeples are used and no legal moves are left. This is worker placement of the strangest order. Set collection and points-as-money bidding makes for very interesting interactions with the board state, which is very tactical. Buy resources, invoke Djinns, assassinate Viziers, rack in the big points with Builders... there are only a few options, but they all mingle together to allow for a ton of possibilities. Like Queen's Architect, this simply can't be played as a solely-strategic game.

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
The combo-tastic potential for this game is excellent, primarily in the two-player game which features a built-in variant allowing for two turns per round. It's possible to chain four consecutive turns back to back, which is a bit dizzying in complexity, as you can line up meeples this turn for bigger payouts next turn. Getting to trigger your Djinn's ability to boost your tile ability which piggy-backs off of your previous meeple ability. Mmm mmm mmm mmm MMM! (I love combos, if you can't tell). 

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
I do not find the tiles to be visually distracting, but I do think there are just enough colors represented by the meeples that it can be difficult to identify possible action chains given how much there is to process at a glance. The board state changes so much after each player's turn that it's difficult to plan too far ahead.

Enjoyable enough but simply too many potential options leading to huge potential for AP.  Very abstracted and not sufficiently thematic for my liking.  This is the kind of game I'd deen to play 3-4 times to explore - but I'm not sure I'd really rush to play it too often.

Fantastic game. I like the mancala mechanic and it sings here with multiple sub systems built on it. The game almost feels Feld-ian to me, as it is pretty close to a point salad. I look forward to trying the expansion, but this is one of the most complete games I have ever played.

It works and all fits together nicely, however it's very tactical. Ultimately I felt that if you try to follow a particular strategy you won't do as well as you would just taking the best opportunity available on your turn. The winner is simply the player whose opportunities gel together the best.

It's wonderfully made and there's absolutely nothing wrong with the game. It's fun, thinky and there are plenty of options. The theme is tacked on, to be honest, but it's tacked on well. I just don't think there's anything that really blows me away. I can't understand the rave reviews. It's certainly a solid 7 and I'd never have a problem with a game of this...

Too much AP. Too abstract and too wonky regarding some mechanics. Decent starter level eurogame but preferable with a group of experienced gamers who don't shed points left and right. IMHO games that have bidding as a balancing mechanism between players are broken. Here the turn order mechanic doubles the time required for analysis of the board.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a pleasant euro driven by a meeple "mancala movement" mechanic.  As a euro, it capably includes, card set collection using green meeples, basic spatial considerations with blue meeples, temples and palm trees, "take that" meeple elimination with red meeples, special "engine" upgrades to be purchased with white meeples, and simple VP collection with yellow meeples.  All of this is driven by a pleasant enough mancala mechanic.

Overall, I found the game okay though perhaps not particularly exciting.  Yes, if played seriously, it would be quite prone to AP.  And yes, I found the game seriously lacking in any theme; in that sense, it is very Feldian.  It is, though, a pleasant enough euro, willing, though certainly not eager, to play it again.

RATING: 6
While the meeple pickup and drop as breadcrumbs mechanic is interesting, it is targeted as an introductory game (note complexity and time ratings). The result, however, is that even knowing which options you have available is hard, since you must first calculate if they are even legal moves. Your head will feel exhausted like a marathon after calculating less than a handful of options, while deciding between options is the more trivial part. This is like having a hand full of cards... that need to be scratched thoroughly in order to reveal what they are.

If you are okay with having hard to find legal options then go ahead, but I'd rather have difficult choices between clear options than easy choices between obscure options. This game, more than any other, because of that mechanic, makes it very prone to inducing AP.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Apart from Shadows over Camelot the only game from Bruno Cathala that I actually enjoy.

A quite complex game compared to the usual family weight titles from DoW.

The game is all about chosing the right group of meeples to move and the way to place them. Lots of difficult choices. Can be a bit prolonged with AP prone players - it might be a good idea to use a clock if you happen to play with that kind of players.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is just irresistible. Like its younger brother Yamatai (from the same designer) it looks gorgeous on the table, easy to pick up while maintaining a good level of tactical engagement. Not for the pure strategist as it can become chaotic with 4 players - it's a best move game - and as such can induce some serious AP.
Like Yamatai I would probably prefer to play this as a 2p.
A classic.

Wow.  Simple rules, but surprisingly deep with lots of tense tactical decisions.

With other good players, it will be a constant battle to make sure that you can get the most points while minimizing their opportunities, simply by taking different paths across the board. (Don't leave single tribes by themselves, ESPECIALLY if it is a single work that can be targeted by an assassin).

There are many things that will give this game a significant amount of replay ability:

#1 Randomness of the tiles on the board
#2 Randomness of tribes placed on the tiles on the board
#3 Randomness of the market tiles taht come out
#4 Randomness of the genies that are available.  These have a significant influence since they have special powers, and can be exploited differently depending on when they are revealed or what the map layout looks like.

Overall, great game, and in my top 5 (possibly top 3) for GenCon 2014.

UPDATE: After a few more plays, this game has lost a bit of it's luster.  Though there is some strategy, it is mostly a tactical points optimization exercise and it is hard to plan ahead unless you are the first person to act since the board state completely changes after every player's turn.

Also, the AP between turns can be brutal.

There is a lot of hype surrounding this game, and it just doesn't deserve it. It's not that it's a bad game, it's just not a great one. It's beautiful production values, designer pedigree, and multitude of mechanics dazzle gamers who can't see past them to the games flaws, the biggest of which is lack of choice. Certainly there are many things you can do on your turn, but only one optimal play. This is a game about staring at the board to find that optimal play. Unfortunately, with so many moving parts, finding that play can be difficult. Further, since the board is ever changing, you cannot spend your off-turn thinking about your play. Games can tend to devolve into a cooperative style play where each turn everyone works together to find the current players best move. Then at the end, points are counted and someone is declared winner. This will be a game that is mostly forgotten about in a year.

Another beautifully sublime Bruno Cathala design, second to Abyss for me for 2014, but still quite engaging, with interesting meeple movement, variable Djinn powers, and solid economic mechanics as you manipulate and score these pieces, take control and activate tiles. Scoring is also really cool, as is the bidding for turn order. Almost every game of his I play just feels so distinct, unique but at the same time fairly intuitive. Gorgeous production values here too, this ranks alongside Abyss and Shadows Over Camelot as one of his finest.

Initial rating, based on playing once. Wonderful mechanics, gorgeous components. I love the bidding for player order with victory points, and the separate little boards for that are very useful. There's a whole lot going on with a full board, but I relish the chaoticness in that, and somehow it doesn't trigger any AP in me to try and find the very best move. I'm also very much in favour of the many different paths to victory you seem to be able to take (hope they'll indeed be as balanced and equally valid as they seem at first take).

Both in the production quality and game quality, this game is an absolute gem. It builds on the mancala mechanism by adding more modern gaming elements (set-collection, engine-building, area-control, etc) and still remains fairly easy to teach. The end result is a game with little luck, which provides a satisfyingly brain-burning experience. And where luck comes into play, the game has an ingenious auction mechanic that reduces it and maintains the fluidity of the game. Furthermore, it scales wonderfully 2-4 players. 

If there was any criticism to this game, is that it can slow down with AP-prone players... but that is only because how the rich the gameplay is. For euro/abstract fans, this is a must-play game.

Simply put, a near perfect game... This is one of my favorite games (along with Merchants and Marauders, Robinson Crusoe, and Memoir 44) I would say more, but I am so flabbergasted by the quality of this game I just say GO GET IT... IMO, This is a must have for any serious game collection, and the best game I played 2014 (by orders of magnitude). It is essentially Mancala on steroids with amazing art, components, wonderful player interaction and it can be really, really difficult with good players. It has taken worker placement and reversed it (worker displacement) into one of the best game systems I have seen to date.

Truly beautiful game, with elegant mechanisms that tie very well with the theme. Easy to explain and grasp, makes it a good entry point for light gamers. Overall addictive, just the fact that you end up talking about it after the end of it, proves my point. So many ways to victory, always something interesting to do (although you are essentially trying to find the optimal one between all of them). Having a djinn early in the game seems to gives a player a more clear strategy to follow, which is definitely welcome. Very AP prone, so make sure you play with people that do not suffer from that, otherwise you are bound to suffer along with them..and for a long time..

Really nice.  It takes the mancala mechanism from Trajan for a much faster, happier and enterteining game.  Since the board is a kind of common mancala for all players, there is no place for such planning as in Trajan.  The games are actually totally different, this one being much lighter.  The auction for the order is also quite a nice touch in this game.  Nice production, and a really good experience.

Days of Wonder is definitely back to gamers' games!

The usual stellar production value (wonderful unusual wooden pieces, fantastic artwork, sturdy cardboard), this time is paired to a meatier game with pretty simple rules but with great deep gameplay.

The set up is so variable, the not-fixed end conditions so varied, that interplay variability is guaranteed.

Players bid for turn order, then choose a tile, grab all meeples on it and drops them "mancala-style" on adjacent tiles. The last meeple must be of the same color of another meeple on destination tile: that color corresponds to an action. Then the player performs the action printed on the tile.

Is that simple, but the options are so many (auction-wise and mancala-wise) that analysis paralysis could be a serious problem: this game (more than others) needs to be played at brisk speed, since it's more tactical than strategic.

A great "Feldian" (and I mean it in a very positive way) point salad, that feels both innovative and classic, and plays smoothly like only a deeply polished and developed game can.

Two thumbs up!

Great game!  Simple premise based on Mancala, but adds so much more depth with the different abilities of the tribes, the powers of the djinns, and a very cool bidding mechanism for who goes first each round.  There are also so many different ways to score points that games are typically never runaways, and you have to be on guard against giving your opponents easy points while scoring some yourself.  However, I couldn't give this the max rating due to its length of time to play a game, the strong tendency toward overanalysis of every move, and a somewhat steep learning curve (though the reference sheets included help a LOT).

Many simple and interesting mechanics in this game.  The mancala-dropoff mechanic is fresh and requires a new way of thinking.  This game does have a problem with visualizing what each individual move is doing for your end-game scoring, though.

Spel zonder enig individueel gelukselement.  Er worden wel kaarten getrokken, maar ifv deze blootliggende kaarten, kan je er wel voor kiezen om geld te geven om eerder te spelen.

Enige minpunt: Sommige spelers denken al lang na over welke volgorde ze willen spelen en hoeveel geld ze hieraan gaan opofferen.

Je verplaatst "meeples", en krijgt zeer veel mogelijkheden om punten te verzamelen.  Keuzes maken aan de hand van de mooie samenvatting per speler.

In't begin zijn meer punten te verdienen dan later tijdens het spel.

Tegels in het midden van het bord worden later nog vaak bewandeld en leven daardoor extra mogelijkheden/punten op.  Niet zo voor de tegels aan de rand.

Five Tribes is a great game with one very specific problem.  At the start of a round you have to bid and in order to do that properly you have to look at the board and see how much you want to go first (or last), If you do not go first then the board state can often change enough that you will have to rethink your turn.  In addition there are a lot of options to think about on a turn.  For this game to work it really needs everyone to play fairly fast and loose but if this happens the game is great.  It does highlight what a genious Feld is in that his games have a similar level of richness but manage to avoid overwhelming players with choices by making only a smaller number available on each turn.  Also his games generally do not have such radical changes on the board between players.  Anyway the game itself all works brilliantly for a quick to teach but plenty to think about game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The core "pick-up and drop-off" mechanic is clever. It's immediately satisfying, it's addictive, it's gamer junk food. But like junk food, I'm not sure it's particularly substantial. The decision largely comes down to puzzling out the maximum point value move, rather than cleverly setting up a sequence of moves that work together in the aggregate. My feeling is that the two-player game will be far more interesting than any other iteration, due to the fact that you'll sometimes (often?) have two moves in a row (as will your opponent).

The Djinns and the resource cards both seem unnecessary, but I guess the five tribes had to have different ways of scoring.

This game does everything RIGHT in my books. Components, replayability, long-term strategy, tactical gameplay, right amount of competitiveness, game time and minimal luck.

This game employs the Mancala mechanics and incorporates it into a 'reverse' worker placement game with slight auction element. The board is modular so there isn't a sure-win strategy every game, there's multiple pathway to victory. This game scales excellently from 2 players to 4 players, employing different strategies for different player counts.

The biggest complaint most players have is the issue of analysis paralysis since the board changes by the time it reaches your turn. I rarely have this issue as there's actually a lot of path you can consider in between turns. You have to be careful not to set up a good move for your opponent.

Very solid Euro-style point-salad game where the main mechanic is moving meeples in a Mancala-style movement. Due to the game's nature, there's a high-degree of replayability. It's brain-burny without being overly long or arduous. Don't play this with AP people as it's too easy to stare at the board and get lost at the options. Bonus points for high quality art & components and a great box insert as well. The main negative to the game is it's very difficult to plan ahead for your turn since the board state changes with every move and you're forced to constantly re-analyze the situation. It's almost slightly chaotic in that way but I figure with more experience you get better at seeing the best moves.

Update (7/2017): 8.5 => 9
This game just keeps getting better for me each time I play it. The expansion makes it even better although it's not even necessary since the base game is that good. The beautiful production, the fairly short game play, the plethora of decisions, the multitude of mechanisms that synergize...it just works. The only negative I have still is the fact that it's difficult to plan ahead but it's not impossible. Always needing to reanalyze the board is part of the fun too.

Really good game. Game of the year 2014? Not in my opinion. I love its simplicity and the puzzle of figuring out best moves while not leaving windfall opportunities for your opponents. Can be AP prone with so many movement combinations early. Is deep enough for heavy thinkers, yet light enough for casual gamers; a true plus. But maybe not the best choice with a mixed table. Luckily, will make it to the table many a game night here.

Really well designed game with interesting, deep tactics. For me, however, the game is busy. Too many things to do all at once. I like choices, but this game can overwhelm.

First game: This is awsome!
Second game: The game is OK
Third game: Trade bin
Fourth game: This game is not for me
Fifth game: Last game...

The problem with this game is that its no engine building so the game comes down to tactical optimizing. Sure there is some strategy but someone can block your strategy so you have very little control of realizing your strategy. This is a game comes down to spotting what you can do and you spend a loot of time staring on the table trying to find possible moves rather than evaluating what move to take. I prefer games where the options are handed to me not where I have to spend effort to find my options.

This seems like a solid game design and a clever way of taking actions and gaining control of tiles by moving all meeples off of one tile. However, it just didn't feel interesting when we played. The now common issue of "3 points for this" or "4 points for that" or "2 points for that one with a dude over here that might help later". There just doesn't seem to be enough impact on each move. Also, the number of options available each turn are practically countless and if a player starts looking at what others can or will do on their turns, the potential for serious AP is frightening. I didn't experience that in my play, but it's not a plus for the game.

Boring ad it is, Five Tribes belongs to the «barely tolerable» games: you just have to push mixed groups of randomly-colored cubes - that is pawns - from a tile to another, in a typical euro fashion, until you notice someone is about to score the end move. Extra points for scoring camels, domes and palm trees: this deep goes all the theme you’ll ever have. [i](October 2014)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - Reading this comment and recollecting my memories about playing it last year led me to realize what a waste of time this game is: hence during my Fall 2015 rating revise I lowered it my rating by one to a better fitting 4.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
I liked this one much more than I thought I would.  After the buzz from Gen Con 2014, I decided to pick this one up, but I was never super excited to get it played, since I was worried about AP being an issue.  Well we finally played it since on of my friends has really been wanting to try it out.  I should of played this MANY months ago.  This actually is one of the coolest games out of 2014.  Really glad I got to play it, and I am very much looking forward to exploring it more going forward.

RATING: 7
Most Euro games fit a certain mold, or are similar to another game.  Five Tribes, while owing it's roots to Mancala, is unlike anything else on the market.  It's very original and quite a bit of fun.  The game invites lots of AP, and I wouldn't hesitate to play with a timer.  The game just isn't fun if everyone is working out all of the possibilities each and every turn.  Make a move and keep things running smoothly and the game will reward you.  Initial rating is a 7, but I could see this going higher.

A little gem of a game.  Relatively quick to set up and explain (and dare I say understand).  But with some hidden depths.  Not for those prone to AP, but if approached sensibly plays in a reasonable time, esp after repeated plays.  Particularly like that no two games will be the same, give set up variation and then players actions afterwards.  We enjoy this as a 2 player head to head... although to some extent this sometimes turns into a battle as to who get the two rounds back to back on bidding.

RATING: 7
Lots of "don't set up the next player in turn order" going on. Sometimes I can handle that, but here, f you really examined that aspect with all of your moves, you would be there all day. So, when do you stop thinking about it? Played with more than 2, you are basically taking your best tactical move, and I am fine with that part. But, then, I have to try to not set up others, as well. 

Despite these apprehensions, the rest of how the game works is fabulous, as is the production, of course. Nice moves to pull off. Clever things happening all over the place. (If the player before you left them for you!)

Nov 2014 - Love the Mancala mechanic and the game is so smooth after perahps two turns.  I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this one.  Te balance in the game on what you need to do to win is tight.  From my first play you really want to try to divest (so it seems).  You do not want to spend a ton of money in the auction unless you KNOW it's going to pay out.   Tactical but there is strategy in the game longish term.

We have really enjoyed this game with 2 and 3 players. I could see some groups having AP problems, but the shared mancala system and the variety of ways to score points is nice for us. A medium game that you shouldn't overthink too much. Very glad I added this to my collection.

Update: The expansion is a must own in my eyes, due to the new dynamics it creates on the map. The use of obstacles create an added level of planning that I enjoy in this game.

// Fun game, but a little harsh on the AP at times. I'd 
rather just play quickly, but then I'm missing out on 
things and giving my opponents an opportunity to spend
more time analyzing and planning. Perhaps this game needs
a sand timer to keep things moving; otherwise it's almost
too solvable.

RATING: 9
The theme isn't that exciting for me, but I love the gameplay. It's very straightforward but so deep with the number of possible moves gradually shrinking over the course of the game. Components are great from the wooden meeples and wooden camels to the tiles and genie cards. Beware of players that like to spend time calculating the best possible move. AP can take hold, and you will need to push them along to play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A simple but interesting abstract game revolving around a Mancala-like mechanic.  I think it's too wide open at the start (what do I do?) and then too brain-burny towards the end.  The goal is to maximize victory points; often the best places to move to and from are fairly obvious, and the decisions are which tiles to move through and which color meeple to drop when moving through a tile.  You are continually thinking about how your move will set up or deny good moves for the next player(s); this makes the game interesting and tense but potentially painful if you play with AP-prone people.  It's not a game that I would seek out often, but it rates higher than several bland, abstract Euro games in my book.

More tactical than strategic. That, combined with the ever-changing board state, means that you can't reliably plan for your turn during the previous player's turn. Increases downtime considerably in many circumstances. Ultimately, that proved to be the deal-breaker, as it seems most of my friends are prone to AP with this game.

This is a provisional rating after 1 play, likely to drop if I play it again (I suspect, especially with more than 3 players!).

Mancala variant - which isn't a bad thing of itself I like Mancala and I like muliplayer mancala (ie. 3M's Oh-Wah-Ree).  This a pure abstract - theme is pasted on and makes little sense mechanic wise, and felt drier than sand (is that ironic being set in the desert?) with some complexity, both tactics and strategy (do you go for commodities or Djin or building or what) and point salad scoring added.

All probably a die-hard eurogamer's dream but not to my tastes at all.

Saying all that, if game play and fun factor were solid I'd look past it and want to play. 

What kills it for me is the downtime, don't ever ever ever play this with anyone with AP, unless you bring a book to read. You have to consider the board at the start of the round to bid for turn order, then consider the board when you play. *If* you go first, fine you've done the analysis, if on the other hand you're going later then the game state has changed often quite significantly by the previous player, so you have to start the thinking as you take your turn.

Eg, with 4 players and going 4th, forget considering your moves, just twiddle your thumbs while the 3 players before you sit in deep contemplation of their possible moves, it was bad enough playing 3 player with 2 fast opponents, I had an unpleasant mix of stress that I was taking too long and frustration at the downtime - and I won, which might mean I'm a genius at this game, or that there's significant luck, or it's deep, so really you need to consider your moves carefully ... thereby leading to more downtime.

And with 2 you get 2 actions a turn, so in theory you could manage 4 goes in a row (go last with both actions in one turn then first with both in the next) ... that seems rather powerful, and your opponent can go make lunch while your brain explodes with the possible combos you can do.

But I'm sure others who love solving a puzzle will get a kick out of it.

So, all in all - probably this is 3 or 2 for me as re-reading these comments I really don't want to play it again (but those ratings seem unfairly harsh, I probably need to give it another go, just not for a while)

Very good expression of the mix of mechanics.  I don't enjoy it as much as I could because of a personal challenge in parsing the intense clutter of the board in the early game and the drop-meeple movement mechanic.  As the board gets less cluttered it becomes easier to read, and I enjoy it more, but the fun factor lacks as a whole.

Great game that has lots of options but you can fall victim to two things, first is a narrow vision where you focus too much on one area and not checking the rest of the board.  The other is that there are so many options it can be overwhelming to choose from and we did have a player who brought the game to a halt on their turn since they would take a while to decide.  But overall a great game that I am keeping and getting the expansion for.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
10x10 2015. This game takes about 3 or 4 plays to click but after it does, it becomes really good.  The first few plays I felt a little lost and there seem like there a ton of Djinns adding randomness.  But after a few plays you start to see the available moves and can evaluate them more quickly and the Djinns start coming up repeatedly and become well known.  The game is pretty tactical, you want to take the best move available while not giving easy moves to your opponent.  Chaining together moves and planning turns in advance is difficult, if not impossible, because your opponents will inevitably make unpredictable moves and take moves you didn't see.  Still, there is some long term strategy here in utilizing your Djninns, committing (or not) to collecting sets of resources, and trying (or not) to get the most viziers.  Initially, I thought variety seemed to be the way to go, and indeed if you have a really good move in front of you you should take it even if it doesn't fit with your plans.  But recently I've tried pursuing one or two goals with more focus from the beginning and found that to be a viable way to play too.  Anyway, the more I play the more awesome this gets- great game.

RATING: 6
Wow!  One of my top 2 of Gencon.  Very simple rules but brain-burner player.  On your turn, pick up all the meeples in one space, then drop them mancala style on an orthogonal path.  The last space, the meeple dropped must match the color of a meeple in that space.  Pick up all of the meeples of that color and do that action of that color meeple.  Then, possibly optionally, do the action of that space.  Lastly, if there are no more meeples in that space (and no one else has claimed it previously) drop your marker on the space.  Points scores for a bunch of things at the game ends either when no more moves are possible or someone runs out of markers.  

Played with 3.  Probably took about an hour.  Easy to learn (and teach) but room for very clever play.  Very happy I got it.

Played once, 2er.  This game is a puzzle in multiple ways.  It is literally a puzzle, and will (I think) appeal primarily to those who enjoy puzzles.  Finding the best move on the board is enjoyable.  Waiting for someone else to find the best move on their turn is not - which is the second puzzle.  This has clearly been designed for gamers, and yet it should absolutely not be played with gamers.  In order for it to clock in at a time that is not cumbersome, you will need to play quickly and intuitively.  I could not bring myself to do so.  There are multiple things to consider for every move, and many possible moves to consider on a turn, and I enjoyed puzzling out how to exploit groups of color on the board.  But I hated waiting for it to be my turn again.  And that was a 2 player game.  More players might ease some of the puzzling, since you aren't routinely planning 2 move combos, but it also increases the total number of turns you have to wait through. 

I should also mention that I definitely think that finding and evaluating possible moves is a skill that can be trained.  I expect that the playtime would decrease with experience.  But I am not willing to play several games with the hope that I will become proficient enough to play the game quickly.   

Overall, I came away happy that I had played this very unique design, but with no desire to own it.  I would play it again willingly if asked, but will likely not request it.

Un estupendo juego que incorpora el mancala como su mecánica principal. En un tablero hecho del losetas empiezan en cada una de ellas tres meeples de hasta cinco colores que hay en el juego. En su turno, el jugador escoge una loseta y recoge los meeples y los va soltando a la vez que se desplaza sobre el tablero. Donde acaba realiza una acción gracias a los meeples (cada uno tiene un tipo de acción), y hace una acción de loseta. Además, también hay unas cartas para acumular mercancías y otras cartas de genios que te otorgan "poderes" especiales.
Es un juegazo. Sencillo de reglas pero con una profundidaz enorme. En cada momento hay multitud de posibilidades. Fue un gran descubrimiento.

Fun game- first play at Gamealot 2015. A different mechanic with the pick-up-and-drop of the tribesmen, and I could see with more plays you'd get better at finding the most point-maximizing moves. Good player interaction as well, as play-order is paramount. Would definitely play again, but the other two new games I played at Gamealot this day (Roll for the Galaxy and Elysium) I would rank slightly ahead of this.

RATING: 10
An easy 10. Highly tactical with the fluid meeple board movement, so each turn offers new opportunities, offering the challenge to choose the right course. Bidding for turn order is interesting, where players must choose how many points to invest versus the offered rewards. Yet the key here is finding a complementary movement, to temper your desire to bid too high for that optimal move. Brilliant design, fun gameplay, thematic, and gameplay that goes just the right distance. Outstanding.

Reading about Five Tribes and watching video reviews made me believe that I would hate it for being too AP-prone. My wife can be really AP and I play with people new to gaming a lot so I didn't want a game like this to balloon into a 2.5 hour mess of waiting.

I was wrong.

We played it at a FLGS and loved it! We didn't spend minutes calculating every possible move and instead played by intuition. A few turns per game (especially near the end) become slow...but I can handle that.

I still haven't played it with more than just two so my rating might go up with more plays with more players

Many people from the Dice Tower Network have had OUTSTANDING reviews of this... even non-euro gamers.  I'm interested... although the theme seems similar to Targi and Jaipur; both in my collection already.  Not sure I like that it's AP prone either.  Further, the slave card debates is an interesting one: 1001 Nights is full of terrible stories that include murder, rape and slavery... so it's not off par to include slavery in the theme.  But if I had a friend that found it offensive, would I still play?  Tough one.  Maybe I'll just buy the alternate cards just incase.

An excellent game with plenty to think about throughout.  It seems very well balanced, as in the game I played every player went after a different strategy and we all ended around the same number of points.  A lot to think about, and while it could certainly become the sort of game that locks with AP, it is nonetheless a very enjoyable game that is simple enough to learn in a play, but offers depth enough to keep coming back to.  I enjoyed it.

This is an amazing game! My gaming group has a lot of fun with this one. The production is excellent and with the variable game board and Djinn powers it's fresh with every play. When you teach the game to someone you just have to tell them that it's not a game for great analysis but of opportunity, if you see a move with a lot of points and suits your particular strategy for that gameplay you bid high and go for it.

-traded away for Troyes-

Original version with slaves

Nice designed game with beautiful artwork.
It is a real brain teaser if you want to pick the right moves... otherwise you'll loose by far.
Simple to teach , easy to play, difficult to master.

My only flaw is the set up time (if you, like me, like to put the meeples out standing on the board).

RATING: 6
While this is a visually attractive game and certainly fairly light and intuitive on the surface, the point-salad nature of the game leads to constant mind-numbing tactical AP.   The decisions are nearly always short term, and involve calculating the points a handful of scenarios will produce.   It feels a little like a set of arithmetic exercises to me.   As someone who prefers games with longer term strategical decisions, this just doesn't seem to fit well with what I like.

I've been pretty bummed out all week that I didn't enjoy this game nearly as much as I would have liked... There isn't anything that should really make me dislike this game but... I can see that there is a lot of replayability and a lot of deep strategy to this game. Unfortunately I just can't bring myself to ever really want to play this game again or enough to really dig into the strategy. This game leaves me 100% apathetic.

RATING: 9.5
When the "slave controversy" first broke out, I was one of this game's biggest critics. I really wanted to try it because I knew this was my kind of game, but I also knew most of my friends would refuse to play. Since the slaves contribute absolutely nothing to the fun or thematic flavor of the game, I made [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/108201/replacements-slave-cards-camels]replacements for the slave cards[/url], and finally got my slave-free copy to the table.

And I'm so glad I did! This game presents some of the most dizzyingly complex and difficult decisions in a short time, with a very simple and elegant rule set that you can teach to just about anyone. Each game will be very different because everything in the setup (cards, tiles, meeples) is randomized, but otherwise the game is otherwise mostly open information. It manages to be both non-confrontational and incredibly competitive at the same time, providing an amazingly tense game experience. Possibly my favorite game of 2014.

Multiple ways to score
Beautiful production (Days of Wonder, duh!)
Relatively easy to learn 

Cons:
First edition had "slave cards"... at least they changed them for Fakirs in following printing. (I would NOT have bought nor played it if they hadn't change these cards)

Note:
Really loooooove this game. Its deeper than most Days of Wonder games... more rules than what non-gamers are used to, but once they know how to play, it can only be fun.

RATING: 6.5
first 2p play was fun. easy to pick up and rather quick to play. problem is I could see it getting more tactical at 3p or worse, 4p, and also more AP-ish. also runs into the mahjong problem where one player may kingmake by "feeding" the next player.

I probably will never turn down a 2p game but may not be so keen on higher player counts and have no need to purchase the game at this stage. rating likely to never rise beyond 7 but may go lower depending on how it is at higher player counts.

I'm usually not the target of Bruno Cathala's games but this one impressed me !
I was surprised by the decreasing number of possible actions as the game progresses (it ends when none is left). It's very original and works amazingly well with the smart VP bidding system.

EDIT: As expected, the DoW components are amazing. There is one thing I do not like : killing the meeples of other players is always very despiteful, it should not be possible !

A really well designed game that's a bit overwhelming with choices at first, although it did get easier to find moves with subsequent play.

The basic mechanism is that you pick up all the pieces from a space, and then chain them through orthagonally adjacent spaces, dropping one meeple on each space you move through.  When you land on a space, you get some of the pieces there as well as get to take advantage of an ability printed on the tile.

The are a ton of ways to score points, which is cool, but the drawback to me is that there are just so many options for what you *could* do, that I found myself staring at the board trying to find the best option, which is odd for me, as I'm usually not an AP prone player.

I think my main issue that prevents me from rating it higher is that it's not a game you can play with your gut, as I usually play. You have to actually find the best possible move, which isn't something I find enjoyable.  I prefer games where I can calculate some basics, and shoot from the hip based on those calculations.  In this one, I have to look at a move, look at another move, look at another move, look again to see if there are any other moves that look better, etc, and you have a ton of potential moves.

Overall, still a really great game that I really enjoy but suspect a lot of people will like even better than I do.

Five Tribes is the newest Days of Wonder prototype from designer Bruno Cathala. Unfortunately, the details of this game are still under wraps, so I am limited in what I can say.  What I can say: Five Tribes is a meaty, interactive, throwback Eurogame that I largely adored.  It pairs moderately brain-burning decisionmaking with tons of interplay variety, which kept me coming back again and again (I played the game four times overall).  It’s a bit of a pleasant surprise to see this one coming out of DOW, but I can’t wait to see what the finished product looks like on the table – I suspect it will be there frequently.

A lot of layers of decision in this game. It's fine as long as players are fairly breezy during their turns. The guy who only wants to make optimal moves is going to ruin the experience for all. 

It was pleasant enough to play and clearly offers many strategic courses for victory, but I'm not really looking forward to exploring them. Does that mean this game is mediocre?

What a fantastic game.  So much going on in this game, but it is all so intuitive, with multiple paths to victory.  It also has a Mancala mechanic that I have never seen used anywhere else, so to me it was incredibly innovative.  It matters what guys you move and how you move them and what spaces you claim and what you leave behind for other people.  The bidding for place is so important because someone can take your move... or even just screw up the placement on the board that it changes the move you were planning on making.  There is that worry of an AP player mapping out every move and the exact number of points it means to them, but I say you need to avoid those people in any game you play.  Definitely a keeper and a winner.

Played twice with two players. Score for two players.  

The most brilliant thing in this game is that there is no luck involved at all. No dice and you don't draw random cards. It's purely strategic. I hate dice and avoid all games based on dice rolls so of course I love this. It's also different from all the games we previously own. 

This game is actually excellent with two players. There is no problem at all catching up if you feel you are getting behind. I miss this in other games where the two player version can have this problem. 

This game is quite hard strategic especially if you have the right opponent of course, but easy to learn. What I think is what makes a game truly great. 

The only problem I have with it is that the theme feels a bit pasted on and not as a part of the game mechanic. This could also be because I have no clue what the different Djinns represent so if their powers matches their background it is lost on me.

A worker displacement game (you score by removing them).  Point-salad group-solitaire, but it's more interesting to me than say, Agricola, or other games of this nature.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a fragile game. I can't imagine playing with people who try to evaluate the best move on each play - it would take forever. Also, the game has an odd arc of restricting options as it goes along until the end when there may be 1 or 2 actions available total. It also has a bit of point salad feel, where there is a 7 wonders/Agricola like spreadsheet scoring at the end - the game does suffer from modern-euro disease of throwing too much at the wall. ie the djinns are silly and unnecessary and I would have probably removed them altogether. 

That said, I found the gameplay to this compelling. It plays fast with the right players (maybe an hour) and AP isn't a problem in the groups in which I play. It is very interactive, and it is a constant struggle to leave the worst board state possible for the following players. The turn-order auctions are critical. There is also competition for majorities, assassins etc. Solid effort. 

Update: I don't know about the turn-order auction. Getting at least 6-8 net points a turn seems standard, and it seems very difficult to make those points bidding 12 or 18. And bidding high and not getting to go first is an absolute disaster. Seems like bidding low, or 0 is much safer and a better play almost every time - certainly in the early rounds.

12 times! That’s how many times I played Five Tribes during the first month, and that’s a huge amount of plays in my book (just take a look at my played stats for most of my games). Five Tribes is easy to teach and play, but at the same time it’s somewhat deep, although it’s highly tactical and not very strategic (you can perhaps have an overall strategy, but it’s impossible to plan your moves ahead). There are always a bunch of (mostly good) moves, so you really don’t want to play this game with friends who are prone to AP! The “mancala” mechanism can be quite brutal if you’re trying to figure out all possible moves… Also, there might be some AP in what to bid for turnorder, but I haven’t found it to be an issue.

There are various strategies to pursue, and none seem better than others, although it’s obvious that getting the majority of yellow meeples (viziers) is better in a 4p game than in a 2p game. It’s also easier to get a high numbered set in a 2p, although the card deck isn’t refreshed much if the same cards come out, so this deck can sort of stagnate (as can the djinn deck) unlike in the 4p game. Also, you better get those cards asap, because the green meeples disappear quickly… And, speaking of the meeples, I liked how they all have special abilities and how you need to elaborate which ones to activate. You need most yellow meeples for a bonus, you need some white in order to acquire some djinns (which are great – I love the variety of those), you need to be in your “spatial mind” when considering where the best places are to activate the blue meeples, you need to watch out for which cards the green meeples can give you, and finally you need to assassinate some meeples with the red meeples (either your opponents’ in order to, for instance, establish a majority in yellow, or to kill a single meeple on the board so you can place a camel). Speaking of camels, I think it’s great that the game can end in two ways, and due to the somewhat fixed game ending games never last too long.

For those of you who deny it, ties can happen! In 3 of my 2p games against my wife, we’ve ended within 4 points of each other although we pursued very different strategies, one of them being a 200-200 tie! Sure, you can say it’s somewhat of a “point salad game” and it doesn’t matter what you do as you get points anyway, but I don’t find it’s too much. All in all the balance between gameplay mechanisms, the amount of decision-making going on and the length of the game is very favorable! I’ve never had a game last for more than an hour, and that’s with 2, 3 and 4 players.

In two of my games I knew right away that I made a mistake concerning the amount I bid (I should definitely have made a higher bid), but that’s my own fault and I was eager to rectify my mistakes and want to play it again! Five Tribes is not as complex as some say, as in, yes, it’s more complex than some of DoW’s other titles like Ticket to Ride, but I find it way easier than, for instance, Mystery Express. It won’t be a hit with anybody as it’s quite themeless and dry and might cause AP, but it’s an overall enjoyable game which only lasts for an hour or less in my experience. The fact that my wife didn’t object when I suggested I would buy it speaks for itself!

On a players turn looking for the best move for points is the name of the game. There's a little planning in this game but ultimately when it comes to a players turn evaluate the situation and do the best move possible. I think the game plays great regardless, and strategy will win because there are ways to setup opponents for the least amount of points possible on their turn. I really like that there are multiple ways to win in this game because of the vast amounts of ways to score points. Another plus is the time it takes to play the game. Most games I play are under 60 minutes!

Five Tribes is a clever play on the Mancala genre.  This is a game that, at first, seems chaotic, but as the game progresses, strategies do begin to emerge.  That said, it feels like point salad, and it got stale for me after about five plays.

First play:
I feel like it's probably a fairly deep strategy game, but through the first playthrough it felt pretty random. Players I played with were also first timers so maybe it was our lack of experience that prevented us from being able to make a long term strategy but the most strategy I could surmise was to just get the most points I could get based upon what I see on the board right now.

It was fun though, looking forward to a couple more playthroughs to see if I can develop a multi-turn strategy

Five Tribes is one of those games where the core mechanic really makes the game. The choice of picking up meeples, dropping them orthogonally to land on a spot, and then getting the meeple action and location action feels much more unique than even my uninspired description.

The closest game in spirit that comes to mind is Tzolk'in. Not because the mechanics are similar, but because the gears in Tzolk'in are unlike anything else. The rest of the game is pretty typical (collect resources, build buildings, etc.)

Five Tribes is kind of the same way. Very novel central mechanic, surrounded by some familiar things (set collection, some characters with powers and rulebreakers, etc.) I really enjoyed my first play, and I think this game probably has some longevity to it.

Update. One solo play as well, which is surprisingly good! I lasted the game but had a pretty weak score.

RATING: 9
Been looking at this since the initial video and really happy that it met my expectations and will be getting my own copy soon. The ideas in this game really shine through in a game that is easy to teach and play, but really makes you think. I thought there would be a lot of moving parts between the worker actions, tile actions, and djinn actions but they all fit together smoothly.

There is a chance for some AP in that the board can change a fair amount between turns so if you lose your move because of a displacement, then you may have to reevaluate the board on your turn. In addition, deciding what to bid for the auction can lead to AP although in our 3P game no one bid above 5 so it went pretty smoothly.

A lot to think about but super smooth rules, my kind of game! Can't wait to play again.

A rather fascinating area control game using the Mancala mechanic for movement.  The game is also an application of controlled chaos -- since every move anyone makes can radically alter any of the plans you thought you had at the beginning of the turn -- mitigated by the risk/reward management of the bidding system.

The gameplay is varied and complex, the art is beautiful, and the components are of excellent quality.

All about spotting the best plays on a board with a lot of options. Could easily be prone to AP but didn't seem too bad in our game as there are usually only a few that stand out each turn.

This is gamewise a fantastic game. The slave issue is a bit overblown but it is a valid arguement.

I would never feel comfortable even suggesting this in a group with black players (Hey guys, want to play a fun, strategic game? Oh yeah, you buy slaves and sacrifice them, that's ok right?) and when a game makes anyone feel uncomfortable, then it limits the appeal. In terms of game this is a solid 9. I am subtracting 1 point due to the limiting factor of offending so many, and am rating it an 8.

I love this game for the tactile feel-the meeples and the cards are great. It's a lot thinkier than I originally anticipated-having to plan out exactly were the meeples will be. Very enjoyable, would like to get this to the table more often

Enjoyable game for me!  Components (1.5/2) good, not the best in storage.  Gameplay (1.5/2) Not the easiest to introduce someone new.  Once figured out however, gameplay is fast.  Theme (0.5/1)  Pasted on Arabian nights theme.  Works for the game but anything could have been substituted.    Replay ability (1/1) Lots of approaches to this game with strategy.  No set strategy will work over and over.  Enjoyment (3.0/4.0)  Perfect setup for me, not so good with game groups.  Some are good with the game, others not so good.

In general resource converters like this one start at a 5 for me, so a 6.5 is something of a compliment.  There are things about this game I like (the interesting board interactions) and this that I dislike strongly (the set collection/point salad).  I feel like 10 years ago, a publisher might have taken the central mechanisms of the game and developed it into something much more elegant. These days the quickest way to make a viable game is to slap a bunch of currency conversions and "paths" to victory.  Thank god Tigris and Euphrates escaped that fate.  That said, I did enjoy myself and I would play it again, but I probably wouldn't request it.

RATING: 9.5
Great game from Days of Wonder that really puts them back on the map for me.

The basic mechanism is the Mancala mechanism.  You pick up all the colored meeples on a spaces and start dropping them off to adjacent spaces one at a time.  The space you end on, the color you end on, and the meeples currently occupying the space you end on all matter.
There are elements of set collection as well.
Overall, it combines to make a very unique Euro that is fairly challenging.

The theme is kind of thin, but the great components make up for it.  The biggest issue some people might have is the amount of AP this game can induce in players.  At the beginning of the game there are countless options for each player to take and ALL of them seemingly score points.

I like the meeple movement and the backwards-thinking process of picking the square you want to land on and having to work back to figure out where to start or if it's even possible to get what you need.  I also love the minarets, the huge chunky palaces and palm trees.

But the djinns (I call them what they look like: demons) are disturbing. Their illustrations are disgusting unless you're into horror/occult.  I'd totally be behind a retheme or even just a reprint that replaced those awful cards.

Four players is too long for me. Way too much downtime of sitting there watching other people play. Three players is decent. But I absolutely *love* the head to head action of a two player game of Five Tribes. You have so much more control over everything on the board and both players are likely to follow distinctly different strategies based on the djinns that come out and how the meeples are assorted on the tiles. I would usually shy away from this at any other player count.

It's a solid game and plays well.

Quite a good game. Interesting turn order bidding on each turn. Different way of playing than most games, where you drop off meeple and pick up meeple on the final square.

Having said that, I found the game a little annoying.

There were so many different ways of scoring it became impossible to optimize anything. The winner ended up being the guy that just happened to like picking up the blue guys.

Excellent gameplay!  So many different movement options to consider in the beginning it's almost overwhelming.

Scoring is cool.  Very susceptible to AP for everyone, not just those so inclined.

The game is simpler than it appears at first glance, but there are many moving parts and multiple sources of victory points.

The game mechanic is brilliant but can lead to serious analysis-paralysis, so much so, that playing it without staring at the board for 5+ minutes before your turn can make your choice seem arbitrary instead.  Another drawback is that the extreme point salad nature of scoring detracts from both theme as well as interest in winning.  Otherwise a fine game, that plays like no other, which alone makes it a good one to own.

2D Mancala with special abilities and a slew of ways to score points and thus play the game: Five Tribes in a nutshell.

Initially I put in a lot of effort to put a value to going first, second, whatever, but learnt the hard way that this is a complete waste of time and money/VP. There are far too many options to consider; and this doesn't even take into account the unpredictable nature of players going before you, changing the board to the point where your initial calculations are now useless. A replay confirmed this line of thought: bidding is only useful if you can be sure that you [i]profit[/i] from doing so... and that is only near the end, or when someone has been really careless (and others blind not to see it).

So, with a better understanding of the game under my belt I feel secure in talking about the game. The 2D Mancala core is kinda cool, if very abstract and not at all relating to any subject matter. Personally I don't give a damn whatsoever, but I can certainly imagine those of weaker spiritual disposition to be royally miffed at playing such a bare-bones abstract all of a sudden. I also like that the last colour you grab from the tile presents you the action you can take, if you like; and that emptying the tiles nets you points in the form of camels. So far so good. Unfortunately the author saw fit to overload this in principle very workable abstract concept with special action cards which break all the rules; set collection of resource cards to balance the weak tile values; a complete disregard for anything related to keeping a running score; and a complete lack of anything useful to do as other players are considering their actions.

It all adds up to Five Tribes promising to be something it cannot be. Admittedly the action and resource cards might, in the end, be not all that problematic as there is a decent selection of them, and it's not like they get taken in great amounts so that the core Mancala walking takes a noticable hit—at least not in my experience. But lack of a running score and interactivity now... those are [i]serious[/i] shortcomings, causing the game to become much simpler and less thoughtful than you'd think for such a ruleset. 

I will probably be made to play this title in the future some more, but I doubt it will improve much. It's a shame, really: there is definitely more in Five Tribes than is currently available.

Niezwykle ciekawa mechanika przemieszczania robotników na inne pola. Próba ugrania czegoś i jednocześnie nie podsunięcia dobrego ruchu przeciwnikowi wymaga starannego przemyślenia. Gra zmienia się dynamicznie po każdym ruchu gracza, więc nie sposób zaplanować sobie następne tury, trzeba dostosowywać się do wciąż zmieniającej się sytuacji na kafelkach. Jedyną wadą tej gry jest fakt, że może powodować duży downtime u wolnomyślicieli. Poza tym jest bardzo regrywalna, dzięki losowemu układowi kafelków i meepli. Przepięknie wydana - śliczne drewniane znaczniki palm, pałaców, wielbłądów i członków klanu, piękne ilustracje dżinów.

The mechanism for this game is definitely inspired by the ancient game Mancala.  I love the different powers the different colored meeples have, as well as the different tiles.  It makes you want to plan on dropping/collecting meeples in a way that benefits you and not your opponent.  Could lead to AP.  Some genies, though, are more powerful than others.  That may be my only real complaint.

The latest release from Days of Wonder comes with good quality components, but it steps up the complexity from their previous games.

Five Tribes is a mix of mancala-type movement and trying to maximize the bonuses you can get with five different meeple types.  It's a tough challenge to plan out what you can get from the meeples and the tiles, but also hoping to clear out a tile and claim it for bigger points at the end of the game.  On top of that, there are some good abilities to be gained if you can sway a djinn to your side.

Lots of interesting choices, I definitely am a fan of this game already.  It also works to a relatively consistent endpoint, so it doesn't take too long to play.  I'd say the only downside is this will be tough for those prone to AP, particularly because the make-up of what's on the table is constantly changing.

The 2-D Mancala is really interesting; the systems it's driving a bit less so. With strong AP this would be a nightmare, but I'm fortunate enough to have fellow players who are OK limiting their search depth (or using a turn clock).

But on a harsher note: while there are games out which do a decent job tackling the challenge of incorporating slavery into their mechanics, this isn't remotely one of them. The way it's handled tips me from "mild interest" to "don't especially want to play again".

(To be clear, it's not [i]the inclusion of slaves/slavery[/i]. Games can do that, and may have good reason to, especially if it's faithful to the setting/source material. It's the [i]way[/i] they're incorporated into this game that I find distasteful.)

[Edit: newer editions substitute Fakirs for slaves. You still buy them on the market alongside other commodities... hiring their services, one hopes?]

Every single game of Five Tribes is a brand new puzzle waiting to be solved, and that's what I particularly love about this euroabstract gem. The artwork and components are pure eye candy, the mancala mechanism is well implemented and the fact that everything after the setup is open information makes for a pretty cutthroat challenge. It shines as a 2 player game, offering minimal downtime and full control over your opponent's potential moves, although with more players involved it becomes somewhat less skill-based and more chaotic, so I don't enjoy it quite as much.

Components: Gorgeous artwork, especially on the Djinns. Clear iconography. Solid wooden meeples, palaces, and palm trees. Quality cards.

Experience: Super fun. Lots of different ways to score points; the resource marketplace in particular lends itself toward specialization; there isn't enough time to do everything. On every turn there are so many tasty options, and lots of fun consequences of each move. My turns are fun even if I think I'm losing.

The variable board geography and seeding, and the randomized djinns, keeps the game fresh.

With The Artisans of Naqala expansion, the addition of artisans and items forces players more than ever to specialize. The chasm, mountains, and tents don't add much.

I enjoyed my first 2 plays of this game.  It was fun and moved at a decent pace.  There could be an issue with analysis paralysis with some players.

The rules for a 2 player game do not work very good.  When the same player goes twice in a row during the same round, there is way too much analysis paralysis where the player tries to set themselves up for a good moves on their next turn. House rules are needed to fix this problem.  Or don't play with 2 players.

Good strategy game, more fun with more players. Can't get terribly excited about it, as thematically it's pretty abstract. Also, playing with a timer recommended -- I can see people sitting for way too long over the board, when this game really should be played pretty lightly and quickly.

1/2015 update: Moved it up to 8 after an enjoyable first game with my daughter. I had more appreciation of the tile effects and more enjoyment of which Djinn effects showed up.

2/2015 update: Dropped it to 6 after playing with wife and son -- underneath the few key mechanisms of this game -- which are mainly tactical in nature so you're reacting to whatever's happened just before your turn -- there's not that much there....

As of Jan '16 - 7: Haven't gotten many sessions in. I don't know exactly when to introduce this game to new players. But it's almost too brain-burny for me because of it's possible combinations. I got to learn to screw trying to optimize everything and just pick a move.

I LOVE this game! Found it in Essen 2014 and really like the concept and the simplicity of the rules. Still, it gives a very deep game where you have to continue adapting your strategy in order to react to your opponents. So far, all of our games turned out differently and I was never disappointed.

One downside (and that's why the score is not higher): I would not want to play this game with every group. There are people where I know up front that the game would be a real drag - I am talking AP. The number of possible moves and the consequences of each of them may lead to very long downtimes when certain characters are on the table. Luckily, for me and my spouse we don't have this problem. Sure, one of us might ponder about a move a bit more extensively, but usually we keep the game flowing.

Even with two players the game is a blast.

The artwork is very thematic and fitting. High replayability due to the ever changing setup  of the board and the starting positions of the meeples. Bidding mechanic is good and adds depth. There are many roads to victory.

Really recommended - lately we play with the Artisans expansion which offers even more possibilities to snatch a win.

A solid, fun game with plenty of crunchy tactical depth, but also colorful and light enough to teach new gamers. Interesting 'reverse worker placement' concept with Mancala mechanics. Great at 2p and scales pretty well to 4. Love the bidding for turn order and the various Djinn powers.

RATING: 7.5
This game is one-of-a-kind. The way each of its discrete elements (mancala, set collection, special abilities, area control) comes together is absolute elegance. That feeling you get when you execute a perfectly engineered series of actions is rare and wonderful. And, as we've come to expect from Days of Wonder, the components are excellent quality and fun to play with.

But, while I'm not usually one to blame a game for the AP that often plagues its players, in this case I will make an exception. The amount of information you are bombarded with on your first turn (and, let's be honest, for probably the first third of the game) is unreasonable. The possibilities available to you are functionally infinite. To me, that's not empowering. That's bad design.

RATING: 9
Five Tribes is essentially a Euro game that incorporates a two-dimensional mancala. There is a vague Arabian Nights theme permeating through the game and components but game play is pure Euro, meaning getting the most points. Every move on the mancala board leads to a few mandatory actions: one that depends on the color of the last meeple dropped, one that depends on the ending tile and potentially one more if the ending tile is empty. All of these give the player victory points or resource that will eventually be converted to victory points.

So how is it different from all the other Euro games? First, the artwork is superb and the colorful board is pleasing to the eyes. Second, each move changes the distribution of meeples on the board and thus the opportunity sets of the next player. The constantly shifting board makes it a challenge to plan ahead, so deep thinking and quick reactions are both needed to win. Lastly, the game is endlessly replayable due to the many pathways to victory points (owning tiles, collecting resource cards, using Djinn's special powers, etc.) and the random setup (tiles and meeples).

Five Tribes is not a casual or party game. You will think long and hard about each move but can never be sure it is the right one. You can try to specialize in one strategy but will be forced to adapt to the changing board. You can block your opponents but may open other, even better opportunities for them. The only thing you can be sure of is that you will not be bored playing it.

RATING: 7
Played 1x
Definitely not for everyone. This is a game that's hard to understand when you start playing. There are so many options! Choices go down over time, which is the opposite of most euros. 

One thing that makes it easier to see potential moves on the board is that if there is an EVEN number of meeples in a tile, you CANNOT end up in a tile that is an ODD number of spaces away, no matter what route you take, and vice versa.

I really like the puzzle aspect of this game and the elegant turn order bidding mechanism (which I'm going to use in Scoville from now on...) but had to trade away this game because it really wouldn't work with my group. Maybe I should buy it again now that there is an official solo variant...

As most games of DoW this one looks great, has little rules and plays smoothly. The game could be considered a gateway game, but there is quite some strategy involved and at first glance the game may seem overwhelming.

The mancala-system is quite different from other games, which is refreshing and it works really well. Turn order is an auction/bidding, so you have to pay coins (=VP's) to be first in line, so you will not want to spend VP's unnessecary, but you would like to be first or second in line (depending on what's available on the board). If you choose to pay nothing, then you're placed in last position, but everyone after you can also choose to play nothing and move you even further back.

I really love puzzle games, and this game is a huge puzzle.  The only thing that irks me slightly is the constant auctioning for turn order, but I really enjoy how as the game progresses the players evolve to want different things, so the auction matters less because likely the great move I see is different from the great move you see.

RATING: 6
Not sure what to think - I feel that the game if played accurately requires too much thought and thus too much downtime. Mistakes can give huge VP swings, particularly later in the game (harder to tell what we may have missed early on) and in a tight game that is frustrating and a disincentive to 'rush' your turn.
I hope to have a few more plays before I decide, but I cannot see this ever getting past an 8 and may be a 6 as it is also quite abstract despite meeples, camels, djinns and palm trees.

Good game, best DoW game since Smallworld.
Feel a bit abstract at first, but after a couple of games I find my bearings. The game has several layers of depth, while mechanically simple. Many ways of scoring lead to various possible strategies, and the Djinns special powers add some welcome variations.

Good incentive to play it again.

A very interesting game where you are moving meeples across the board to do various actions. Really like the bidding aspect of who goes first because that makes it even more strategic in in the sense of how much and how badly do I need to go first to do an action before some steals that idea. Easy to pick up, yet difficult to master, Five Tribes is a game that I can sit with the family and watch the inner strategist in them go nuts. It's a great game.

RATING: 8
Fun theme, pretty game, and for some reason it clicks for me. Those that say AP is too heavy are playing with the wrong people...you have to quickly evaluate, take your turn, and move on. Early in the game their are so many choices that you can just choose what you can see, and as the game goes on it becomes easier to see moves and play can slow. Don't let it! Played quickly this is lots of fun.

The Artisans expansion makes it even better.

An ingenious game around a "Mancala" mechanism.

Five Tribes demands a constant brain work to find, in each turn, the possible useful moves and, amongst them, the one capable of providing more points while cutting the next player access to those points.
Thoughts always need to be made, as the action of the previous player may completely change one´s planning in a flip.
However, the points awarded to the white meeples seem quite unbalanced.

My favorite game of Days of Wonder. Lots of replay value, high quality components, and tons of meeples! Every single game you play will always be different. Unique worker "displacement" style, which keeps you on your toes because you will be forced to adapt your strategy on the whim or prepare yourself somewhat in advance. Some Djinn cards are a lot better than others. Can easily get stuck with analysis paralysis due to trying to maximize points in a given move. I think it's best played a little more casually to speed up gaming time. 

Two players gives you more options for moves. You can actually plan your moves a lot better.

Variable setup, random dijinn and market card offer allow for a high amount of replayability in the game.

Both strategic and tactical due to the state of the board changing and how many points a particular action is worth changes as other players drop off pieces.

Due to wealth of options, the game lends itself to AP as rumored. More experienced players can quickly sift through the information presented and choose between several moves.

Colorful art and good components.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a nice tactical game, with lots of different possible moves on any given turn.  You'll spend time pouring over the board looking for the move that will allow you to further your strategy, and you can disrupt the board to bother your opponents as well.  This game works best with two players, as it makes the game much more "plannable" as with four people playing you might as well not even look at the board until your turn.  

The genies are my favourite part of the game, as they allow you to develop special powers just for you.  I feel like this aspect of the game could have been expanded, as my only gripe is that I feel a little bit like I'm doing the same sorts of things every time I play the game.

My wife and I really enjoy this game at two players. It is fairly open and you have a lot of options on each of your turns. You score a good number of points and we always enjoy games where you play and then tally up your points at the end to see who won. That way nobody feels like they are losing the whole time and loses interest in the game. There are a lot of options on each turn so those who struggle with AP may want to steer clear, but we have had close, high scoring games each time we play.

It is a bit heavy on AP on the first couple of plays or with new players.

Other than that the game brings a lot of interesting combos and strategy to win.

Bidding victory points for turn order is a mechanism that normally demands more calculation than I enjoy performing. That problem is mitigated in this game, ironically, by devaluing the players' places in the order. Bidding low (and going late in the order) almost always works out, because the moves of the players ahead of you are likely to open up possibilities for you.
In any case, you get a point-salad Euro, the central Mancala mechanism of which is more interestingly employed in Trajan, in my view.

RATING: 6.5
Mancala was one of my favorite games as a kid. 
Now its NP-Hard. 

It's almost a luck-dependent game, in terms of "will I see a good move before the other players get annoyed with how long I'm taking?" You can easily imagine that a "best move" exists, but you can't guarantee that you'll find it. 

Definitely don't play this with anyone who's AP prone.

Prototype version, but clearly nearly ready for market.

Liked this. Brain-burny game taking the mancala-esque approach from Trajan to a shared board and adding richness where the different colors have different personalities which on one play appear well-balanced (no doubt there is still tweaking). Not so overwhelming as there are not *that* many options and the game is of medium length.

Expect the analysis heavy play to play best with 2, but played only with 4 and it was interesting at this count. I was able to remain competitive, but not win, against experienced players which is a good sign.

Nice to see Days of Wonder and Bruno Cathala move in this direction. I will be buying this.

Great looking board, but point candy scoring, accentuated by AP-prone gameplay -- the state of the game can change significantly with each player's turn -- means a lot of time waiting for another player to try and think out an extra 1-2 points on their move. And you can't even think your move through, as the situation will change by the time your turn comes around. #OnePlayJudgement (September 2014)

This gets a 6 mostly on originality.  It has a little bit of the mancala mechanic where you pick up a bunch of workers, spread them across different tiles...taking the action on the last one based on the the color of the worker placed there.  Also the tile itself can carry a possible action.  Lots of different ways to score points.  

The big drawback with this game upon my first play is the game is extremely fragile to someone's poor play helping the next person.   I mention this because I didn't really think through one of my moves and how it would help the next player.  I left things wide open and basically handed the game to the next player.  This was a 4er game so I felt kind of bad for the other 2 players who lost.  I mean, I deserved to lose, but those guys didn't.  :P  So I think this game needs to be played with experienced players only otherwise someone random could be inadvertently crowned king.

I completely disagree with this.  there are many choices and choosing the best one is the tricky part and is what creates that exciting feeling. Two thumbs and two toes up

Colourful Mancala based game, with many different ways to score victory points.  A standard points salad game these days, but certainly pleasant, and a much overdue return to form for Days of Wonder.  The game is all about tactical opportunities, rather than any deep strategy - you really shouldn't even look at the board until it's your turn, as it is in a constant state of flux.  Feels a little bit like Istanbul, which is a much better game.

Game is holding up pretty well to repeated plays. If you like point salad games and enjoy the macala mechanism then this game might be one you would enjoy. Looks good on the table. I've played this mostly two player, and I think this may be the best count. For a few reasons. One this game can create a lot of AP, so a smaller gap between turns is preferential, also fewer players gives you the ability to combo between turns which increases the potential for cool combos and hence increases the potential for strategy in my opinion. Not always wanting to play, but wouldn't turn down a game if asked.

Instead of a worker-placement game, this is a worker-pick-up game. :) I look forward to playing this more.

Very good middle-weight Euro which can be played hyper-analytically (if you like that) or a bit more casually (if you like that).   Pretty easy to teach, apart from the genie abilities which are a pain, but necessary to give the game variety.   The turn order bidding is more interesting than I expected.  I wish the player's wooden bits or the tribe meeples were made from different materials in order to make the contrast a little more pronounced on the game board.   There is a lot of visual clutter to deal with.  Would like to add this to the collection.

There's a lot to like about Five Tribes. You can start with the very unique mechanism by which you carry out your turn - picking up all the meeples and dropping them as you walk. You could go onto the beautiful art. You could wrap up with the excellent execution of the point-salad style (points are easy to track, despite being for a variety of different things.)

And yet, I find myself a little bored of it after having played it so much. I collect my 3 traders and get some valuable goods or use my assassin to clear my spot and another spot at the same time, and I think of how many times I've done exactly that before. It's still an excellent game, I just think I'm little worn on it.

RATING: 6.25
Not a terrible game, but I don't get all the current buzz over it.  It's very thinky, you have to study the board carefully to identify possible moves, and you're never quite sure what plays everyone else sees/is going after.  I think the auction for turn order is pretty flawed because of this.  There isn't really a way to bid on the specific thing you want, other than trying to go first all the time, and due to the fixed bids and once-through order, there may not be a way to get yourself in the first 2 or 3 positions if the bids you wanted to take are gone.
I also think that collecting sets tends to be a pretty easy/reliable way to get tons of points, and getting camels out is also easy, and can shut the game down in a hurry if the other players aren't fighting for it.  The djinns which are the game's subtitle, otoh, are tough to get and kinda worthless.  If you grab them early,  (and they have a playable ability) you may be able to get some use out of them, but a lot of them are kind of useless.  The blue guys will have perhaps 1 or 2 good plays during the game if things line up right, but are largely an afterthought.  Lastly, the palm trees and palaces rarely amount to anything.
So, although the game can have decent replayability due to the modular/random setup and due to the different playstyles of your groups, the actual moves you're making fall into narrow, repetitious patterns.

I am prob in the minority here, but game just does not flow well. Board is just too busy and confusing, there are too many possibilities, specially playing it 2 players. Too AP inducing, hence turns take too long (there is no point in planning ahead of time since board is constantly changing) and you are always left with a feeling there was a better move which you missed... very unsatisfying... 
On top of all, special power tiles has this crazy symbology so you are constantly checking the rules book for translation.... There are games that simply cant be language independent...

I'm still not quite sure about this one. Our group has two or three people who are AP prone, and this game seems to bring out the worst in them. On the other hand, my wife and I can knock out a game in about 25 minutes. It's clever, with a  well-written rulebook and excellent components, and I can't see us parting with it for a while yet. 7.5

Edit: The Artisans of Naqala have brought this game up for us to an 8, it's a great expansion, and adds even more ways to win.

RATING: 7

[thing=157354][/thing] is a very enjoyable game.  I can't say that it is as great as some of the buzz around it but it is a pleasant game and works well.   Like Puerto Rico you need to be careful of player positioning in this game.   A player who just hoovers up stuff without thinking about the position he is leaving the board in for the next player will give game-winning benefits to the player on his left.  In fact the game really becomes as much about containing the opportunities for the next player as maximising your own.  And so turns can take a while as you evaluate the benefits to you of each of the large variety of potential options available and you evaluate the benefit to the next player of the same.   It is this that prevents it from moving from a Good Game into a Great Game from my perspective.   I don't suffer from AP and tend to play fast and intuitively (which may be why I lose a lot!) but playing Five Tribes in that manner can create problems. 

Don't get me wrong, played without thinking too much and Five Tribes will move quickly and enjoyably, but ultimately the winner will be determined more by the board state the winner received on each of their turns rather than the game they played on their turn.  

It's a keeper for sure and one I'm looking forward to testing further over the coming months.

Interesting family game employing mancala mechanic, with 5 different factions (or tribes) with different powers which trigger when meeples are gathered from the tile. Each tile also has a power that activates at the same time. There are also Genies which give you unique special powers. There is market. And there is bidding for the first player. State of the board changes constantly so planning is possible only on your turn. The colors are pastel and nice.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Whole plethora of Genies who introduce a variety to the game and strategy and come out randomly.

 fővel próbáltuk nagyjából 1,5 óra volt, 40-80 percet írnak, stimt.
A játékelemek gyönyörűek, DoW minőség. Nyelvfüggetlen.
A játék: végig izgalmas.
A játék menet:
Licit a körsorrendért – van egy előre meghatározott értékkel (0, 1,3,5,8,12,18)feltöltött licitsáv, ide lehet a kör sorrend szerint letenni a bábukat, ezzel licitálva. 0-sából 3 is van, aki legkésőbb tesz a 0-sra az jön előbb a 0-sok közül, egyébként értelemszerűen a legmagasabb értéket megtevő kezdi a körét. Plusz amilyen sorrendben játsszák le a körüket a játékosok, olyan sorrendben fognak majd a köv. fordulóban licitálni.
A játékos akciók: a játékos egyben végig csinálja a körét. Ebben a sorrendben:
kiválaszt egy lapkát, amin vannak figurák, felveszi őket, és egyesével lepakolja őket, miközben lépked lapkáról lapkára. (klasszik mancala). A trükk: olyan helyre lehet befejezni, az utolsó figurát letenni, ahol van olyan színű figura, mint amit odatennél.
Ahol befejezte a játékos a lépését: onnan felveszi az összes olyan színű figurát, ami megegyezik azzal, amit odatett. Ha kiürül a lapka ettől: akkor megszerzi -1x lehet megszerezni, és nem lehet átvenni, a végén pontot ad.
Végrehajtja a felvett bábuknak megfelelő akciót.
5 törzs, 5 féle figura,
sárga: csak gyűjt, a végén pont;
fehér gyűjt, a végén pont, ha nem használja el a dzsinnek megidézésre;
zöld: árut szerez, annyit amennyi bábut felvett,
kék: érméket szerez (annyit ahány kék lapka a környéken, szorozva a felvett kék bábuk számával, ez a szorzó növelhető rabszolgakártyával (kék bábu+rabszolga= szorzó)));
piros: gyilkol: vagy a tábláról –ezzel akár újabb területet lehet szerezni –lapka-, akár ellenfél sárga vagy fehér bábuját.
Ezután jön a lapka akció végrehajtása: ahol befejeztük a pakolást, azért kell/lehet végrehajtani. 5 féle lapka, 2 kötelező végrehajtású, 3 opciós.
A 2 kötelező a lapka értékét növeli,
a 3 opciós egyike a dzsinn szerzés, ami jó sok pontot ad, illetve spec képességeket a játék közben. A másik 2 opciós végrehajtásúval árukat lehet szerezni.
Ami fontos: a forduló közben nincs feltöltés, ami elfogy, az elfogy.
Jó sok mindenért lehet pontot: lapkák, dzsinnek, sárga bábuk –itt is egy trükk: nem csak a bábukért, hanem 10 pont/ olyan játékos, akinél több sárga bábud van -, lerakott plusz elemek a te lapkádra (pálma, palota), árukártya sorok –különböző elemekből kell állnia, jó sok pont lehet belőle, ezeket játék közben is lehet váltani, ha pénzre van szükség.
A játékunk:
A licit: első fordulóban: max 3-as érték, aztán ahogy éreztünk rá, illetve inkább, h akartunk elvenni biztos sok pontos lépéseket, úgy ugrottak be a 12-es 18-as értékű licitek.
Előretervezés: 3-4 fordulóra nem lehet. 2-re igen. És érdemes is. mert h előre tervezni, h mennyire licitálj, h vajon más is hasonlót kurkászott ki magának, és akkor mennyit is licitálj, h ne menjen föléd. Ugyanakkor nagyon érdemes figyelni arra ki mit lép, mert egy-egy lépéstől sok-sok új lehetőség nyílik meg és ilyenkor érdemes lehet tervet változtatni.
Jelzem tök utolsó lettem, de végig élveztem. Ugyanis végig izgalmas, állandó tervezést igényel, és újratervezést. A szabályok egyszerűek, de a mancala zseniálisan van beépítve, a pálya folyamatosan változó, a mancala miatt, és rengeteg helyről lehet pontot, és kérdés, h épp mire merre, menjünk rá. Szóval lenyűgöző. –legalábbis engem :-)-
Erősség: vhol a Kennerspiel felső vége.
Egy baja az 1-4 :-)
A vége nálunk: 1-2. hely: 126-117 pont, a harmadik-negyedik: 88-84.
Szóval szoros csaták, menetközben kevésbé látható, legalábbis egy játék alapján, bár érezhető ki, h áll. (Nincs közbeni pontozás, a végén egyben minden, de a pénzek és az áruk kivételével minden látható, az árukat meg nagyjából lehet figyelni)
Nekem nagyon bejött. 
Update: még mindig tetszik, igaz most sem tudtam a top2-be kerülni :-)

If I ever play this again, it's because I'm being asked to fill a spot at the table.  This is simply not my cuppa.  That's not to say it's a bad game, because clearly a lot of people enjoy it, but so many things rubbed me wrong with Five Tribes and I can't even accurately put a finger on what it was.

It could have been the down-time (which I don't mind in wargames), the AP of other players (which I don't mind in epic games), the bidding mechanic (which I don't mind in financial/market games), the random chaotic nature of camels, temples, oases, or whatever (which I don't mind in, well, everything - chaos rocks), maybe the somewhat unbalanced djinn powers?  I dunno.

To me, the game simply wasn't fun.  Even with terrible games, I can find something fun in it, but this felt very much like solving a puzzle where other people are hiding your pieces.  Even though it has all these elements that I normally don't have an issue with, for some reason Five Tribes combines them in such a way that I simply don't want to play it again.

Five Tribes is a current favorite of mine. It's primarily a tactical game (over a strategic one), but I don't think that's a bad thing. It's often better to ditch your strategy to take advantage of points immediately on the board, so continual evaluation/re-evaluation of your plan is necessary and keeps you on your toes. Set collection can be one of the higher point scorers in the game, but it can be risky, too, for the same reason. Moving the meeples around is a fun puzzle (how do you land with the color you want, on the square you want, while also thwarting the next person's turn?). 

My one "criticism" of the game is that there's a fair amount of "luck." Five Tribes is great if all the players are on the same level - both thinking about their own moves the moves others' want to make, and finding the optimal balance. However, one new player (thinking only about his/her own moves) can destroy the balance of the game, as they unwittingly (a) leave the best moves on the board, or (b) set up an excellent move for the next player. Just something to be aware of; if playing with new players, be prepared to sit back and relax, and take the game as un-seriously as possible.

I really like the spatial element of this game.  I'm not usually very good at that kind of stuff, but after just one play I started seeing the patterns.  The different paths to victory also appeal to me.  The biggest letdown, in my opinion, is that the game is most interesting in the beginning when there are lots of Meeples on the board.  About halfway through the game the options diminish significantly and then there aren't really any good moves left, just moves that are slightly better for your strategy than others.

On the outside, I *want* to like this game.. but my couple of plays of it haven't been that great.  I strongly dislike spending the entirety of the other's players turns planning my move just to have the board game state change so much that on my turn I have AP trying to make a decision.. then feeling that pressure and having to hurry to make the decision and making bad decisions... phew! just thinking about the game has me stressed out.  Guess I'm just not good at this game.. either way, unless something changes this is my least favorite Days of Wonder game.

Light weight feel.  Medium weight complexity.  Heavy weight decisions.  Endless replayability. 

I liked this game at first, then didn't.  I sold it.  Thought about it.  Bought it again.  Played it.  Realized I still wasn't into it.

Moving the pieces around the board is really fun.  That said, I'm not really into games that hide the leader board behind a wall of calculations (no matter how easy).  It makes standings hard to see at a glance.  

Also, all the different art elements don't seem to cohere.  It might have to do with all the different colors.

As to the slaves, while I'm not offended, they are bizarre in that their thematic tie in isn't really apparent, so they don't add anything to the flavor of the game. I think genie lamps would have been cool instead!

I finally played this game with more than two.  I really like it!  I may have have overthinking the bidding leading to some frustration playing the game.  If you can sit back, enjoy the ride, and try not to get to AP on it, it's a great game!

2015-07-28 : Finally got a chance to play it. The 2-dimensional mancala mechanic is neat, but this is almost a pure tactical game : you make the best of what the previous player has left for you, which could make this a no-no game if you're playing with AP prone gamers. There's just a tiny bit of of strategic depth in de djin cards, but the only combo I saw working once was going last; setting something up, then going first.
On the plus side the gameplay is smooth, the graphic layout is excellent and we played a 3-player game in under an hour

Played 1 3-player game. It was fun figuring out the best plays and I sometimes surprised myself with the options I saw once I understood the possible options and game flow. I won this game, probably because I was the only one really gunning for resources, while others where going for the Djinns. This is also the problem with this game I guess. If you are the person doing something others aren't going for, then you have a greater chance to win.
Also, I do think the others where over estimating the amount of points the Djinns where gaining them (forgetting the White meeples them selves are worth 2 points)

After the first few plays, I was excited about this game and gave it an 8. Those games were 2-player. Then I played a 4-player game. My g*d that was boring!

I would say the boardgaming community subconsciously doesn´t like this game, because on the poll for the best amount of players, there is none. Only "recommended with 2-4".

My advice, only play 2 or 3-player. Overrated, but fine now and then.

Not terrible. The main problem with the game is there is very little opportunity to really plan ahead. So each turn you take, you almost have to completely reevaluate the board to determine where you can get the most victory points. The first player auction is also largely a trap, it is rarely worth being first player specifically, at least enough to pay points for it. Everything about the game seems fine, there just isn't any real room for developing a winning strategy. So it the end, you just take the most points you can find each turn.

Everything is worth points which can lead to some AP problems when playing with gamers who like to maximize value out of each turn. Other than some slow moments of counting meeples and calculating points/play the mancala style meeple placement is a really fun structure for turns. Seems quite deep after just 2 plays!

By all accounts I should :heart::heart::heart::heart::heart: this game. So why don't I?

:heart: The Euro-ness
:heart: The Abstract-ness
:heart: The GORGEOUS art and graphics
:heart: The wonderful production quality
:heart: The unique meeple movement mechanism and the puzzle it provides.

However, [b]every [/b]time I look at the box I [b]dread [/b]playing it. For all of the great things there is one thing that takes the joy out of the entire game for me - bidding for turn order :yuk: It's not just me. The Mr. hates it too. He refuses to bid anything other than 0...unless I bid 0 then all of a sudden he's willing to spend money. There were a couple games he won just bidding 0 and that annoyed me no end and soured the game for me. When he used that tactic in auction Tikal he lost, and I felt this game rewarded him for doing nothing. It's not the game's fault. We do not like any kind of bidding/auction in games.

In any case, the designer came out with an official solo variant that really made this palatable for me. In my first solo game, like the score chart said, it was almost too easy. I definitely played it correctly. The rules are simple, and Yazid is easy to implement. Even with quite a few sixes coming out I got a major score on my first game which I wasn't expecting. Didn't get a chance to play it more solo and wouldn't keep it for only solo play - too much setup.

This game gets a lot of flack for crippling AP prone players into submission, but thankfully, I haven't had that issue during my plays.  My games have been mostly 2 player with my wife, and we enjoy it a lot.  3 Player games seem to go fine as well.  The production value on the game is fantastic and moving the meeples around the board is a lot of fun.  One of our favorite games.

I don't want to play this game, for two reasons:

(1) You have a lot of decisions that matter (in particular, about exactly where you make placements,) but I don't think I'll be able to make those decisions in any intelligent way without spending far more time than I want to spend.

(2) There's no reason to include slaves as a commodity.  It's offensive to me.  I just played Sid Sackson's Samarkand, which is about commodity trading in the deserts of the Near East, and it manages fine without using slaves as a commodity.  I'm sure this game could have done the same.

Gaming: I enjoy this game a lot. My only complaint is having to bid for turn order every round. Aside from that, Five Tribes is a simple game to learn, but has a ton of decisions each turn making it deeper than it first appears. It is more abstract than other Days of Wonder games...and probably not as newbie friendly (although the Mancala mechanic is something many people are used to.

It's always difficult to play a game like this the first time. You have thousands of opportunities at the start of the game with a descending number of opportunities as the game goes by. Playing with players who want to analyze everything may easily result in too much downtime.
On the good side, you get a real kick out of this when finding the perfect way to move your meeples and score a lot of points.
This game really grows on you after repeated plays. Exploring the different strategies, getting constant kicks from boosting points, finding a smart path that at the same time destroys your opponents' opportunities, etc. A lot of good stuff going on, and the playing time is really acceptable.
Definitely something original, and some awesome components! Great game, but never destroy a game like this by picking opponents with "analysis-paralyses" tendencies.

A very well designed game. I imagine there are still a lot of subtle nuances to discover in this one.

EDIT: The number of Djinis a player can have should be limited or other changes should be made. Some of them are simply too powerful. The one that allows you to draw market cards for only 1 Fakir. C'mon! I drew about 15 cards with him, 3 of them being Ivory, Gold and Gems. And with the market sets I earned +130 points.Pleeeeeease.

When I first purchased Five Tribes, my main concern was that the game would get boring, as we intently stared at the board in a wash of AP.  In our early games, we didn't know enough about the strategy to do so, so the game moved quickly and felt exciting.

The more we've played it, however, the stronger the AP has become.  We've seen multiple paths to victory all work well, so now we are looking for more types of board conditions.  It really slowed the game down.

This is one where I think we'll take a break from playing it for a while, intentionally giving ourselves time to forget some of the strategies so we can play "from the hip" rather than carefully analyzing everything.

I will say that, despite the randomized boards, randomized cards, and randomized genies, by the tenth play the game was starting to feel a bit samey.  Even though there were many different paths to victory, none of them really seemed to stand out as having a different [i]feel[/i] to them.

However, with all of that negative stuff being said, this is a game that is shockingly well balanced, considering how much is going on.  Many different paths to victory can work in a given game, and strong tactical play can snatch a come-from-behind win if you make your move at just the right moment.  The puzzle of this game feels very unique, and the pasted-on theme somehow does manage to give it just enough flavor to not feel completely abstract.

Also, I still have to say it - the choice to include the slave cards bothers me, and many plays of the game haven't changed that belief.  Especially when teaching the game at meetups to people I don't know, I always cringe when I get to the part that I have to try to make excuses for the crass inclusion in an otherwise very abstract game without a lot of adherence to the theme.

RATING: 5
One 2-player game
A mishmash of elements that mostly works. I was prepared to hate the puzzle element of it but it's not bad. In my 2-player game there were a fair number of move choices but usually your target(s) seem pretty obvious. It's mostly a matter of trying to not set up the board for your opponents to score easily or have easy choices.

Seems like there are too many resource grabbing tiles and they were under-utilized in my game. There are far juicier targets. Are they meant to be generic consolation prizes? Probably more occupied/used with more players.

Lastly, I have to agree with a GeekBuddy's opinion that the auction for turn order mechanism is largely useless since only the winner really knows what they're getting. The board can be very different for subsequent players (less so for two players).

I think this is probably a very different game with two players versus more players.

My only real issue with it is Analysis Paralysis (depends on group) and the fact that player experience is a huge factor in the game - the owner of the game scored a lot more than the rest - with 170 points, followed by 139, 128 and 98 pts.

This is interesting and very different. It feels a little like a deeper version of Blue moon city. The meeple movement mechanic is very mancala like and it leads to some very interesting decisions and i like the turn order mechanic as well as you do not always want to go first and other turns you NEED that first place regardless of what it costs to get. I don't think it is a game that will hit the table particularly often but it is interesting and different enough to all the others in my collection to warrant the occasional play.

There are over one hundred different meeple moves that you have to choose from.
When it is your turn, you can
1) Calculate which of those potential moves is legal and will give you most winning points. If everybody does that, one game will take at least three hours.
2) Quickly choose a meeple move that seems good to you. But this way, you will be annoyed because later you realize that there would have been a better move and you overlooked it.

Mancala meets euro-salad, and has an AP-prone boardchild.

Rating history: 7|6|4

2p - I like this best as a 2p duel. (1x)
4p (1x) Not much control, too much downtime.

[b]4th play, Jan 2016.[/b] My interest and enjoyment of this game ticked up just a bit. When I disconnect from the need to find the best play, and just settle for a good move, and more good moves, playing casually, I enjoy it.

1st play: 7. Oct/14. More euro-style than I thought it would be, but I also liked it more than I thought I would. 2p game playing assassins a bit incorrectly, but fun to build camel chains to make opponents moves more difficult. Enjoyed.

2nd play: 6. Same night. The 4p game had a lot of downtime between turns (3 waiting turns instead of 1), and harder to play defense, plus a weak player can leave lots of good opportunities on the board for stronger players. Also find the djinns to lack variety (i.e. not enough of them).

3rd play: 4. Months later (July 2015), I teach this to some friends to see if my "meh" reaction was just game snobbery. Brandon's reaction: "It's something different, but it not a game I'd go out of my way to play." Couldn't have said it better myself.

Great components and a pleasing overall feeling made it easy to pick up this game to play.  I was not disappointed.  Each one of us took a different path to winning, and it was close.  Potentially there are so many ways to winning can't wait to try out different strategies.  The game will never have the same set up twice--a fresh board & layout every time.  Easy to teach with just a few rules.  Some people might get paralyzed with choices--so if you like a  quick game, choose the right people.

Typical Days of Wonder quality and polish to this game - it looks amazing.  

The gameplay is very simple "Mancala-like" by movement of groups of coloured meeples which must be dropped off one by one on adjacent tiles as a pathway is made.  The colour of the final meeple must match at least one meeple from the final tile and it's that colour which determines your meeple action.  The colour represent different clans such as white=Elder, red=Assassin etc.  Each has a different action.

It's quite addictive as you search out the best movement options and hope the other players a) don't spot it and b) don't ruin it by parallel movements.

It is prone to AP players if they insist on calculation all the possible options for the meeple movement so choose your group carefully!

Five Tribes is a game with pretty simple rules but not quite as simple to play in practice. That's not because the game would present you with particularly interesting dilemmas that need to be pondered but solely due to the size of the decision tree you're asked to grapple with each turn.

There is hardly any strategic play possible in the game. The board changes significantly between turns and the only task is to maximize returns for the current turn which mostly involves a lot of scanning and rescanning the board for opportunities. Beware of AP here.

To compare it to another DoW game, it is quite a bit less strategic than Ticket to Ride, yet more demanding in turn-to-turn play. I'd have preferred a less tactical approach since the underlying mechanism does show some promise.

Oh this game, this game... I do not know where to start. Five Tribe is unique, strategic euro game. Thanks to modular game board and random meeple setup is every game completly different. It is full of options and you have to find a new possibilities after yours opponent turn. In the most cases long term strategies does not work and you are forced to play a react kind of a game. Five Tribes is for an specific audience, not for everybody. If you like heavy strategic games, euro games, buy your copy today!

Massive overproduction aside, the Mancala mechanism is novel enough, but it ultimately creates an intensely tactical scenario due to the way the board state changes so drastically every turn. The optimization of every turn seems nearly infinite which means moves must be frustratingly taken regardless of their absolute quality so that the game might end before the players' lives do.
The auction for turns every round is necessary, but makes the game feel even slower than it already is.

This is a really nice tactical abstract game with an interesting mechanic that is improved by good production. Possibly a bit AP requiring the occasional "A good game is a quick game comment", and much like T&T, do not look at the board until its your go, otherwise you will get frustrated (Rating 8.137, May 17).

Quite a good game. Very Euro, but brings something new to the table with its mechanic of "worker drop-off and removal". This is a great-grandchild to mancala. There are many ways to score (point salad) but players may wish to only focus on a few and hope to maximize. The components are GLORIOUS and almost worth the price of admission. This is a great game for people who like medium-weight Euros. This game could seriously fall into an AP spiral for new players.  There are always about 10-15 moves one can make, and there is always 1 optimal, best move. For players who really want to do the math, everyone may find themselves sitting around waiting for the turns to complete. So, not revolutionary, but a well-executed design that will not appeal to everyone - but it certainly appeals to me!

Wiele dróg do zwycięstwa dzięki tzw. sałatce punktowej. Zasady są dosyć proste - wystarczy przeczytać instrukcję i grać, ale nadspodziewanie sporo trzeba się nakombinować, co prowadzi do całkiem długiego zastanawiania się nad optymalnym dla siebie ruchem. Plus za losowość - do końca nie wiadomo, kto zdobędzie najwięcej punktów, bo może się okazać, że akurat trafiło na tę najbardziej niepozorną osobę. Bardzo klimatyczne elementy i piękne grafiki, bardzo przyjemna gra.

Although popular with many, I'm not keen on the 2 player rules which over complicate the game in my opinion.

You might want to steer clear if prone to analysis paralysis as the options on your turn seem endless and you can't really plan ahead as the board state can change quite dramatically (and in unpredictable ways) on other player's turns.

A very tactical game, using the mancala mechanic. Can really be AP since you can't plan much before your turn but the moves are very satisfying

Artisan expansion keeps the game fresh and adds in more special powers, which is awesome.

Fairly abstract, puzzle type game.  If you enjoy theme, pass.  Action selection is similar to mancala, but you have several goals: get the meeple action you want (last color you drop), get the tile action and possible tile points (where you end up), and don't create good moves for your opponent(s).  In addition, with a once around bidding system for turn order, you would ideally consider the differential in payment during the bid.  Game is enjoyable and challenging.  If there was a theme with well integrated mechanics, I'd probably enjoy it a lot more.  It does have a potential A/P problem, and downtime in waiting to see what the board looks like for your turn.  Very nicely produced.

Really good game. A silent brain smelter, not so much talking going on during the game as you are busy thinking about you next awesome move.

Rules are not difficult and was quick to get to the table.  Lots of meaty tactical decisions as each turn is like a mini mancala puzzle with some strategy too.

If you like huge downtimes, this is for you. You can't really plan beforehand. And when it's your turn, you have to think about the best move you can do, this can take 1-5min per player. So have fun if you have to wait 10-15min for every turn...

I don't feel the theme. Too many possibilities that let people think too long.

Very fun! This was only my second Days of Wonder game after Ticket to Ride but so far they are 2 for 2 in my book. It's very inventive (I love the spatial mancala-esque mechanic) though I haven't mastered the point-salad and often get a lower score than another player even if I think I'm making better choices. For me, this game is more about the journey than the destination.

I liked it on the first play.  I don't typically like the mancalla mechanic, but I enjoyed it here.  I think that it's hard to plan more than a move ahead really - it's just too easy to plan something and either 1).  have to overpay for the move, or 2).  someone else takes it.

That's fine, it's just more of a tactical than a strategic type of game.

I think we played in 90 minutes, with set up and explanation, and I think that 60 minutes is pretty accurate.

I would definitely play it again and I suspect I'd enjoy it for at least 10 plays.

I intensely disliked this game. It suffers from a design that encourages timeless inaction as other the peoples' moves make planning your own almost impossible.  Matters are made worse with pieces of similar size and colors, all becoming a jumbled mess.  At some point, trying to decipher the meeples from the player tokens and the palm trees and all the other items that clutter the board become a huge headache.  Literally.  Even ending this painful experience was difficult;  there is too much info to track and scoring is complex and non-intuitive.  A scoring app is almost a necessity.   Scoring is variable with in-game Genie cards modifying many of the totals.  Paper/pen/calculator are needed.

Really, this is one of the most unpleasant games I have experienced in quite some time.  Mid-game I was standing and pacing, wanting desperately to end the torture.  You could not pay me to play this again.

Opinion: I needed 2 plays to liked the game, it is an abstract game with a small risk of A/P if players look for the perfect movement. I do not see it like that, it is all about tactics. After the first game, you could see lot of chaos, it is just an illusion. You could see also that the genius are overpowered, and I could agree if it is the first game and players do not know how to play. You have several ways to go for the victory. And think twice your bidding for the turn order, it is really important.
Please, whenever you play this, do not go for the perfect play.

Days of Wonder's first "Gamer's" game and first attempt at Euro-style mechanics.
THE SHORT:
It works flawlessly, but, like real Euro-games, it doesn't really capture a theme like other legendary Days of Wonder titles. If you want a Euro experience, there are several better titles. If you're trying to coax your game group toward something other than the latest zombie themed Ameri-trash, then this might whet their appetite, but don't expect them to stampede toward AGRICILA or CAVERNA after this experience. FIVE TRIBES, like its desert setting, is a little on the dry side. You will respect the mechanics, but its fun factor is low.
THE LONG:
Days of Wonder games are great at theme: [thing=10630]MEMOIOR '44[/thing] perfectly captures the spirit of WWII battels, [thing=15062]SHADOWS OVER CAMELOT[/thing] drips theme, [thing=9209]TICKET TO RIDE [/thing] is all about building that long rail line, and [thing=40692]SMALL WORLD [/thing] gives you the impression of civilizations rising and falling at your God-like whim.
However, during our playthrough of [thing=157354]FIVE TRIBES[/thing], I never once felt like a sultan. I didn't feel like I was interacting with tribal politics, and even with powerful Djinn at my beck and call, I never felt their mystic wonder. The only thing that made me feel somewhat connected to the Egyptian or Persian aspect of this game was the Mancalla-like mechanic of picking up a group of meeples, and then distributing them in a linear fashion around the tiles. 
WHICH IS COOL!  It creates a constantly evolving puzzle that each player is trying to solve at the same time. This puzzle has so many moving parts and so many ways to earn points, that you may not want to play this with certain strategy buffs who will sit for 20 minutes trying to choose the best move for point yield.
There is a lot of praise out there for Five Tribes, and when a game is this good, the theme doesn't matter as much. Five Tribes is similar to Dominion, in that it's a solid design with game play that constantly changes and challenges each person to play it in different ways, but the theme is as thin as ink on paper. 
So, yes, I understand that you don't always need theme to have a good game, but, Five Tribes just doesn't feel "engaging" to me.  There is very little excitement, and after agonizing over every move and what strategy to follow, you don't exactly know how your strategy payed off in the end, which makes for one of those "Oh, it's over?" anticlimactic situations. Most times, you won't know who won until MATH happens, as each player spends a few minutes counting all their points, similar to [thing=68448]7 WONDERS[/thing]
I do have nice thing to say about Five Tribes: it scales very well from 2 to 4 players, and did I mention the lovely components? But none of that puts it over the top for me. My desire to play again is more of an effort to understand it's many-faceted, shifting, victory point system, which is brilliant. Perhaps that IS the theme, a puzzle that moves and changes like majestic sand dunes. If that's the case, then I'd have to say "well done" to designer [person=1727]Bruno Cathala[/person] and his play testers. Sorry I missed it.

Ultimately, FIVE TRIBES is one of those VERY NICE games in my library that sit there asking me why I didn't commit to something more like [thing=120677]TERRA MYSTICA[/thing] or [thing=105551]ARCHIPELIGO[/thing]. It's a purchase that once again convinces me that as far as nerd culture is concerned, I'm definitely a member, but I'm just not trying hard enough.

Dropping the rating slightly after the most recent play, which included the Artisans expansion. This game just promotes the highest level of AP in my wife and given that 90% of my plays of this game will include her, it's hard for me to keep the rating as high as the game deserves because it's an all-day affair when we play it. However, with the right group of players who play by instinct, there are few better experiences out there in the board game world.

One play with three and one with four. A point salad game that gives the players a dump truck's worth of options, both tactically and strategically. It's a clever design, and it's fun coming up with good moves, but the overabundance of possibilities definitely made it bog down from time to time. I don't like my games to be quite this puzzley-brainburny. Also, the usefulness of the djinni seems to be all over the map, with some being extremely valuable and others being pointless.

Played twice. First game was quiet a light experience. The second game, when we had a better idea of what we were doing, slowed right down. To play optimally you need to take longer to take a turn than is polite to the other players.  The easy to understand rules, nice production and sweat spot 1 hour play time will see the game getting more plays but I don't think the decisions are going to get instinctive enough to assess to avoid analyses paralysis issues. Oct 2014

Third playing, this time with family rather than gamers. This is not the next "Ticket to Ride". They really disliked it. Way too dry for your typical family. To put it bluntly they found it boring. As the family are my target audiance for a Days of Wonder game I'm going to have to chalk this down as a fail and drop my rating but only by a point as I still enjoy the game. Oct 2014

The gamebox says that you can play Five Tribes in around an hour. In my experience it's more like 3 hours. This game leads to more analysis paralysis then any other game that I've played. But! it's worth it.

This game is fantastic. The components are of great quality, the mechanic of picking up and dropping the meeples is clever and there are multiple ways to achieve victory. The game is a point-salade but it's very possible to specialize in a particular direction. 

On top of it all Five Tribes has a cool theme, plays well with 2-4 players and comes with an insert!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Cool game, solid mechanics and great production values, easy to learn and seems very replayable. Nice twist on the mancala mechanic.
There's a couple downsides, though. The first one is the rules for scoring market cards are unclear. The other is that you can't completely plan your turn during other players' turns since the board can change, which has immense potential for analysis paralysis. Luckily it didn't happen in our game.

I love the idea and how it all fits together, but it brings out my AP more than most games.  If you don't think things through, you end up setting up your left hand player and not scoring as many points as those who can see or think faster.

A lot of standard Cathala touches here, but much more tightly developed than in some of his other big-box games. I like a game where I get fewer turns than I was expecting and still feel satisfied with how much of an arc the game went through. There isn't time to flog any one advantage for a million points, but it does seem to matter quite a bit what you spend your moves doing (even though there's often several ways to get roughly the same number of points on a given turn).

A game with a neat Mancala-like system that is dragged down by the point-salad scoring. I agree with Geekbuddy Cole Wehrle when he says that 10 years ago, this game would have been streamlined into a much more fun and robust light-medium game. As it is, it sort of invites AP even though you can't plan anything ahead of time.

Shame on Days of Wonder for not giving this one a bit more polish.

It has some interesting decisions that are almost abstract, plus some solid second-guessing of the other players, but the board is cluttered and not very fun to look at, the mechanism of picking up all the meeples on a space and redistributing them one at a time is intriguing but kind of clunky, and very prone to people dropping the meeples and screwing up the board setup (and sometimes not being able to remember what belonged where), and the djinn cards (and for a different reason, the slave cards) don't really seem to fit with the rest of the game much at all.

Do you have lots AP? If you do, please, remove yourself of the premises, please.
If you don't, them please, come in and let's move colourful meeple around.
Great game, prefer it with the chaos of more people, but clearly well thought of as a 2 player game.
It does have issues about theme, I don't really care about them, and say it would be a shame to miss out such a good game over that.
Plays well with any count, for a more controlled experience, play it with 2 players, for more fun and chaos, 3-4 (but please, do not play it with 3-4 players if someone has really bad AP).

Very interesting use of the "Mancala" mechanic. There is a multitude of possible moves every turn until near the end, each one changing the game state, creating and removing other possibilities. Add an auction for turn order and it's easy to see how the game can be quite a brain burner if taken seriously, causing "analysis paralysis" even in some players that are not prone to that. However, with multiple ways to score, most very different from each other, it's very rewarding to explore its many strategies.

Nekem nagyon tetszik a dzsinn-es téma és a sivatagi törzsek felhasználásának a formája. A klasszikus munkáslehelyezős játékmenettel szemben itt azokat veszed le a játéktérről és gyűjtesz pontokat. Több út is vezet a sikerhez, bár még nem láttam, hogy olyan nyert volna, akinek nincs egy sok pontot erő erőforrás kombója is a tarsolyban.
Könnyű több percig is gondolkodni, akár AP is előfordulhat.

Un juego con el tema pegado, es un euro abstracto con mecánica de mancala y ensalada de puntos que es el sueño húmedo de los Eurogamers duros.

Los componentes a la altura: kilos de madera y mepples encima de fichas de cartón de colores pasteles.

Hasta ahora es el juego de Cathala en caja grande que mas me ha gustado, lo cual no es mucho decir. 

El principal problema del juego son los tiempos muertos, es un juego muy propenso al AP, hay que estudiar el tablero para buscar combos y ver si quieres ganar la subasta y si eres el primero ahí terminas, pero si eres el segundo o el tercero, o a lo peor, eres el cuarto, resulta que el tablero ha cambiado tanto o te han levantado el combo que habías visto inicialmente que toca volver a analizar y repensar la jugada que quieres hacer.

Por otro lado aunque cada partida el set up es totalmente diferente, tengo la sensación de que con varias partidas es mas fácil reconocer y jugar patrones.

Es un Euro de alma familiar digno de la escuela mas dura, y hará las delicias de auqeloos a los que les encante resolver este puzzle, yo no me encuentro entre ellos. Prefiero euros mas elegantes, con menos tiempos muertos y a poder ser mucho mas dinámicos en su desarrollo.

Con 2 jugadores moviendo cuatro peones tiene que ser el infierno AP buscando combos ganadores, y con 4, mejor llévate un libro para leer entre los turnos, por lo menos hasta que la gente sepa jugar y vea las jugadas y haga los movimientos en automático.

Y esto, es el mejor de Cathala en caja grande.

Instant hit for me. Still trying to vibe where it lands in my top games of all time, but it's way up there. Love the genie powers and the puzzley nature of this one. Works incredibly well with all player counts and is actually a fast game. Lots of decisions and lots of pathways to victory, but this is truly a study in tactics. The board is ever changing so you must make the best decisions that are given to you at the moment. Work with what you've got, but also set yourself up for victory while not setting your opponents up for scoring. Artwork is awesome, truly fits as a Days of Wonder game. Bravo Bruno Cathala for blowing out minds once again, this may be your best ever.

This is a hit with my wife and I. We enjoy this as a 2 player game. We don't look at it as a deep game, or a strategy game.

We have no AP issues when we play it that way and therefore it is a game we thoroughly enjoy.

This game starts with so many options!  It's definitely a candidate for analysis paralysis, or for computerization to allow all options to be visible.  It's often not clear what is the best option at a given time.  Sometimes there is one clearly better square... but only if you see a way to get there from another square (sometimes by going in a loop and hitting the square twice).

Playing with 3 players is difficult enough, but 4 players would probably be bad, because you'd never be able to plan your turn in advance if you didn't go first.

The bidding leads to painful decisions.  You can be stuck in a position where if you bid high, you can win but everybody else will save lots of money; if you bid low, you won't win; and if you bid zero, you'll be leaving a good option to someone else for a ridiculously low price.  It's an interesting (and sometimes painful) mechanic that bidding zero determines that you will go later than any player who's still in the bidding.

The scoring ends up being over 150 points, which I think is too high.  It's hard to value points when there are so many available!  There are obviously many ways to get points and win, so it's a matter of balance.

Five Tribes is unmistakeably a game that has evoked and will evoke a diverse range of opinions (and I'm not even talking about the inclusion of slaves in the game). Mechanically, the game puts to work a mancala style movement on an board of 30 spaces (5x6 tiles) rather than a closed linear loop - this means that when you pick up meeples (not stones! - there are also multiple colours), there are multiple possible locations to which your movement can end (including doing loops) as well as decisions to make about which meeples you drop off on route. This, in turn, creates an immense tactical horizon which becomes paralyzing to some. Now this is not what I take issue with here, I'm usually a fan of brain-burny games (and huge one at that). However, the intellectual effort required to grind through the possibilities does and the tactical outcomes do not seem to be in sync -- almost everything generates points, and very few outcomes seem to deny or heavily deviate other players plans in a consistent or meaningful way. In other words, I find myself doing the heavy lifting of a game like Reef Encounter (i.e., heavy and meaningful game-shaping actions), but with the outcome of Castles of Burgundy (i.e., if I do this, I get two additional points and my opponent will have to implement another approach which will likely result in a few points less). While this sounds hyper-critical, I still think that the game itself offers something new and creative -- I simply wish that it offered a bit more granularity or fewer paths to victory to really ramp up the competition (especially in light of how taxing the game is).

Five Tribes probably holds for me one of the best first impressions of a game I've ever had. The mechanics blend together so well (I love this game's adaptation of the mancala mechanic), culminating in a game that can have such varied paths to victory. Every game feels fresh and unique from one another! Besides my very first game of this (my friend thwomped me so hard), the scores have been extremely close, like a 10 point difference in a 150-200+ (the average changing based on player count and RNG game set-up) between first and last player. It scales so phenomenally. 2 players is very rich and complex, while going above that player count leads to a slightly more chaotic but still tactile experience. Five Tribes is a must have in any board gamer's collection!

While VERY fun, this game gives me analysis paralysis like no other game ever has. Also, watching the board while others play is nightmarish, as they crush every hope/dream you had about what path/action you were going to take on your turn.

I haven't played it so far! - but this looks like an instant classic.

It's Bruno Cathala, it has a pleasant and not to strong theme, gameplay is rather abstract and supports a lot of strategy paths to be likeable by many different player personalities.

It seems to be the perfect step-up game, i.e. one step after gateway. It provides huge replayability with the random setup -- and after the randomness of the setup it allows for some strategic gameplay, so I even can imagine tournaments evolving around it.

One minor complaint: only 2-4 players. But even Catan started with 3-4, I guess. Maybe a 5th player can be added through an expansion.

Currently (09/2014) my bet for game of the year or at least a bunch of awards in 2015 :)

It is a mix of the well known games, that could creat something new. The idea of picking up meeples which open up actions to you are nice. I feel super unbalanced the djinns, some of them are an instant win, while some of them are the worst ever. It was a good game to try out once, but im 100% sure i won't buy it anytime soon.

Pros / Cons:
-It has high replay ability because the map and the meeples locations are always changing.
-The mix of the well known games, managed to creat something new.

-It is super expensive for what it is.
- The Djinn are unbalanced, some of them are an instant win, some of them are the worst ever.

Five Tribes is a clever activation game requiring small caravans of meeples to move about the board in order to activate and claim tiles.

Players bid for turn order each turn, and then move meeples on the board in a path from the location where they started as mancala stones.

At the destination matching meeples activate, and the tile activates- possibly a player can claim the tile as well, and then may take optional actions.

Because the mancala motion occurs on a shared grid instead of a ring or a personal board, meeples left behind can help or hinder other players from their next action- it is a very interactive game and moves quickly (as long as players do not try to analyze/optimize too long).

In another clever twist, all bidding and goods purchasing is done in coins which are also VP, so players do need to judge whether the expense will provide bigger returns in the short run, or be a poor investment.

It's very understandable why this was an award-winning game- the elements work together well in an integrated whole, and come to a timely but challenging conclusion.

(02/20/2015) Comment based on one play.

A mancala-like sowing game, where sowing is not fixed in one circular direction, but occurs on a grid. Sowing can occur horizontally or vertically, where some action(s) can occur on the last sown space, based on the type of meeple sown, as well as the action printed on the space.

The board consists of tiles comprising a 5x6 grid, where 90 meeples of five different colors (18 meeples in each color) are randomly distributed, with each space containing 3 meeples. The board itself is randomly generated, where each grid space is assigned a random tile, each with differing VP values and optional actions.

On their turn, a player picks up all the meeples in any one space and then "sows" one meeple in every space they traverse away from the original space. The player collects all the meeples of the color of the last sown meeple, triggers whatever action (if dictated) is dictated by the color, and then lastly can execute the optional action of the space.

If they happen to end up in a space that has removed the last meeple(s), they can then put a camel in that space, claiming it for its VP value, which will be summed for endgame scoring.

The five tribes/meeple types represent different things in gameplay: 1) Yellow represents Viziers. Collecting the most Yellow represents VP at the end of the game; 2) White represent Elders, which can be turned in to summon "Djinns" (genies) that give extra capabilities; 3) Green represents Merchants, which allow acquiring of commodity cards that score much like the civilization cards in Stone Age; 4) Blue represents Builders that score depending on board position; and 5) Red represents Assassins that allow removing meeples at a distance, which is useful for claiming empty tiles.

When the rules were explained to me, my reaction was: "Is that it?" Given the random starting conditions, it is a matter of the players to identify and execute the best sowing pattern(s), and improve either short-term or long-term scoring possibilities. Based on this, players conduct a once-around bid to determine player order. Spend most, go first. Spend least, make first bid in the next round. As the number of meeples is reduced through sowing, the number of best sowing pattern(s) will change and shrink. Near the end of the game, there are very few sowing patterns left. The key is identifying the best sowing pattern(s) and bidding high enough (in VP) in order to get first-crack at exploiting the patterns.

So, since the board is all open-information, it is possible to "find" (or solve) the best sowing pattern. Then, it is a matter of bidding the proper amount to exploit it, and hoping the other players don't recognize the same pattern that you have. Due to the monstrosity of choices available, this is probably the source of AP that others have commented about. There may be some tactical considerations when sowing, to ensure that players after you are not given some better sowing pattern. There seems to be little strategic implications, and certainly no satisfying combinations to build up to, since the board changes after every player's turn. Even with all the thinking and rethinking to maximize points, the end result of taking no more than one or two trivial actions is a letdown. Given all this, I find this "searching for best patterns" abysmal as a game mechanism. It's kind of like "memory" as a game mechanism in Concentration--it may have been fun when I was very young, but now find it boring. The same goes for the game--it didn't get me excited, and I found myself quickly bored.

The production values are gorgeous, as it is standard Days of Wonder fare. The game is accessible and not very difficult to play, although there is plenty of depth here if you want to delve into the many interacting pieces. It's just the main mechanism leaves me flat, and the payoff is simply not worth the effort. Initial rating is a "6". I am willing to give it another try, but I am not terribly excited about it.

Great light/midweight game, I usually use this as a step-up from a "gateway" game. It's Colorful and looks nice on the table and offers a somewhat different but simple core mechanic. The game can drag a bit if you are playing if AP prone players, so to avoid that I always tell to the players to not try to find THE BEST play on they turn, but instead go with a good one if possible. Great great game.

[b]tl;dr[/b] — Light & fast = FUN; serious & slow = OH GOD KILL ME NOW

[b]After 1 play:[/b]  [COLOR=#979797](2p)[/COLOR]  Works well as a chill activity with a glass of wine & some downtempo ambient.  It's pretty, has neat little puzzles to solve, and everything you do nets you some kind of return, so there's a feeling of constant forward progress (as opposed to irritating impotence).  I like the dark undertones of Rasputin-like manipulation of entire peoples, murder, and slave sacrifice in order to treat with demons.  But that's just me.

I think it would be [i]absolute hell[/i] with hardcore gamers, especially at max player count.  Each turn can be laboriously optimized for maximum payoff with minimum setup for the next player; but this process, at least in the early game, involves brute-forcing all possible moves to climb the various branches of the game tree, a fractally-fuzzed boredom bush.  This might be okay if you're playing against quantum computers (spoiler alert:  you will lose), but it would be excruciating with savannah-born meat-brains (chuck a spear, check; grind [i]n[/i]-ply game states in a timely fashion, not so much).  A chess clock would be a must... or you could just hold everyone to casual play and save the thinky for heavier games where such deep contemplation is part of the intended experience.

Probably most enjoyable with your honey, family play, or two couples as a social activity.

[b]Thoughts on the 2p rules:[/b]

It's a bummer that the process of turn-order bidding for two is merely implied in the rules—maybe more obviously for some, but still.  It would have been nice to have a small, concrete example of what must otherwise be intuited.

[q="No one"]
The two players will bid for [i]four[/i] turn order slots; it is therefore possible, through clever and/or aggressive bidding, to get two (or more!) turns in a row.*


[size=7]*If you go 3,4 in one turn and then 1,2 in the next that's [i]four turns in row![/i][/size][/q]
[b]After 4 plays:[/b]  [COLOR=#979797](3x 4p)[/COLOR]  It's a solid 7.  Works as intended—a pleasant little puzzler with lots to do, Nerf®-edged back-and-forth, and gorgeous to boot.

[b]Stuff we got wrong:[/b]

• [i]Resource cards are hidden.[/i]
Good luck finding that in the rulebook...

• [i]Djinn & the market only refresh between rounds.[/i]
What you see during turn order bidding is all you'll get until next time...

• [i]Viziers score 1 VP each, then +10[/i] per person[i] with fewer than you.[/i]
So if the final vizier count is 5, 4, 3, 1 the scores will be 35, 24, 13, and 1.  This will crazy-change the game...

Sadly, the fact that you can Mancala-calculate the highest-scoring move for each of the five tribes on your turn, and the fact that the board state changes so much that you can't begin calculating until your turn, mean that it would probably best be a game that you play between your turns in some other game.

Although I liked it very much, in the long run it became a game to avoid when your gaming group is a bit cheerful since the AP factor might slow the pace and the mood of a gaming session. Don't missunderstand me, it is a very good and thrilling game but if you have an AP prone friend in the group you can expect some yawning.

This game is a really great puzzle. You have to be attentive at all time, because the puzzle is always changing. The strategy of the game is pretty nice but the rules are simple enough that I was able to tech it to my parents. The only thing I dislike about this game is the lack of importance of the yellow meeple in a 2 player game.

A fun, colorful, dynamic point-salad game. There is a bidding process (I hate bidding) to get to go first; mancala-type board "movement"; a variety of board actions based on where you end your turn on the board and therefore lots of strategy involved in where you want to go; Djin cards to give you abilities, a market to collect sets to gain points... it's a lot of stuff that somehow comes together to create a coherent game. It kid of ends up having a "something for everyone" feel to it in this way. And best of all, the 2-player game works VERY well with the double-turns, unlike some board games that weaken with fewer players.

Enjoyed this game a lot.  Really like the Mancala mechanic.

A little bothered by AP possibilities.  However, this game is "front-loaded" with AP, as the possibilities get fewer and fewer as the game progresses.  So the worst AP happens when you have the least idea of where your game is going to end up.  So perhaps that will mitigate the AP problem.  Need a few (dozen) more plays to decide.

I'm starting to think Bruno Cathala is one of my favorite designers. Cyclades, Abyss, Madame Ching, Shadows over Camelot are some of my favorite games, but Five Tribes is probably his zenith for me. Probably my favorite game from Bruno. Every game is completely different than the last, plus the mechanisms are easy to learn, but hard to master. 

My only gripe with the game is that it can be a little hard to teach, meaning it doesn't hit the table as often as I'd like. Learning how to do legal moves and use the different tribes can be taxing on some peoples brains but once they get it they get it. 

Update: May just have to get trade this one away for someone else to enjoy. I cannot for the life of me get this game to the table no matter what. Pretty typical nowadays as far no one likes game I enjoy. Guess I'll start playing solo games again...

Well at least this wasn't Kickstarter funded. It's actually quite refreshing to find a game that's been traditionally published these days. That said, this is a very chaotic, point salad type game. For starters there's no point in bidding to go second or third unless you're very good at predicting what others will do and the effect that will have on your options. Everything scores points, so it's just a question of picking an action and hoping you're scoring faster than everyone else. A good, middle tier game, but not one to take too seriously.

I liked this!  It's clever. It has a little bit of the mancala thing from Finca or Trajan, but with more options.  I can see the potential for AP, but we didn't really have that problem in our game. The djinns are interesting, although some of them seem clearly better than others.  I don't feel like I have a really deep understanding of the game yet, but I feel like I could certainly develop what I know about it through more plays. (1 play)

Played this at GenCon. I had seen pictures of it being played, and it looked really complicated. My wife doesn't typically like games that are really complex. So I was a little worried going into this one.

It looked like there was only one person explaining the game, and there were 4-5 tables playing. So we went ahead and read through the rules on our own and got started (our demo person never did come around to our table). There is a lot to cover initially. However, once you get going it really isn't very complicated to play, and my wife LOVED it. It was her favorite game at GenCon this year (that we played).

This game was as fun as I've anticipated. Really want to log more plays. There's something deliciously satisfying about the puzzley nature of the game. It's not a "match 3" puzzle game, but it gives me that same crunchy goodness as some of those PC games. The endless variety of set ups and multiple paths to victory really help it shine. The components are fun and chunky. The Djinn art is gorgeous. The only real downside I can think of is that it seemed to end just as I felt I was building steam. It might lend itself to back-to-back plays for this reason, as one game doesn't let you do nearly as much as you'd like by the time the clock winds down. But in this case maybe that's a good thing.

Awesome Euro game.  It is outstanding in its production value, but even more outstanding is Five Tribes' powerful intensity of player interaction.  Player interaction is often mild and sometimes absent in the Euro game genre; near the top of the genre's detractors' list of complaints.  With every move in Five Tribes, a player must carefully consider that his move is not opening up a big scoring opportunity for his opponents.  The mancala mechanic of picking up all the meeples in a space and deploying them in successive adjacent spaces and finally performing the action at the final space reminds me of my favorite game, Trajan.  Five Tribes is an extremely stimulating optimization puzzle shared on the same board with your opponents.  Five Tribes has just the right game length and has a delicious, crunchy, mental puzzle feel.  I almost left out the djinns, which can be summoned by players.  Djinns allow a player to break the rules or score extra points at the end of the game or collect extra money in the game.  The bidding for turn order mechanism works quite well also.  I find the mental challenge of maximizing the points yield of each move very stimulating and enjoyable.

Worker deplacement! Mancala mechanic. Easy to learn. There's way more strategy involved than it first lets on. On my first play through, it wasn't until half-way through the game when I realized that there's no real way to plan ahead.

A very neat resource collection game where you move meeple onto tiles to scoop up the final colour and take an action on the tile.  Similar flavour to Clans (for moving meeples) with an area control system you need to pursue or you will lose (don't get suckered into just one point gathering strategy or you will be slaughtered).  People complain about the slave cards, but it wouldn't matter what they were called as they simply represent zero points (except when you human sacrifice them to summon a demon!!)

The game is quite brilliant, however it is definitely not without some clear flaws.

My biggest problem with the game is that there isn't enough RNG in the game.  With some abstracts I'm happy for this - sometimes it is nice to really put the brain to work. My problem with Five Tribes is that the ever-changing puzzle in front of you is far too complex.  If you really, REALLY sit there and think, you can often eventually number-crunch a really good play.  In a 4 player game however - this is hugely problematic when 2/4 people are just there to have fun.

I am not s super AP prone person, but I find that in order to try to win, I have to put in at LEAST as much thought as the next AP heavy person, which sort of creates an AP arms race - which is to say it can spin out of control and break the flow of the game.

A game should have its own built-in mechanism to prevent this from happening - the responsibility should not be on the players, because it cheapens the experience.

That said - what is here is AMAZING hence the 9 (and my own selfish bias), but with the wrong group this game is barely worth the time it takes to set it up, and I can think of few games as guilty of this issue as Five Tribes is.

I very much appreciate the clever application of the mancala  mechanism in this game. It has real depth and meaningful choices. But the heavy tactical element invites a certain degree of analysis paralysis. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
With potentially 216 opening moves and possibly 1296 variations on those opening moves, the game facilitates analysis paralysis from the outset, and since the board state changes significantly after each players' turn it further encourages down-time as players have to re-evaluate their options creating a more-tactical-than-strategic experience which is then compounded by the bid for turn order mechanism at the start of each round. I like each of the ingredients of this game separately, but when combined they form something unsavory.

I could be convinced to play this game only as a two-player game in the future.

Nice idea, but a few fundamental problems:
- the game is hardly controllable (if at all)
- way WAY too much time spent on thinking how not to give a present to an opponent :-//
- weak/unbalanced djinns.  The game has just too few actions to make many djinns useful enough to bother with them at all (besides their VPs).  A serious designer’s mistake.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The poster child for modern mid-weight Euro. A couple pages of rules based around a single action with few exceptions. 

Five Tribes is undeniably a game about accounting for the best possible move on your turn. This makes it difficult to plan ahead and is murder with AP prone players, but results in a tight battle between equally skilled players with scores coming down to a couple points. Plays quickly, around 60 minutes with 4.

Bokkensprong 20/02/2015 met Pascal, Sander, Jukebox en ik. Woestijn met 5x6 tegels waarop initieel telkens drie mannetjes in drie kleuren. Elke kleur is een stam met bepaalde eigenschappen (wit: punten en handelswaarde, geel: 2 punten en bonus voor wie er meest heeft, rood: moordenaars die andere kleuren elimineren, blauw: punten voor blauwe tegels, groen: leveren groene kaartjes op die exponentieel punten opleveren). In je beurt neem je alle mannetjes van een bepaalde tegel en volg je daarmee een orthogonaal pad, waarbij je op elke tegel die je over moet een mannetje achterlaat. De kleur van je laatste mannetje moet gelijk zijn aan die van minstens een ander mannetje op je eindtegel. Die mannetjes neem je weg en de eigenschap van die kleur mag je nu gebruiken. Wordt de tegel daarmee leeg, dan mag je een kameel plaatsen op de tegel, die nu van jou wordt. Je mag ook nog de tegelactie uitvoeren, waardoor je kaarten kan krijgen (groene, slaven, geesten (dzjins)). Leuk systeem ook om de beurtvolgorde te bepalen (je kan betalen voor een betere startpositie). Tof, uitdagend spel met toch vrij eenvoudige regels. Niet voor twijfelaars. Geen tekst nodig in het spel, maar wel op de geheugensteunkaarten - helaas enkel in het Engels.

Really cool game. Probably more tactical than strategic but there is definitely room for some broad strategy. I haven't really seen any AP with this game, which is surprising since my group is generally on the AP heavy side of things. It reminds me a bit of a gamer's 7 Wonders somehow. The key I think to enjoying this game is to play a bit by feel, obviously it would be insane to count out every possible legal move and decide which one is best. Generally my perspective is to decide what I want out of a turn and then work backwards from there. So maybe I want some cards, I look for all the spots that let me buy cards and see how to best activate those spots, and I'd also look for spots where I could pick up green guys, etc. The genies are also really cool in that they give you special powers that help focus your play in certain directions. It's far from the deepest game in the world, but it's definitely a serious game and I definitely really enjoy playing it. I think it's the spatial aspect that I really enjoy, although it's unfortunate that outside of the two player game it's rare enough to have two turns in a row that you really can't use one turn to set up a second really strong turn. I imagine I'd love this at two players, unfortunately I rarely play two players.

Five Tribes is certainly a Euro game, but I understand how the chaotic nature of the game board makes it a game some don't enjoy.

For me, I keep wanting to play it again because the Mancala-like puzzle is addicting. It's one of the few games where I don't focus on the long-game but instead zero in on the best move each turn. Each turn is a satisfying experience and a chance to get better at finding the high-scoring patterns.

My only warning is to not play this with those prone to linger on finding the best move. The game can provide a plethora of choices (especially in the early game), catnip for the "analysis paralysis"-prone player.

Great game with 2, 3, or 4 players. Love the variable set up, and the auction for turn order is a great mechanism (for this game anyway).
Going for the merchandise works well (for me) for two players, as I was able to score over 100 points on merch alone.  With four players, it should be a mad dash to pick up as many yellow guys as possible.

Raised rating a bit due to the one player variant being something I'd actually do every once in a while.

Abstract tactical game. Im not sure about this one yet. But I do enjoy the puzzle of figuring out the best move on my turn. But I think that is the whole game. I guess the turn order bid is really where the game is played. Going to play more but will possibly trade away.

RATING: 6
Solid medium-weight euro.  Each tile starts with a pile of meeples.  Pick up a pile of meeples and move, dropping one meeple per tile.  When you run out of meeples, resolve the last tile.  The color of meeple determines the action.  There are various things to collect, tiles to claim, and even a way to attack.  Then points, you know.

RATING: 10
So yeah. This is a game where my rating could honestly go up just based on how much I enjoyed it on my first play. It improves upon the Mancala mechanic with the use of Meeples. I love the bidding to decide turn order as you can bluff someone into spending more than they want to go first based on what you see of the board. I'm really having a hard time with stating how much I enjoyed all the intricacies of the game and how much I can't wait to play this again. I also find that I don't care who I'm playing this game with which really makes a huge difference for me.

There are some nice ideas in the game, but it cannot really be taken seriously.

Like you can bid for the playing order, but practically only the first player can have any idea what he is bidding for. By the time the second/third player comes, the setup changes dramatically. This is also a problem, because players who bid the lowest can have much better options than the one who bid second.

It is also a problem, because it is an analysis paralysis game by default. But since it changes dramatically by one move, you cannot really use the other player's turn for your own plan.

Nor the tribes neither the Djinns seem to be balanced, but because of the chaos, you can't even imagine that someone would even consider a complete development circle. It is often solved by adding a bidding algorithm, but as I wrote that does not work either.

Still, I understand why it is popular, and because of its uniqueness I would play it again nevertheless.

RATING: 8
I am still trying to figure out how to play this game well.  There is a psuedo-manacala vibe to it as players move pieces to claim the benefits of certain meeples, but it is really an area control game with resource collection mixed in.  Another great production from Days of Wonder.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (October 2014)

By far the best Days of Wonder game for me. As usual from them, it is gorgeous, but this time they added some depth to match the pretty exterior. Still it is a light-medium weight game for me. Rules are easy to grasp and the playtime is reasonable.

The beginning of the game it is a lot harder because you have so many options, and you are trying to maximize your points without giving away easy plays for your opponents, but after some rounds, the rest of the game becomes much more obvious as there are fewer options each turn. I also really like that you have to give away VPs to decide the play order, that’s a neat mechanic BUT it seems to me that it is only relevant in the last half of the game. At the beginning there are lots of good options.

On the bad side, there can be lots of downtime, at the beginning because there are lots of options to assess and at the end because everyone is really trying to find good plays. Unintentional king making occurs very often in Five Tribes. The use of slaves offended some people in my game group (not me, I really don´t mind this in a game setting). I also dislike the luck inherent in the goods cards and the Djinns, some of them are very unbalanced BUT I’m not sure of this if this is an issue for me. 

Bottom line, it is an ok (mostly) tactical game. I don’t think I will buy it but for now I won’t say no to a game of Five Tribes. I have the feeling the game will go down in my personal ratings with more plays but it is the best DoW game I have ever played.

A lot of fun, very strategic, incredible "pick-up-and-deliver" mechanic that gives the player a special action (1 of 5) depending on what color meeple is reunited with other meeples of the same color when placed on the last tile.  The added strategy of navigating the markets, D'jinns and point multipliers (Palaces and Palm Trees) adds an additional layer of depth to the game. Great two player game.

Combines the 'seeding' mechanic from Mancala with the choices and rules of a Euro, resulting in a sweet but not too heavy game. In contrast to most Euros which become more complex as the game goes on, the amount of moves available dwindle, so it ends very abruptly and the Victory Points 'fruit salad' mean it's hard to know whether you're winning or not! A very fun process regardless and a unique game in my collection.

Crossing into the Land of 1001 Nights, your caravan arrives at the fabled Sultanate of Naqala. The old sultan just died and control of Naqala is up for grabs! The oracles foretold of strangers who would maneuver the Five Tribes to gain influence over the legendary city-state. Will you fulfill the prophecy?  Invoke the old Djinns, move the Tribes into position at the right time and the Sultanate may become yours!  Designed by Bruno Cathala, Five Tribes is a bit more of a "Gamers' Game" than Days of Wonder's standard fare.  The game builds on a long tradition of German games with wooden Maples in a unique twist on the Worker Placement game genre. While the rules are quite easy to learn and understand, implementing a winning strategy will take a calculated approach.  In this worker displacement game, you score by carefully maneuvering the Five Tribes of Maples over the tiles that make up the ancient city-state of the Sultanate of Naqala. You need to look ahead to determine what moves will not only position you to score well, but put your opponents at a disadvantage. It's when, how and where you dis-place the Five Tribes of Assassins, Elders, Builders, Merchants & Viziers that will determine your victory or failure!

RATING: 7
In Five Tribes, meeples of different colors are randomly distributed across an already randomly distributed grid of 6x5 tiles. A player's turn consists of simply picking up all of the meeples from one tile and dropping them, one by one, across a chain of tiles - and the last tile is required to already have a meeple of the color you are dropping. Each colored meeple represents and different action and you take the action of the last meeple you place by removing that and other meeples from that tile that are of the same color. In this way, the number of the meeples on the board diminishes every turn. If you clear out a tile, you have the option to place one of your camels on it which will score you the points on the tile at the end of the game.

In addition to the meeple action, each tile also has an action that you can optionally perform, so you are constantly balancing the meeple action you want plus the tile action that will most advantage you - while at the same time not setting up your opponents for an obviously killer move. The meeple and tile actions basically feed the many ways there are to score points in this game. When a player has placed all his camels or there are no more legal moves to make on the board, then the game ends. Then you break out the scoring pad and add up points into the hundreds.

The early game feels a little directionless. The possibilities are endless and there are many viable and great moves, which can feel a little pointless. As players start to collect things and preferences start to be defined, things get more interesting. I think what prevents me from scoring this higher is that there are so many ways to score and the points get so high, that it is well nigh impossible to tell how well you are doing, unless one player is really running away with it. It isn't secret end-game scoring, but in some ways it may as well be. The many possible moves could prove daunting for those who like to analyze choices to the nth degree, so you will want to be careful who you play this with. I really enjoyed my play, but was slightly disappointed as we went through the score pad, scoring all of the different possible avenues to points. I had the sense there were too many, and I might prefer if the game were a little more focused. It's a solid title, though, and in my opinion, Cathala's best.

Days of Wonder has done it again (as has Mr. Cathala).

This is a game that requires perhaps slightly more thought and in-depth tactics/strategies than the typical DoW game, but by no means is it inaccessible.

The modular board and meeple setup, brought together with sound gameplay elements and a production quality that is tops in the industry for art and design make Five Tribes one of, if not THE, best board game of 2014.  

Simply put, it is fun, exciting, thought provoking, and gorgeous to look upon.  

A real winner with staying power and room to go up in rating.

Really enjoyed Five Tribes. Love the spatial puzzle and use of the meeple. The rules aren't too complex to learn and teach. The component quality and artwork are great. I didn't really feel the theme shine through. There is a fair bit of AP looking at the board. You can plan your move a little in advance, but not that much, because the player ahead of you can change the board enough to create new opportunities or destroy your choices, so it's usually pointless.

Is Yamataï better than Five Tribes? I'll have to try it and see.

This was one of my favorite new to me games at Geekway. This has a nice Mancala-like mechanic of picking up meeples and dropping one per orthogonal space. The last one dropped needs to match the color of one or more pieces in that space. Pick all of that color up and take a special action based on the color. Then take a special action based on the space. If all the meeples are gone place your camel to own the space. There are many ways to score in the game including owning spaces, collection of one type of meeple, set collection of different resource cards, and buying various genies. The genies also grant special abilities. There were always many options to consider which kept it interesting. I think the game will have a lot of replayability.

I think days of wonder's deepest game. There might be too many decisions to make though. I'm fine playing haphazardly but a few people I played with took way too long. don't play with AP people.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The Mancala mechanism and the multi-facetted scoring dimensions create an AP heaven but the tactical decisions are challenging and worth the time. Only towards the end when the choices decrease, the game speeds up. I really like it but it's a very brainburning pleasure and not for everyone. The initial auction can be misleading some players into overpaying as it's not always better to be earlier in turn order and enough times it doesn't matter at all.

Note: End game conditions are translated wrong in the German rules. Game ends when one player doesn't have any legal move. In that case, game will end after this round even if another player puts back meeples and has a legal move again.

best game of 2014 in my opinion. I like it more than anyone in my gaming group... to bad:)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My first game I was AP prone, but after a couple more plays I'm liking the game quite a bit. Moving the meeples around the board offers for a lot of chances for big plays, but you always have to be careful you're not setting up the person after you for an even bigger one.

I do feel that making the tiles double sided, but identical on each side is a missed opportunity. I love the artwork, and the more I play the more I realize the thematic nature of the djinn. I look forward to subsequent plays.

After 5 plays, the game inspires too much AP. It may be because I haven't played super competitive since I've always been the teacher. Anyway, my brother hated it, and he really seemed like the target audience for this. It's not deep enough for me to take it seriously since I think the winning strategy is to always bid so you go after the person that makes the moves without thinking about who they are setting up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An outstanding meeple movement puzzle game, with a lot of solid mechanisms around it. I love just about everything about this game. The multiple paths to victory are all great, and none of them feel unbalanced. The 2-player variant is probably the best of its kind that I have ever seen. A very satisfying game that I'm always glad to play, especially with my wife.

We like this game a ton.  It is a mental workout for sure.  Super cool concept.  I have heard some people say that it does not play well as two player because you almost always end up with back to back plays and that this gives an advantage.  However, my husband and I do not have this issue.  I guess the money pincher parts of us tend to land us 50% of the time with back to back and 50% of the time every other when we bid on turn order, so our games are crazy interesting.

I'm not quite on the hype train of Five Tribes yet, but I've only played it as a two player game, which I hated the auction mechanic for.

It's a case where I think it's a very well designed game, but I'm not quite sure it's the type of game for me. I'd be willing to give it more plays before deciding if I'd want to own it or not.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I expected an innovative system based off Mancala, but the game really felt too much like another Euro (most recently Istanbul). The game just has too many things going for it that players with AP would be tempted to analyze every single action and this can really drag the game down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The concepts behind the movement and scoring are simple enough, but the strategy and tactics of doing it well is going to take some time to fully grasp.  There is more going on in the game than you see at first glance.  Warning: Not for the AP prone.

RATING: 9
While many fault Five Tribes as an AP prone game, I see it as a game that caters more towards those of us who are better at making adjustments on the fly and going with our gut.  You really do have to just go with your gut in this game and see if your intuition pays off.  There is a strategy here that is fulfilling in that there are a number of paths to victory.  I very much enjoy this in spite of the setup being somewhat hefty (for me).

It's okay. This game is wonderfully produced and some of the ideas and concepts are cool but it just fell very flat for me. There's really no way to plan ahead for your turn unless you bid first that round. The result is a game that lasts 3 or 4 times longer than it feels like it should. Disappointed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This was nicer than I expected, but the experience can only be nice with the right minded people. The game is a potential double AP trap. First you freeze with the auction and then you freeze with Mancala. I would walk out of the game if there was someone taking minutes to make a move. Besides the AP issue this is mechanically a very sound mix.

Solid game, innovative mancala-like mechanism, and every move has so much riding on it: the tile action, the meeple action, the possibility of control, and of course, what you leave behind. I love when one action triggers multiple bonuses. Add to that the Djinn powers, which I love, especially those which pay you when others do a specific action.

Wood-on-tiles with heavily abstracted spatial relationships and lots of ways to get points. Kind of dependent on everyone counting up scoring opportunities (and their interdependencies) for proper bidding, which also includes knowing which djinn are worth significantly more than their nominal values in the early game, and then re-counting as each action is taken. Even more computational with two since it seems you're planning double moves more often than not.

RATING: 7
I enjoy the system for moving/taking meeples about and taking actions there is a lot more strategy involved than would appear from the way the map is set up. Very boring and way to much downtime with more than 2 players. Rating is 7 for a 2 player game and 3.5 for any more than that.

Absolutely amazing game. Have played 3 rounds (3 players) the first time and couldn't wait to get back to it when I get more players. I love the amounts of decisions one get to make in this game. And the game seems quite balanced. I've played it 3 different styles (heavy control, heavy builders/viziers, heavy merchant/light control) in those 3 different games and each style played quite well. Perhaps the only nitpick is that some djinns tend to be very situational whereas others may seem overpowered. In one of the games, we also gotten to a point where noone seems to bother to get djinns because of how weak we perceived them to be. Perhaps a potentially way to house-rule this is to discard djinns in play after a couple of rounds or something.

But all in all, Five Tribes... Love it!!!

Despite the theme kinda being my theme I was never really attracted to the game. But with Yamatai being compared to it so often I decided to go back and give this one a shot first. And it's... decent. It's not bad, far from it. But not very exciting either. Especially not the end.
You can do fun stuf though. I like the Djinns and tend to spend (too much) attention to them to try and get some nice combo going.
I might be a bit too 'tame' with the turn bidding though.
Art is great.

Have only played 2p so far and that has a good mix o tactics and strategy. I'm not keen on trying 4p since that just seems too chaotic.

I have this rated as a 9 and that may continue to climb.

Strategy level 0. With 4 players all you do is wait for your opponents to even begin thinking about your turn. That's how much each move changes things on board. Then the more you study the board the more likely you will find a move with more points. AP madness. Would give it another go with 2.

Oh god I love this game. I have played it many times before I started tracking my games. The game just throws options at you and you feel like every move you find is better than the previous. You start with many options and as people play more options open up. Loops and assassinations are so crucial to victory. When you get to put 2 camels when you used assassins you feel so clever or when you get 20 coins for a move you made with builders you feel like the king of the world. But quickly you shake the feeling and start the next move that you make. There is a reason Days of Wonder releases 1 game a year and this one is my second most favorite game for that reason also.

2015-10-13 - 8.5 - Awesome, colorful game with a lot paths to victory. It's a little bit abstract but the great artwork makes it up. The game might be AP prone so it's not meant to be played with everyone.

2015-11-07 - 8,5 -> 9 - AAAAWEEESOOOME! I watched a review some time ago and I'm really surprised how much I like it.

2015-12-27 - 9->10 - This game is one of my favourites if not the favourite for now. I played with the expansion already, which adds more cool things although I know I would rate this game 10 even without the expansion. 
I'm not exactly sure what is it that makes this game 10 for me. Lot of interesting choices? Many valid ways to win? Dynamics? A lot of depth in 60 minutes? 
Anyway I can play it on every game night.

Fun game with great artwork and production values as can be expected from Days of Wonder.  I like the Djinn cards and their artwork as well as the resource gathering.  This is definitely a game where experienced players will have a huge advantage over beginners.  New players need to learn to see the patterns on the game board to make the best moves and avoid setting up the next player for a big move.  And this requires understanding all the various ways to score points.  Good game but not one that I feel I need to own.

Played this at Beyond the Board and then sat on it. I was one of the people not too keen on having slaves as a commodity in the game so I didn't get it.

Too many bells and whistles around the board here. The basic mancala system is nicely done, although it does seem to rely on players not overanalysing the order they drop the intervening pieces in too much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Didn't expect to like this game as much as I did. Needs more plays, but it's a very simple concept with so much variability. Each game is incredibly different based on the meeple layout. Would definitely not want to play with more than two players, as it can definitely become AP-prone. Wish the meeples were something more thematic however. But overall, a great, stream-lined strategy game.

The mancala mechanic makes this game feel really different to anything else we own.  I'm still getting to know the likely weight of all the possible strategies to score but my impression is good. It seems quite difficult to keep track of where you are versus your opponent(s) and djinns bought towards the end can cause quite a swing.  The Wilwit bonus card we got at the UKBGE seems to give too many points, at least in a 2 player game where each player ends up with quite a lot of djinns. (2.89)

A lovely and intriguing "points salad" Euro with very little luck involved. The bidding mechanic to determine turn order is fantastic, and the multiple paths to victory lead to interesting and unique game experiences. It can be a little intimidating to first learn since there are a lot of rules and interactions right up front, but once everyone gets the gist of things, the game moves at a steady clip. If you like Mancala (or good board games), you'll love this.

Five Tribes frustrates the hell out of me because my wife always wins. But I have so much fun playing that I keep coming back to the well. I have played it 2 and 3 (still looking forward to trying the solo variant soon) and prefer it at two. The strategy of bidding to 2 (and sometimes even 4) actions in a row is fun and having multiple actions in a round keeps me interested. 

Update 5/18/2016: played the solo variant and loved it. There is a lot to consider in every actions and it really allows you to set up some good moves.

The sort-of-Mancala base mechanic is clever, but the game moves way too slow and is very AP-prone. It feels that there are too many layers of not-so-interesting decisions that need to be optimised. Looks great, though, and the components are top notch.

What do I have to say about this game that hasn't been said already?  I walked by several tables of this at GenCon but never got the chance to play it.  I saw that my local game store had a couple of copies in.  Only about 30 minutes of talking to the shop owner about the game I wanted it, bit I didn't have the money to buy it right away.  The agony!  I went to the store yesterday, and that was the first thing I bought!

I have never come across a bad DOW game yet!

It feels nicely varied between plays.  Not too heavy but you'll still sit there for 2-3 minutes (at least) for each player's turn as they play out every move they can find in their head.  This can make games at 4 players pretty slow, but if you're willing to sit there and fiddle with your phone while you wait the game is still interesting.  Mancala movement is the primary mode of gameplay.  Having more than 4 meeples on a single tile can break the game pretty easily, so we quickly found it was best to avoid it at all costs.  Genies can break the game pretty easily, and fewer players nerfs the usefulness of the yellow tribe.

The mechanics of this game are great, but the game itself seems to bog down and require too much re-evaluation at any point in the game, given that every action in this game creates aftershocks that are then needed to be looked at. I would definitely shy away from playing this with anyone remotely AP prone. Planning a turn in this can be overly difficult. The one game I played of this had everyone looking at the table and finding the clear optimal play for everyone else. The game could go down in score for me if this continues to be the case, but I can't deny that the idea of the game is solid.

I put this on par, if not better than Abyss. Same designer, but where Abyss beats Five Tribes in Art and atmosphere, Abyss is somewhat more linear than Five Tribes. Five Tribes' art is nothing to pass over, it's the fact that a winning strategy can come out of nowhere in Five Tribes, where as Abyss is more obvious...

Bonus points for a non-static board as well, so the game intrigues every time you play...

Great components and couple of novel ideas, but Five Tribes is more of a puzzle solving contest than a game. Each players' actions change the board completely, so any long term planning is not needed and the game is almost 100% tactical (with a lot of opportunities for AP prone players to freeze the game).

Also, because the board changes so much between players turns the novel player order mechanism doesn't really work - you either want to go first because you spot a good opportunity, or if you didn't spot anything, then it doesn't really matter when your turn is as the board is going to change so much before your go anyways.

Five tribes is a game that uses the mancala rule.
It is done in a great way and I think it is one of the best family games of the last 5 years.
Production quality is great.

A fresh and original Euro, simple rules but deep. The mancala mechanism ties the different ways to score neatly together, so it doesn't feel like a VP salad at all. Not as much AP-inducing as I thought. The VP bids for turn order fit the game very, very nicely. Like I've seen in the comments here, if it really is so good 2 player, my rating might go even higher.

Five Tribes builds on a long tradition of German-style games that feature wooden meeples. Here, in a unique twist on the now-standard "worker placement" genre, the game begins with the meeples already in place – and players must cleverly maneuver them over the villages, markets, oases, and sacred places tiles that make up Naqala. How, when, and where you dis-place these Five Tribes of Assassins, Elders, Builders, Merchants, and Viziers determine your victory or failure.

I enjoyed the game Mancala back in the day as a kid. The gameplay seems simple, but each move has 4 layers to it:
What Tribe action do I want?
What board action do I want?
Is this the most beneficial move I can make?
What moves did I just set up for the other players?
This can cause some lag for players that calculate everything.

Its a shame there isn't a rule about clearing the market/Dijinns if no one wants what is available. We had a whole market full of Fakir/slaves and no one wanted to get on that. 

Still, great game and always fun to play. In my top 50

RATING: 8
In short: I liked it quite the first time I played and I liked it slightly more when played the second time. Yes, it can have problems when played with AP players – unless they also realize they should be playing intuitively in most of the turns. It’s colorful, and the mechanism is way more interesting and unusual than most Eurogames released in the past few years. I had no problem with some djinns being stronger than some other djinns. Also, while I don’t really like it when whatever you do you score points in a game, here it felt it just provided lots of space for creativity. All in all, it’s an enjoyable one, and while it's rather complex for a gateway, it does reeward non-gamer approach to the games.

Really nice, hefty pieces but the concept looks a lot better on paper than actual play.

A move consists of finding the most points for yourself while wrecking other moves for the next player. It essentially devolves into lots of staring at the table, screening basic math between each person. Lots of downtime here and not much fun.

The map doesn’t scale to player count so the more players the less you get to do (about the same number of moves regardless). With 3 players planning ahead gets pretty worthless and with 4 there’s not enough moves to work with the Djinn powers. Solo actually worked ok. I’ve not yet tried it one-on-one, which sure looks to be the sweet spot.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I enjoyed my first play and found it somewhat brain burny.  There were definitely moments of AP in the game for all involved.  Still, the whole thing with rules instruction took only 2 hours which would likely decrease with repeat play.  Rather painful when you bid higher than someone and they end up finding the better play...;-)  The mancala mechanic feels well implemented with quite a few different paths to victory.  One must be careful not to set up the player who follows you for a high score.  Components are high quality as usual in a DoW game.  Perhaps DoW is back in the market for me with this one - I haven't really enjoyed their lighter fare the last few years.

Ambientazione da 1000 e una notte.
Si devono muovere i meeple di varie tribu col meccanismo del mancala. Nel posto di arrivo si attivano i poteri delle tribu mosse e l'abilità della tessera di arrivo.
Si possono comprare e utilizzare i vari "Geni della Lampada".
Se ci si mette a pensare ad ogni possibile mossa il gioco genera immensa AP perchè ci sono sempre mille e una mossa disponibile. Va giocato spensierato e si resta nei 60-90 minuti di gioco in maniera leggera e dinamica.
A me piace molto, è un gioco studiatissimo con cui ho scoperto Bruno Cathala.

I did not care much for the difficulty of planning: the change in the number of meeples on the board can drastically change a plan. My problem with this is that it is hard to predict what the opponents want to play, so it is hard to plan what you will be able to play. Maybe this is remediated by the play order bidding, but still: when you are not early in the turn, it is hard to plan.

I liked the special powers of the djinns. They can be purchased relatively easily, with the right bidding for turn order. However, nothing is guaranteed, and I did not like the feeling of being denied a piece of a plan I had investigated in creating, when someone snatches the djinn I wanted.

I am also not a fan of the point salad: I have a hard time even starting to reason about the various ways of making points.

The setup is also quite long compared to the game.

Not bad, but Istanbul (played just before) feels so much cleaner and interesting (with more control).

Played it a bunch of times before receiving it as a gift from Days of Wonder and their masterful employee EricB (@DoW). This game is a really fun strategy game with a very unique mechanic that's not really like any game of its genre. Very rarely is this game not fun, and even though it signals an AP game it never feels like it suffers from it. Coming from someone who thinks a bit before his turns (not AP myself but I might have one turn where I think for a little bit longer than I usually do) this game played fast, and the people I play with have a tendency to not play fast. This is a good thing in my mind, as a game that requires as much strategy as this that plays as fast as it does is a well designed game.

Glad to have it in my collection now. Thanks to Asmodee NA, Days of Wonder, and of course EricB for this gift.

This very popular game has been played near me for a while, but for some reason I was never in any of those games. I finally played it and was pleasantly surprised; I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. I like a game that claims to have multiple paths to victory and actually does, and I thought the action selection mechanism was interestingly done. This could very well have been just a point salad mish-mash of mechanisms, but I think it comes together very well. Also, we played with the Artisans expansions, which seemed to integrate into the base game just fine.

I simply love Five Tribes! The theme is one my favorite's and the production is stunning. The different ways meeples score brings lots of distinct flavors. The randomness of the game setup makes it's replayability unlimited. Expansions make it even more strategic to play, but add length overall. I play this game mostly at 2 players only, but I would like to try more 3 players game and 4 players seems too much. AP is an issue though in this game and can add good amount of downtime in our playgroup. Solo variant is nice, but pretty difficult to win and requires too long of a set-up time to see regular plays.

Can't decide how I feel about this game. I guess my first thought when it comes to this game is "fiddly". It is a nice enough game, but it takes ages to set up, and it has a bunch of rules for a game that isn't very deep, it leads to crazy AP for some people. The fact it only goes to 4 players means you're usually going out of your way to play this game, and I just don't see myself pulling it out that often.

First impressions: Don't play this game if you have a lot of AP-prone people, as the huge amount of possible turn options in addition to the fact that the board state can change pretty dramatically from turn to turn makes this a nightmare for those people. This game has a pretty cool take on the mancala mechanic, where which colored meeple you set down as you weave your path, and also how you weave your path has subtle optimizations. Also, that the tiles themselves have actions adds an additional factor that you have to think about when making your move. 

My cons of this game are 1. the game is a bit too much of point salad without too much thematic backing (e.g. why do the yellow meeples score more points? Why can you put 5 buildings on one spot, and why do they only give points? Similarly the goods are basically just points), 2. I thought the djinn would play a more central role in the game but it is hard to get a ton of them unless you specifically dedicate yourself to do so, and only a few seem to have game-changing effects unless you completely dedicate yourself to utilizing their abilities, and 3. that there are more options in the beginning which gradually dwindles, when it would be better if there were more options later when everyone else knew what main point scoring mechanism they are pursuing.

Components-wise this game has a ton of large, chunky wooden pieces, and you really are getting your money's worth. The art on the djinn is fantastic although the art on the goods and the tiles are just ok.

EDIT: I've come to like this game less because outside of its mancala mechanism, it feels very point-salady/doesn't do a very good job of hiding the fact you are just doing various stuff for points. Probably has to do with the fact I've played more Euros too so it doesn't feel as unique.

I wish I could have rated this game higher...Love the premise of this game, and the fun innovation on a classic design!   As per Days of Wonder quality this is an amazingly produced game... I just wish that the female images were less scantily clad.  WHY ruin a perfectly amazing game with images that I don't want my pre-teen/teenage children viewing?  I am a professional artist, and I have a deep appreciation for figure drawing.  This unfortunately is not the time to be displaying one's gestural skills in my opinion ~ especially as this is marketed as a "Family Game".

Mancala on steroids, Five Tribes combines two things that I love: meeples and unlimited options. I like having an entire universe of possibilities in front of you and having to figure out the best one. I like being able to anticipate what other people are going to go for and preventing them from getting it. And I definitely love the flexibility of the Artisans in Six Tribes (Five Tribes plus Artisans). 

Biggest Pet Peeve: Calling it Five Tribes when the expansion adds on a Sixth.

This game was pretty boring to play.  I knew going into it that it wasn't going to be for me but I wanted to give it a chance.  I confirmed my suspicions. 

The main issue is you can't plan ahead. The board will most likely change before you are able to make your move.  You will have to do your full move analysis on your turn which means everyone will be waiting for you and you for them.  AP people beware!  In most games you can plan ahead and then execute your turn when it is time. In this game you have to do all the analysis during your turn.  This slow the game down and means that most of the game you are sitting around doing absolutely nothing because it is pointless to do any kind of analysis beforehand.

Also, it is extremely frustrating when you really want to land on a specific tile but none of the nearby tiles will work so that you have enough guys to land on it.  It just doesn't feel satisfying... especially since you burn a lot of analysis/brain power on trying to figure out how you can possibly activate that square and none of the combinations work.  I don't have AP but I certainly felt like I did while playing this game.  People in our group were frequently apologizing because this game turns everyone into an AP player and we all felt bad for taking so long on our turns because of the mechanics in this game. 

100% tactical game.  Strategy does not pay off.  Blehhhhh.....

Wow. So they went and made super-thinky mancala with a ton of ways to gain points. I like it.

Every game feels different, and AP aside, is generally fast and interesting. I never imagined that DoW would make a true gamer's game, but here it is.

J'ai tardé à m'y lancer, car les explications de l'auteur en vidéo m'avait donné l'impression d'une grosse usine à gaz. Il se trouve que le jeu est plutôt simple dans sa mécanique et que les multiples façons de marquer des points n'en font pas réellement une usine à gaz (du fait que ça reste globalement simple). Je regrette juste que l'interaction ne soit pas plus prononcée (moins subtile) entre les joueurs. J'ai également beaucoup apprécié le côté opportuniste du jeu, qui m'a rappelé un petit peu "Euphrat & Tigris". Bruno Cathala est décidément toujours un auteur à suivre de très très près.

Days of Wonder "gamers game" but has a very intuitive feel once you start play.  You pick up meeples and "mandala style" drop them one at a time in other spaces.  You place a same colored meeple in another space and that ability activates.  You then resolve the space as well.  If it is the last meeple of that color, you claim the space.  

There are cards with special abilities and many different paths to victory.  It is a very good game and I really liked it. 

Very AP prone players ought to stay away.  It will run long with a lot of AP.

Some good mechanics wrapped together. I love how random the setup is. It's ratio of complexity to strategy is weighted a bit much towards the former which makes it harder to teach to new players than I would like.  Also, is a bit too abstract with little long term planning.

Auf dem Spielplan sind viele Orte zu finden. Dort befinden sich anfangs zufällig platzierte Spielfiguren aus fünf verschiedenen Farben – den Five Tribes. Ist ein Spieler am Zug, nimmt er alle Spielfiguren von einem Ort und verteilt sie neu. Die letzte Figur darf nur auf einem Feld platziert werden, auf dem bereits wenigstens eine Figur in der entsprechenden Farbe steht. 
Für den Spieler entscheidend sind die Farbe der letzten Figur und das Zielfeld. Denn beides bestimmt nun die eigentlichen Aktionsmöglichkeiten.
Nun entfernt der Spieler alle Spielfiguren auf dem Zielfeld in der entsprechenden Farbe der zuletzt gesetzten Figur und nutzt deren Vorteile für sich.

Filled with wonderfully interesting choices each turn.  You're attempting to maximize points and be sure that you don't leave a big opening for your opponent.  Turns can be slow as the board will potentially shift before your turn, perhaps agree to using a turn timer with your friends if that's problematic.

Great game with lots of strategy - the board is comprised of 25 unique tiles which are place in a 5 by 5 random grid which already makes for variety. each tile starts with an assortment of different colored meeples. your turn is to pick a tile then pick up all meeples on that tile and then you move by dropping off a meeple to an adjacent tile and keep going (no doubling back) till you have no meeples to drop. you get the action on the last tile you drop and a bonus if you can clear the tile (droping a meeple and there is only 1 color of meeples on that tile)
haven't played this enuff - its a definite keeper

I'm not sure what it is about this game, but while it's unique, aesthetically pleasing, and plays fairly quickly, it never provides the fun the way I expect it to.  After playing it each time I just say to myself, "Yep, we played it," while not really basking in the afterglow of what should have been a great game.  

This game is easy to pick up and hard to master.  It may be impossible to master because each turn is so dependent on what you opponents leave you with.

Once you gain an understanding of the various strategies, it's worth a few plays a year.  There may not be enough variation to keep it from feeling samey, if you plan to keep it in regular rotation.

There is so much depth of strategy to this game! It's pretty easy to get lost in all the paths you can take and like any good game, it's easy for others to ruin your strategy during their move.

Las diferentes maneras de ganar son lo que más me gusta del juego. Las mecánicas son simples y las fases de activación dan mucho qué pensar durante tu turno. Debido a esto puede que haya mucho tiempo perdido entre turnos y que no tengas mucho qué hacer mientras no te vaya, pues es muy posible que alguien mueva el tablero y no puedas hacer lo que tenías planeado. 

Conforme los jugadores conocen más las reglas y el juego, el tiempo entre turnos disminuye considerablemente.

The mancala like mechanic is cool but the gameplay is overly chaotic. Everyone changes quite a bit on their turn to the point that you can hardly plan much and just end up doing the most points move on your turn. Bidding is complicated and doesn't fit the game well and drags it down. The end is very anticlimactic with doing 5 minutes of adding scores and seeing who scored more..

IMHO one of the best 2p games ever made.
This game deserves a 9,9 as a 2p game while it doesn't even reach a 6 if you play it as a 4p.
Not only because of the inevitable analysis-paralysis that will leave you with enough time to smoke a joint in between players' turns but because you can't even try to plan ahead since the board state will change a lot before you'll play again.

As a 2p game it is a whole different game, which requires you to play tactically in order to adapt to your opponent's strategy while trying to force your own.

Like Mancalla, you pick up colored meeples, and drop them off one by one, attempting to end on a tile with only one color remaining. By doing so you gain control of the tile and its points. Each tile also give bonus which allow you to buy goods for vp, jinn for powers, or add structures to the tile for more vp.

Starts off with a riot of coloured meeples and a host of possible actions.

I already played it dozens of times  (as play tester). Very interesting mechanism of displacing meeples on the board to execute actions. Plenty of possible strategies which are driven by the "biding" system to determine  player order for the  turn.
A lot of interaction is possible between players, when you lay the meeple you could open or close next move for opponents.

Awesome in a box. Such a cool game. The components, the art, the theme, the play time, the decisions, the insert, the mancala...it's just so cool! I can see why Five Tribes was a smash hit this year. It plays really well with 2, despite Richard Ham's complaints. I will say that 60 minutes is probably not feasible for this game, even with 2, unless you have several games under your belt. Expect 90 minutes with 2 your first couple plays (120 minutes with 4). There are a lot of decisions in this game, and they don't usually appear as obvious. My wife had some crazy AP going on when we played. To be honest, that is my only complaint. If you notice any AP in your game group, it will certainly manifest here. If not for the AP, this game might be a 10 or close to it. As it stands, it's still quite excellent. 

Update 1/31/15: 

Erin and I played again tonight. It ended quite differently, to my dismay. With the help of a useful Djinn card, she burned through her camels crazy fast, and ended the game abruptly. I was only halfway into my strategy when she said "okay, it's over." To be honest, I was pretty upset by it, considering I had a pretty good synergy going. On the other hand, I liked how the game ended so differently. There's a lot going on here, and it seems clear so far, that this is just a great game!

I was concerned with the Analysis Paralysis, but after playing it it's actually not that bad. There's just too many potential choices to be able to math out each one, just accept that you don't have the time or patience to do so. Just pick one you like and roll with it. I love the asymmetrical sandbox gameplay, you're not forced into any particular action, you can just choose whatever you like to do or focus on. And the worker displacement mechanic is incredible.

There are a ton of tough choices in this game and there are so many things one can do on a turn. The game works in a bit of reverse order in that you have way more options in the beginning of the game than in the end, but the choices at the end have a more meaningful impact. I like that flow.

It's another solid medium euro from Days of Wonder. From heavier side like the ones they've put out last couple of years (Relic Runners, Cargo Noir..). But sadly it's still not a hit like they used to make.. I think biggest problems with this one are that when you become good with the mancala mechanic it will be very chess-like (ok, not quite, there' good randomness too). Second problem relates to first one and it's that Five Tribes is pretty abstract and dry game. I prefer Trajan mancala to this one, and when even Stefan Feld game is more FUN than DoW game, something is wrong! Still, the components are very high quality, auction mechanic is nice addition for interaction and like I said it's a solid game. It's better than average euros, but from DoW I expect more! 

update: I've come to like this bit more. This game invites you to take itself too seriously, and I never would've thought, but I was the one to fall to that trap. When you let go a little (don't think of every consequence of your actions) and stop trying too hard, it can be a fun game. 7->8

2-Player Comment:
* There's nice 2p variant in the box where you use 2x betting tokens each. It's a nice touch from DoW. 2p game is bit more hardcore than 3-4, but works very well.

Rated with Artisans expansion, improves replayability but makes it a bit longer and more random, and Whims, which adds a new depth without making it much longer.

Don't have much experience with the mancala mechanic, but I enjoyed it a lot in this game. Lots of ways to get points, and always interesting to see which is the best path available. 

I wouldn't say the slave cards bother me a lot , but I do wonder why they had to be included. When we play, we talk about freeing the slaves when using these cards, like some have suggested here on BGG. 

The concern for "AP" is there, and the ability to plan ahead is limited by the ever-changing board. But my group seems to be able to keep each game of this moving without too much delay. And I do think you stay engaged during other players' turns, to see what might open upon the board.

I've heard the criticism that the end can be anti-climatic, where there are only a few legal moves to make, so the group walks each player through what is available to him, but I myself don't find this a huge issue.

RATING: 8
Excellent tactical brain burning Eurogame. Rather than planning far ahead, you need to be able to adapt quickly to changing board layouts, and that makes it quite a bit different from the other Eurogames I play. I find it more strategic at 2 players, and consequently quite enjoy it that way, but it's a solid medium-light thinky game at any player count.

I like this game, it has a lot of interesting things going on...the only thing that drives me crazy is the AP that some players may experience when planning out their meeple placement. 

*Update* We have noticed a huge slowdown in the amount of play that this game receives. Probably because of the set up time versus gameplay time. Also, I would question whether or not this game is actually good...or if people just got excited over the controversy of "Slave cards".

As a cheap alternative: Play Mancala.

I love the "Mancala" core mechanic of this game, with thoughtful strategy regarding where you want your last meeple to land (are there any singles in sight to assassinate and claim two territories?) and how valuable the First Turn marker is to you in the next round.  I've played with my core gaming group, with my work group (who gravitate more towards gateway games), and at the local Beers & Board Games night.  It was a hit in all of the groups.  Very unique game play compared to anything else on the market.  I can't get enough of it!  Also, although I haven't tried it yet, I believe the 2 player variant would be just as much fun as having 3 or 4 players.

Loved our 4P game at Essen, especially my GF. Didn't quite feel as good on our first 2P at home so the rating might still drop a little. AP was acceptable, although we're AP prone players. Amazingly produced.

Upgraded to 8.5 after a few more plays. Good with two, better with more. The possibilty to have two turns in a row in a 2p game (and setting up your second turn) drastically changes the dynamic of the game.

RATING: 9
I don't think of this as a point salad, necessarily, because you can win by getting points from each category or by specializing.

Not a point salad - I won my last game without getting a single card and with only three camels on the board. I had three Djinns that paid off huge. One doubled my only builder move of the game, one boosted my viziers to 3 points each (of which I had a plurality), and one allowed me to get free Djinns (got this one first). So, on every turn but one I went for yellows and whites.

Point salad - In the previous game, I was middling in each category and scraped by with a win. I had 7 unique cards, took second place in viziers, made a couple of strong building moves, had five camels out, and had two merely okay Djinns. I didn't bid high at all in this game, so essentially I won because my points per turn were consistently solid even though I never made a particularly big move.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun and tactical, this game is heavily oriented towards seeing and taking the best move possible. Turn bidding is kind of linear though and sometimes this game feels like it could be mathed out for each turn. Loses value each time I play it.

RATING: 3
11/25/14 Played a four-player game in 65 minutes. 
The vague "1001 Nights" theme made no sense to me at all. Apparently each of the five meeple colors was a tribe. Though I have no idea how there can be whole tribes of Viziers (yellow meeples) or Elders (white meeples). So three minutes into the explanation I knew I had a turkey on my hands, and... it just got worse. The Djinn cards - almost every one had hard to decipher icons on them. So every time a new one was revealed I had to ask, "What does that mean?" After a while I just quit asking. I no longer cared what happened in this game; I just wanted it to be over. I stopped agonizing over my turns after about the fourth one and just did any old thing that was legal the rest of the game, to make to game take as little time as possible. I knew I'd lose and I didn't care. I'd scoop up a handful of meeples and spread them over the board, not caring if they made me any points or not.  
Five tribes is indeed a "point salad" type game with what seems like random game mechanics bolted together in a miasma of arbitrary rules. The phrase "the theme is pasted on" is raised to new heights here. The *huge* potential for analysis paralysis is only superceded by the amount of chaos, as planning ahead is virtually impossible. 
Five Tribes was a total waste of time, that I hope to never see again.

Mancala with special abilities and a grid! The shared board probably becomes quite a bit more meaningful when you really start to get the game, but for the first few plays you (I, atleast) are sort of forced to consider your own position first and foremost. Every turn feels very much like its own puzzle - though especially with the Djinns you sometimes play for a long time investment.

I like more direct screwage, and while this one can bring it - I think it takes a bit too much to get there as compared to something like Patchwork - thus this feels like a bit like Kingdom Builder except there I feel that you have more of a "strategy" to play towards. Anyway, this is a fun puzzle, the heuristics for parsing the board state are tricky but once you realize that depending on odd or even number of meeples from the origin tile you can ignore half the tiles.

A good game!

My favourite Euro type game. Great artwork and components. Expansion adds a lot of new options to the game and is one that integrates well into the base game. 

The bidding round to determine turn order is also interesting as you want first turn to get the best possible move but also don't want to spend too many of your victory points doing so.

This is probably the best Euro I have played. Unlike most Euros, Five Tribes has variable strategies that you can pursue, and no one strategy is particularly better than the other and there is no "optimal route" for you to min max out. Further, each move every player takes changes your options dynamically, making it difficult to do that elusive "best play" that characterizes the winning strategies of most Euros. The one strategy that may be strongest is a Blue money strategy, but it's hard to setup and easy to block if your opponent knows what he is doing, or he can take it from you himself! So it really works out well.

It also helps that the game plays like Sungka, which is a simple game from my childhood. And I love the theme -- this game promotes slavery, human sacrifice, murder, coup d'etas and demon worship. How awesome is that?? The only Euro I have ever rated a 9.

Well I wanted to like this one, but its the biggest box with a lot of stuff in it for just a huge tactical game. 
The problem is that this is the Paradise for AP. Lets think about bidding. "Oh well I bid 3". And immediately all the players AP starts again "Why the heck is he bidding 3? Have I missed something? Is there a much better move". Even in a 2 player game this is annoying.
This is a great example for an APP and not for a big boardgame. Forgot that the rulebook could be much better

Pretty much exactly what I expected. I enjoy the ingredients of this point salad. The djinn cards are just the right level of super power. But my favorite part is probably the game's biggest downfall: the puzzly action selection mechanism. I enjoy decisions that have multiple ramifications and tradeoffs. A single move here can be motivated by one or more of: the tile action, tile control, the tribal action, opportunity removal, setting up future moves (risky), plus compounding any of the above with bonus scoring/benefits. Unfortunately with the combinatorial explosion of possible moves, players can really get bogged down in finding the optimal move, then deciding between equivalent moves based on which hurts your opponents most, then ensuring you aren't setting someone else up. And planning ahead is difficult because so much changes between turns. Even if the move you have your eye on is still there when your turn comes around, maybe a better one has surfaced? Better check. Personally I'm not willing to put more than 20s into a play which can have a detrimental effect on my score, which is fine, but likely also sets up moves for whoever follows a la Puerto Rico. This is further compounded because the player that follows likely paid less than I did for the opportunity. This doesn't kill the fun for me, but I can see players being incompatible when it comes to this game: some play too slow, some play too "randomly," whatever. I enjoy this one but I'll be picky who I play with and I don't need to own it. But it does earn the distinction of my favorite Cathala game!

UPDATE: Abyss has taken the "favorite Cathala" prize. Further, I've lost interest in playing this game again. The AP, the puzzle, taking what's there rather than what you want, it's just not fun after the novelty of the puzzle wears off.

It's hard to read the board (The camels don't help) which makes it really hard to evaluate how important turn order is and what you should be doing.

Sold it after playing it once. Nice individual components, but for me the overal style was a strange mix. I didn't like the look of the tiles to be honest. The game seemed to take forever since everybody was trying to optimise their pointa every turn. Thinking ahead is hard since the board changes every time. Betting for turn order seems a bit of a gamble because of that. Original game, but traded it in a math trade for castles of mad king ludwig.

It can be rather hard to see what is going on on the board, and esp. the first few games will be won by those who can actually spot the options.

Update: decent fun, but oh boy so mind numbingy abstract...

Furthermore, certain cards (genies), and strategies are considerably stronger than others.

Such a fun neat concept. best with 2 or 4. Meeple (worker) Displacement. Many choices that get fewer as the game goes on, good planning that can be done but easily unraveled by an opponent. Good player interaction.

Original, yet simple mechanics. Lots to think about in a very pretty package.

The expansion adds more to the game without necessarily increasing its length; with more tiles on the board, a new tribe to play with, and new choices to make. Rather than adding more of the same, we have a bigger, fresher game. It didn't need an expansion, but it's nice to have the option.

Demo at Spiel - cool Euro game with a lot of meeples. For me the best game I've played at the fair. solid mechanisms, random setup, interesting decisions. I bought the game afterwards (price at the fair was quite steep) and I test played it with my wife and we both like it a lot. OK, it can last forever if you play with AP-prone players but the worker displacement is really very original. I can understand that it is not everyone's cup of tea though.

Five Tribes is first an excellent GAME before anything else. Though I do think that it pulls you into the theme well, I love the mechanics of this game above everything else. I really like how it gives players several ways to score points at the end of the game. I also love when games give you the ability to spend VP's (in this game's case, money), for an investment in being able to score much larger points (bidding for turn order to get that one AWESOME move). Now, I will admit that this game definitely favors the player that knows the game's cadence above a player that is playing for the first time, but there are very few games I know of that bring newbies in the same level as experienced players--especially games with this amount of depth. Five Tribes truly shines, in my opinion, in all categories of awesome.

The mancala mechanism represents an exciting new mechanic that works well with a pretty straightforward scoring system - seems like doing what is best for your scoring strategy, rather than just taking the best move on the board is an important part of maturing one's approach to the game.  Setting up future turns (both your own and your opponents) also seems important.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.3
Five Tribes is a beautifully produced mancala game.  It's a fast-paced abstract game with a very broad decision space.  I think that after the first few turns, you should hit on a strategic focus that guides the rest of your game.  You then maximally exploit that strategy each turn while limiting your opponent's ability to do the same.  It's a great blending of strategy and tactics.

One of the tricky things is that no strategy is so dominant that you can ignore everything else while pursuing it.  You need to be best in two or three point-scoring categories and close in the others.  This means you need to watch what's happening very closely and make sure you are not falling too far behind in any category. If you are: you need to find a way to catch up in that category.  This is an ever-present tension in the game. You find yourself feeling good about your game with regards to viziers until you realize that you have completely ignored the resource market & you think your opponent might have a set of 9 different resources!

The main idea is ok - manqala can't go wrong. Overall production is very good, sturdy wooden pieces plus solid cardboard tiles, great pastel colours, okay cardboard money and a little thin djinn and market cards but that's ok.

Now, the theme is pasted in. Yup there is the artwork, but change the whole game to ancient rome or whatever and it wont change a bit.

There is also a controvery about Slave cards - I was suspicious too, but I must admit, when you're playing you don't feel it so much unless you're very sensitive to the subject.

A good game, very abstract, with some holes in the rules: if I'm 4th and all 3 zero-spots have been occupied, still I have no money but I'm required to occupy the 1 cost spot...what can I do? The Author said that this never happened in his test. To me this is not an answer.

Szuper játék! Gyönyörű kivitel, egyszerű szabályok (amik bár elsőre bonyolultabbnak tűnnek), és gyors játékmenet. Utóbbi persze csak akkor, ha intuitívan játszunk, szerintem máshogy nem szabad. Ha itt mindent kimatekoznánk, holnapig mellette ülnénk. Persze halkan jegyzem meg, még nem nyertem, de valószínű csak rossz stratégiát választottam.. :P
Egyelőre egyébként a kereskedelem nagyon fontosnak tűnik (vagy olyan volt a leosztás).
Mindenképpen szeretnék még játszani vele egy párat, más játékosokkal is. Ha kellőképpen megkedvelem, és elszállnak az AP-vel kapcsolatos félelmeim, akkor muszáj lesz beruháznom erre is..

Egyelőre beigazolódni látszik, hogy a kereskedés jó stratégia. Legutóbb egyértelműen arra mentem, meg is nyertem simán a partit.. Kár érte, remélem valaki rácáfol egyszer erre!

RATING: 5
A lighter abstract euro game where players pick up small groups of meeples from a tile and move them around the board, hoping to end up on another tile that gives them certain benefits. I like the puzzle, but it can be blindingly AP inducing if players have a tendency to try and calculate out the most optimal moves. I like this one best at 2p or 3p... at 4p the board gets soaked up quickly and inter-turn changes to the board situation can be frustrating.

After one play of this Mancala style meeple placement game at Essen Spiel 2014 I am convinced it is a keeper as I have nothing like it in my collection. The board will be different very time and the special cards give some real depth in the short one hour play time.
A second play has confirmed that this is really a fantastic game with multiple paths to victory. My worries over AP have been unfounded as it completes in under an hour even with new players.
The more I play this game the more I like it. Rating increased.
With the artisans expansion the game gets even better. rating increased again.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

This is not a strategic game. 

It is an incredibly tactical game. 

This distinction is what usually causes people to either sink or swim in this game. Each turn should be about generating the most points or setting up a future turn to get lots of points. Long term strategies will fall apart, as will picking over leftover points. 

The bidding mechanism is also incredibly important gauge properly about when it's worth it to use VPs to gain even more VPs.

The most over-hyped game of 2014. Disjointed mechanics, almost no theme whatsoever, arbitrary auctions, and too much randomness between turns are just a few of the issues this game has.

Surprisingly simple but deep game. Grab workers from one tile and drop them on adjacent tiles until you end up on the tile that is most profitable. There are many different paths to earn victory points but they are all fairly easy to evaluate so the tactical decision never turns into analysis paralysis. Claim tiles, develop tiles, trade goods, acquire djinns or perhaps assassin someone - each decision is yours and each decision is fun!

Update: Sold because although the worker displacement mechanism is unique, the chaos and randomness makes strategy and bidding for turn order pointless.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Lots of terrific ideas and strategic concepts, but the game-ending limitations - placing all one's camels or having no legal Meeple moves left are the endgame conditions, and they get met really, really quickly - make it hard to pick and play out a strategy before it's over, and then setup takes a good fifteen minutes. Also beware of the steep learning curve. Mastery makes the game much more fun, but the first two rounds are pretty tortuous.

This would be more cool for the strategy-crafters with some house rules eliminating time-consuming turn elements (like turn-order bidding), allowing more turnover of djinni selection, and creating conditions (besides the one djinn with this power) in which players not only can, but must place more Meeples on the board.

Great game, as long as everyone plays similarly.  Analysis paralysis could make this game AWFUL; you have to be able to quickly find a decent move and then just make it.

A very tactical game. every turn you are trying to move meeples in different ways to gain points in different ways. There can be a lot of things to consider - the way in which you move your meeples will subsequently affect the following players' decision. 

On one hand the game is easy to teach with lots of player interaction, on other hand it is very chaotic at times. Very often the board state will be completely changed if you are last in turn order.

RATING: 7.5
Based on the Tales of 1001 nights, this game designed by Bruno Cathala has a 6 by 5 set of tiles seeded with three meeples each on the tiles. There are five different colors of meeples. Players then move the meeples, mancala style. For instance, if there are 3 meeples on a tile, you have to move 3 hexes, dropping off a meeple at each hex. Where you end your move, there must be a matching colored meeple to the last meeple, and you get to remove those meeples: Yellow meeples count for majority scoring, while meeples allow you to purchase bonus cards call Djinns, green meeples allow you to collect cards for set collecting VPS, red meeples allow you to assasinate other meeples and blue meeples score for adjacent blue numbers as well. In addition, each tile has a special ability (buy cards, buy Djinns, place palace/tree) that you execute when you finish your turn.

Each turn, you also bid for turn order on a fixed track, so you can always bid $0 if you do not wish to spend VPs. 

This is a really engaging game. It can get very complex, since this game is more about not leaving behind valuable points after your turn, yet there are a few tactical possibilities. This could be Cathala's best game and I'm looking forward to more plays. I keep thinking about what I want to do next game.

I've only had the chance to play a couple of times but I think I love this game. It felt unlike anything I've played before. 

I've heard people complain that it can give people a case of Analysis Paralysis, however I felt that it gets over that by overwhelming the player with so many options, particularly at the start, that it's clear that no effective analysis can be achieved within a reasonable time, so you just have to pretty much wing it. That feeling of winging it, of trying to navigate through the possibility space on instinct, felt exactly right for me. That does mean that the game only works if no-one takes it seriously enough to try and play perfectly, but when you play with the right people it works wonderfully.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
I like the look and feel of this as a euro even though I wish the board looked somehow less abstracted. The abundance of meeples and the ease of set up despite their sheer number is a huge plus. This game seems like a good point salad game that will have a lot of replayability and appeal to Euro gamers especially or those in that mood. I like the different types of meeples though I do really wish each different colored meeple had a different shape to reflect its occupation. That really would have took away some abstraction and improved the feel of the game. The overall system, mechanics, and strategy are strong and decisive. The game uses a lot of future thinking/visualization and spacial reasoning: two things I don't excel at so those could hurt my feeling towards the game. This is definitely a game I would enjoy playing  a game and feel that like 7 wonders, it likely has an enjoyment curb (not a learning curb but it takes a few games before it gets really fun--this is common with non-light euros I think)

This is not one I would own but would enjoy playing and recommend to those who like a good euro game. It's possible it was over hyped but that's hardly a new phenomenon for any time of new thing that a lot of people like.

One thing I don't like is that because the board will be slightly tweaked right before your turn (the last player will alter the board a little changing your options) you therefore have to do all your decision making on your turn and can only do SOME planning on other people's turns. And because the game is all about future thinking and planning multiple turns ahead in a complex interactive system, it can lend itself to analysis paralysis in a way that is similar to chess and isn't terribly exciting. The slower you take your turn and the more sluggishly you play, the better you'll probably do. I like it when games have some mitigating factors that take away incentive to really drag out your turn and this game lacks it.

Despite that critique, I think it's an excellent and awesome game and as long you don't mind AP (analysis paralysis) or you're playing with players who are not prone to it, it should be fine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game is a great change of pace because instead of making a long term plan early in the game and executing it as well as possible you are forced to constantly just take the best move available, if you can find it. Bidding victory points for player order is a great mechanism. Can move slowly because the changing board makes it difficult to think out your move before your turn but the game still plays relatively quickly (a little more than an hour for four players is typical in my experience) with two distinct conditions for ending the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Not a game for AP prone or impatient players. Every turn provides a great puzzle to figure out. It may frustrate some but I really enjoy. I also really like the two play rules. Setting up huge moves during the auction provides some very intersting strategic decisions since you have to spend victory points to make it happen.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Visually stunning and plays easily enough, but with a special mechanism that makes it a compelling play.
A modular board means each game will play differently, and many tiles provide some sort of useful bonus when activated.  Where this truly differs from most other games is that a trail of pieces is dropped onto each tile in turn, with only the final tile mattering to you in your immediate turn - but the effects can be felt for many more turns afterwards.

An extremely variable set-up (there are randomized tiles, meeples, genies, and cards) ensures that no two games of this will likely play the same. The bidding mechanism *seems* intelligently designed, because it will allow players to weigh their potential gains versus potential costs. What's curious about it, though, is that the board can radically change from one player's move to the next, so a player who pays for 2nd place might not have the options they expected available. It will take more plays to see how impactful this element of the design can be. That aside, this is a clever, subtly innovative game that seems mind-boggling at first and then like second nature within a play or two.

Five Tribes is a contender for my top 10. While acknowledging the randomness of the board lay out every turn, the actions are always fun and intriguing. I have found the random board set up each turn hurts your strategy very little. With enough location on the board and enough colored meeples, I have found if you look hard enough you can find the move you need. I have enjoyed this game every time I have played it, and I have walked away wanting to play again.

Each game resets itself automatically and the game is a great piece of gamedesign imo. It's hard to reject a game of 5 tribes because it plays so smooth.

If the game keeps pace than it is in my top 10 games ever, but if there is AP during play it sinks the fun. I like to push play to making moves and I think I woud like this game with a timer. However my plays so far have been very fun and mostly on pace.

RATING: 7.5
I like it quite a bit, but many of the qualities I view as strengths could also be construed as weaknesses.

Nice mid-weight game that has a good amount of things happening at any one time, but isn't hard to explain for new players. However, the game sits at a slightly awkward spot where I think it's a bit too complex for new gamers, but not quite heavy enough for the more experience people in my circles.

I enjoy the feeling of picking up and dropping meeples across the board, and how that movement constantly changes the options available so that you need to stay flexible in pursuing your goals. However, that same movement makes it hard to plan ahead because a meeple dropped in the wrong spot will ruin any plans you've made while waiting for your turn to come around.

On one hand: wow, those combos. But at the same time: wow, that analysis paralysis. The start of this game, staring at the board and searching for potential moves, is one of the most overwhelming experiences in any game I own. But it's a fascinating game that I find super satisfying, and I like it a great deal.

RATING: 7
Typical of Days of Wonder productions, Five Tribes has beautiful artwork, good components, a great box insert, and easy-to-understand gameplay.

Unfortunately, despite the relative simplicity its of play, turns involve processing a lot of variables, so FT suffers from a high rate of analysis paralysis. Also, endgame scoring involves a points tally that runs high, meaning it will most likely require a calculator to compute.

A good game, but too much waiting, both for turns and endgame scoring, was a deal breaker for me.

Mancala?  What the heck IS Mancala?  Pick up everyone at the square you are in, and drop one in each square orthogonal to yours until you land at a square you want to be THAT HAS A WORKER OF THE SAME COLOR AS ONE IN YOUR HAND.

Depending on that color, you get to do an ability.  

I did not enjoy this game with four players, the board just changes drastically from turn to turn and you don't feel like there is any real strategy in finding a combination, you just look at the board state when it IS your turn, and hope there is something good/left for you.

I thought this game SHINED in two player.  This way you can set yourself up for TWO turns in a row and actually set up a pretty cool combination that allows you to get a BIG score.

After one play, I wanted to throw this point salad in the garbage can.  I'm glad I didn't, because after multiple plays I could see how all the gears interlocked.  It LOOKS tactical but it PLAYS in a deeply strategic way and better than most point salads I've played.

More than any game since Caylus (another game I love), Five Tribes demands replays.  Commit the time and you will be richly rewarded.

Highly tactical game. It's difficult to do too much long term planning in this game, as the board changes so much from turn to turn. The best you can is try and not open up something game breaking for the next player, which means this can suffer greatly from 'inexperienced player to your right for the win' syndrome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This was a game I was very interested in. I heard raving reviews and saw wonderful images about its art and components. Truly, a Day of Wonder production. I have to say though that I found the terrain tiles a bit dull, and the demons art doesn't match very well with the rest.

The rules can be explained in about 20 minutes: you basically move groups of meeples, but you have to leave one per tile you cross. The final tile determines one of your 2 actions; the colour of the last meeple sets the second.

Then there are many ways to score, "a la Feld", but they are totally inconnex (a bit like "Bora Bora"), with several mechanisms (mayories, set collection, etc.). Some of them are somewhat abstract: it's difficult to know exactly how many points you have won with this action.

The theme is completely pasted. You never get to believe it, not even at the beginning. 

The big issue with this game is that it is very slow. I won't say it's AP prone (but at least it's arguable). There are many possible moves and at least you need to invest some time to check some. Even the initiative bid can feel lenghtly.

It's not a bad game, but besides the meeple movement mechanic, there's nothing really new/original to it, and it really drags. It would improve a lot if it could be played in 30-40 minutes.

I would play again, but I don't think it's a game I would want to play more than just a few times.

I was certainly dissapointed. For me, it didn't live up to the hype :'(

RATING: 6
Insane amount of constant analysis paralysis:
- First there is collective AP when everyone is searching for the most profitable move.
- Then there is AP for the turn order bid.
- At the start of a player's turn, there's the AP for the optimal move again, because somebody overbid you for turn order and already took the move you wanted.
- Finally, there's AP during a turn, about not wanting to leave easy scoring options for the next player.

Nope, nope, nope.  After three plays I can say I'm done with this game.  Experienced gamers can get bogged down with analysis paralysis, because you're not only thinking about your ideal move, but about what it sets up for the next player.  Inexperienced players, on the other hand, can easily set up ridiculous moves for the next player.  Worst of all is playing with a mix of the two -- I mean, who doesn't want to be told "if you did this, you would have gotten 15 more points" by another player after they make their move?  It would be difficult to convince me to play this again.

Gioco gradevole, ottima scoperta anche se trovo sia un gioco per due giocatori. In tre comincia ad accusare alcuni difetti quali l'impossibilità di pianificare e soprattutto i tempi morti, difetti che in 4 giocatori si manifestano in modo ancora più significativo. I materiali sono molto gradevoli, ad eccezione dei colori scelti per i giocatori. Le meccaniche immediate e il gioco scorre via (se al tavolo non avete fini pensatori). Gioco che non posso non promuovere perché ci rigiocherei ma preferibilmente sempre e solo in 2.

RATING: 10
This very quickly became an absolute favorite. 

I think it is amazing as a 2 player game. Yes, back-to-back turn are much more common and even more is possible, but it's part of the game to make people pay a lot for getting them. Back-to-back turns also allow for nice combinations where you can set yourself up, which to us does not even increase the time a turn takes as you have to look for what you wanna do and what you leave behind is a question for every turn not just back-to-back turns. 

Yes, I can see some people having AP problems here, but we don't have them much. Due to the game being very abstract with all information open, one can always study the board while it's another persons turn and even though it may change a lot when others took there turn, it's something that keeps us very interested and which gives already a good "feeling" of the state of the board. Especially certain Dschinns also give you a direction for a more long term strategy, which makes finding good moves a little more "directed". From time to time a turn can last a little longer, but in this game we just don't have a big issue with this. 

It also does have a learning curve to it. After a couple of games, certain "patterns" for good moves became more obvious for us, reducing playtime quiet a bit. 

I also love the fact that one can go very different strategies and still end up with a close result. I'm not always a fan of point salads, but here for me it just works, because it is tied together with this really great mancala mechanic.

I'd be happy to play it again, but I'd not give it a high priority. The wife could take it or leave it. I think part of my ambivalence towards the game is the bidding mechanism with 2 players is devoid of interesting choices. You either spend a few dollars and go first and second, or save a few dollars and go third and fourth. With more players, it would be far more interesting. The potential for AP is high, and with no potential for planning between turns, it really does come down to having two consecutive turns.

All based off of one play at 2 players, so keep that in mind.

Dans la lignée d'Abyss avec un côté plus stratégique peut-être... Il s'agit du même auteur en même temps et ça se sent (on peut faire le parallèle entre les peuples et les tribus notamment).
Five Tribes est bien car il est possible de "miser" des points de victoire pour être peut-être le premier à jouer le prochain tour. Cette mécanique apporte un bon souffle au jeu car chaque tour est différent.
On peut lui reprocher à 4 joueurs :
 - d'être un peu chaotique : si on joue en dernier, toute stratégie sera irrémédiablement avortée par les autres joueurs qui jouent avant.
 - de s'ennuier car impossible de réfléchir à ce que l'on pourra à faire plus tard (voir ci-dessus).

Ce que j'aime dans ce jeu c'est qu'il n'y a pas de méthode miracle pour gagner à part faire un peu de tout avec ce qu'on a, le jeu étant bien équilibré. Si on délaisse une source de points de victoire, le score s'en partira sûrement. Le tout est donc de savoir quoi faire au bon moment. De l'opportunisme pur et dur donc :-).
Les interactions entre joueurs sont assez minimales mais suffisantes pour pimenter un minimum les parties.
Un bon jeu qui deviendra assurément un classique.

Not really a fan.  But it's personal -- I can see why others like it.  For me, there are too many choices early in the game.  Tons and tons of potential for AP prone players to bog down the game looking for the PERFECT series of moves.  This continuously abates as the game progresses until there are fewer and fewer possibilities, but in the beginning, ack!  If it falls in my lap, I'd be happy to have it in the collection.  However, I'm not going to actively seek it out.

I was terrified of this game. Just looking at the board and the thousands of meeples and tiles and looking at the rule set...it just looked like a huge AP nightmare. But, incredibly, it played pretty fast. And I think it was because players took the first move that seemed profitable instead of trying out EVERY scenario for their turn. Five Tribes looks intense and complicated but everything flows very well after the first turn. While not an Intro to Gaming experience, Five Tribes is enjoyable for players comfortable with more strategy-heavy games.

A multiplayer abstract with no hidden information that channels Mancala. If anything speaks to analysis paralyis and the potential for kingmaking that's it, and it is. The kingmaking is obfuscated by having about 8 different ways to score thankfully - or not thankfully if you're not a fan of point salads. It's a game that rewards specialisation over generalisation though, but it's not easy to specialise. The perennial question each turn is whether I can effectively progress in my specialisation, or are there tactical plays that are rich in points, and is either or both setting up an opponent for a big play, and do I need to take a lesser play to deny an opponent a big play. Given there's 30 tiles on the board to move meeples around, that's a lot of analysis to undertake each turn. The other major downside is that there's no story arc -  the decision process you take in a turn at the end of the game is fundamentally the same as what you do in a turn at the start - assess the board, do the best you can. There's no personal board development, no sense of personal progression, no personal location relevance - just grab points as they come with the board that's presented to you. While each turn provided an engaging decision which would normally warrant a higher rating, running down the same unvarying decision tree each turn became more problematic as the game developed. The lack of theme meant it wasn't saveable.

This is a great game based on mechanics borrowed from Kalaha. It's fun and quite short, but it invites to AP and might be tedious with the wrong players. It also gives little variation from game to game so don't play it too often. 

Since this was one of the EuropeMasters games of2015 I have played it a lot now. Usually after EM you get fed up with the games, but this I will probably play again in the future.

The only thing I don't like about FT is the tactical nature, forcing players to rethink every turn. Otherwise - excellent!

Brilliant. Gives analysis paralysis to some players, but still - brilliant. I like it best with two players because of the small rules change, that allows you to play two turns in a row sometimes.

Too much stuff to track, all over the board and in front of other players, too much AP, everything felt completely abstracted. This one did nothing for me.

I really like this game. I like the 'chess like' mechanic -  perhaps because I like to recognise and exploit patterns. The theme is really just a thin skin on an abstract game, but it is pretty. Ultimately though, this stands out as something different from the 100 or so other games I own, which makes playing it a refreshing experience. The missus loves it too, which is a major plus :)

RATING: 8
10+ plays - This is probably one of my more favourite mid-weight games. Visually very cool and the concept of picking up meeples adds a different kind of 'mechanic' to your board game collection if you're trying to round it out. Not the greatest with 2, but okay.

RATING: 5
Based on one play: This is a fairly plain game where you have to move meeples to other locations in order to trigger events. A lot of things will get you points and each different tribe triggers a different way to get points. It is meant to be family friendly, as most of Days of Wonders games, but I found that it was hard to visualize how to maximize points and the mechanics were not very interesting. I would say that most people would be better off with other games from this publisher who makes excellent family games.

RATING: 9
One of my favorite game with a lot of winning strategy possible. You have to take care of ressources, enjoy Djinn power, have the majority on the yellow meeple, control places, keeping money... But you cannot do every thing and must choose !
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Solid game.  The mancala mechanic has been used before but there are elements of the game that feel fresh.  There are many ways to gain points, so it is somewhat of a point salad.  The propensity for AP may be overhyped as there are opportunities to loosely follow a strategy hence you tend to hone in on certain moves.  Also, as meeples start coming off the board, there are fewer tiles to examine.  Art and components are through the roof and for me, the fun factor is quite high.  Also, because the meeples are distributed randomly, the tiles are arranged randomly, and the djinn cards are not all used, the replay value should be high.

The only negative I see is the scoring may be a bit too diverse.  It is very difficult to judge midgame who is most likely winning.

  And contrary to what some may say, I think it is actually great  with 2.

RATING: 7
This is an excellent game. It works as a great bridge from gateway games into meatier ones, without being too heavy. 

I love how literally everything is worth points in the game. Even the money is worth points at a one to one ratio, but you use the money to buy everything else. 

Once you've played a few times, the game time drops significantly, and it's a great game to play between heavier euros as a palate cleanser. 

The component quality is excellent, as you would expect from Days of Wonder. The cardboard chits are thick stock, the colours are vibrant. The meeples have little turbans if you look closely. 

All in all, a wonderful game.

I've only played this a few times now.  It's a good game.  I like the puzzle aspect, the multiple paths to victory and the weird little tricks that you can learn to do to rack up lots of points.  That being said, it just doesn't grab me.  It's a very good game, but it's almost too cerebral.  There are very few "stand up" moments.  I think I'll be happy to play this one, but never excited to play it.

RATING: 6
Five Tribes is a very abstract game with a mancala-like mechanism (which makes it seem more like a Rudiger Dorn game than a Bruno Cathala game). Each turn, players select a tile with a number of tokens on it, and "travel" along the board with those tokens, leaving one on each square, until they reach the final square, at which they get to perform some action depending on the color of the token and the symbol on the tile. There are multiple paths to victory, but much of the game involves staring at the board and trying to find the best move (I worry about AP here). The turn order bidding seems like a trap, too--if you don't win first, the game state will probably be changed enough that you need to re-evaluate everything.

RATING: 7.5
Wonderful game. Simple but with lots (and lots) of depth and replay value. One of the best parts is that you don't quite know who is going to win, making the point count at the end far more than a formality. 
Cons: 
- potentially demeaning female djinn images
- analysis paralysis 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Five Tribes ends up just being an overall boring experience for me. While the artwork and colors of the meeples on the board are bright, it all feels cluttered. All of the actions in the game feel dull and just give you points for the end game. You have 2 spaces that do literally the same thing, except one is a palace and one is a palm tree. Yay? The only thing slightly interesting is the Djinns, but even those are just modified versions of the tiles. Downtime can be bad, but we luckily have fast players with this game.

I really wanted to like this game, but there is very little here to warrant my attention.

RATING: 6
Very interesting bidding game, where the heart of the game is bidding for turn order. One has to analyze the board and determine how much turn order is "worth" each round.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very unique mechanics to a game, but absolutely a must own.  I think the mancala mechanics with the bidding for turn order and the five tribes of maples make this one of the most unique games I have played in a long time.  This game can be prone to a little ap but I suggest a timer if that becomes a problem.

An enjoyable worker deplacement game.  I liked the random setup and the Djins affecting the game.  There were many paths to play and to bid.  I liked the bidding of zero mechanism.  Game seemed easy to pickup once taught.

The game could suffer if playing with slow, AP-prone, new, or four players due to downtime.  Some Djins seemed overpowered.

New to our family of games.  We like it.  I'm not very good at it yet, so I'm working on making my mind think the way it needs to to make effective moves in this game.  Haven't played it very much, and not with more than two people, but I wonder if we will be able to get it to the table with the big group.  Seems like it may not be their style.

After the first play (2 players) I do believe the game lacks a punch factor. However, the amount of options you have to gain VPs is staggering and made me enjoy the game, instead of being prone to AP we simply played on and had a good time.

This game is Mancala with a hodge-podge of modern mechanics tacked on to it.

Seems like they just kept tacking on more features to add to the decision making and paths to victory, but they don't aggregate in a pleasing way for me.

The design elements, except for the Djinn cards, are unattractive when all placed together...too many different colors of meeples all jumbled up on puke brown tiles. 

An appropriate metaphor would be manufactured, derivative pop music.

I would rather play Jaipur which is reduced to the core elements for a similar experience without the needless complexity and opportunities for analysis paralysis.

My third play in 4 was the best. At first I was not sure about the hype after the Gencon but now.. OK. This is a good game, unfortunately very abstract. But each new player enjoyed it, that is true. There are so many ways to victory and until final counting there is no clear winner.

RATING: 5
Five Tribes got so much hype after Gen-Con. It’s easy to see why, with the lavish production synonymous with a Day’s of Wonder game, and the promise of more depth than their other productions. While there are a lot of interesting things going on, I found in a four-player game that planning was too difficult, which made the experience much more tactical than I would have liked. 

I really enjoyed the mancala-like mechanism for action selection, buying Djinns that grant special powers, multiple paths to score big points, and bidding points on the turn-order track. On the other hand, unless I know I’m going to go first in turn order (and to guarantee this costs a ridiculous number of points), I cannot predict what I’ll be able to do on my turn. The board changes so much with each player’s move that any plans I might have had could be ruined (even with multiple contingencies). I could live with that if players were intentionally blocking me, but the act of picking up and putting down meeples in a path can lead to really arbitrary choices by the acting player that severely influence everyone else. 

Overall, the things I did like I liked enough that I’m willing to try again, but this definitely won’t see space on my shelf for the foreseeable future.

I got to play this at my local meetup today. It was pretty damn fun. The scoring is a bit to figure out and math can make AP player bog down a lot. It feels a little bit like a Feld's point salad game. Although this one is on the lighter side of the spectrum. There really should be a timer that is included in this game and somewhat enforced like a chess clock.

Apparently my group is perfect for this game, as I have not seen the criticisms arise that people talk about.

As long as you pick what tile you want, and work backwards, turns don't take that long.

Love the variability in options and the mechanisms in general.

Big negative: cycling of cards. You see way too few genies in the game, and the market is not viable in low player count games. I would wish for a rule where if nothing is bought in the market, the 3 lowest cards are removed. Same for genies but just the lowest genie.

I was a bit surprised by the high rating of this game, but after 1 play I totally understand why: this is a school example of a game with not so many rules (typical DoW-rulebook of 8 pages with 2 pages set-up and lots of examples), many things you can focus on to score points and more then depth that you can imagine after reading the rules. Best DoW-release since Small World.

Played this and loved it. If you think focusing on just one collection will make you win, I can voucher that it will score big, you could always lose. Great mechanic, great theme, great quality.

On top of this, the instructions of this game blew my mind! It says in the beginning of the book to save those punched out pieces of cardboard that you would toss out. They brig the box up and make the game flush with the top of the box.

Now that I have played a few times I find that I am the only person who does not seem to care for this game.

Not a bad game just not really for me.

Interesting concept. Feel too much on the field changes on a regular basis to plan out your moves. I did enjoy this as a 2 player game much better as determining if getting two moves in a row is worth it. Most of the times in a 3-4 player game, rarely seems worth it to jump the line and pay points to get your move. If you aren't in first, it just doesn't matter.

This game is incredibly satisfying to play. It's tense and relaxing at the same time. It suffers from offering so many decisions, but the options are all fantastic choices to have to choose from. With money as points, the turn order bid has a huge impact. If you afford yourself the time needed to play plus some extra -- and play while having brunch where you can give the current player all the time they want to crunch through the many options while you go refill your mimosa -- you're in for a good time.

This is a really interesting game where you pick up a pile of workers, and drop them one at a time along the tiles forming a path to your final tile where you resolve your actions. You get an effect based on the color meeple you dropped and an additional effect from the tile itself. There are a number of different and interesting point scoring categories, which allow you to explore different strategies. There are lots of imaginative djinn cards with interesting abilities to choose from as well, all worth varying victory points.

Overall a nice game. I liked how many good options the game gives you, I liked the tactical play of trying to not set your opponent up for too good a move on their turn despite the futility of trying. The components are nice. I just couldn't get myself to feel passionately about it. There's nothing wrong with it, and maybe one day I'll miss having it around, but I feel like I'm fine not having the box sit on my shelf collecting dust. Maybe the actions are too equitable. Maybe the lack of any real engine building is what fails to light my fire.

RATING: 5
I'll start with some things I liked about Five Tribes. All the action happens on a shared board, and as a consequence it's pretty interactive. It's not overly fiddly either.

But it seems to me to essentially come down to a series of puzzles to solve, each one mostly independent of the next. Sure, you can have something of a strategy, but the game is overwhelmingly tactical and the moves are far too easy to evaluate purely in terms of immediate VP gain rather than more interesting trade-offs.

And oh, the downtime if your players are overanalytical! There's a turn-order auction at the start of each round, but only the high-bidder really knows what they're paying for, because the board will have changed for the others. The game also has an odd structure of starting with an overwhelming number of options and then gradually removing them until none remain. As a result, it seemed rarely worth bidding anything for turn order until the mid-game; just take whatever's left when it gets to your turn. 

The scoring system is also a bland 7-Wonders-like spreadsheet. A bit of area majority, a bit of set collection, season to taste. It's too bad, because the underlying mancala mechanism isn't bad but it gets smothered by everything else. Our feeling was that you could play slowly, really deliberating over the details of each move, or you could play badly, leaving huge opportunities for the next player. Neither is that appealing.

RATING: 7.5
The game at first seem fairly light. The rules and mechanics are easy to learn, but that is where the "light game" part ends. It's a worker "displacement" game where players pick up meeples and drop them off one at a time on each location. The strategy varies from game to game, and is based on your previous turn and/or other players turn. It will caused a lot of deep thinking and analysis paralysis.

An interesting euro with a lot to think about and multiple paths to victory. I like the basic mancala-like mechanic and the ways that the game branches off from it to make interesting decisions.

Overall, it's a good game for a group of people that are willing to limit their own AP.

One 4-player with 2 experienced players. Although not difficult, the game has multiple layers that new players will not be able to integrate into a plan from the outset. This could lead to Analysis Paralysis unless the new players are just going to 'just see what happens'.

My newest 'pet peeve' are Euros that have complexity for complexity's sake. Unfortunately, this game has drifted into that realm. Wargames at least (try to) connect complexity with 'reality'.

I liked the mancala meeple movement mechanic to claim the action and score depending on the type of meeple being removed. 
There are several types of scoring, probably too many. Blue score based on neighboring tiles, Green to jump start card set collections. Red to remove meeples to allow you to score additional tiles. Yellow straight up scoring, white to build your engine. 
The tiles allow you to build up the scoring potential of the tiles (palm trees/palaces), buy genies that allow you modify the base scoring, buy set cards...

People criticized Tikal for AP. It doesn't hold a candle compared to Five Tribes. In Tikal AP is tolerated, in Five Tribes it is demanded.

With board full at the beginning and so many options available, there is a ridiculous amount of analysis.
Everyone has to study the board to decide what to bid.
Restudy how things had changed if they weren't first when it their turn.
Restudy yet again when placing meeples so they don't open up something too generous for the next player in line.
All of which made it a tedious game. I didn't mention the time it takes to calculate the final scores.

Or just ignore it all start with any old tile and make a guess.

Let's just say after playing it few times I don't need a any more experiences.

An excellent point salad euro game with a good amount of crunch. 

That said, this is possibly the worst choice for a tournament game I have ever come across - it only really works in a casual setting; because there is so much choice, and so many things to keep track of and calculate that working out the optimal move is hard AND there are no take-backs. If players tried to play optimally - if for example there was something at stake - it would be obscene for AP.

Great game with interesting choices.  Suggest a timer for the AP prone.  Also suggest just taking turns without bidding in a 2-player game because having two turns in a row will really get the AP going for some.

From DoW

Amazing game, great components, fun theme! 

The game mechanic in this game of picking up meeples and charting a path around the board to earn the most points, but not leave a great turn for the next player is amazing!! It will take me a while to get good at this game, but it's so fun I'm happy to put in the time!!

I expect this game to do very well for DoW. Another home run!

This is my game of the year for 2014, hands down! Simple rules, a wonderful twist on the mancala system, lots of ways to win, and tons of re-playability. Wonderful game and of course, great components.

Five Tribes runs really smoothly. At least, as far as the mechanical aspect of the game goes. It's really prone to AP, and a lot of turns end up with someone staring at the board for a long time before doing anything. It gets better over time though, because eventually you realize that after all the agonizing and thinking you do trying to find alternatives to what you want to do just end up with you wanting to take the move you originally thought of anyway. There's very little luck involved, which is also nice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Very clever game, everything is open, you try to optimize your strategy (often relying on an early Djinn acquisition) and it feels pleasant.

Not too many "in your face" moves and only a little player interaction through bids for turn order and obtaining djinns/items before others.

Works well with two with very combo-ish turns (you can have "double" turns).

This game is very prone to AP, I tend to recommend to analyze the board during other people's turn trying to find your best chance to earn VP's and when it's your turn, you only have to calculate how not to give too many options away.

A very refined game with several paths to victory (although you cannot neglect any).

Great components. In short it is two dimensional mancala with too many add-ons to slow down the game play. Symbols on the Djinns are not intuitive. End scoring makes no sense. Thematically completely off.
In between turns the game seems to last forever as there is not much interesting on the board to observe in the meanwhile.

Like how the game is all strategy and there is no chance involved (no dice). The bidding phase is very enjoyable. The one negative with this game was the rule book. The first time playing we had to jump on BGG to find an explanation of several rules. (Scoring of the Viziers and if the Fakir's are scored at the end). The "game turn" sheet that every player has is not the official rule book. The Viziers's scoring is misleading on the game turn sheet.

#2 for me behind Castles of Burgundy (of games I have played). Such an interesting game with so many decisions to make on every turn. There are a lot of ways to score points...can be very challenging to determine which course of action to take each turn. So it does have some AP possibility for sure. But I think the mancala movement/variable board setup makes this one so good.

A very interesting game mechanic. It's the first game I have played with this mechanic. It's fun to come across a game with an original approach.

I enjoyed the game, but it got a lower rating because the game play is slow. There is a lot of board studying while people go through a lot of different moves in their head. This really slows down the game. If possible, I'd recommend a move time limit just to keep it moving.

RATING: 6
Game play which doesn't simply create a risk of analysis paralysis but almost demands it is not my idea of fun.  For all the talk of a great new mechanism ("worker unplacement") the game didn't feel particularly fresh - though frankly my brain was begging for release before the end of the first round, and the game scarcely got any better after that.  For the same kind of game - "move stuff around on tiles and acquire VPs/cash/mechandise/extra options" - I'd recommend Istanbul instead.  I feel no desire - and quite  bit of antipathy - towards playing this game ever again.  Life's just too short, and there are too many games that I *want* to play in its stead.

Such a slick game and awesome implementation of the mancala mechanism. Multiple paths to victory and nice variability in the set-up process.

Nothing to complain about here, other than my daughter making good use of one of the Djinn cards last game and beating us senseless, hehe.

Wow! Finally got this one to the table. I got it in a math trade. I traded Specter Ops for it. What a come up! This game just fits my thought processes. There are so many things going on, and so many ways to score. I usually would not like all the options, but this game gets it done. It feels very meaty and fulfilling, and it can wrap up in as little as 45 minutes if you keep it moving. The play just flows very well as long as you don't try and find the perfect move every time. My wife and I assess our options and play, and this game flies by with fun. Not everyone can see the patterns. Different people are better with different mechanics, and even enjoy them more. This one is certainly a try it before you buy it, but it is one that you are either going to love or hate. I was on the love end of the spectrum. Out of approximately 100 games I've played, this one sits in the top 5 easily. **Wife:8

Take my opinion with a grain of salt, as I've only played this game once, but I think it's spectacular. I played it over at my friend's house pretty recently. The game is pretty quick to teach and easy to learn. 

One thing I like about this game is the amount of things you can do, it's almost overwhelming. In general, it seems like it's a good idea to stick to one or two strategies to make a lot of points instead of trying to do everything. I love the Djinns. A lot of them give bonus points for certain things so acquiring one gives you a clearer strategy to stick with.

I love moving the pieces around, I love the colors, I love the modular "board", I love the fact that you play both the action on the tile you land on and the action of the color you landed with, it adds quite a bit of strategy to the game despite it being, overall, a pretty simple game.

Then of course money converts directly to victory points at the end of the game, but you have to bid for turn order. That was the most difficult part for me in multiple ways. First, I like being the first player even if it means taking disadvantages, but it's hard to realize how much of a disadvantage you're putting yourself in if you're paying 12 gold to be first. You start with 50 gold, and when you look at all of the coins in front of you it seems like a lot, but you will quickly deplete your resources if you want to be first every turn. Second, if I bid for first, when the turn ends, the next bidding phase will be done in that order. That can be problematic because if you want to be first, or at least not last, you'll want to bid something, but since you don't know what everyone else is willing to bid you may bid 3 coins and still end up being last just because everyone else decided to bid higher. Yes, they still used more coins, but you used more coins when you bid for first last turn, and you really need to make up for your loss of money and spending money just to end up being last is a pretty big hit.

Overall, it's a great game. Well worth the praise it gets and I could see this being fun for children and adults alike.

Unfortunately this is not a game for me, and it has several reason why...
1) The whole game is too artificial for my tastes. If a recall correctly the same was my problem with Goa: the whole mancala mechanic in the game is very detached from the game, even considering the minimalist approach regarding the theme in general in this game. 
2) This is a game about tactics not about strategy, short term vs. long term, reactive vs. proactive. Usually I don't like these kind of games...
3) I'm AP prone, but my girlfriend is even worse hell it can cause some serious downtime. Usually I hate people playing / texting / etc. with their phone during their games, but this was the one special case, when I did exactly this. 
Until now unfortunately Bruno Cathala is a big miss for me. He has a lot of fans out there (this game, too), but for me, there aren't enough layers to enjoy his games. Even the wonderful production quality cannot stop me from putting this to the trade pile.

Simple and intuitive rules.....the rule book and player aids are great....very clear.   Easy to teach and first game is fun.  AP wasn't too bad for us....a little prodding was required.  I did most of the prodding, but had to be prodded myself on the last move of our first game!  :)

Several viable strategies....more tactics than strategy, but the strategy you pursue definitely influences your decisions.

It's fun to have both a tribe action and a tile action on each turn.  It's also fun to take an assassin action that let's you claim two tiles on the same turn.

The djinn powers may be the funnest (yes, that is a word) part of the game.  All-in-all it's a great game!

The board looks like the Skittles rainbow fucked a Meeple Factory. It's a riot of colours that is impossible to look at from a high level, but the game is all about spatial movement of specific colours. So it's AP heavy but also light -- oxymoron achieved. It's a waste of time.

when my game showed up I discovered that I had the updated version that did not come with the slaves. Having the slave cards did not bother me however I am still glad that I got the newest version.

Played as a 2 player game and I think that I would prefer this game with 3 or 4. Having 1 person or even both players taking 2 turns back to back all the time has a different play style. And while I am not against playing that way I believe that I would much prefer only having 1 action per turn rather than 2. Still a great game.

Really enjoyed this game.  Uses a Mancala system just in a very unique and gamer way.  The game seems a bit daunting at first but once you go through a turn all rules are clear but the strategy is not.  This game needs multiple plays to learn all the different strategies.  The options are so wide open as you try to maximize you meeple drops without setting up a great move for your opponent.  There is an aspect of AP but there is so much on the board to think about that you rarely are sitting around waiting for  on others turns.  I really can't wait to explore the different strategies with the different tribe powers to see if they are balanced but from an initial game there seems that they could be.  Replayability should not be a problem as the game setup is so random that you will never play the same game twice.

Puzzly and colorful. Offers many opportunities for synergy into a compact form (scoring synergies, anyway). And you have to consider what you're leaving on the table for the other players. Still, it's pretty dry. The saving grace is it doesn't overstay its welcome. 

And a quibble: A game called Five Tribes that is limited to four players? I saw several groups of five sit down to play this at a convention. And what are the eponymous five tribes anyway? It's not at all evident from the gameplay.

Avoided this game since release as the reviews suggested it could be quite prone to analysis paralysis. Had some time free today and took the opportunity to play this as a 2, then 3 player game.
In my opinion, this is just above gateway game in complexity to teach.  The player aids helping in the learning curve.  Various Djinn cards provide a pinch of strategy but for the most part this is a tactical game.

This is a great game and likely to go up further.

This was a game which both by wife and I wanted - but after playing twice in January 2015 (both just as a 2p game), we were both disappointed. I don't think it's a bad game by any means - but I have failed to be as engaged by it as I expected. I had been meaning to try it with more players, and got a 3p game in June, but the reaction - of both me and the other 2 players, who were both new to the game - was the same, it's a decent game but not anything special. I'd never refuse to play this, but I'm in no rush to play it again.

It's rare I like a game this much that I'm this bad at!

5 tribes is an awesome game with a very unique mechanic that rewards careful planning and bidding. Turn order matters more in 5 tribes than most games, but overbidding in the order auction is a quick way to lose by a few coins in final scoring.

:) Cool action selection mechanic comparable to some sort of 'Mancala' principe applied to a grid.

:) Quickly explained and played. An ideal filler.

:) Game has a good potential to be a big hit with occasional gamers as it offers decent and original mechanics in an accessible game

:) The art is more than ok: tile drawings are very nice and the Djinn cards have beautiful illustrations

:) Different setup each time you play (different order for the action grid, but the same tiles are always available)

:soblue: A bad player can generate golden opportunities for the player behind him/her, distorting the balance of play

:soblue: In essence, this game is a (beautifully produced) abstract with no thematic integration

While it does suffer from AP, as well as the inability to plan ahead, the process of taking your turn in Five Tribes is just so satisfying. Every turn feels like you did something substantial, and it makes playing very enjoyable, but there can be gaps waiting for your turn that takes you away from the experience.

Great game! Seems complicated, but it's easy to grasp and quick to play. If you analyse every posible move before you take your turn, the game will last four hours, and the fun will be zapped out. Play by your intuion, try different strategies and have a great time! Played it three times now, and two times the winner was decided by two points or less. The balance seems perfect!

After additional plays one thing that is annoying about this game is the downtime.   One can plan only to have another player ruin your move and then u need to come up with a new while everyone waits. And u might find a better one now that the board has changed but meanwhile everyone waits and waits and waits.   Had not played for a while but my opinion is the same

Amazing game. Rules are simple but game play is complex. This is the perfect combination. In our game, each person went for a completely different strategy and the scores were VERY close at the end :) 

My only knock is that I feel I'll have a hard time introducing new players to the game because experience with the game is very helpful. Near the end of the game, I started to better see possible good moves. Even with only a single game under my belt, if I played with new players I think I would wipe the floor with them. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting mechanics but it seems pretty mathy.  With a time limit imposed on the players, the game seems very strong.  Without, it is a massive math problem for minor gains.

It definitely feels like a game where a greedy AI that does all the math would beat almost any human -- just take the best short term point gain each turn.  If supplied with some reasonable heuristics for how to value the djinns, it would probably be nearly unbeatable. Not what I'm looking for in a strategy game.

Still, the whole experience was pleasing, so I need to play it again.

Five Tribes is an excellent puzzle. Unfortunately, it brings out the worst in analysis paralysis prone players. God, can this game be unbearable with three other players lost deep in an ocean of combinatorics. This game is not for those people. This game requires the "ah, this move looks about right, let me do that" mentality. Otherwise this game can be a frustrating brain-burner, rather than the colorful and evolving puzzle it's intended to be.

A final complaint from me: Five Tribes isn't focused enough. It's kind of a hodge-podge of popular mechanics, from set collection, special player powers, etc. It's a little too much and takes away from the potential elegance of the game. This one's a decent 7 for me, I'll be playing this again sometime soon.

P.S. Forgot to mention that I think bidding for player order works beautifully in this game.

Fun mancala-type movement where you can more or less predict what value you're leaving for the next opponents. Extremely vulnerable to breakage with players of different experience levels, especially when they are adjacent to one another. 
Subtly entertaining, but can be quite chaotic -- not much opportunity for planning. Multiple scoring paths and variable setup ensure replayability.

29-03-2015. Rated after 1 play. FINALLY played the game of last year, Five Tribes. Five Tribes features a random setup of 4 times 5 tiles in a grid. During setup, on each tile random 3 meeples are placed. Turn structure is easy. Before all players start their turns, there is a bidding phase that determines the player order. Then, starting with the start player all players take their subsequent turns. 

At the start of your turn, you take the meeples from a tile and move orthogonally over the tiles, dropping a meeple on each tile you pass over. When you drop your last meeple, you take all the meeples in the color of the meeple you placed last and take the action of the color and strength (number of meeples). Yellow and white meeples are worth VPs at the end of the game, blue meeples allow you to score VPs for adjacent blue tiles, green allows you to get some market cards and red allows you to kill meeples on tiles. In addition, you get the action that is on the tile, which is can be to add Palm tree and Gate meeples that are worth extra VPs, allow you to buy more cards from the market, buy Djinn cards (special abilities and end-game scoring) etc. IF you take out the last meeple on a tile, you score that tile, place a camel in your color on it and get points. 

I like Five Tribes. I think it's a good game although I suspect it would be better played with less than 4 players. Now, the game felt hard to control, as each time your turn came around the whole board would have changed, so your planning meaningless. That makes the game basically a solitaire puzzle. I think it's a good puzzle, interesting choices etc. But a puzzle.. and that's a bit disappointing.

A game where players gather meeples of different colors which give you the ability to perform five different kinds of actions. A deck of Djinn cards allows extra bonuses for certain kinds of actions. I highly recommend this game to everyone as it is superb. It has smooth mechanics and excellent components. The key to the game is how you move and gather the meeples. I think it's kind of chess-like since the way you leave the meeples on the board at the end of your turn either helps or hinders both you and your opponents. Very enjoyable and one of our favorites.

RATING: 7
So I expected not to like this - I figured it would be too abstract for me, but this actually was really good.  It is very "puzzly" and we had a lot of fun with it. Definitely a game you need to play a few times to get good at because you have to learn how you get each action and how to best move the pieces.  (JW)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Five Tribes is a beautifully produced game of many options to score points.  In this game players take turns picking up pieces on certain tiles and dropping them on a trail of tiles with the last tile determining your action you can take for that turn. Their are many different ways to score points in the game. The game is fairly short only lasting about 45 minutes to an hour, but is full of deep decision making.

Pros: Beautiful game production ,unique game play mechanisms(Mancala) So many strategies to gain points, fun bidding mechanism. Fast Gameplay. Little downtime

Cons: Overload of choices make it a nightmare to play with AP Players especially when the board changes every turn. The game does not allow for mistakes or taking back turns.

Look, you don't have to tell me this game's faults. It's entirely abstract and is prone to slow-down when people insist on analyzing every move. But the fact remains that Five Tribes is probably my favorite pure eurogame from the last five years or so. The use of the mancala mechanic provides a familiar framework where players are free to do what they like and pursue the path they want, without being locked into a specific path. Besides that, the tactical gameplay can gives the game a nice conversational tone, assuming people aren't trying to math out every permutation on their turn. This is a 10 for me, not because it is a pristine design, but because I almost always want to play it. Not many games have captured me that way, particularly not in this genre.

The mancala mechanism is fun, and leaves some room to plan ahead (kind of. Also gives you room to worry over every little placement and grind what should be a pretty zippy game to a screeching halt). And it features myriad disjointed-yet-ultimately-similar ways to score. Great.
I guess I don't know thematically WHY these groups of people are wandering the desert and why it's ultimately good for my final score, but maybe it doesn't matter. No, it definitely doesn't matter.

A fun spatial puzzle with high tactical gameplay, many many paths to victory, gorgeous table presence, good lenght, insane player interaction and through the roof tension. Plays even better with 2p imo, as each player has two turns so it makes the game more strategic. The new expansion is awesome as well! Sold my copy but my g/f bought one as it's her favorite game in the world.

Fun light/mid-weigh euro. I appreciate variable setup and genie tiles as that keeps things different each game.  That said, I am in the camp that finds this a bit AP inducing and while I personally don't take a long time usually during my turn, I do feel like there is an objective "right answer" on your turn which is a bit of a turn off.  I wouldn't buy it, but I'd happily play.

meh. I'm not a fan of games where the main point of the design seems to be to obscure the relative worth of different moves, in order to make the game more accessible, presumably? Like Castles of Burgandy, you just get points no matter what you do, and are prevented from calculating very much what the possible ramifications of that move are...so why am I playing? is the thought that comes to mind.  It's especially random at high player counts. Mancala, the mechanic the game was based around, is far cleverer than this. This is exactly the kind of wishy-washy paste flavoured euro that seems to get love on BGG, and exactly the kind of experience I dislike. I come from abstract games stock, want a lot of control and a lot of ability to see what every move means for future turns. If this means that new players get crushed by more experienced players, so much the better. Actually if the theme is really fun I can get into a lot of chaos and dice rolling and random events sometimes, but this theme is paper thin, a throwaway. Pass.

Strongly themed point salad of the more palatable sort. The Djinn powers are quite interesting, inclusion of slaves annoying, and not a bad experience. It goes quickly enough (maybe too quickly, the game seems to end just as you're starting to use your djinni, etc.).

AP isn't too big a deal since most moves are tactical in nature apart from the bidding for first played in each turn. If AP becomes an issue, use a timer.

I enjoy this game a great deal. Some of that love is from the pure joy of picking up and dropping meeples, but the rest is from everything else about the game; love the multiple ways to gain points, love that it is generally hard to tell who is winning, love the artwork, love bidding for turn order. There is just so much to love!

Abstract, tactical, points grabbing nonsense. Each turn begins with the same near meaningless auction for turn order. Except for the final turn (where it's somewhat important), the top bid usually means that in amongst the Pollack-esk splash of colour the player has seen a way to earn a decent score. Those behind will see new opportunities open up as the meeple distribution changes. With the Djinn cards there's probably about ten different ways to score points just on your turn. Round and round you go until you get to counting your final score. There's no sense of story arch. It's over in about 30 minutes and it's okay. Ho hum. Players will find that along the way they've accidentally been gifted wonderful points opportunities. Oh dear. They'll find that such and such a Djinn special ability card was quite profitable because it was bought early. Yawn. It all feels so meaningless. Spot the best points grab on your turn and execute. Rinse and repeat. It's a pleasant social activity, but one where I enjoy chatting while setting up and packing away the game as much as I do playing it. Many will enjoy it much more than I do (and that's fine by me), but I'm burnt out on these types of abstract games.

RATING: 8
Mancala on steroids, with a dose of area control and set collection. Depending on which meeple they drop last, the players can perform actions. They may also perform the action of the spot they land. They look for resources and different ways to score points in order to win. Paste on theme, beautiful production, as usually with Days of Wonder.

Take a basic mancala type mechanism, and add in special powers based on which of five different tribe colors end up being placed together in the last move, and you have Five Tribes!  A simple idea that is a ton of fun to play!

**As a side note, I do wish the Fakirs had been in the game from the start, as I have the first edition and really am uncomfortable with the slave cards.  Really wonder how no one thought putting black slaves in chains into the game was a bad idea...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I think Five Tribes will be a game I enjoy every time I play. There is a lot going on, and it all revolves around my current favorite game element: the mancala (which is actually kind of a more-complicated rondel, but a very fun puzzle to work with). Where do I want to end up? And where do I need to start? And where do I want to drop off pieces along the way?

Then there are lots of great little actions along the way, be it the colors of the meeples or the tile ability or the genie cards or the resource card collection. Everything fits together quite nicely.

Despite the fact that the little about the 2-player version of this game that I know isn't ideal, I have a feeling I will get this someday. Although I mostly play 2 players with my wife, it's quite good and a game that I think would fit well into my collection some day.

Fall 2014 "just-because" gift for my wife.  This game is like "1001 Arabian Nights" meets Mancala with a taste of 7 Wonders but with 90 meeples in 5 different colors.  The djinns in the game really add to the theme and they in themselves could warrant a spinoff game in the future. This is a game I hope to get to the table more often and hopefully at a guys game night but for now I am content in playing it and losing handily to my wife.  The components from Days of Wonder are incredible and extravagant compared to other meeple heavy games.

Got to play this at Lobster Trap 17 and even though it wasn't something I was going out of my way to learn, I happened to fall into a game.  I really like the fluid, tactical nature of the game.  The fact that money/points are linked is cool as well.  You cannot sit there and plan out your whole move because the entire state of the board could be different by the time it's your turn again.  This brings up the worst part of the game.  If you play with even one person with AP, this is going to take an eternity to play.  Trying to maximize every move is virtually impossible since there are so many moves possible in a given turn.  Not sure if the bid track is all that well done either.  I really liked it though.

RATING: 8
Somewhat-abstract area control game.

Pro: Artwork, aesthetics and components are outstanding. Very deep game yet easy to understand how to play. Multiple paths to victory.

Con: Suffers very much from analysis-paralysis - and more casual players may find themselves getting bored whilst waiting for their turn.

I just dig it. If you're new to the game, you likely won't win the first time. It's really about risk/reward and playing the right price for the right move. Beyond that, I love the look of the game and the overall design.

My wife picked this up on a store recommendation for my Christmas present. Got lucky, because this is a fantastic game. We love playing with 2 or 4 players equally. Colourful, beautiful tiles and playing pieces makes this lovely to even just have set up. Actual gameplay is great fun despite being surprisingly simple. Definitely a moment-by-moment tactic game rather than overarching strategy, but I say that just requires some flexiblity in choosing what to do on your next turn. Have played over 15 times since Christmas 2014.

RATING: 7.5
Awesome game with a mancala type collection mechanism. The rule book needs some work with standardizing terms (e.g. "villages" are also misnamed "palaces" sometimes, etc), but very fun and fairly simple to teach to casual gamers. A lot of strategy is possible to implement as well and the variety is fun with the randomness of the set up each game. Much more impressed than I thought I'd be.

I don't get it. You make a typical euro game with all the normal VP salad stuff, mild spacial elements and a couple special abilities that enable specific strategies, but as your differentiating mechanic you have analysis paralysis incarnate. Why would you do this? You monster.

RATING: 8
Received in trade (2-24-16)

Finally got this to the table and it didn't disappoint.  It's pretty easy to set-up and teach, although the scoring is a little opaque for new players until a couple of turns have gone by.  Beautiful components, great decisions, and several viable "strategic" paths to take make this a winner.  The satisfaction of landing a big move that nets you a bunch of points is palpable.

I don't find the game as "chaotic" as some have described.  You can definitely push a particular strategy, and even block strategies that your opponents are attempting.  Like many of my favorite games, there are "layers" of mastery in Five Tribes.  You can do pretty well once you learn the basic concepts, but if you really want to think things out, you can try to set up big moves for yourself on the next turn (assuming you'll win the turn order bid), you can pull off great combo's with Djinn, etc.  

Biggest "problem" with the game:  it is quite thinky.  Yes, this can lead to a little AP, but perhaps worse, there's not much casual table-conversation going on.  People are pretty focused on the board, trying to see good moves.  This elevates it from light to medium weight, in my book and means that it doesn't quite have the fun-factor that other light-medium games in my collection have (e.g., Lords of Waterdeep, Evolution).  This is not a game I would pull out on every occasion, and you have to be aware of the effect it will have on your table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I have played this a few times which is good going for me with new games. A good game that is quite easy to teach but has strategy and tactical play that is challenging enough to engage the gamer in me. It has a certain blocking quality, slightly higher than Carcassonne, which provides the interaction ie take something that you know others want even if it is suboptimal for your score. Just a solid game that has a basic gameplay (similar to mancala I am told) mechanism not used in other games I own(picking up meeples and placing them in a trail on the tiles and actioning the last tile you place a meeple on).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Mancala with a reason for picking up meeples and laying them out. Has a bit of analysis paralisis since you can't really preplan your turn much, the board is constantly changing.

This game had a lot of hype for its beautiful components and its publisher's illustrious track record.  For me, the game fully lives up to the buzz because it takes the mancala concept and reapplies it in an interesting way.

Five Tribes is a list of arbitrary rules welded to a victory point system that just barely qualifies as a game. The theme is potentially interesting, but instead serves as nothing more than window dressing for a tedious exercise in following rules. The lack of connection between theme and rules made it difficult to remember rules or even care about the outcome of the game.

We loved the mancala style of play and all of the different scoring options available. The bidding system to determine turn order (especially in a two player game) was super well done as well.

The mechanics and choices you make in this game are really deep and meaningful. This is also a very unique game because the way you move the meeples is not found in any other board game. This game is well known for analysis paralysis because there are so many choices to make. That is the biggest complaint about the game, but the good thing is that it's not a long game.

1 play with 4P - It took a few rounds to "get the hang" of strategy, but I really like games with multiple ways to get VP.

Really interesting combos are all over the board - sometimes can lead to AP trying to find the "best" one though.

A Mancala szisztéma, annyit lépünk, ahányan egy lapkán vagyunk mechanizmus nagyon jó kis csavarral került bele ebbe a játékba. Négy különböző színű és tudású meeple-ből random 3 kerül fel minden lapkára és miközben haladunk velük egyet-egyet elszórunk az útközben érintett lapkára. Ahova megérkezünk egy színben minden meeplet felhasználunk a tudásuk szerint. A játékban rengetegféle győzelmi pont szerzési lehetőség van, minden játék más. Érdekes, színes, egyetlen baja van, hogy rettentő AP veszélyes. Kicsit a Mangrovia alá lőném, de jár ennek is a 7 pont elsőre. Tetszett!

Five Tribes is a unique offering from Days of Wonder as it is a bit above the weight of the games they are typically known for. However, it's quite straightforward in how it plays and that is what I love most about it. I've heard the criticism that it is prone to extremely long periods of downtime while someone is thinking of their move and that is a valid complaint. However, I try to get people to not care so much about making the best move and simply going for the first good move they see. In that way it speeds up the game and the scores are usually very tight. It's an elegant design that is matched by DoW's usual production standard. Definitely top ten material for me.

Mancala meets set collection.  I'm really bad at mancala, but this game is pretty interesting overall.  The gameplay is highly tactical and can lead to some long turns.  Fortunately, the rules are very straightforward and easy to learn.  I'm not 100% sure how balanced the djinns are.  I've also only played this with 2, and I think the turns could go super long with more.

There is just way way way too much down time for my taste. In between turns can take 5 minutes per player, with AP prone peeps taking even longer.

One of the finest games of 2014. Like all Days of Wonder games, it has beautiful components. The game is elegant, with a mancala mechanic for choosing your actions that provides plenty of possibilities. I like that there are several different kinds of meeples that you collect, some scoring immediately, others working for set collection, and still others enabling you to take special bonuses (via the djinns). Overall, a great game with plenty of decisions and a short play time.

UPDATE: The expansion is really great, and blends beautifully with the base game. This is something I just enjoy playing over and over again. I really enjoy the challenge of trying to find out how much to bid and then what moves to take. It's especially interesting to be later in turn order and see how much you can make the most of what options are left for you.

From my couple of plays I'm really intrigued by this and the options it provides, though I find it really difficult to figure out 'how to win' so to speak, as from the start of the game there's such huge variety of options that it would take forever to find the best option (And I'm just not that kind of player).

Looking forward to getting a better handle on it to be able to see the golden moves sharper =-)

I am not a fan of some of the design decisions that went into Five Tribes. I'll start with the djinn cards. They won't add replayability for me because I won't play the game more than a few times. Instead they create rules overhead, randomness, and they require players to track which meeples go back into the bag and which ones don't, which is tedious. Next, there's the set collection cards. They feel less tacked on than the djinn cards but they make it more difficult to discern who's winning without slowing down what can be an already slow game. They could have been excised. There is an unhealthy tradeoff in Five Tribes between playing quickly and playing optimally, and the tradeoff is exacerbated by the inclusion of so many ways to score points. I suspect that they were added to increase replayability but, for me anyway, they will do the opposite.

There are pieces of the game I like. Bidding for turn order with VPs is a good idea. And there is a healthy amount of interaction and cross-incentivization on the board. But at the end of the day, I think the design could have used an editor. Five Tribes might have been a good small-box 2p game.

Enjoyable first play of this. I got totally housed by my opponent who focused a lot on gaining djinns that synergized well together.

I will say this: Five Tribes is chaotic as all get-out, so just feel it out and do your best. There are simply too many permutations to calculate the most optimal move on your turn without annoying all of your fellow players (and it's guaranteed you'll be unable to do any meaningful planning on your opponents' turns due to the board state changing so much leading up to your turn).

Brain-burning puzzle every turn and the best implementation of the mancala mechanic.  Downtime between turns gets pretty bad as this game lends itself to severe analysis paralysis.

Early game drags as players have lots of options to evaluate. As choices neck down over the course of the game play speed improves. 
At 2 there is the possibility of having a run-away (i.e. one person gets ahead with no way to catch up). Not my favorite, but the theme and components are very nice. Would like to get a few more plays to see how it changes with better understanding of strategy.

Really awesome game that makes you think abstractly about the routes you might take with your meeples.

Since each gold is worth one point at the end of the game, there is a constant struggle between spending money vs. the rewards.

I'm glad I played it. It is now good and out of my system ... I hated every second of it, from the first move all the way through final scoring! I hated having to stare at the board looking for all the available moves, figure out how much to bid, worry about which meeples to leave behind and not set up the following players ... UGH, what a horribly annoying game!!

1 play, prototype, 4er

It has a mancala like mechanism, like Trajan except everyone is playing on a common board. We played it wrong, totally forgetting about how you needed to match a token on your final space! But I'm not sure that would've changed our impressions much: WAY too much down time, since you couldn't do much planning until it was your turn (other players' actions could totally change the board for you). 

I suppose I'll have to withhold final judgement until trying it again with the right rules, but probably with fewer players. Current tentative rating: low.

RATING: 8
The actual gameplay of this game is fairly easy to teach.  There is a layout of tiles with different colored meeples strewn about.  You pick up all the meeples from one tile and move them across other tiles.  When you drop a meeple onto your final tile in your move you collect all the meeples from that tile of that color and perform the meeple and tile's special action.

However, actually playing the game is a lot to grok.  I, myself, did very poorly in my first play because I just didn't decipher the board very well.  I was missing moves that would have been better options for myself while completely setting up my opponents who went after me.  That's really what this game is about too, managing your moves so that you get the most benefit from them while providing as little as possible to the other players.  You have to be really careful with this though because there are a lot of players who will slow this game to a standstill trying to discover the perfect move on each turn.  While I played poorly I can at least say I didn't hold up the game with AP.

I think it is an incredibly clever game, despite it's cutesy exterior and bright colors it kind of surprised me with its depth and complexity and I play a lot of very heavy games.  It's probably mostly because I just wouldn't normally expect a game of this weight from Days of Wonder or Bruno Cathala.  In the end I enjoyed it and it is definitely something I want to play more and challenge myself to do better at.

It is also definitely worth mentioning that the components are of mostly the highest quality.  My victory point chits weren't punched the best and were a little hard to punch out without tearing and getting a little extra paper attached.  But everything else is sturdy and beautiful.  Be warned though there is giong to be a lot of pastel colored wood out on the play area at once which can make it kind of hard to decipher a camel from a meeple, from a palace, etc.  The method we used to help with this is to stand up all the meeples but lay camels, palm trees, and palaces flat.

After several plays this game has elevated itself in my eyes even more.  The main reason for that being I think you can legitimately follow any one of several different strategies and win this game.  That's always a great boon when a game like this has so many different scoring opportunities and all of them are viable.  I've seen clever use of the assassins, collecting huge lots of resources, taking advantage of powerful djinn powers, and lining up rows and rows of viziers and elders all be winning or at least very close to winning strategies as well as others and hybrids thereof.  Such a well designed and smoothly running game.

First try, and I like it but am a bit apprehensive. Some mechanics, specifically the meeple movement, I find truly interesting, at the same time the game seems a bit convoluted to me. Maybe that's just being overwhelmed after learning it and the first play through, maybe it is not streamlined enough, time and more plays will tell and I will adjust my rating from the 7 I have set now.
It for sure looks gorgeous (those djinn cards!) and I am interested to explore it more. We played with 2 which worked well, I am looking forward to 3 but am apprehensive of 4: the turns are quite long and solitary, with 4 we could look at long downtime which I don't really appreciate.
Played with 4: downtime is not bad at all, the bidding gets a lot more interesting with 4. Overall I enjoy this game a little bit more everytime we play. My apprehension has completely disappeared.

Setup is pretty quick to set up despite its modularity and the game takes very little time to explain. After playing it for a while, I realize that the difficulty of the game comes from just how big the board is but I also noticed that games go by pretty quickly.

I really enjoy that it is a non-linear/2-dimensional Mancala game and I sort of wish that I'd have thought of it first.

Finally I could try this game!
I really enjoyed it, the Mancala style turns, the different powers of the meeples and the design.

I think the lots of colours is quite disturbing: the color of the meeples, the different camels, the tiles, the numbers and icons on the tiles.. so it can be confusing.

The more I think about Five Tribes, the more I like it. I sometimes struggle with AP, but there's always something fun to do in 5T, so it's easy for me to shrug, make an immediately satisfying move, and stop trying to read minds. 

Now musing on a variant where most of the meeples are replaced with Starbursts...

RATING: 5
Played 3 times in one afternoon.  I like (part of) this design - it presents a puzzle that rewards creative thinking. However, it can reduce 'gamerz' to absolute paralysis, weighing the auction , then every move thereafter. 

Despite the Djinns (who give some direction) it is a tactical game, and this does not suit some.

It needs to be played at speed, weighing up and deciding on the best 3 paths before your turn. However you will then have to recalculate when it gets to them because the board will have changed.

The board, meeple, Djinn setup and the variable game end conditions meant each of my three games played out very differently, with the different parts of the points salad taking centre plate in each game. There was some interaction, competition for yellow meeples and the desire to not leave juicy control pickings kept participants as much interested in fellow players as their own path.

After 3 plays in one day have not had the inclination to play again. Mainly because I won't play it with any one who suffers from AP, or anyone who might suffer from AP. And also because I find balance between tactics and strategy is too heavily weighted towards the tactical for the length of play.

The Mancala-like system of "movement" in this game is a lot of fun, but really does lead to a fair amount of analysis paralysis. I've heard it described as a "point salad" game, with a lot of different ways to score. This works out great, as you never really know what your strategy will be until you see what's available to you on your turn.

RATING: 7
An interesting game for sure, but it has a bit of a problem with analysis--it is easy to make your move as the first player, because the board remains intact during the re-stocking phase and your plan is simple enough to execute.  The problem lies in that board changes, often significantly, as each player takes their move.  If you're not first player, you will often have to re-evaluate your turn from the start.  In one sense that tends to keep players engaged during the other player's turn, if you're next.  But if you're the fourth player, you might as well get up and go for a walk while the other players take their turns, because everything will change by the time it gets to you.

Point salad?  No, not really, just multiple areas to focus on for many different paths to victory.  It's great in that respect.

Overall arc and timing of the game--excellent.

Balance--decent.  The djinn are not well balanced at all, with several being obviously more valuable than others.  But since Djinn are not necessary to win, it's not a huge issue.  There should be a way to clear a stagnant face up pool though.

Artwork--decent.  Lots of wood.  Like all these annoyingly movable lay out the tiles to form the play area games, it really should have a board with recessed areas for the tiles to fit in.  It would also help to have 9 marked areas for the resource cards since 9 is not a visually automatic identifying number....you often have to count out the cards remaining.

Great design with a perfect balance between meaty gameplay and simple mechanics. A innovative twist of the mancala mechanic, surprisingly heavy for a DOW title. I really enjoy planning the best move with limited resources according to game state.

That being said the game is not without problems. AP hell with the wrong players. Scoring is obfuscated (if you need a pad to calculate scoring, something is wrong). Weaker player can give the game to following players. Djinn can swing the game like creatures in Cyclades.

Still a very good experience for me, I would very much like to play again.

Family game on a sort of grid mancala. Pick up all the meeples on a tile, then distribute them along a set of orthogonally adjacent tiles. Collect meeples on the space you end at, taking some action depending on the colour, and also an action for the type of tile.

Scoring is a point salad with some eight different sources of VP.

There are significant changes between turns, so play is almost entirely tactical; worse, there's enough to think about that there is painful potential for analysis paralysis.

It's entertaining enough in play but a disappointing total package.

Five tribes is a brainburner, but it plays pretty fast. The different tribes (colours of meeples) give you points for different things and you need to get points in all categories to win, and you need to keep an eye on what the other players are doing in order to find the right balance. There is a small element of luck in what cards are available at the market and what djinns are available.

Way too tactical and AP prone for my tastes. Nearly everything is calculable and simply staring at the board for 20 minutes to find the most effective move that doesn't "give" the game to the next player isn't fun for me.

There's some neat things going on, but ultimately some set ups can be really weird and problematic due to one person messing up and giving another person a huge lead.

EDIT: I appreciate the game a bit more after playing it a couple more times. Definitely not my type of game but I can see the appeal. Just still way too AP prone for me. The expansion attempts to fix a few of the problems with the base game such as having hidden powers to reduce AP, but still not enough in my eyes.

Five Tribes is one of my all time favorite games. It blends the accessibility of Days of Wonder's other games with a deep strategic element.

2-4 players. Move meeples and, depending on the color of the last meeple you move, perform that tribes action and earn victory points. Could have been a bit less tactical for my tastes perhaps. And I don't really like bidding for turn order. It really doesn't work at all in the two player game - it needs to be fixed with some house rule (to prevent one player from taking consecutive rounds in the same turn), or play with 3-4 players only. With four players there is a bit of "downtime" while waiting for the others to do their stuff (planning ahead is pointless, it is too frequently thwarted by the other players moves). But play it on three and it's a really good game. I like it. Score 7.

By far the better of the two major Cathala releases for 2014.  It integrates the mancala mechanic quite well.  It's definitely FAR more tactical than strategic though, so I have a hard time defining this as a strategy game.  Nonetheless, I usually enjoy playing and won't pass up a game when asked.  The "usual" is reserved for those games played against someone whom you can only sit there, mouth agape, asking "did you REALLY just set that up for the next player?"

Oh the hype. I don't usually buy in to it, but that doesn't mean I don't want to play the games of course.
The last couple of years (like say, since [thing=27746][/thing]) Days of Wonder hadn't put out games that interested me a lot. And this game looked to be more of that, but then they started saying how this would be one of their heaviest games. One of? Probably, but not the heaviest, I think [thing=27746][/thing] is probably still their heaviest. But this game is not a superfiller. Bruno Cathala has done some very meh games and some quite good games like [thing=21763][/thing], so that didn't say much for me.
The theme for this game is completely pasted on so let's not bother with that. It has a fun mechanism where you pick up a group of meeples and drop off one on each tile you pass over and the last tile is triggered with the color you dropped there. This might lead to AP as there are a lot of options, especially early on, but the best options should be quite obvious. All you have to do is figure out which of those is the best for your strategy. And the way the scoring is constructed does open up the game so multiple different strategies can be explored. In our 4 player game everyone was doing something different. But that didn't mean we weren't doing things that didn't annoy the other players. There will always be overlap between players.
I must say that this is a very solid design indeed. Hype worthy? Maybe not, but certainly worth a good deal of attention.

Initial rating: 7.2/10

Enjoyable game in a puzzle kind of way.  Can be very AP prone towards the end.  I think 3-player is the sweet spot of the game.  There is too much board turn over in a 4 player and the bidding for turn order in 2 player is wonky.

Play badly or be buried in AP? Bid for first but if you lose out, pay points for nothing?

There are a series of poor decisions that have gone in to making this game. They are too many to count. Played in a family-friendly quick manner this might be interesting, but how is that possible? Everything you do is open information, so the best move is clearly there for you to spot. Anything less is sub-optimal.

This might be salvageable with 2 players. With any more, it's a snoozefest of AP and indifference.

The most complex game that my little girl (8yo) has played so far, which she handled with ease and beat her parents  during the first 5 games we played! It is great to see her so overjoyed and dancing after scoring a win that I do not mind losing every time. It is also a rare game that my reluctant wife doesn't complain too much about playing. So all these have made the game permanently special for me, and it will always remain in my possession.:)

Amazing!
There is much going on in this game: The unusual "Mancala" mechanic, modular board, collecting trading goods, Djinns act as special powers, auction for turn order, area control, people effects, area effects and much more. And the different mechanics interact with each other. Different strategies emerge depending on your choices and the options that present themselves to you in a given game.
The Arabian style fantasy theme is nice, materials and artworks are great.
It's an awesome game with a good level of complexity.
Yes, it can be tough to play because it is very hard to see and weight all possible moves (especially on the full board at the beginning of the game). You have to like that challenge and to decide more through instinct than exact calculation.

in short:
+ theme
++ mechanics
+ modular board
+ great artworks (especially the Djinns)
+ materials
- expensive
- can be hard to play ?

Jól összerakott és gyönyőrűszépen kivitelezett játék. A játék alapaja egy négyzetrács mezőire adaptált Mancala-mechanizmus.

A négyzetrács mezői tele vannak rakva különböző színű bábúkkal és amikor valakire sor kerül, felveszi az összes bábút egy mezőről és addig lépked élszomszédosan - egy-egy bábút mindenhol hátrahagyva - amíg el nem fogynak a bábúk. Azon a mezőn aztán, ahova az utolsó bábút tette, két akciót is végrehajt. Az egyik akció attól függ, hogy milyen színű volt a bábú, amit oda rakott, a másik pedig attól, hogy melyik mezőn állt meg.

Minden színhez más akció tartozik és persze a mezők is mind különböző tipusú akciókat adhatnak. De vannak megszerezhető dzsin lapkák is, amelyek mind különböző folyamatos előnyt adnak annak a játékosnak, aki megszerezte.

Mivel fontos a játékossorrend, minden kör elején licitálunk a játékos sorrendre. De ez csak egy egykörös licit, ami nem húzza el a játékidőt, csak keménnyebbé teszi a taktikai döntéseket, hisz a pénz egy-az-egyben váltódik győzelmi pontra a játék végén.

A játék folyamán fokozatosan fogynak a bábúk a térképről, mígnem a végén már nem lehet lépni. A tapasztalat az, hogy az elején bár több a lehetőség, a játékosok nem számolnak végig minden lehetőséget, így viszonylag gyorsan lépnek. A játék vége felé viszont már egyre kevesebb a lehetőség, de mivel mindenki végig számloja az összes lehetőséget, lassabban lépnek. 

A mechanizmusok elég változatosak ahhoz, hogy mindenki megtalálja a maga útját a legtöbb pont megszerzéséhez.

I'm usually hesitant to give a "9" to a game I've played only once, but I really, really enjoyed Five Tribes.  It isn't just eye candy, it really does have a lot of things going on.  That said, I didn't find myself in "analysis paralysis" like some people say the game induces.  I love that there are many ways to get points, that the tiles change position each game, and that you bid for turn order.  I felt with these aspects, and the randomization of the Djinns/market, that it has a lot of replayability!

RATING: 8
Wow, finding the Mancala-style combinations of meeples in this game is incredibly satisfying! This is one of those games that brings the best of Euro-style and Ameritrash games together.  Euro games are praised for their excellent game mechanics and satisfying points scoring, but often lack in rich, aesthetically pleasing experiences. Conversely, Ameritrash games are characterized as being highly themeatic and flashy, but a bit shallow on gameplay.  I think Five Tribes brings the best of both worlds together in a glorious and rich gaming experience, without compromising in any category.  A beautiful and satisfying game.

I'm so enamored by this game! I can't stop thinking about it. I got to learn the game at Gen Con, me and my friend waited by Bruno's table so we could learn from him and both him and the game were a blast. Who knew how hilarious Bruno was? Me and my friend waited by the doors three hours before they opened the next day to rush in and be one of the first 50 to get the game and get it signed, another treat! Though I felt bad getting it signed in front of a line of people that was just behind us and was getting told the game sold out... we should have maybe waited to get it signed haha. 

Anyways I have played the game as often as I could since I got back home and I love it so much. There is so many interesting things to do every turn and it feels so satisfying to make big plays. The rules are very easy to teach and it seems that right away people are making strategic and clever plays. I thought the game could have some AP problems but have never found any issue with the game taking any longer than around an hour. The bidding at the beginning of each turn is so interesting as this is really where the champion of the game is made. Every bit of design feels so clever and tied in with every other element, like the cards not being replaced immediately as they are purchases. This mirrors the rest of the game as decisions diminish each round. This ties back into the bid for turn order being so important. If you want to do something that turn bid high, as it may be gone before you get to it. But getting to something immediately doesn't make the game for you either, if you see no good move, or you got outbid, the layout is ever changing as every player before you manipulates the board and cards until your turn and a great turn can arise out of that. Its a very tactical game and with the Djinns and some of the scoring elements, especially with the sets of cards and yellow meeples, it is a strategic game too. 

I really can't say enough good things about the game. With more plays I may move the game to a ten even, something I don't do lightly! Bruno, if you read this I want to think you personally for the great opportunity to learn this game from you and for the hours of wonderful fun the game provides me and my friends.

3/17/2017: I have played this game several times and this has become one of my wife's favorite games from Bruno Cathala. This game is essentially a point salad game that allows you to gain points from various ways. 

The interesting element of the game is the implementation of Mancala as the main mechanic. With the combination of Mancala mechanic and point salad element, it allows players to pursue different strategy in the game. 

Additionally, the auction mechanic for the turn order also allows people to either execute the action that they want or block someone from their obvious move. 

This is a very easy game to teach and hard to master. I am always willing to bring this game to the table! :)

I'd like to play again. The game felt very tactical, which was a turn-off at first. Yet as the game progressed, I have to admit that I was more engaged and felt enough tension to end up liking the experience. Solid game-play and an almost abstract sensibility combine to make for something interesting. Repeat plays will, I hope, confirm my suspicions.

Absolute great design. You can plan ahead, but it will probably get wrecked unless you are willing to pay for it. Many different ways to win this game.

Only complaint...AP (Analysis Paralysis). That has never bothered me too much. I try to not take too much time to make a decision. If I miss something...I miss it! But, I realize the search for the best move is the enjoyment of the game. So Analize to you heart's content...just don't mess up my move!

I can see the appeal of Five Tribes.  The game is accessible and has nice components.  There are a lot of decisions to be made and the board is constantly changing.  But there is virtually no long term strategy.  It is purely tactical to just optimize your current move.  At least in 4 player, it's nearly impossible to think more than one turn ahead.  I could see two player being a tense chess match, but that's not really for me either.  Also, there seem to be some minor balance issues.  Djinns can be really powerful while Viziers and Assassins are very underwhelming.  It's a fine game, but there's nothing that would make me want to pick it from a pile of other games.

Includes Wilwit and Dhenim Djinns

This game is phenomenal, but has a couple limitations. one is that some people can freeze up and not make decisions in a speedy manner, which causes the game to drag, and for me, there are a few too many slave/helper/fakir cards). On the plus side, I've played about 10 times solo, and the official variant is fun and challenging as well. This game has an interesting and fun theme, phenomenal components, a very high strategy, is good for beginners and more, a fun bidding system for turn order each round, and some (but not a ton) interaction between players.

Before playing, Five Tribes both intrigued me and scared me, as I had previously had bad experiences with the mancala mechanism in Trajan. While this seems more complex as it is implemented here, and essentially the entirety of the game, I think it is less punishing.

I find Five Tribes to be a beautiful puzzle, as you try to work out how to get even a decent action without setting up your opponents. The bidding system was initially a headache but it's growing on me, and really takes a few plays to know what a turn's worth is and the acceptable margin between that and your bid. I just love the way they have implemented the mancala mechanism, and how freaking fun it is.

Five Tribes is fairly clever and presents some interesting choices to players. The only real downsides here are that the game is very dry and very tactical - the situation on the board is going to be totally different by the time your turn comes around, so it's hardly worth trying to plan things out ahead of time. This can be especially painful with the analysis paralysis-prone, as the clock doesn't really start ticking until it's your turn, and it's really a stare-until-you-see-the-absolute-best-move exercise at that point. Solid if unspectacular.

It's a good game, but I didn't like as much as many other people do. It's a bit of a puzzle, but you can't plan ahead very much since the actions of other players will change what is possible for you to do. When I play board games, I like to plan my move while others are playing, but you can't really do that with this game, so I tended to feel at a loss for what to do when my turn came around.

Although not a bad game, I just don't find any great excitement here.  Strategy is rather pointless, as it seems to boil down to just calculating the biggest scoring move each turn.  I like the mancala mechanic, but not the point salad aspect.  I don't mind playing it, but prefer other games.

A game that does not really focus either too much on a strategical or tactical scale but instead combines both approaches nicely. At first one would think that such a brainburning game, which it is, focusses heavy on strategy aspects but there are lots of small tactical decisions to be made and random additions throughout the game. Add pleasing artwork as well as beautiful components and game mechanics that work nicely and play smoothly and you'll get Five tribes. And yes, don't get too many people prone to AP at the same time to the table!

RATING: 8
Lots to think about (but not overwhelming) and great wooden bits. Having a bid for turn order is usually a sign of lazy game design but the way it works here is really well done. You have an auction track (kind of similar to Homesteaders or Speicherstadt) and each person just gets one bid on the track. Bid too little and you might miss out on that big combo you were planning, but bid too much and you could end up losing more points than you gain on that turn.

There's a decent amount of luck but probably no more than most middle-weight euros. If the perfect Djinn comes out at the right time, or the right cards come out of the deck, a player can rack up on points. Rating could go up or down based on how this affects future games.

Great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fun in that it's a rather odd mechanic in a game that is  successfully implemented (not just a gimmick). I particularly enjoy being in the middle of moving meeples and then realizing the huge mistake that I've made, quickly detouring so that I can then pick up a few assassins and kill off the great tile I accidentally set up for my opponent. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game has really grown on me. My first impression was that it was kind of a big mess with too many things going on and not enough cohesion, but once you get the hang of it and start to know what good moves look like it gets really fun. The bidding for turn order mechanic is genius and pulling off a cool/unorthodox move that works out is very satisfying. 2 player game is quite different than the 3-4 player versions (you can have consecutive moves quite easily with 2 players, in the 3-4 player game you have to engineer that situation far more carefully) but both have their charms. The game components are all excellent as well (camels + palm tress + palaces!) My biggest complaint is that I wish you couldn't kill other players' meeples with assassin, it's not like they're doing anything once a player gets them so it has no strategic effect to it, it's just mean.

I love this game.  I LOOOOOOVE this game.  At no point will I ever be able to say enough about how much I love this game.  But since that's not helpful, here goes:

I love Days of Wonder games and I love games designed by Bruno Cathala.  So far when the two meet, it's always a win.

The theme is exciting, set in the aesthetic of Scheherazade and filled with genies, intrigue, etc.  Yes, most of it is abstract, but use you g*& d$%^ imagination.  "Pasted-on theme" is just such a dumb term anyway.

The art is spectacular.  I just want to look at this game and it's components all day long.  Each djinn card is gorgeous, and, I mean, camel meeples!  CAMEL MEEPLES!!!

Most importantly, this game is mechanically one of the most fun and engaging games I've ever played.  It's essentially a beefed up mancala, wherein you pick up all meeples from a tile and deposit them one at a time until ending on a tile with at least one meeple of the same color, activating the ability of that color.  Each ending move creates new abilities and options.  The variety of possibilities each turn is dramatic. (note: if you don't like playing games that could produce AP, or playing with people who have it, this isn't one for you).

I find this game endlessly replayable thanks to the choice to make the main play space a grid of tiles rather than a static board.  I have never had the same strategy twice, and I enjoy a game in which my strategy at the outset implodes by turn three and I have to adjust.  It's possible to disengage when it's not your turn, but you will be 100% lost when your attention returns to the table.  So it commands your attention.  And I LOVE a game that keeps everyone's eyes on the table rather than their phones.

**final note**  I purchased this game AFTER Days of Wonder switched the slave commodity cards into fakir cards.  I did not want any game on my shelf in which a primary path to victory was human trafficking.  I am SO glad they made this change.  Now instead of buying slaves, I am recruiting fakirs (Islamic mendicants) in hopes of gaining powerful genies on my side.  The djinns produce major effects, so you simply cannot do without them.  And now I can play this game and never have that moment of terrible discomfort as a game set in a hyper-fantasized story realm broods with an unnecessary dose of historical grotesqueness.  Kudos to Days of Wonder for fixing what, I think, was just a total bonehead oversight on the part of the publisher (a great one) and designer (one of my favorites).

Fantastic game with so many layers of strategy, and so many differing paths to victory. I love the fact that you can change your strategy throughout the game depending on both the board & what other players are focusing on.  A few of the Djins are underpowered in 2 player games, with their powers being focused more on the multiplayer element, but I usually remove them if not playing with 3 or 4 (after a few games occurred when all 3 of the Djinns available were of this ilk) . The production values and artwork are beautiful. This game is not for everyone. You can suffer from AP as you have so many options & are worried about what you will leave for everyone else. But its biggest drawback to some, is its greatest asset to others & if you and your group are ok with that their is so much to like here.

What a beautifully designed game! Mancala on steroids. We thankfully bought the first edition, before DOW was forced to redesign it, which IMO makes it that much more special. Most of the "low" ratings on this are simply ignorant and are not justified. Throwing a fit over the inclusion of historically accurate "slave" cards shows how art, ingenuity, unique character and originality is muted and stiffled by PC lunatics and if you are offended by them, YOU are the problem.

Any way, Love the strategy, love the design and artwork and my wife and I love bringing this out to the table with friends. It's an easy game to pickup but still challenging and fun! Must-have for any game collection!

A fun and interesting game from Days of Wonder that I almost bought without playing just due to my Days of Wonder fandom.  I've played a couple of times and it's pretty fun.  Wouldn't mind adding it to my collection but it's not a "must have".  The "mancala" method of moving and collecting rewards is interesting and brings some fun thinking to this game.

RATING: 7.5
This game is great for those with the ability to mentally manipulate spatial relationships with some facility. Otherwise it can be painfully slow.

While the ability to tactically optimize each turn is essential, the bidding for player order component will make or break the game for otherwise equally skilled opponents. 

The opportunities for double moves that skillful bidding can create even in 3-4 player games is not to be overlooked.

Great game. Options constantly evolve with each turn. Lots of different strategies can be successful. Heads-up play has interesting dynamic by each player taking two turns each a round creating scope for back-to-back turns and huge point scoring set-ups. Only downside is all the different options (and possibly bright colours) triggers analysis paralysis in some.

I really enjoy this one and so did most of my playgroup members, however it does present players with multiple choices each turn that can be overwhelming and therefore is prone to A.P. The production is the typical high quality you would expect from Days of Wonder, and the art style and theme is engaging (slavery aside) and fits the game perfectly. You can try a long term strategy in this game but the meeple movements often mean that playing more tactically is a much better plan overall as the actions other players take and in what order is very much the focal point of the game.

RATING: 7
A perfectly pleasurable game but it isn't great.  The decision space is mathematically enormous at the outset which definitely adds some interesting decision making.  

The play time is nice at about 45 minutes unless you have someone with extreme AP.  The rules are shockingly short but at the same time slightly lacking in clarify, that said it is a simple game to understand.

The setup is a big of a drag as you have to build the map and then populate it with a huge sack of meeples.

The Djinns provide some interesting abilities but they ultimately feel almost like a more complicated add on to an otherwise crisp game.

Ultimately it's a point salad abstract game with some take that elements and some interesting decisions to be made.

The components are excellent as well.

Like I said before a good but not great game.

I like the additions of the Artisans expansion and it feels like it almost "completes" the game.

I enjoy Mancala and this game takes some of that idea and puts it into a Euro game. You have so many ways of gaining victory points, you have a lot of options in front of you, but no matter what you pick, you always feel like you are in it until the end (even if you actually aren't). The turn order bidding adds in a lot of fun and strategy to the game. One that I like to pull out as the game goes by quite quickly when you are playing.

This game has grown on me.

With repeating plays the amount of AP has gone down considerably, to a point where we play a full 2p game in less than 1h.

The amount of double-turn we are experiencing also went down.

Gameplay is really enjoyable but there are a few things that bug me:

1) There is quite a bit of luck involved with the way market cards show up.

2) The Djin that lets you exchange a slave for a random good can be really good, or really bad, depending on your luck

3) The 2 Djins that let you take control of a tile, seam out of place, they go against the nature of the game.

YMMV

Note: Finally tried the solo version, and it works really great. Might be worth getting this for the solo play alone.

I thought that this game would be heavily bogged down by the plethora of decisions that needed to be made on a turn, and because the board can shift immediately prior to you move. However, I was pleasantly surprised, the game actually moves along at a good pace and there is quite a bit of game for how quickly it plays. The game is quite forgiving it seems too. If you feel like you made some big mistakes early on, stick with it, the game keeps everyone guessing as to who is in the lead. It's really great.

Only game I've played where AP affected me more than anyone else at the table. Too many options at the beginning with no clear way to find the optimal move. Or strategy. Once you start to identify a plan or strategy, the number of options have diminished and you find yourself scrambling to choose a strategy from a set of completely uncompelling strategies. Toward the endgame, when you want to stay in contact with competitors, the options to put your strategy forward are few and far between. 

What makes me resent the game is how it entices you to develop a strategy, only to completely change the foundation of that strategy multiplied by the number of people going before you. It is impossible to efficiently plan ahead, and we have the game's system to blame rather than our fellow players. Absolutely hate how you can have a plan and then have to start over at the beginning of your turn instead of making your play. A LOT of downtime between turns in a 4 player game since all can really do is wait and/or read the list of  overwhelming djinn powers for the umpteenth time. 

The least fun I've had playing a board game in a LONG time. The continual dread of agricola is more bearable because at least in that game you have little sheep to push around and the other farmers aren't dropping crap in the middle of your field and stealing all your vegetables.

RATING: 7
Five tribes is a game played on a random arrangement of tiles which start with three random meeples. On a round, you bid for turn order, and then resolve your turn. Your turn consists of picking a tile, taking all the meeples on that tile and allocating the meeples, one at a time mancala style, adjacent first to your start tile, but thereafter adjacent to the last tile you put a meeple on. You can't go diagonally, you can't immediately return to a tile you just left, and you have to end by placing your last meeple on a tile that has the same color meeple on it. You trigger the action on the last tile you land on. And you trigger the color meeple you used on the last tile, removing all meeples of that color on that tile. Different colored meeples do different special things. If you ever remove all the meeples off a tile, you claim it for your own, and you get the points of the tile at game end. There's also a set collection market thing going on. And you can buy special action cards that do different things and score points at game end.

The game is largely tactical, where you are looking for the best move every turn. What other people do on their turn could potentially screw your options, or open up new options. The auction for turn order is based off a fixed track, where you bid 0 , 1, 3, 5, 8, 12 or 18, and with the exception of 0, only a single player can take a spot. If you pay a lot to get first crack at the board this turn, you're likely not to go very early in the next turn.

The game ends when a player runs out of markers to claim tiles, or when there are no legal movements anymore. The game gets really interesting as it nears the end of the game, as options become terribly limited. What to bid for turn order becomes very important, as few moves are likely to justify bidding much, but the first move will likely return a lot more than any other move.

I liked this game a lot. There's a lot to take into account, and it challenges you to think on your turn, but it's pretty quick. We didn't really run into AP issues on our play, but it's a game where that could be a problem.

[thing=157354][/thing] is a well knitted game, smart, and with some great art and sturdy components. However, the game sure didn't grabbed my attention - it is fine, don't get me wrong, but it is so detached from its theme, that I didn't felt it at all, not even a little bit. This is so noticeable because I do enjoy so much a good theme, and Arabian themed games usually have a mystic veil on them that attracts me, specially when you link a game to the world of [i]1001 Nights[/i]. By the way, I haven't felt a game so off its pretended since [thing=102680][/thing], and it is curious to me that both these games share the central mechanic of the mancala.
	
Now that I talked about it, the mancala works beautifully in the game, and it is the major source of fun taking the meeples, dropping them on the way, until you reach your desireable spot to take the meeples that of the same color and activating the type of meeples and the tile they were on. This is basically the whole game. Except that, at first, you bid for turn order. It is not really an auction - there is a track, in some of the spaces there is a cost, which you pay if you want to put your marker there. If someone wants to pay more to put in a space in front of you, they can, and there is nothing you can do (you can't pay more). If you put your marker on the 0 (zero) spot, you put it in the first space, but you can be pushed behind if others put their markers also on the zero spot but did it after you. Once this is decided, following the round order, players take meeples from a tile, leaving meeples along the way, until you reach the place you want. You activate the meeples of the same color of the one you hold for last - you take them from the tile, no matter which color they are, and some go to the box, others (yellow/vizirs and white/elders) you keep for yourself, for later use. If you take the last meeples of a tile, you take the tile for you, placing a camel of your color on it (tiles are worth points, and also, in some of them you can also claim (if they are already there), or put, palm trees and castles - which are also worth points in the end game).

The game ends when someone is out os camels or there is no more legal moves to be made with the meeples left in the board. The player with the most points wins!

I thought I would feel the downgrade of options on the game as time passes way more than I did. But I was fine with it - sure, there are less options as the game advances, since the board will have less and less meeples, but then usually the game changes a little bit from activating meeples to claiming tiles (and putting palm trees and castles). And, even when the options were really slim, the game end was just a few minutes away.

The interaction in the game is mostly indirect - taking what someone else maybe wanting before them. The assassins (red) can kill vizirs (yellow) and elders (white) from other players, and this can mean a good deal of points, specially with the vizirs (since they score accordingly to how many players have less than you). There is some tension for the round order bid, but, usually, everyone will do their thing - but, if you play before someone, and you have a good guess of what he/she will be wanting, specially regarding taking hold of tiles, you can prevent him/her by leaving a meeple in a tile that had a single meeple - this can be really useful to put a break in their intentions. But, regarding activation of tiles, there is little to be done.

Anyway, [thing=157354][/thing] plays reasonable fast (around 40-50 minutes) and allows for a fine amount of decision-making for such a short span of time. I also found that playing the game is even a bit relaxing, probably because I enjoy to grab meeples like I'm an angry Arabian djinn! But the lack of real theme make [thing=157354][/thing], overall, just a little above-average game, and it could be a great one.

Finally, there are two things I just could not stop seeing when playing, no matter how hard I tried:

Point salad on a plate of analysis paralysis. It doesn't work badly as a game, the theme is acceptable and it has some interesting mechanics - some people will definitely like it but I personally don't care for this one. In a game where you score points for everything, the goals are diffuse and it doesn't rmatter too much which one(s) you pick. The aim is simply to amass as many points as possible rather than to accomplish any particular objective, if that makes any sense. A good game for those who enjoy that sort of thing, but I don't (I also don't like Viceroy or Egizia).

We played a three player game and I loved it – would be interesting to try with four

This game gives me the feel of Trajan without too many choices as in Trajan – I think a newcomer would get it fairly quickly especially with the provided player boards

Also, it's fairly quick and boils Trajan-like play into a fast game without all the odd regions and such

Played again - Trajan is still the king but this is a fun almost-filler

The best thing about this game is that you can use many different strategies to get points and they are all extremely well balanced. With experienced gamers the end game scoring is almost always very close. The components are good quality and djinns are awesome. However game has some problems too: It is very prone to min-maxing points with every move/analysis paralysis so I highly recommend that you should not play this "extremely seriously" unless your whole group enjoys competitive environment.

Somehow, I feel like Five Tribes is a game that could have come from the hands of Stefan Feld, as it really is a point salad type game with a Mancala mechanic. So, while I do not feel that it is groundbreaking or even very original, I really enjoyed playing it and so did everyone else at the table. All in all, a solid worker placement type game with an interesting twist, but not a game that I am desperate to own: I am not always in the mood for an AP inducing optimization puzzle.

RATING: 7
Was pleasantly surprised by this one. An interesting blend of actions and point systems.

I pre-judged it negatively because of all the meeples and tiles. We played it 2 player, which allowed some advanced planning that might not be possible with 3 or 4 players.

Update with 3 players. A lot of my future moves disappeared in the 3 player game as two players got to muck with the layout between my turns, so any planning in advance just turned into optimizing on my turn. Still enjoyed the game though, and would definitely play this again with any number of players.

Five Tribes borrows heavily from the mancala mechanism of taking all the meeples on one tile and dropping them on a series of adjacent tiles. Bonuses are conveyed both by the type of meeples dropped, actions carried out on final tile, claiming of empty tiles and also set collection of goods. There are at least 8-10 categories for scoring and many folks have pointed out that this ends up being a Feldian point salad game. There is some truth to these claims. Virtually any action you take should yield some form of points directly or indirectly. However, some paths do force you to specialize and invest several turns in order to accrue points. Set collection of goods in particular requires that you grab different types of goods in order to hit the higher returns. However, most point salad scoring games also reward some form of specialization.

What is refreshing about Five Tribes isn't necessarily the scoring but the mancala mechanism. One wonders if the game would be better serve being more Knizian than Feldian. Stripping the scoring to the basic essentials, perhaps even just scoring colored meeples or majorities ala Samurai, might make the game shorter and more streamlined while keeping the core experience of the game. In a 2 player setting, the game is quicker in pace in the early stages, but starts to drag toward the end as options are limited. Instead of dropping meeple on tiles I want, I end up playing defensively to avoid opening up opportunities for my opponent to claim tiles. This really bogs down game play and increases play time unnecessarily.

That said, the game is good if not great. The mancala mechanism is fun and being able to look at the board in totality to find "paths' can be rewarding. I just wish the scoring is streamlined to extract the main essence of playing Five Tribes.

I'm not fond of games like this anymore. I can definitely understand the appeal; the design is simple and straight to the point. 

It just feels like a giant puzzle where all the players are trying to solve it optimally. There's always a best move and the decision space is simply not one that interests me anymore. I don't really want to compete with people to work out where the highest amount of points can be found on a multicoloured smorgasbord.

The djinn cards are annoying in that the iconography isn't clear and having them written on the back of the player aid isn't great.

Maybe it's best with 2 where the downtime is less severe. Playing it with 4 was just not fun. By the last round I wasn't even paying attention to what my opponent's were doing.

All these annoyances just lead to such an uninspiring game. It works, there's nothing broken about it, but it left me with a feeling of emptiness. I just don't care for it.

I'm glad I looked through the hype and purchased this game. There are several relevant paths to victory and every move can be a game changer in the later rounds. I love this as 2P. Can't say enough.

RATING: 3
Horribly designed game based on a novel mechanic.

The mechanic itself leads to a poor experience.  Each player's move will significantly change the board position so it is very difficult to plan your move in advance.  This is prolematic in 2 ways: 1) the once around bidding mechanic makes your position in the turn order chaotic further injecting chaos and destroying strategy and 2) you can't really plan your move while others are doing their move which leads to horrible down time.  The game is VERY "thinky".  I love brain burning games but this game doesn't provide the same reward for brain effort.  And did I mention the downtime?  It's worth mentioning again.  Snore....

I got bored about 1/3 of the way into my first game.  Unlikely to ever play again.

Abstract but interesting puzzle.  Like Trajan, this ends up not triggering AP *too* badly because there's so many options that it doesn't even feel like I can consider them all.

Bids are very tense and probably the biggest part of the game.  General decisions and play are pretty point-salady and calculational, but in a satisfying way that can feel like a plan coming together.

Oct 2017: Rating -2 (to 8)
I enjoy this game every time we play it, but the fact is that we don't play it all that often.  It takes a little longer to set up than other games.  The bidding mechanic also feels really clunky - in 2P, which is how we mostly play, we constantly find ourselves forgetting to bid.  I understand the point of the bidding, but at the same time I think 2P could function just as well without it.  I do intend to look into expansions for this, eventually, but there's already so much going on (in a mostly good way) that I'm afraid of adding anything that would complicate it too much.  The newest expansion does add a 5th player spot, so that will probably be something we pick up for use around the holidays.

Original, Feb 2017:
Why did I wait so long to buy this one?!  I LOVE this game.  It seems simple, but is deceptively so.

The rules took a little longer to explain to my parents, but I think by halfway through the game they started (mostly) understanding the point of it.  I wouldn't consider this a first or second gateway game, but could be one to introduce to someone who has a few games under their belt.  I'd say it's a mid-weight game, just slightly to the lighter side.

Why I love it:
* There are multiple ways to achieve victory.  This means your initial strategy may be foiled, but you can adapt to a new strategy.  You will be putting some thought into every move you make, especially as you get farther into the game.
* There are lots of parts and pieces to this game.  It's overwhelming at first glance but all pulls together surprisingly well to make a rich, complex game.  I think the Djinns are the only part I'd say I could live without, but even they add another layer to consider.  (If you're playing with new gamers and want to make it lighter, you could definitely play without them.)
* Theme fits pretty well.  It's not super immersive, but I can see how every part and piece works together to strengthen the theme.  Each meeple has a fitting purpose, and camels, oasis, and palaces all tie in nicely too.

It's just a great game!  I could go on and on about how much I LOVE this game, but you should try it out yourself.  If it does feel too complex, I'd definitely suggest playing without Djinns for your first game to learn the basics first.

RATING: 7.5
Really enjoyed the game, more than I thought I would actually.  My fear of it being AP prone was well founded, but it's not unbearable.  Can be overwhelming the amount of moves available, and it can be hard to spot as the board fills up. I like how tight the game can get about midway through and I kind of wish it could maintain that more instead of going so quickly from an over-abundance of moves to hardly any.  Final gripe is that I'm not fond of complicated endgame scoring.  I like when you can watch the score and know clearly who is ahead.  This game is more akin to 7 Wonders where you're just taking broad guesses.

Overall though, I really enjoy it.  It was pretty quick to pick up, very fast to play and yet a lot of great decision making present.

Edit: Been liking it more and more every time I play it.

I love random boards and the random Meeple placement is a bonus feature.  Don't play this with people prone to AP.  Each of my friends has a minor level of AP because you can't really plan your move ahead of time.  Someone's move can completely mess yours up.

very interesting mechanically with lots of options but a few downsides for me

[+] a bit of strategy, a lot of tactics, skill required; a lot of options in the begining, then less and less; the fun is figuring out the very strong moves, all the while blocking/ not setting up strong moves from the next players; I liked the bidding on turn-order with points mechanic, short & fast-paced without AP players ^^
[-] point-salad, I don't like final scoring/accounting, I also don't games where options grow more limited as time goes by, it's a bit anti-climatic; AP?

This game is prone to AP. Though it has simple rules and easy to understand actions the movement possibilities are really really hard to plan. With so many possible moves, players are prone to AP and therefor this game is not suited for AP players. I like the game all the combinations between meeple effects, tile effect and djinn powers make the game really interesting. And it's a point salad games no doubt.

Apparently the big hit from GenCon 2014 and very highly rated on BGG.

A good, solid game but nothing spectacular and nothing to warrant the GenCon hype. Innovative, interesting, Mancala/Kalaha-like worker placement (sort of) mechanism. A bit chaotic and a bit of unavoidable downtime as your options are very likely to change significantly during others turns - would be a nightmare with AP-prone players. Completely pasted on theme.

A game I would be happy to play occasionally with the right people if nothing better was available, but not at all a game to buy or seek out.

A masterpiece of a game. Infinite replayability with the modular board and random meeples at start of game.

On more plays, it's just as good with two. Unfortunately, the rulebook isn't too clear on two player setup but BGG is a good resource. A lot of people say that the bidding is broken with two because you can set yourself up to take 4 turns in a row but so can your opponent (they can also block you and vice versa) and it's expensive to do and sometimes it's not even the best move (like when you want your openent to move pieces to set up turns for you at the beginning of the game) so really this point is not valid.

A hit every time with every player so far. Love the possibilities on every turn of every game. The AP potential is certainly there but we've been lucky that all players at home and in the group play at a reasonable pace and don't try to min/ max every move.
Fantastic to look at on the table as well. 
This has the feel of a game with real longevity, and not just because of the random set up - it has an elegant design and is easy to remember how to play once you've had your initial game.

This game seems to have triggered a strong love it/hate it response in almost everyone. I come down somewhere in the middle. I like the Trajan-like puzzle of figuring out the best mandala move each turn and I love how the decision tree actually grows smaller as the game goes on, reigning in the AP and pushing the game to conclusion. This is a great feature in a casual game.

Otherwise, I don't think it's a great game by any measurement. In fact, I'm pretty sure it will get unpleasantly repetitive in regular rotation. Yet, I think it can hold up well as an occasional distraction, as long as no one takes it to seriously. (Such as complaining about a medieval Sultan utilizing a slave market.)

I still think it's a good game to teach people about instinctive play, constant observation & opportunity, however I feel it doesn't evolve enough over time which is becoming one of my primary criteria when scrutinising games. It also has a problem with a mid-game crescendo, then diminishing options in the endgame making it anticlimactic.

I love minimalist Euros but Five Tribes just doesn't do it for me. The mancala mechanic is fine but there's way too much that changes on any given turn to really plan anything and that leads it to be a little chaotic and difficult to follow sometimes. I guess you could argue the turn bidding should be factored in when planning plays but often times the correct play is to low bid and hope your opponent misplays. Speaking of which...

Unintentional kingmaking seems to be pretty common. One slight misstep could swing the entire game toward someone that really didn't deserve it based on that turn's order.

It's visually very pretty, and it is a fairly decent intro game but I don't get it to the table often for a reason.

FT is an AP prone point salad with very good components and a solid flow. Rules aren't very complicated (but i can't call them simple) and the rhytm of game would be good IF there wasn't this big big problem of WAAAY TOO MUCH information on the board that makes the game lacking elegance. As all points salads, it is possible to win following different paths as everyone specializes in some aspects of the game (set collection, viziers, tiles, monuments and so on) and the game seems very very equilibrated.
If i played it again probably the rating would raise as my brain adapts to the avalance on info to elaborate. So far it's almost a 7.

I think my wife said it best: "I enjoy playing this game whether I win or lose." I think that has a lot to do with the fact that it's hard to calculate how well anyone else is doing without fudging some of the numbers. Quite frequently we get to the end of a game and I have no idea how many points people have in coins, sometimes half as much as they started with and other times they have more than they started with. I really enjoy the different routes to victory and that they're all viable ways to win the game. This will hang around in my collection for a while.

One day someone will create a core mechanic with arbitrarily high complexity such that not even one move ahead could possibly be planned for by anything other than a supercomputer. Even identifying the tiniest fraction of the possible moves a player has on a given turn will take entire game nights. Players, at the urging of impatient friends and frustrated loved ones, will quickly resort to taking the first legal move that they can identify. Gamers everywhere will argue about whether this game is pure skill or pure luck.

(12) fantastic euro game, great with any number of players... you drop and pick meeples and do actions/rewards where meeples are dropped off... reminded me of istanbul because of similar mechanics... ap can be serious problem, great game though

Arabian Nights themed mancala strategy game. Setup random 5x6 play area of location tiles and seed each with 3 random tribe meeples (elders, viziers, merchants, builders, and assassins). Take meeples from a starting tile and move to a target location depositing one meeple at each tile along the way until reaching the destination tile where you may claim one color of its tribe members. Depending on the tribe, they can be used to summon a helping djinn or demon, get rare merchandise including slaves, earn coin, or assassinate other tribe members. Lots to think about; how much to bid for turn order, meeple movement tactics constantly change, while trying to not help the next player, also considering which location benefits to control, maxing the djinns power, and collecting a set of unique goods to sell for big coin.  I agree with other player comments that the unpredictable flux of the game makes strategy practically impossible, so don't bother figuring out your move ahead of time and just wait for your turn to eventually come around. In fact, I usually bid zero and go last and take whatever lands my way and win more often than not. Definitely can induce AP.

Our gaming group gave Five Tribes so many opportunities, so many chances but the last time we played it we all kinda laughed how we really didn't want to even play it anymore. The biggest complaint I had for the game is that I always felt that a computer AI would always beat you in it. Also lots of analysis paralysis in it, sometimes the turns would just take too long. 5/10, sold it forward for a good price atleast.

So far I like the fact that there are multiple scoring opportunities no matter what you do. And I also like the fact that first couple of turns are usually not significant enough to change the game as all the spots have only 3 pieces on so unless there is a space that has only one coloured meeple, there's no pressure to go 1st and bid ridiculous vp's.
Production quality is an 8 or 9.
Reasonably easy to teach and ease people into the game.
plenty of replayability with the interchangeable tiles and different djinns that come out.

RATING: 6.5
Meeple mancala mechanics, very heavy strategy but strategy can be quickly interrupted by the actions of other players. Fortunately there are usually a number of locations that can give you the same desired result, at least early in the game. Later in the game the ease at which players disrupt each other could become frustrating.  Multiple paths to victory ensures there is always at least something of value to do in a turn regardless of when your turn occurs. Possibly too much opportunity for analysis paralysis, especially when anger player's action can completely spoil your plans.

I liked it the first play, but need more plays to determine an accurate game rating.

Five tribes can be lot's of fun, but if it's not your turn you're mostly waiting around for other players to go.  And since the board can be changed so drastically in one turn, there's not much you can do to plan ahead.  But on your turn you can usually find an optimal move if you think about it for long enough, so sometimes this game can drag on.

Just 5 plays in, but wow, what a gem of a game! A VERY thinky puzzler of a game b/c your moves will impact the next player a lot. So while a really good move may be available for you, by taking it, it may leave an opponent open for an even better one. Definitely an AP (analysis paralysis) type of game, but a 1-2 minute timer can drastically speed up play. A really, really brilliantly created game.

Yeah, this one is a thinker. Definitely not something you'd want to play with someone who wants to analyze every possible move (that could realistically take hours). It's not that it's a particularly heavy game by any means, there are just so many choices that some people can get overwhelmed and shut down.

The mancala mechanic is fantastic though, and it's always very satisfying to spot and pull of some fancy play. Definitely recommend!

I was interested in Five Tribes since it was announced, but due to Tyler’s skepticism of the game, and a few other minor things, I held off on picking it up. A sale as well as hearing so many good things about this game weakened my resolve. I bought a copy and hoped that it would go over well despite Tyler’s doubts. It turned out to be a strong success. I think Tyler liked it even more than I did (and I really like it!). I played a lot of mancala as a kid and this hits the right spots to become the mancala of my adult life. It’s extremely smart, easy to learn, and we find the 2P version to suit us extremely well. Neither Tyler nor I are very AP-prone, so the game moves along within a reasonable time. Honestly, my biggest complaint is that the game is completely color dependent, so we’ll never be able to play this with our colorblind friend (he can’t tell a large number of colors apart, more than just the expected red/green and blue/purple). I fully plan to pick up Five Tribes: The Artisans of Naqala at a later date so we can see how that shakes up the game.

I love this game. I hate playing it with people, especially multiple people. Am I the only one who doesn't suffer from terrible analysis paralysis with this game? By the way, studying the board to find the move that gives you the most points this turn ISN'T the best strategy, I promise ;) Honestly, just pick three of the tribes, rank them one to three in your personal priorities, then pursue them, as a turn, in that order. I am also going to instill a three minute timer on everyone's turn. Seriously, I can't handle waiting an hour for my turn, NO game is worth that. That is my only complaint really is the AP people seem to get. Remove that mental obstacle and this is one of the most well made strategy games out there. Perfectly combines strategy with tactics, gives the mancala mechanic a modern make over and has a feeling unlike any other game in its' weight. As always, DOW knocks this out of the park.

2-4 players. Unsurprisingly the material is very nice but it comes with a big price tag like all DoW games. Surprisingly the part I liked most about the game was the turn bidding and I usually dislike any bidding elements. The random elements in the game just provide set-up so there's very little luck involved. The rest of the game was - after 1 play at Essen - too open for me. Too many choices and the chaos of all the meeples on the board just blinded me. Could lead to lots of AP. I guess that on more plays interesting strategies would emerge but right now too many other games are vying for my attention and with 60€ it's a not-buy. But I wouldn't mind playing again.

The moving of meeples mechanic is refreshing and well-implemented. The various scoring paths also gives players a number of options to pursue. The only path I dislike is the Djinns with awkward names and feels slightly disjointed with the rest of the game.

Game components are very high quality. Artwork is fine looking too. Interaction is fairly high and replayability is definitely not an issue.

Good game. Feels very abstract, but also very thematic at the same time. I was concerned about the game flow but with 4 players it seemed more than alright. I would definitely play this again, although the game is not directly my style. Strategy wise I am not sure if you can really stick to one. I tend to get whatever I can get, as there can only be one optimal move to make at any point in time. So my experience has been that the game dictates which strategy each play should try to stick to.

RATING: 6
Gameplay was a bit dry and dull for all the different components and mechanisms going on. I like the idea of "worker displacement" a lot, but I felt like the game was rather less than the sum of its (very nicely designed!) parts. I'd definitely give this another go with more players though. The sheer number of variables felt like a bit of a red herring - either there was one very obvious best move, or an AP-inducing selection of options where the various pay-offs seemed fairly random and didn't feel worth the time spent working them out. I liked the option of bidding for essentially back-to-back turns in a 2p game, but the board changing every turn meant it wasn't really plausible to approach the game with any kind of strategy or plan your turn ahead of time.

A lot of cool things to do in this game as moving different meeples around the board both activates the special tiles and activates the meeple's special abilities while changing the board state for any play after yours.  That can lead to a lot of AP if you want to play well... or a rough time at the table if you don't enjoy going through that kind of AP... or watching other people with that kind of AP... or get annoyed when you don't spend the time analyzing and are giving up easy points.  I had a tough time reading the board state most of the time until near the end which hampered my overall enjoyment of the game, but I could see where experience would help with that and make this something I could enjoy more.  Still not something I need to own.

RATING: 8.1
Days of Wonder is known for the fact that they produce games with wonderful components, which are also a lot of fun to play. At least, that for the games we known from them, until they released Relic Runners last year. That game looked also great, but it wasn’t fun to play at all. Also the games Cargo Noir, Small World Realms and Small World Underground we liked less. Both of them are nice, but not games that we want to play on regular base. This made us less curious to Five Tribes. Yet, when we were able to play this one, we didn’t hesitate and joined the table. As usual for a DOW game, the game is pretty easy to explain, which made it accessible for families. The components are also just great. Nice meeples, wooden castles, wooden palmtrees and wooden camels.

On a player’s turn, he’ll pick up all of the meeples on a single tile, then he’ll drop them, one at a time, on an orthogonal path. The last meeple he drops, he must drop on a tile that already has a meeple of that color. Then he picks up all the meeples of that color and does that meeple action. Then he does the tile’s action. If there are no more meeples on the tile (and no camel already there), he places his camel there. The actions that come with the different color meeples are:

    Blue (Merchants) – Count the number of merchants you took (plus any slaves you want to turn in) and multiply that by the number of blue tiles adjacent to the current tile (also include the tile itself). You get that amount of money and the blue meeples go in the bag.
    Red (Assassins) – Count the number of assassins you took (plus any slaves you want to turn in) and trace an orthogonal path that far from the current tile. Kill (put in the bag) a single meeple on that path (including the starting tile). If you emptied a tile by doing this, put your camel on it. Alternatively, kill (put in the bag) one meeple that another player has. Then put the assassins you took in the bag.
    Green (Trader) – Count the number of traders you took (X) and take the first X market cards. Then put the traders in the bag.
    Yellow (Viziers) – Take the viziers and put them in front of you.
    White (Elders) – Take the elders and put them in front of you.

This repeats until the end of the game. At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins. A game ends, when a player places his last camel or nobody can make a legal move.

Gameplay is changed just a little bit for a 2-player game. Each player gets two turns in a round instead of one. It makes for a fun little mental sparring when bidding (now twice each round!) for turn order. Do I want to let my opponent go twice in a row?? (In 2-player it is even possible for a person to go 4 times in a row – going 3rd and 4th in one round and then 1st and 2nd in the next). 2-player games really open some neat strategic options based simply upon the ability to chain turns together.

This is again an old-style Days of Wonder game. We liked it a lot. Nice gameplay, nice components. Nothing to complain about. Of course there is. The theme is pasted on. The game has nothing to do with 1001 nights. It just gathering points everywhere you can. If you like a light Feld game, we’re pretty sure, this one is right up in your alley.

Tentative rating from one play.  In truth, it's somewhere in the range [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] – [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b], but I don't yet know where.  The game suffers at the beginning from the late-game problem Caylus has: scads of bits of various colors all over the bloody board.  …but there are myriad point sources, so there's plenty to pursue here.  That first game, I was sure I was a solid fourth place, but I ended up winning by 1 point. Interestingly, had it not been for 20 points that I had assumed were off the table when I stopped collecting viziers at 3, I actually would have been last.

So, it may be brilliant, but it certainly is at least good.

Played at Essen.
This was recommended to me a few days earlier and boy am I glad they it was. It is a nice looking game but I think I may have overlooked it as "just another meeple placing game" which is totally wrong (technically, you aren't even placing meeples). Everybody got engaged quickly and I really want to play again as soon as possible.
We didn't finish the game for unrelated reasons but everybody  agreed they liked it a lot.

I would think twice to play it with AP-prone players though. One turn can have multiple implications on the other players and somebody who attempts to assess them all will take quite a while.

Wonderful game that is beautiful to look at..  DoW always has great production values.  Strong replayability and has multiple paths to victory.  My favorite mechanic is the bidding for turn order.  This is the heart of what makes this game great.

It forces you to calculate your potential advantages and make meaningful choices about how to spend your victory points to turn a profit on them.

Highly recommend and will always be happy to put on my table.

Gran gran juego, el setup un poco largo, Grandioso el motor del mancala, problema a mas de 2 puede ser un terrible si juegas con gente con AP

Maybe the most AP prone game... quite excellent though.
Try adding a turn timer.

Great game, the set up takes some time but I 'm ok with that. I love the puzzle element combined with strategy.

The only negative about this game is that some players take way to long to take their turns.

Actually only for 4 people. Don't be fooled by the title. I really love this game. It's slightly complicated to learn, but not more so than, say, Puerto Rico. There are multiple paths to win, many strategies can be going on at once so you can hedge your bets. You don't have to focus too much on defense or what others are doing.

Solid gameplay.  The only bad thing, and it's not really bad, is it can be hard to plan ahead because the board state changes right before your turn.

Components are great and it will be very easy to expand this.

The mechanics of this game is a huge hit. Moving meeples, bidding, and the huge variability in this game gives a lot to think about, and no two games are nearly the same. There's a lot of ways to win and the game has you thinking on the spot quite a bit, rather than having you plan a long term strategy out. A big hit with my gamer friends, but not that great to play with new people (that's why we have other introductory games!)

Amazing game with lots of paths to victory and a lot to think about. Very fun, but can aggravate A.P. tendencies. Also, very great art and components, though some were difficult to punch.

Very easy game in terms of rules, with the right group this should flow well and probably take less than 50 mins. Need to play more.

I love this game, my wife not so much (because I always win). The meeple-dropping mechanics works perfectly, bidding works also well in 3-4 players.
But in 2p, it is pretty boring, otherwise, I'd give it a 10.

An amazing game. Tactics, strategy, atmosphemic artwork and components, and a perfect game length. This should be a runaway hit for the designer and the company. Likely to be my favorite game of the year (2014).

Doesn't have AP as I thought it would be, and I really like that you have many ways to score. Having a Eureka moment is golden as well.

Nice middleweight game where it's usually quite straightforward to make a decision. Not entirely sure how much the turn order bidding adds to the game but it is great fun and not too long.

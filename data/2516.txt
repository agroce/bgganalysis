TABLETOP MINIATURE WARGAME (Out of Print)

Good strategy value. Not a lot of miniatures needed. Unfortunately OOP. Too many counters / bookeeping needed. Lacks good campaign rules.

This game died a silent death, I guess because Games Workshop didn't sell enough miniatures for it - you only need a few to play (5 per player). This game is actually a very nice sea-battling game, and very dynamic. Other GW games have loads of miniatures that stay in the same place for hours on end, but not MAN O WAR !

Unfortunately on 26-11-2009, BGG were instructed to remove all uploaded files all all GW games. Even those files with no copyrite material.

The games might be OK but the company attitude to it's customers is definitely broken. All my GW game ratings are reduced to '1's until GW mend their piss poor attitude to their client base and files are allowed to be reinstated..

[b]Thoughts? - [/b]A great implementation of the GW armies in a naval battle.  Expensive but fun.  As with any skirmish, open rules interpretations, line of sight, loose movement are things I could do without personally, but this was certainly of the time.  I had some great 4 player battles of this.

[b]Still Play Regularly? - [/b]Now gathering dust.

The best game, ever, by Games Workshop [because it hits my three favorite area: variable player powers, miniatures game, and great strategic and tactical options and thinking]. Also, one of the best ship movement and combat games out there, and with the two expansions, the varieties are endless.

Very nice tabletop fantasy miniature naval wargame. The rules are simple but not simplicistic. Play one game and you'll have an appreciation of the problems faced by ancient admirals. Flashy individual ships and heavy characterization of the fleet make this game very fun to play. Beware that it's very dicey, no perfect plan will work against a lucky admiaral.

Haven't played this one in years. The best GW design in my opinion. We have totally remade all the fleets, which were probably the most unbalanced factions in any game ever. :)
I won't play this again until I have kids. I'm thinking about making it a hexagon based game and also about reducing the effectiveness of boarding.

Lots of fun, and fairly unique, but badly in need of a re-design. To many rules that aren't needed, wizards for example. Still I do enjoy getting out my orc fleet every now and then.

RATING: 7
Really good turning and wind system, very fun damage system, but really don't like the range of units available.  Elves and Bretonian feel right, but Imperial, Orc, and Dwarf are off.  More army variation in sides that I dig would gain it a point, and probably a better magic system too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Clean enough and one of the better efforts from GW. Fun, flavorful, low-density, not too complex. However the game isn't very strategic, is surprisingly slow to resolve damage and movement, and the magic system seems pointless and underdeveloped. 

For the I-go-you-go fleet games I'll take Silent Death over this, but this is nothing to turn your nose up to.

For the £100's I've spent on miniatures, this is going to need a lot of playing.

I still kind of hate myself for the huge investment in one game - eBay has a lot to answer for.

Probably my favourite of all the Games Workshop stuff.  Interesting mechanics, cheap to buy a useable fleet (or rather it was cheap when you didn't have to sell a kidney to buy ships from Ebay) and full of laughs.  And each fleet really does feel different and reflects the race characteristics well.  I have pretty much every fleet except the Norse.

I'm not sure why this game appeals to me as much as it does, but I have always had a blast playing this.  I even opened my Man O' War career with an 0-8, and still enjoyed it thoroughly.

If you like Warhammer Fantasy Battle, this is a fun version on the high seas of the old world.  The standalone boxed set is mostly useless though without finding miniatures to add to the collection (it's a miniature game, thats how they work.)  Thanks to eBay I collected five large fleets.  I love this game now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I can't believe GW hasn't reprinted this. The game is almost all cardboard with simple ship models that their plastics could do very well with. Hint to the uninitiated: if you can find Pirates of the Spanish Main around anywhere, they make awesome Empire/Britannian ships.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nifty game, hampered by how tough it can be to get hold of.  You don't need many models (that's good because they're pricey now), and the models are easy to paint quickly.  The rules stand up very well to age.  My only real complaint is that Orcs, Chaos Dwarves, and Skaven are too cartoony.  That's just how they were at the time the game was made.  Overall an excellent game!

RATING: 7
Simple, fast-playing system combined with the typical GW personality - this is a great ship combat game. I especially like the way ship damage is treated - you shoot high or low and roll for location, and then the area you hit, the liklihood of damage, and the impact to the ship's performance are all unique to the type of ship. Variety and personality are key aspects of play. Every fleet has its own strategies. I haven't played enough to speak to the game's imbalances, but the system is quite flexible and rules can be discarded or altered rather easily. A while ago I said that Blood Bowl was the only minis game I would ever collect. I think I need to amend that statement. This game doesn't have the raw tension of Blood Bowl, but it's still a heck of a lot of fun.

Best GW game produced!  I was lucky enough to jump on this one before it was mothballed by GW.  It is one of my most prized possessions and one of my most requested games to bring out and play.  you can teach someone the rules (which are easily modified) in no time (unlike 40k or Fantasy)  the ships are BEAUTIFUL and look great on a tabletop.  Lots of fun to play and if you can collect the set off ebay I suggest you do!  you will not be sorry!

Random, unbalanced, and fun as hell! The interwoven movement/action system, along with the ship's templates/damage system really help move this game along (very, very little downtime), and of course the theme is wonderful.

I could happily write a book on why I think Man O' War is one of the greatest games ever made (including the expansion sets). I am not even a fan of naval wargames of any sort either. But there is just something about the smooth simplicity of the system, the character of the various fleets, and the variety of options that come in the expansion sets. I wish all games were made this well. After from the Epic series of games produced by Games Workshop, this is my favorite of all time.

Easily my favorite game of all time, Man O War has clear, concise rules that effectively capture the feel of each race's special traits and abilities. For a more in-depth review and recommendation, click on the link below to see my comments. Man O War had cool looking miniatures that made the game come alive, especially when using 3-D scenery too. 

I have created MANY more ships and rules to use for others and have a thriving club at Yahoo called "The Sea of Claws" where we help new members locate the main game, expansions, ships, ect... Come join u sover there to get help in finding ships, rules and to take part in the very active discussions that continue to take place for a game thats been out-of print for over 12 years.  This is the most fun you can have playing with miniatures!

Excellent GW game.  I'm so glad I bough the original, Sea of Blood and a pile of ships in the sales GW did when the discontinued it.  What a shame both the game and the ships are so expensive to get now, and no sign of a re-issue :(

Best naval game I have ever owned - colorful, fast, fun, and easily modfied for extra chrome if that's what you want.  Double thumbs down to Games Workshop for abandoning this and wasting resources on crap like the fourth or fifth re-release of Blood Bowl.

The Evil Empire produced three great "big box" games. This is one of them.

The supplements are ... less awesome. Still good, but there's too much silliness in Plague Fleet (the orcs look sane by comparison) and some badly unbalanced stuff in Sea Of Blood (flyers).

One of the very few games that I have loved for more than a decade! The rules are light and easy to learn, introducing new players is never a problem - but finding people willing to play a fantasy naval wargame that lasts for several hours from you start unpacking to you have finished is difficult :)

Only downside is the magic system, which I feel is a bit outdated. Some of the races are not well balanced, bot none are actually broken. 

Highly recommended!

A really cool game by GW that I still enjoy playing when I get the chance. The magic system can be a bit unbalanced so most of the time we just leave it out. Great looking minis and good rules make this a unique and satisfying game to play.

Played again recently for the first time in over a decade, and it was even better than I remembered it being.  This is one of those games from the heyday of good clean Games Workshop fun, the other memorable successes being 3rd edition Blood Bowl and Epic.  Man o' War is perhaps the simplest of all of GW's wargames from the 90s -- unit density is low, there aren't a lot of troop types or terrain to worry about, and the to-hit/location/damage rules are a snap.  They still manage to give each fleet its own flavor and one has to shift tactics based on one's opponent.  Great fun unless you're an anti-GW fanatic.

Although there are some problems with game balance between fleets, overall I have always enjoyed this game and been able to resolve any fleet difficulties with my opponents. 
This has to be the only game I have played consistantly since it came out in 1993.

RATING: 8
For a mid-nineties game Man O War is a surprisingly clear and spiffy fantasy naval miniature system. As it's set in the Warhammer world it's right up my alley. Many of the fleets are downright ugly (chaos dwarf, skaven, orc, high elf), but I don't care.

I was fascinated with this game when I was a kid.  Provided the core for a pirate game my friends and I created as we went.  Overall this game lacks depth, with only 3 ships/ race for the most part there is not much actual customization with ships.  The template system is a whole lot of fun though.  I own both expansions for this game: Sea of Blood, and Plagefleet.  Essentially it is an incoplete game without all three.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A beautiful game, from the last days before GW went to a completely corprorate profit driven mentality. Unfortunately, in typical GW fashion, GW will -not- sell the rights (despite many offers), nor will it ever re-release the game. Doomed to linger forever in the hall of "brilliant, out of print games."

An update:

I've had some comments on an this, so wanted to add my own. This is a game worth having and collecting, but the online community can be off-putting to many. Unfortunately, it's dominated by a handful of loud voices that are totally opposed to any ideas that aren't their own (we have been trying to get a revised manual incorporating all errata together for years, and it hasn't happened... put your own conclusions together). There are a lot of very good people in the community as well. Please don't be put off by the few who make it bad for the rest of us.

My friends and I loved this game. Like Battletech, you could field a fun game with just a handful of ships, but the game was so addicting, it wasn’t long before we had massive fleets. This is another OOP classic that should be brought back to life. I’ve still got the games, but unfortunately, the miniatures, with their delicate masts and sails, have not survived.

I dearly love Man O' War!  Yes, it's quirky, and the cards take up more table space than the game board.  But it's great fun.  

I used to play using a friend's (complete) miniature collection, but now I'm creating fleets using Pirates of the Spanish Main models.  (Replacing the card sails with ones made using toothpicks and paper really adds to the visual appeal.)

Together with Mordheim and Necromunda, Man O War is one of the best collectible miniature games that Games Workshop ever produced. Not only because of its limited collectibility (you only need a couple of miniatures to play an interesting game), but also because of the balanced (no overpowered armies or special units) and squad-for-squad tactical gameplay. And it is relatively quick to set up. Would love to play this again.

Probably one of the best, if not the best Warhammer spin offs. A great game that is fun to play, looks great, and has everthing you need in one box. It's a shame they dont still produce this and that the minitures fetch such high prices on ebay. If you can get hold of a copy it is defenitely worth having in your collection, even if you dont like GW (this game shows what they can do when they really want to).

Will only trade with the other boxed expansions.  Other box expansions, boxes a bit rough, some tape reinforcing some corners, has extra bits included as well.

Relatively easy rule set. The game can be taught in a few minutes. Short, medium, and long range fire, ramming, and boarding. Most things have a saving throw. It takes multiple hits to sink a ship most of the time so you get to return fire or try to escape. Very nice miniature game. The minis were very distinctive.

Fairly entertaining. Takes up an awful lot of space since each ship needs its own card to record crew, damage etc. One of Games Workshop's better efforts, left unsupported (of course).

More of a 'starter set' for a tabletop naval battle game than a game in it's own right, the basic set is rather bland.  Don't bother unless you're prepared to also spend money buying additional rulebooks and miniatures.

RATING: 7
This was the game that finally broke my sales resistance to miniatures.  The rules are not ideal.  Given the amount of cardboard templates you need to track even a middling fleet and the activation rules this takes too long as is.  The models are still a wonderful spectacle on the table.

A true wargaming classic.  Would have to be one of the best 10 wargames of all time.  The rules are easy to digest and newcomers will recognise a super-variant of Battleships in the search method.  Don't let that put you off, as there is a lot of skill in the searching here, you only get so many searches per turn and your enemy is moving!  Once you find your opponent you have to strike, but sometimes you are aware that he may strike you in the same turn, or that it may be better to strike next turn, especially if night is approaching.

If you're the Americans, you get an opening advantage as the Japanese are vulnerable early on.  If you're the Japanese, do you risk an early attack on Midway when your relatively unsupported carriers could be sunk?  To do this, you really need to spot the US player before he spots you.  If you're the American, it's easier for you to hide.  Do you play for an early attack when the enemy is weak, or do you sneak off somewhere and strike when and where it is least expected.

Endlessly replayable, full of possibilities and variations in strategy and tactics.  Super fun!  Since the rules are very easily grasped, this is perfect for anyone wondering about wargames and not knowing where to start.  And, if that's you, and you want to get into wargaming, here's 10 reasons to buy this one:
1. It's chock full of S and T 
2. It's more replayable than almost anything else wargames-wise - you can play it with loads of different strategies. 
3. The unequal sides with diff strengths and weaknesses - dilemmas abound. 
4. The fact that you'll recognise the method of searching intuitively if you've ever played battleships. This is the adult version of that. 
5. The suspense of the chase. 
6. The sense of history. Midway was one of the 5 key battles of WW2. I'd put it with BoB, Stalingrad, D Day (if you think of the first day or two as a battle) and Kursk. 
7. The easy rules that allow you to concentrate on S and T. 
8. It's cheap on Ebay 
9. You can get loads of great writing on it in the old AH Generals if you want it. 
10. It's fun and exciting. You won't feel like you've been dragged through a hedge backwards by the end of it.

Got this game when I was about 10.  It really is a very fun game.  The double-blind game and resource management make it very challenging.  I would like to play with the fighters rule sometime.  To me, this is one of the all-time great Pacific naval games and the Midway game by which all others are judged.

Another AH 'classic' wargame that I played as a teen and have no desire to play again, because its 'classic' status was in part a function of the one publisher monopoly the hobby had way back when.  I don't hate the game, but it just sits there, indigestible and creaky.

RATING: 7.5
Classic Avalon Hill navel wargame with a blind-search mechanism. If Pacific theater fleet battles are your thing then this might be right up your alley. The rules are fairly short with very little bookkeeping so you don't need a huge commitment like you would in something like Flat Top. Nice lite wargame.

My parents got this one for me around age 18 because my Dad was actually stationed on Midway between 1971 and 1974 (and my brother and I were born on base!)  Game wise it's sort of like a more complex version of Battleship.  Opening it up is like going back in time to 1964 and the early days of the late, lamented Avalon Hill.

RATING: 8.75
It has been my first wargame so it deserves a detailed description.

We can say that basically it takes his origins from pencil-and-paper public domain game that we all learned just after learning [gameid=11901]: both players have their fleets deployed on their hidden map, then on that map you first secretly move the fleet and then you search you opponent's ones in the way you shoot, by coordinates. But then we must add that it is much more you move around the fleets and to attack your opponent's ones you must find them and have them in striking range. 

If you played it, by reading all the other descriptions of this game you read a lot of sentences that can be your since for many of us has been an high school game, one of the first wargame played and so on. All says that it had a working system and after of it arrived more detailed games on it, all above the other [gameid=2885]/[gameid=2529] but almost all we remember how much we enjoyed it.

May rate should have been a little lower but too much were ungenerous with tis old friend of fun, so I've given it a better vote to do my part to compensate it.

One of AH's most underrated games.  This game works great as a double blind.  I don't play it very often these days, but keep it cause it was so good.  Searches are tense and firing your AA guns to avoid that dive bomber gets your palms sweating.  Good game.

Midway is still one of the most balanced games I've ever played--and I've been gaming for nearly 40 years.  There are a few rules ambiguities, but most of these can be solved with some common sense and a bit of rigging.  It's also playable in one setting.  In one of my games, I made the very mistake the Japanese admirality did!  (I won't give it away.) [I was perhaps a bit overzealous in my rating, and downgraded it from an 8 to a 7.]

Playable in an evening, this game is often a nail-biter as the Japanese, with their larger force, seek to destory the more flexible and hard-hitting American carrier fleet. Components and systems show their agae, but still hold up well nearly 40 years from the original date of publication. Robust rules set has been used to game Leyte Gulf and Coral Sea as well. Playing double-blind with a ref (or two refs and a team of players on a side) easily slides this back up to a 10. Check out AH&#039;s game Bismark, if you enoy Midway.

This was my 2nd wargame when I was a kid (Avalon Hill's Tactics II was the first), so it gets an extra star for nostalgia. :-)  It is Battleship on steroids, and I think it does a great job of simulating the operational situation in the Pacific in early - mid 1942.

Really needs a third person to act as an umpire to make the double-blind searches work. I'm surprised that this hasn't been updated by someone as it's quite an accessible game and a key battle of WWII. Maybe it's because the searches are handled more easily by computer so it lends itself better to video gaming.

RATING: 8
Sold on Consimworld after Ebay failed to generate any interest.  Carried this around for over 30 years and got to play it once, I think. Tired of carrying around two player games I will never get to play again.  No way to solitaire games like this.

A great classic game.  Much more of a game than the more recent titles on the topic, which tend to be more simulations and less games, where carrying out the airstrikes is largely a matter of luck.  In this game the airstrike resolution is a game in itself. 

Includes  Wargamer's Guide to Midway (1979), an issue of The General, plus my custom hit and airfield readying sheets for all four Coral Sea variant scenarios.

Avalon Hill inclusive of The Coral Sea Variant and The Gamers Guide to Midway.  This classic 1:1 naval war game sports a double blind game mechanism.  Just like the real battle of Midway, both players tend to jockey for tactical position on the game board in close proximity to Midway Island to wreak havoc on the opposing fleet usually by air strike.  The game is fun.  The rules are fairly simple for a war game.  The game plays in 3 - 5 hours.  Avalon Hill also made The Coral Sea Variant kit which allows players to play most of the Solomon Islands and Iron Bottom Sound type battles.  Additionally, The Wargamers Guide to Midway by Avalon Hill, allows for more optional variants and even a Battle of the Phillipine Sea.  Great replayability and a classic game that lives on and on and on.

The high rating is only because It is a great tool to bring a young gamer into gaming.  Great fun with my 12 year old son.  Very tense and easy to play and a good introductory game for young gamers. A great time while watching TORA TORA TORA (we stopped and watched the battle & key scene.  He wants another chance at me with his Japanese masses. lol, he hated being ambushed just when he was ready to invade Midway.  He thought I got lucky in snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. Do I let him win? No never, you have to earn that one.

Played back in the early 80s before I really knew what I was doing.  Remembered I liked it, but seems like there wasn't much game to it.  Searching for the carriers was the goal.  All those cool destroyers/battleships didn't play into it much.  Kind of like the real war in the pacific I found out later.  :)

Unplayable except with someone who doesn't know how the Battle of Midway turned out.  Awkward, clumsy game design and throughly annoying to players looking for any kind of fidelity to the real world.  Games based on historical events that hinged on one-in-a-million circumstances don't work.

A classic Avalon Hill wargame. I consider it a lighter weight version of "Flat Top". There's a nice search and destroy element here, that can be a real nail biter. The American player has a tough struggle ahead of him as he attempts to recreate history. This isn't easy to do, as the advantage clearly belongs to the Japanese. 

An enjoyable historical game, that is probably a bit long for what it delivers. Set it up when you have a good block of time available. Make a morning or afternoon of it. 

The rules are simple enough, and the average grognard will consider them familiar, if lighter fare than most of the heavier games. 

I recommend this game to wargamers who don't mind a lighter war game with a slower pace.

An AH classic. The thrill and the frustration of the blind search is enough to bring you back for more or have you scream in agony as your ships sink to the bottom of the Pacific. At the beginning Avalon Hill often times had it right. This is another example of that.
12-20-05 after doing a couple of strategy articles for the game I'm going to raise my rating a point. The more I wrote about the game the more I remember liking it a whole lot.

OK, I guess.  I was quite underwhelmed, when I finally received it.  Glorified "Battleship", zero solitaire play.  Basically played about 5 times, then just sat on the shelf.  Felt old at the time (1977), and certainly is an antique now.  Computer sims handle this much better IMHO.

RATING: N/A
Fun game with surprising depth.  The battle board "odds" resolution to combat is about the only thing that really 'dates' this game back to the mid 1960s IMO.  Replace that with a better (and easier/faster) method and this game is an easy 10 IMO.

Rating based on fond memories playing this as a youngster. I remember enjoying it very much; the tension of trying to find the enemy fleet, fierce fire coming in as the dive bombers and torpedo planes make their runs. I always chose the American side and almost always lost. Could it be the game was heavily tilted toward the Japanese or was I a lousy strategist? My guess would be the latter of the two. A very fun game that will always be a part of my collection.

It really does seem like battleship advanced, and probably a little too simple for me but undoubtedly still fun I'm sure. I think Victory in the Pacific is a better fit for me for a simpler sea fighting game but the double blind nature of this one does have a certain draw

For a game this old (and they don't come much older) it's actually a pretty darn good game.  The components aren't much to look at, but it's a simple game that does a fair job of recreating the battle.  The U.S. will usually win, but fun for the Japanese to make the attempt.

RATING: 6.5
Light wargame that has held up very well considering its age.  It feels quite different from any other wargame I've ever played.  The rules err on the side of playability vs. historical simulation (a good thing in my opinion) and they are simple without allowing the game to become a complete abstraction. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game has its moment as a historical simulation.  The game is fun and can be played in an evening rather quick.  The fun part is on searching the enemy ship and sending in all the bombers in an attempt to sink the enemy all before your opponent does it the same on you.  Somewhat ahistorical as to the searhing procedure and the movement of ships on the search boards but it has all the battleship and carriers names on the extended counters.  The system is dated and flawed somewhat in today's term.  The latter expansions into battle of the Carol sea and Leyte Gulf based on the same system makes you excited for a while collecting all other battleships available.  Of course, time has moved and you see how fun and satisfied it was back then when we were still teenager without pokemon, magic cards or a PC.

A classic game involving tactical and strategic gaming. One of my favourites and one of only two games I've managed to keep hold of over the years. Box looks like a disaster, and the original search and battle boards are gone, but it's got all the variants and lots of counters. Combine it with the Midway Island variant and you have the last component needed for a comprehensive strategic/tactical recreation of the game.

Don't need the battle board, just lay it out on the floor. Don't need the search board, I use a hex map that I published in the BGG files section of Midway.

02/18/12 It was not my idea to play Midway today. When asked to play this 48 year old game my first reaction was negative. I knew the graphics / ascetics would be primitive. But I looked on it as "an experience"; a one time shot to play what is generally considered one of the Classic wargames from old Avalon Hill. And if I didn't play it now I'd probably never have the chance again. Plus I'd never played a wargame like this (using hidden search). Hunting for the ever moving enemy fleet(s) was tense, and nerve racking if you then lost contact. The combat was fairly simple; but I liked that. I also liked it played in only 1.7 hours. Looked at in that light I enjoyed the opportunity. Yet I have to admit, judging this 1964 design by today's standards leaves it sorely lacking in some areas. Even so, it holds up a lot better than one would think. I'm glad I had the chance to try it, but I don't really have the urge to play it again. It was nice, but now I can say "been there, done that." Midway had some very good points, but I can't ignore its graphics. So its high marks and its low marks sort of canceled each other out, leaving it an "average" game.

RATING: 6.5
The basic rules are boring without the surface combat - your cruisers have no purpose other than defending themselves from plane attacks.  I strongly encourage you learn the extra rules for the tournament version (included in the rulebook)that incorporate ship-to-ship combat.  Otherwise, the game becomes anti-climatic as tiem transpires and your airplane supply runs low.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
AH Midway is loads of fun and offers valuable insights into the battle. Love the rule that readying planes give a carrier a one hit penalty for sinking, with no distinction made on where the planes might be located (avoids hangar vs. flight deck controversy). Also, the fact that the defender determines the plane attacks via antiaircraft fire is novel.

This was the first true "war game" that I ever played (4th grade).  It's not much of a game, to be honest.  Mostly just trying to locate fleets.  If the Japanese can find the American carriers, the U.S. is toast.  So in some ways it's a goosed up Battleship but with some tension once your planes are launched.  There is also a chance for ship vs. ship combat, but if your the Americans you don't want this.  As a fourth grade boy who was awed by the historical story of Midway, the game was more of a place holder for imagination.  A much better place holder than the movie, which sucked.  That fourth grade boy would have given the game a 9.  The 41 year-old boy would rather read a book.

Midway is a great strategy game for those looking for a game of battleship that is constantly on the move, blended with air attacks.  Finding the enemy fleets and attacking in proportion is the secret to being successful. Of the old Avalon Hill games of the the 1960s, Midway was a good move away from their tried and true standard of zone of control mechanics. Midway is a good naval tactics game representing carrier tactics of the Pacific War.

Played through basic game, mid-December 2007. I really like the move-and-search phase, as it well emulates radar, and gives each player a lot to think about, anticipate. Very much a cat-and-mouse game, and, unlike "Battleship," only the prelude to eventual battle. Very intriguing. Then once the battles begin, it's hot and heavy, fast and furious--and bloody. One has to make big decisions about how to pair up one's own ships for maximum anti-aircraft protection and not put too many carriers too near one another, as carriers are the key. This game makes me appreciate the luck factor for the U.S. in actually winning this battle. And, "Midway" takes into account that particular factor--the danger of having planes (and hence ammo and gas) on deck when an enemy attack might come. I give this game an extra half-point for holding up so well in its design over the course of 43 years(!), plus the thought that if it was reissued with contemporary standards for artwork, board, and bits I would think it would be rated in the 7.5- to 8-point range.

It's all in the search, but the ship top views and large counters are very good for this publication era.

A classic wargame from the silver days of Avalon Hill.  Still worth playing.  With advanced rules, a tense simulation of the Battle of Midway; with basic rules Battleship on Steroids.

Old school wargaming. I like this one a lot. My wife would rate it a '3', though...mainly due to the planes all being the same color. She kept mixing them up.

One of my early purchases. I played this a lot when I was younger and living at home. Unfortunately, the box broke, and most of the counters were strewn in the closet when my mother decided to do some spring cleaning. The game ended in the trash.

Again, have not played this game in long time.  Since most of my games are PBeM now, this game does not hit the table.

One of the best Pacific battle games available.  Hidden movement and search are easily managed.  Does a great job for such a classic.

"Battleship" like search sequence, may frustrate both players due to too many possibilities to search the whole ocean. Combat is better, with all ships involved in the actual campaign. I've played the Chinese translated version.

This is a classic wargame, and one that I'm happy to own, but it feels quite dated.  The "Battleship" aspect of shooting blindly until finally finding something out there can change the game pretty dramatically depending on how long one can stay hidden.  That may bug some people.

Great war game. Captures the feel of the hide & seek that was going on during that battle. Sort of a more complex "Battleship", although that description doesn't really do this game justice.

This is a fun game. I won lots of times, I lost lots of times, but, more importantly I played this lots times. Although unfairly equated to Battleship [similarities yes, the same no], quite often if you can get in the first strike and cripple your opponent, you will win the game...but not always. I've always wanted to try to 1990s version, then I stopped playing until recently.

My first wargame and one that holds up surprisingly well after all these years.

RATING: 5
The game involves a long search segment and some short tactical board combat which resolves most of the effort to either smash the Japanese carriers, or simply destroy by attrition the two sides' air power. 

I find it a bit weak, the effort really is to form fleets that have anti-aircraft guns that can flank the carriers effectively for when the enemy finds your carriers. As the Japanese it's pretty important to find the US carriers first and hit them with everything all in one shot.

It doesn't really fill the imaginative need to meet the sense of escapist gaming it should to make it as enjoyable as possible, and it's not as historically pristine to really learn anything really new about the battle either. So if playing, you play knowing you'll do gamey things, and play both the game and your opponent.

Simple and elegant design.  Some may criticize the mechanics and (lack of) realism as compared to more hardcore wargames.  Nevertheless, it does a good job of giving the feeling of tension of trying to find and cripple the enemy first.

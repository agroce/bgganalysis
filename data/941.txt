Funny puzzle.  Can be tricky, lots of adrenaline involved, since you want to finish the puzzle before your opponent does.  Glancing sideways to his board is very distracting and will cost you.

There is a lot of game in this little box.  A fun puzzling game that is easy to teach and easy to introduce to others.  The speed element works well.  You'll be surprised how challenging some the of the puzzles can be with so few pieces - don't be deceived - play the game. [GTI: APSL]

Missing 1 blue tile - Kristine/BGG Library
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Competitive puzzle game in which players try to be the fastest at placing tiles to connect 4 pieces that surround a 3x3 grid with their private, and identical, tile sets. Each player faces the same task: one piece on each side (in one of the three locations) and with a predetermined tile in the centre of the grid.

Like [gameid=51], it is likely that players bring different levels of natural ability to the table, and chances are that some players only show up to fiddle about a bit whilst the same closely matched usual suspects will have a flurry of highly competitive head-to-heads. If you fall into the first group, you might as throw in the towel as soon as the first centre tile is revealed. On the upside: it is a very fast-playing filler, so at least you won't be frittering the time away for long.

Those who have the original set will know how much the Queen remake improved on the original, simply by giving each player set a different colour and hence shaving off at least 10 minutes sorting time. Whether the added loops and curves that are drawn on each tile (masking what are essentially basic straights, curves and junctions) are an equally welcome change will be a judgement based on a more personal preference.

I do welcome them, but only because it makes spotting the tile that fits a little less obvious. With the occasional exception, most tasks have fairly straightforward, and although there are technically a lot of variables thrown into a 3x3 area, most solutions are also surprisingly similar. So, for minds that easily click with this sort of puzzle, anything that makes the problem a bit more complicated is a welcome one.
   
This is not the sort of game that will see many quick replays, but it is a great game to have in a larger collection. The occasional dabble with the right crowd will be entertaining, but, like [gameid=22465], the small grid doesn't offer the challenges of, for instance, [gameid=51]. There is a reason why that will see table time much more often. My main disappointment is that splitting the 4 edge pieces up in 2 different sets that need to be connected individually, promises a level of complexity that just doesn't exist. In reality there are very few occasions where a solution makes use of that requirement. The tiles mixture on offer usually interconnect all 4 pieces automatically, making the extra task non-existent. It doesn't impose the sort of connection problems of [gameid=24417], where even the shortest distances can require highly intricate celtic knotworks that still leave you one t-junction short of what you though you could do.

A decent enough filler for well-matched players, in the most literal sense.

Turbo Taxi is a simple puzzle-like filler that plays unexpectedly addictive: its turns rarely take longer than two minutes, which makes both the game very fast and the players scream for «just another shot».

Fturbo Ftaxi is heavily dependent on the players' action game skills, spatial skills, and practice.  Practice definitely definitely helps.  I like the cardboard pieces though.

Must admit, not what I thought it would be upon reading the box description.  I pictured actually racing taxis through the city.  Oh well, still an interesting puzzle type game, where you "race" your opponent in putting together the road tiles in a winning matrix.

Decent adaptation of a puzzle to a group setting. Fun if you enjoy puzzles like this one. I think as games like this go, Ricochet Robot would get more play from me.

RATING: 3
These competitive puzzle things really aren't my cup of joe, but Turbo Taxi at least does me the favour of being over in a relatively short period of time, which helps to make it tolerable in small doses. That said, I don't have any desire to play this game again either, and doubt that I ever will since there are so many 2 player games out there that I actually enjoy. 

The ability to "see" the game properly is as crucial in this as it is in Richochet Robot, though, because of the smaller scope, the solutions are generally arrived at much more quickly and the game keeps moving forward as a result.

That said, these games don't really engage me much in terms of being social experiences because they are effectively multi-player solitaire races. The game really doesn't seem as though it would feel any different solitaire than it does with more hands at the table, and it also seems as though the replay value of this game would be questionable due to the small tile set and number of potential combinations.

Simply put: decent representative of its genre, but that genre is not one that I care for.

Turbo Taxi involves competitive puzzle building.  Players have matching sets of tiles.  Each round, a tile is placed in the middle of a three by three grid.  The tiles create routes.  The object is to build a grid around that middle piece in which there are no dead ends and a route exists between the yellow objects and the black objects.  These objects are pairs that are placed around the edge of the board by the player who won the previous round.

Components: Sturdy little tiles with some funny detail on them.

Experience: A fun, fast puzzle game. (I don't know how they did the math to figure out that a puzzle is always possible, but it seems like it would be complicated to compute this.) Games are very short, and scratch that itch to be challenged with a random problem to be solved.

Just one solo play so far, but I really enjoyed it.  It's essentially a solitaire puzzle game anyway; each player just plays on his own and the first person to solve it wins the round.  Comparisons to Ricochet Robot are apt, although here you're building a maze on a much smaller 3x3 grid.

Try to solve the puzzle faster than the other players. Unless you prefer the added pressure of the goal to finish first, this game works just as well solitaire, although you will need to impose a time limit when playing alone to ensure a challenge.

Played 5 times with 2-4 players for 2.00 hours.

This game won't blow anyone's mind, but I can see how it would be a fun game to play with casual gamers, as it reminds me a lot of online flash games. It is a speed game, which will turn some people off, but it's short, msotly harmless, and scales well, since everyone is playing simultaneously. I had a particularly fun playing of it tonight, so I'm bumping to a 7, but I think it will go back to 6: it's just too simple/repetitive to want to play often, even as filler.

I have come to learn an important fact about myself. I like puzzles, but I do not like speed puzzles, because I know ahead of time that they are an exercise in futility. Someone else will always be faster. Too bad.

What to say about this one? The tiles are intentionally drawn to be confusing to the eye, so that's pretty awful.

Turbo Taxi is really only fun with a group of evenly matched puzzle gamers.  If one person dominates, it's pain all the way thru.

I own the original Flickwerk version, which themes as a computer network connection in an office setting. A clever little spacial ability game. If you like Ricochet Robot or Lunar Lockout you'll probably like this. Each player gets their own tiles to play with, which is kind of fun. The great thing about these mind-bender games is that there is no down time.

RATING: 7
A light puzzle filler where players try to solve the map by allowing 2 taxis to reach their destination. I like the design of the game, its very elegant, but because the game is so simple, I doubt it will have much replayability. The number of random setups is very limited and the map feels very same-y after a while.

A competitive solitare puzzle game.  No player interaction other than saying 'stop' when you finish first.  They are interesting puzzles, but it's hard to describe this as a game, other than keeping track of who solved the puzzle first.  I'm hesitant to rate it lower on the scale since it works as a good puzzle diversion and I don't want to discourage people interested in this sort of thing (sort of like Rush Hour), but again, I'm hard pressed to consider this a game.

Speed puzzle game where you put together a 3x3 puzzle based on a common middle piece.  Each turn, a player will place a yellow and a black taxi and house that the puzzle will then need to connect.  All roads must connect within the puzzle and no roads are allowed to lead off the map unless a taxi or house is located at that end.  I like this one over Richochet Robots because I can pick up pieces and move it around.  However, if you do not like speed puzzles, don't play this game.

Bought this because I hoped I'd like it better than Metro. I don't. But at least it plays faster (even more if you don't play all the times which is quite allright, just make it "best in 10 minutes")

And no, the fact that Friedeman Friese made this doesn't make it any better than it is, unfortunately.

Egyik barátom készítette házilag (ugyanaz aki a boogle-t is).
Mindig is szerettem a logikai feladványokat, egyedül is fejtegettem (mensa) rejtvényeket sokat. A Turbo Taxi érzésre kicsit ehhez hasonló, megspékelve egy kis versennyel a játékosok között, úgyhogy azonnal megtetszett! Viszont egy estényi játék nagyjából elég is volt. Miután ráéreztem (2-3 forduló), mindig én végeztem elsőnek, nem találtam benne túl nagy kihívást.
+ a rácsodálkozás a mások teljesen más szintén jó megoldásaira
- meg kell várni az elsőnek, míg az utolsó végez (és nem beleszólni..)
- a győztes kap plusz 1 lapkát -> akinek amúgy is megy, sokszor első, még pluszban segíti a játék
Jó játék, kedvemre való, még fekszik is, de az utóbb írtak rontanak a megítélésén.

This is a much better game than the box size and theme would suggest.

Essentially it is a simultaneous puzzle game where each player is racing to use a series of tiles to complete a city street-scape that will connect two passengers to their homes. 

Classic tile placement rules are in play and each of the puzzles is different due to the altering of the objectives and the starting tile that is at the center of each city.

Very clever game and like any simultaneous build game, the tension amongst the players is what makes it work.

A puzzle / race game for which it is hard to find an evenly matched group -- usually there will be one player who is head and shoulders above the others in terms of ability.

In each of the 12 rounds of this quite funny game players need to build as quickly as possible a 3x3 jigsaw puzzle matching some characteristics marked by a tile and some pieces diplayed in the centre of the table. 

Turbo Taxi is actually hilarious, but the middle complexity of the tasks that players need to achieve and the lack of much material mean that the game shouldn't be played too often for it to keep it from becoming automatic.

Colpo d'occhio, intuizione e velocità la fanno da padrone in questo filler adatto anche ai più piccoli.L'obiettivo del gioco è quello di essere il più bravo a ordinare i quartieri per permettere al Taxi di eseguire il proprio viaggio. Gioco che probabilmente non soddisferà tutti i palati anche se stiamo parlando di un giochino senza troppe pretese. Divertente ma forse un po' ripetitivo alla lunga.

RATING: 6.5
A very polar game. Those with no sense of shape and space (ie. women), and those who detest competitive puzzle-solving are not likely to give this the time of day. For the rest of us it's a classy, easy-to-explain filler whose only flaw is that perhaps it goes on a little too long. If, and it's a big if, you can get three or four lovers of Turbo Taxi to the table, a good time is assured.

12 rounds of fast jigsaw type puzzle really. Kind of interesting for the first couple of rounds, but it's too repetitive to bring out much. Each round is identical, so you've really played it 12 times by the time you've finished, which is more than enough for a long time after. If any 1 player is decent, then it's a non-fun cakewalk, so it's probably more useful as a solo puzzle exercise for kids.

Fantastic puzzle game: each player has a set of 12 identical road tiles. Each turn, two sets of start and end markers are placed on the board and a general tile is turned over. Players have to start with the same general tile and place tiles in a 3 x 3 grid to connect the markers. First to do so gets a VP token. Reapeat for 12 rounds. Most VPs win!

Not sure about replayability of the game in the long term as there aren't that many variations of marker placements. But it's great for a few plays.

Gyors szabálymagyarázat után már mehet is az útépítés a Turbo Taxiban. Két játék megléte esetén akár 8-an is lehet játszani, ugyanis mindenki a két taxi és két uticél lerakása után megpróbál 12 darab útlapkájából 9-et a szabályok szerint összeilleszteni. Aki a leggyorsabb és hibátlan megoldást készített az kap egy pontot, amiből 12 osztunk ki a játék folyamán. A puzzlét szeretőknek ajánlott, de egyáltalán nem mindenki számára. Könnyedsége okán azért kipróbálni bárkinek érdemes.

It's a race to put a puzzle together--everyone has the same hand of bends, tees, straightaways, etc.  The center tile of nine (3x3 grid) is set, the connections are set (black taxi to black house, yellow taxi to yellow house) and...GO!  It's interesting and well-designed, but I don't tend to thrive in games where speed is a factor.

Fun speed puzzle game. Occasionally it will seem that a layout is impossible, but I find that once I get it out of my head that a particular tile has to go [i]right here[/i] I can find the solution.

The positive aspect: the "Turbo".  The negative aspect: the "Taxi".  Wait, that doesn't even make sense - let me try again.  It's a great idea in concept, but it just doesn't play out quite so well.  The major problem seems to be that, unlike in "Ubongo", there is no reward for placing second or third, and no way for a slightly less skilled player to make up points.  I feel like this could have been a super-fun game, but unfortunately it fails miserably, and that leaves me quite disappointed!  Given enough time I might be able to work out a few house rules to salvage the game, but since I don't own it, I can't see that it's worth my time.  Game design: 2/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 4/10

In my first 4 player game, there was one player who scored zero. I suspect that might be the case in any 4 player game of this. You need a good match up, so best played with players of equal or near equal ability in problem solving/spatial awareness.

Clever game.  The components are a bit cheaply made (I've only played Flickwerk, not Turbo Taxi), but have a delightful whimsey to them.  It's a little discouraging to play with someone with better spatial relation skills (final score in the game I played was 7 to 3 to 2 to 0.  I placed second.)

And this game is one of the reasons why i believe Friedman Friesse came out with Power Grid just by chance.

Not what I expected.  Race to complete the puzzle.  Moves fast and stretches some brain muscles that don't usually get a workout.  Very little socializing, since everyone is staring at their own puzzle.

Turbo Taxi is a good speed/puzzle game in which players solve a puzzle using tiles.  It's easy to play, but it can't be tough to figure the puzzles.  As each puzzle is created at game time, there's infinite replayability.

I think this one is a lot of fun.  Unfortunately that appears to an opinion held by just one in my gaming group :(  I like the race to complete your block before your opponents and trying to find the right combination of pieces to get it done.

Turbo Taxi is a nifty little tile-placement filler that only works when all players are at the same level of experience.  But once you've learned it, you've learned it.  Replay value is low.

Okay puzzle game - very popular with my 12-year-old daughter.  It's fine, but doesn't really stand out from the crowd.  I prefer both [gameid=51] and the [gameid=16986] family to this (each of which have some mitigation of the "speediest player" issue), whereas this does not.

For a puzzle-solving game, not bad. The thing is, those that are faster at putting puzzles together will always defeat those that are slower (me). Rating is based on my desire to play again.

Real Time; A neat little competitive puzzle game, similar in feel to Ricochet Robot. Another set would allow up to 8 to play. Each player has an identical set of 12 tiles displaying part of a network of computer cables. A further set is shuffled and placed face down in the centre of a 3x3 grid, representing the nine rooms through which the cabling will flow. Four markers are placed around the edge of the grid and these represent the only points at which the cabling can leave the grid. The top card of the centre pile is turned over and players have to re-arrange their own tiles in front of them to form a valid network, using the same centre tile as displayed and connecting up the four “perimeter” markers. First one to complete a valid network wins the centre tile ( 1 VP ). He then rearranges the perimeter markers if he wishes and turns over the next card to be played for. The updated edition, Turbo Taxi, features city streets rather than computer cables. The markers on the edge of the grid are a yellow taxi, yellow house, black taxi and black house. Players must ensure that their tiles create valid routes leading the yellow taxi to the yellow house, and black taxi to the black house. This game can also be played solo as you try to complete a grid in the least amount of time. Also known as: Flickwerk

Played once. A nice puzzle for an occasional play, but I get the feeling it would become repetitive quite soon - and there are games in the same category which I usually prefer, which means I am unlikely to play it very often.

Simultaneous puzzling game, which I usually don't like. Here though, the puzzle is just difficult enough to ensure a decent amount of thinking time for each player.

Intense, quick, puzzle race, in which you attempt to beat your opponents to the correct solution, while not faltering in your haste.  My head literally heated up significantly during a game of this against comparable competition.  The main problem with it is that it relies solely on a particular type of thinking, and if you are not quick at that sort of thought, you will lose with little chance.

Conceta cada taxi con la casa de destino usando tus losetas en una grilla de 3x3. La única loseta fija es la central. Los caminos no pueden terminar en los bordes a menos que haya una casa o un taxi.

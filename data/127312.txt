Each round presents you one of four types of puzzles that are fun to solve even when you are not doing so well in the overall game situation. When finishing a puzzle you get a tile you can use in a Carcassonne-like way to collect points.

Same category as "FITS" for me.  Great puzzle-y type game that is great for new or casual players.  Not something that I would probably would own, but would play it if casual players asked me to.

Four puzzle types:

Tanagrams
Balancing weights (math problem)
Making 4 differently shaped colored cubes look like the diagram
Making a set of pipes correct

Fun little mini-games which is then rewarded with a Carcasonne strategic game where you get points for completed reactors (like road scoring in Carcasonne).

The 4 colored cubes is the hardest one of all (for me).

I have a few quibbles with this. If you are sitting directly to the left of another competitive player, they can steal the puzzle you are best at from you 3 out of 4 rounds. Need a different mechanism for deciding to pick puzzles. The puzzles are fun. But the scoring is like a very sad version of Carcasonne.

First Play: The Sunday papers puzzle page meets Carcassonne. Successful completion of one of 4 puzzle types allows you to place a piece of tunnel map with colour stations en route. Form a closed circuit and score the points for the colour you have chosen.

You would have to play this many many times to encounter the same puzzle again so there is little danger of memorising the decks. A fun filler.

Mini games/puzzles abound! I enjoy all of the 4 different kinds of puzzles in this game as well as the area control tile laying aspect. I have some in my group that despise this kind of stuff however. So, this probably won't see many plays.

Speed puzzles to play Carcassonne. Why didn't anyone think of this sooner?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
2012. A cute game of puzzles and speed, but I'm not sure if it's well balanced.  There are for type of puzzles (may, tangrams, pipe paths, and 3D wooden blocks), and the goal is to solve your puzzle within the allotted amount of time, which allows you to earn/deny points by placing the map/tunnel shown on the reverse side of the puzzle tile.  The problem is that puzzle difficulty varies widely both within and between puzzles types.  Additionally, anyone can flip the same time at any time to put everyone on a serious time crunch, which could be annoying for some people.  Lastly, the map/tunnel tile placement is Carcassonne-like, and it's fairly easy to connect into opponents' tunnels to earn an equivalent number of points.

Others say: simultaneous & timed puzzle-solving, best played by persons with similar puzzling abilities (thus not good for family play or teaching newbies), puzzles are challenging but not too difficult, also described as solve puzzles to play Carcassonne.

Designer clarification on scoring from a BGG rules thread: "It's the friendly way (no competition). If two or more networks combine, all players get to score their pawns normally (so they ignore all other pawns in the combined network when scoring)."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Enjoyable for those who like small puzzles, but it won't fit all or many game groups because inevitably some people will be worse at some puzzles and that competition or time limit will sour them on the game. While this is fun and not too long to play, it's not easy to make it to the table. Plus other than the 3D block puzzles there's not a ton of real innovation here. We are happy to own it but it simply won't be for everyone, which is a downside of a lighter family game.

I'm not a big fan of Ubongo games and first part of Enigma leans heavily towards Ubongo games - simultanious puzzle solving and fast players score points. What is interesting is that there's four different types of puzzles and that there is also a tile placing element in the game which acts as a nice flavour and gives the game an another layer in tactics.

I'd say the game is at it's best with four players because then you have to solve also puzzles you're not so good at but it's not bad with less players than 4 players.

I love spatial puzzles and Enigma lets me do that for an hour, while playing "Carcassonne-light" on the side. The puzzles are quite challenging, and it's very interesting to see how different people are incredibly capable at one style of puzzle, and utterly useless at another. Abilities and failures that can and will completely juxtapose with what you are capable and incapable of.

It's just competitive puzzle solving, which I like. Others may disagree, but I found the blocks the only worthwhile puzzles. The math weights was comically easy and the first to finish by far every time. The tangrams and pipes I have seen before in other games. The points are pointless.

RATING: 6
I hadn’t heard anything about this game (even though it’s a game from the designer of Eclipse), so I didn’t have any expectations when it hit the table. It turns out that it’s a game of four small tasks you need to solve before the time runs out in order to place tiles (each round you choose one of the four puzzles to solve, and there are 24 or so of each). On these tiles you can place your pawns and score points depending on the paths the tiles are forming (not the actual tiles, but what’s depicted on the tiles), and the first one to reach 15 points is the winner. While this spatial element is quite cool, what really make the game interesting are the puzzles. I love these, and I’m positive that my wife will too.

I’m very good at the math one, and I’m very poor at the last one (the one with the shapes)… The “view from the top” and “aqueduct” tasks are probably my favorites, not because I’m better at those (which I’m not), but they are the most enjoyable. Even though you are good at the four tasks, you still need to place the tiles wisely in order to win, and other players can block you or sneak into your paths so they score points too, so there are really two different games going on in this one. It’s a very different game, and it’s definitely not a “normal” game, but if you like puzzles and has a good “visual/spatial” IQ, this game might be something you enjoy. I know I do! I am somewhat concerned about the replayability, though, as there is a limited amount of puzzles in each of the four categories, so after a handful of plays you might be able to remember how to solve most of the puzzles. But for the first couple of games it’s really enjoyable!

The puzzle part of this is great - and even if one doesn't care for the game, one can still enjoy the puzzles.  I like the tile-laying aspect as well, but with 2 players there isn't much competition for the circuits so it can be a pretty quick trip to the finish.  Overall, my kids and I enjoy this one.  Mostly for the puzzles.

I feel like I should enjoy this game more, since it has a lot of things going for it: simple logic puzzles, quick playing time, a touch of tactics.  But in the end, all that got washed away by the fact that some puzzles were just way more difficult than others, and it felt random again.  Ubongo Das Duel has the best solution to this problem, in that it has players working on the same problem at the same time.  Something like that would have been nice here.

RATING: 4.5
The puzzles are quite neat but competitive puzzling can get a bit demoralising for those who aren't good at it so the game needs to be played with people of a similar ability. Rules it out for family play.

Tile-laying game where you have to complete puzzles before being able to lay the tile. Really hard for anyone who is remotely challenged in areas of maths or spatial awareness.

A semi-timed puzzle game. A ton of fun and pretty descent challenge UNLESS someone in your game sucks at puzzles. Then they will get depressed and feel stupid while the rest of you laugh about how smart you are. This could engender resentment. So emphasize that the goal of the game is to have fun with puzzles, not to win.

RATING: 6
Wow this one plays fast!. It is approximately 6 rounds before some reaches the end condition of 15 points. This does means there is a great deal of replayability out of the box as the stack of each puzzle type is fairly large.

The puzzles themselves vary greatly in difficulty with the pipe puzzle and the weights puzzles a lot simpler than the blocks or tangrams puzzles. Player ability is also a large factor in the outcome.

The timer is also very very short and can lead to situations whereby players do not necessarily complete any puzzles and therefore never have a chance to place any tiles.

I like it because I do enjoy the puzzle aspect but the time pressure is immense when playing which I do not necessarily enjoy but I understand why it is present. It also ensures the game stays quick and fast making this an enjoyable filler game.

The most common criticism I have heard about the game is that “type A puzzle is way harder than type B”. To some extent this will depend on the attitudes of the players concerned. If all players are prepared to throw caution to the wind and try out a range of puzzles including those they are not very good at then Enigma becomes a fun, quick playing, easy to learn family game with a generous dose of Mickey taking (especially when dad has to take off his shoes and socks to solve the maths puzzle).

Complete puzzles in order to place tiles in front of you, the tiles score points based on the rooms they depict and where you decide to place your 'archaeologists'.

You and your opponents choose a puzzle each and you all try to complete your own one as fast as possible, if one player has finished (or knows they are about to finish) they can turn a sand timer which gives everyone else 30 seconds (if I remember rightly) in which to finish their puzzles or they fail.  If you finish your puzzle you get to play your tile in front of you which will likely net you more points at the end.

The puzzles are all challenging without being frustrating, and I think they cover a fairly wide range of puzzle solving skills, meaning that people who are poor with certain types of puzzle will still be able to find a type of puzzle they can accomplish most of the time.  There are also plenty of puzzles in the box, enough for a whole bunch of playthroughs.

Well designed puzzle game. While some puzzles are harder to solve than others, the game gives plenty of time to those who may struggle.

Fun game. Easy to teach and great to play.  I really enjoy the puzzle aspect of the game, the tile laying aspect is average and obvious. Ok components, paper thin theme. 

Enigma is definitively at its best with 4 players. With less players some puzzles won't see play time. I feel there are some puzzles that are considerably easier than others. For me the math and pipe puzzles are very easy while the perspective one is almost impossible. It seems there is an unbalance here but I'm not sure yet if that's an issue for me. 

Bottom line, I want to play again soon. I will probably keep it in my game collection for now.

Enigma was quite entertaining, more so than Ubongo or Blokus 3D. The unpredictability of what type of puzzle you will have a chance to solve, and what type of tile you can get enhances replayability, and offers more opportunities for decision making. The thin veneer of theme is a pleasant bonus.

Well, now we are talking! Fascinating game: a bit like Ubongo (that part of game is at least as good as Ubongo 3D), a bit like other puzzle games. This feels like a Brain Academy (Wii-game) to me. The second part of the game, where you build routes to get some points brings some tactical element to the game which makes this even better. I'm definitely going to buy this, when it comes available. And I hope Touko will make some kind of expansions as well - at least there is a good possibility to do so. Enigma is the best game so far from Touko (I've played Eclipse, Walnut Grove, Arvuutin, Aether, Principato, Politix) - and I think your opinion will be same IF you like puzzles. If not, then this is not a game for you!

Wow, this fucking game. I've never had a game filled with more frustration than this one. Essentially, Enigma is a game filled with puzzles and more puzzles; those tiny brain teasers at the back of the newspaper and you're essentially trying to complete your puzzle before everyone else. So every two minutes, you can see me sigh heavily and throw the puzzle across the room at being beat to the finish line AGAIN. And if that's not enough, the scoring mechanic is another puzzle to solve; tile placement to score victory points. And of course this only happens IF you complete your puzzle within the time frame! Argh! So much rage! It's a game filled with more aggravation than joy for me but that's my own damn fault for not being one of these super-smart, riddle-solving douchebags. I have a life, okay?! And yes, I have a skills. They just happen to be ones this game doesn't reward!

I'm not sure on the rating for this one even after a couple plays.  The name of the this game definitely fits.  There are really multiple enigmas in this game.  It a puzzle game with four different puzzles but there is strategy to picking a puzzle because you are looking for tiles to place that help you.  This tile placement has a bit of a Carcassonne feel as you place workers that stay on the board until they score but you can both score the same color in a conduit if you have two separate conduits unite.  So there are two puzzles.  you also have to weigh which puzzle you are best at to try to finish faster than you opponent so they can't even participate in the place tile phase.  So many facets to this game that brings so many puzzle-like mechanics together.  However, the game can just be frustrating as a puzzle game and I really like puzzle games.  I just wonder it there is just too much hence the uncertain rating.  We'll see with more plays.

Better than expected. Needs house rules for variety.

:) Good puzzles
:) Scoring is a puzzle too

:soblue: Timer too long, most will complete their puzzle
:soblue: Would have be cool if a game was built around the puzzles

What an odd game.

The part of the game where you score points is basically a simplified carcassone (put figures on features, when they're finished, get points for colours your pawns were on). This part is actually crucial and if you're not careful you'll get runaway leaders. Thing is - it's not where the gameplay is. 

See - to lay down tiles you need to solve the puzzle on its back side. There are four different kinds (3 spatial (one 3D, two 2D) one mathematical) and they're far from trivial. Everybody does them simultaneously and the first person who finishes theirs turns over the rimer. So, we had adults play and still it was ... aaaa .... [bleep].

And it was funny in a way that people got more fixated on puzzles than on the point scoring part of the game. They just wanted to solve the puzzle even if the time was up. And it's this weird situation, where you're playing a game together, but everybody's fixated on their own thing (obviously I don't play enough euros, ahem) - and people don't really care who wins. It's more of a dramaturgy to determine the end of the game.

Probably as people get better at it, the game gets better as well. And probably more focused on the scoring part. Pretty unique for better or worse. 

Worst part - I like the puzzles, I mean one of them is Tangram which I have a special fondness for. But I don't play games to play puzzles. Maybe I ought to see it as a sort of co-op. :D

Love this game! With 4 different types of puzzles and a tile placement/scoring mechanism similar to Carcassonne, this game is a hidden gem in our collection of puzzle-based games!

This game is really more of a set of 4 mini-games in one.  Each round players will pick one of the 4 puzzles with a circuit pattern on the back to attempt.  They will try to complete that puzzle in an allotted amount of time and if they succeed they score points Carcassonne style by placing a pawn on a circuit and getting that pawn back plus points when the circuit is closed on all sides.

The four mini-games are tanagrams (like from Ubongo), an equality puzzle where you put cubes on either side of a scale on different numbers to make them equal, a 3D puzzle where you are attempting to make 4 3D shapes match the overhead view picture, and a pipes puzzle where you have to connect pipe pieces maze-like so everything connects properly.

I like puzzles alright but I don't like games that are typically just a collection of mini-games and I really don't like solitaire experiences.  Both of those things I don't like describe this game perfectly.  However, the game is alright.  The turns go by so quick, and in total the game itself goes by quickly that it's not that bad for the 90 second brain burner puzzles you have to solve.

It's not something I would play very often or even suggest probably but I wouldn't mind playing it if suggested either.  I also imagine that it is a good academic exercise for younger kids (even 4 intelligent adults had issues solving some of the puzzles even without the time constraints).

It's a great idea in a nice package, but I have to wonder who are the target customers.  
It's a little hard for kids or elders, if you don't like puzzle it feels like homework.
I like the game and would play it, but there's no way I would buy it.

I had high hopes for this; Touko has delivered a couple of interesting games, with Walnut Grove being my preferred one, but all of his designs seem nicely different. He certainly doesn't seem to rest on his laurels and keep designing the same thing (*cough, Uwe Rosenberg*).

Alas, the puzzles weren't greatly interesting and the 3D puzzle (as a big fan of Ubongo 3D) was by far the hardest of the four for our group which seemed to oddly imbalance the game (or remove 1 player each round).

The tile laying game on the reverse of the tiles then was also anticlimactic with a little route-connecting but nothing in the way of interesting or difficult decisions to be made.

Also, from Zoch I had high hopes for the production quality, but this just left me feeling a but underwhelmed. The pipe puzzle appears to be an afterthought as though they decided at the last minute that a fourth puzzle type was needed and the tangram is so small some players couldn't tell if they'd built it incorrectly.

An ambitious failure, I'm afraid.

Really fun puzzle game, but some of the puzzles are so much easier than the others, so people always end up taking the easy one first and if the others happen to get a particularly tough one from the others, it is very difficult to get it done in time. Could really do with an expansion and maybe some house rules for puzzle choosing.

First off, this game is completely themeless... so if that bothers you, then you've got a good excuse to avoid the game.

There's two parts to Enigma. The game part of it, is a tile laying exercise where you're laying tiles to extend (or end) a network of pipes. Laying a tile allows you to place one of your three markers onto one of the colored nodes on that network. When the network closes you'll get points equal to how many nodes of your color exist in the network. It's a simplified version of Carcassonne. I want to say that this part of the game is somewhat interesting, but honestly I wouldn't know as I only got to lay a single tile in the entire game.

Why? Because at the beginning of every turn you have to tackle one of four puzzles (a tangram, a 3D Tetris-y thing, a math problem-y thing, and a pipe diagram thing). If you successfully complete your puzzle in a timed race, then you get to lay a tile and play the real game. Otherwise you just sit out for the round.

If you're good at puzzles, this might be fun. If not, then you'll just sit around watching everyone else play the game. I'm not good at racing people to solve puzzles, so I absolutely hated this game. If I never play this thing again, it wouldn't be too soon.

Fun game. With 4 players it's good that you can't always get a puzzle where you are good at. Have to try a 2 player game with Wife when I buy this :)

Explorer placement exactly like in carcassonne for roads... With 1-3 different lanes

I enjoy puzzle games from time to time.  I love La Boca (which came from Make 'N Break) and I like Ubongo.  Combine elements of those two games plus Tanagrams and some math problems and you have most of Enigma.  I'd rather just play La Boca or Ubongo.  But if asked I suppose I'd play this, but not at 2p.

A series of simple competitive puzzles clumsily smushed together into a single game.  The main board that the puzzles play into doesn't really add anything to the game, and the puzzles aren't interesting enough to make a good game on their own.

Commented after one game with three newbies. Puzzle game with Carcassonne-ideas. Nice collection of different games in one game. There are some tactical decisions when choosing the puzzle, but overall quite light game. Would work with casual players and with couple of beers.

I [b]really[/b] like the puzzles, some of which are surprisingly difficult. [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] for those.

A completed puzzle pretty much becomes a [thing=822][/thing] tile that you can place, for non-exclusive point-grubbing.  Unfortunately, the layout isn't great for perceiving the points or the paths — it's actually pretty darn bad for seeing the paths.  [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] for this Carcassonnesque part.

The start player role rotates around the table, and players choose their puzzles in player order.  That means you are guaranteed to get your pick of preferred puzzle type once each round.  Unfortunately, this means that with four players, the last in turn order just gets what she gets, for better or worse.  Unfortunately, this also decides which circuit piece you're trying to place, and this is where it bites.  At worst, it's effectively the same as Carcassonne, in that you get whatever tile and place it, but somehow it feels a little annoying in this game.  [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b]

Overall, I loved the puzzles enough that I want to play more, and I'm tempted to buy it….

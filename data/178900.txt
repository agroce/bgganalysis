Like Concept, this game can be figured out on the fly in about a minute by anyone who wants to join in. Unlike Concept, some more advanced (but still very intuitive) thought processes can ensure better victory conditions. So simple yet, the possibility of advanced analysis is there.

Finally got this to the table.
Great game but was a lot more thinky and a lot less party than I expected.
Must try it with the timer to see if that is more fun.

RATING: 4
Some thoughts I had after two different evenings (6-7 games): Neat game, but overpriced for what you get. By the end of the first evening, a couple of us had figured out that the game turns and sort of breaks when you get someone as a codemaster who is really good at concept association (and thus good at being the ghost in Mysterium, the clue giver in Concept, etc). The people who just did straight association of words (e.g. "Musicians, 2" and yields "Kid, Rock") had a much rougher/tense go at it than the people who did conceptual linking to examples (e.g. "Jurisdiction, 6" and ended up with London, New York, Australia, Bermuda, etc which just sort of ends the game). The difference is you can still get screwed by interpretation of the dream cards in Mysterium (or just get a shitty draw) where as it just sort of falls over here. Reminds me of Set in that regard (where skill imbalance is a key factor). Second, the game dragged ass above 9 players. The discussion phase lags because you're waiting in lock step for a clue to be given where as in Mysterium you can be working on someone else's clue while you wait for your own. Our best games we had in that regard were at 5p, maybe 6p. Above that, and I'd probably break up into two groups and play something else. I think one of the most telling things is that with Mysterium, we played that until they made us go home every week for like 6 weeks, where as this, we played for maybe 2 hours and everyone was ready for something new after just the first week (both groups on different days even...) It's a game I'll play if it shows up (and there isn't anything else to play right off hand), but I'd never buy it.

almost a year later, I find it's just ok, but it improves some if you use dixit cards instead of words which is where I think Mysterium achieves a better "group guess the interpretation" setup. Baring that, I think it should be a requirement that there are no single guess clues.

Really fun, quick "party game" (just like everyone says).
It's easy enough not to follow the eyes of the spymaster as other reviews have complained.
It's over quickly, gets a laugh, nice and social, has varients for 2/3 players.
huge play ability due to amount of words.

It's not got a huge amount of depth but then it's not that sort of game.
The "grid" card is a bit small but an nice app can replace that.

While there is a good bit of downtime between turns, the game has some fun and interesting wordplay/connections going on.

When playing, we had the opposing team score the words right or wrong because that seemed to help lessen the odds of accidentally giving information away to the other team.

RATING: 4
[I]tl;dr -  This one got a lot of hype, but it really depends on the group and can easily get overplayed. The basic concept of giving clues is really good, though.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Codenames is a fairly fun social game but I'm not as high on it as most people are. The best part of the game is being the spymaster, but if you're playing with any more than four players, going around to let everyone be the spymaster takes a LONG time. I feel like not getting to be the spymaster is kind of lame, but that must be the only way people are playing this with 10+ people. 

The basic game structure is fine, but this one flaw means that games are either unsatisfying for many people, or take way too long for the game offered. I also find the game very repetitive after one session of 2-3 rounds, so I only like this one every so often. Unfortunately, our group loves it so even though I don't own it, we play it a lot. 

[b]The basic spymaster concept is implemented much better in [thing=224037][/thing], since both players get to be a spymaster[/b] -- its become the go-to two-player game for my wife and I, and I highly recommend it.

LIKE: Solid game, easy to learn. Good variation between plays.
DISLIKE: Rules of silence are important and inadvertently broken. Game is a bit light and needs the right group.

OVERALL: Fun game for a group, because the team aspect creates that tension and interesting dynamics. I don't think it'd be as fun with less than 6.

RATING: 6
Don't get the hype.  A good game, but after a few plays I lost the desire to play it much more.

Update : Raised the rating to an 8 after a long hiatus from the game.  Had a few fun plays recently.  I think I'd gotten frustrated with too much down time in this game.  With a timer/people who play quickly and lots of 'help' (ie trash talking) from the other team during turns, this game is fun.

Update 2 : Back down to 6 again.  For every good game I've had, I've played two painful ones.

Alright. I like it too. It's a nice challenge as the spy master. Conversely, if you are listening to bad clues, it's very frustrating. It's tempting to give precise clues for 1 card as if slow and steady wins the day - and often enough, the game reduces to just this. But with a bit of stretching, you can get more than 1 clue done. And better, you can mentally file away past clues to surge ahead later. Certainly approachable. Good for a group of 4+. Will I put it into my collection? Hmm. Difficult to say.

I do not know which is more fun, playing the spymaster given hints or trying to figure out the clues. Either way Codenames is entertaining. The only worry I have about the game is the possibility for serious analysis paralysis with some players if they just cannot make up good hints. Fortunately the publisher has supplied the players with an hourglass to keep the pace fast.

Anyways, Codenames certainly lives to its rating offering superb party fun for the early evening when the going is not too crazy.

RATING: 5
I had heard a lot of buzz around this game before I got the chance to play it, and at the time I didn't get what all the excitement was about.  Having now played it, I have to say... I still don't get it.  Well, maybe I can see why other people like it, but it just doesn't do it for me.

The game is very thin on theme which, being a Eurogamer, doesn't usually bother me so long as the game is interesting mechanically, but this one falls flat in that regard as well.  This game is highly prone to analysis paralysis if you don't use a timer (which I didn't in any of my plays), resulting in most players sitting around doing nothing while one or a small portion of players thinks long and hard.  The play time on the box says 15 minutes, but our games took more like 30, and it felt like more than 30 due to the down time.  There's very little thinking or planning you can do outside of your own turn unless you are a clue-giver, which makes the down time more pronounced.

The limitation of single word clues is highly restrictive, and trying to give clues about a randomly selected group of words is even more restrictive.  It's extremely difficult to come up with clues that will lead to more than 2 answers unless the board favors such clues, and even if you could come up with such a clue, odds are it would be so obscure or convoluted that your teammate(s) would never guess it.  Typically the best you can hope to accomplish in a turn is to get two answers correct, usually with the second one being a bit of a toss-up.  I usually agree with the adage that restrictions breed creativity, but the restrictions in this game feel so much so that it chokes out creativity.

Additionally, it's very hard to carry any information over from turn to turn.  Usually you will find the clues your teammate was going for, meaning you are back to square one the next round.  Blindly guessing is not a valid strategy except in desperate situations as you can hit an opponent's word or, worse, hit the assassin and lose straight out (which is not only disappointing for the losing team, but is a rather lame way to win).

I generally find Vlaada Chvatil games overly fiddly with an excessive number of rules, and while I don't find this game fiddly, I do find it too confining.  I don't know whether it would be better off with more rules or less, but I do know this isn't a game for me.  If I want to play a game that involves giving clues and trying to think like someone else, I will reach for Dixit or Mysterium instead.

(+) Very popular (especially with non-gamers), easy to teach, tying words together with clues is really enjoyable, splitting into teams is fun, plays quick, lots of variability added with the cards and key, great price

Everyone loves it! We have twice used it as the main game at parties (with very mixed groups of people) and it was a success both times. A few of the attendees later purchased the game for themselves. I have played it with older folks who are not gamers at all and they loved it. I have even played it with teenagers and children under 10 and they wanted to go 20 rounds for each team. It's a great little game (as long as you don't have any cheaters--Dad!) and the huge variety of words makes it very non-repetitive.

What's this?  A party game that is enjoyable?  Yes, sir!

This one can be really dependent on the base intelligence of the group you are playing with.  Smart people can come up with some remarkably clever clues (even though they are only one word!) that are a thing of beauty, based on references to history, literature, etc.

Other groups?  I could see this falling flat (unless there happens to be that one time where the clue giver could say, "Animals, 4" and have all of the animal words conveniently lined up).

RATING: 8
A very easy game to teach and plays very quick and can fit a big group. It is one of those games where a review does not do it justice till you play it. It is immensely interactive and interestingly even when it is not your team's turn you are constantly discussing old clues and planning whether to push your luck with another clue if you are leading or trailing in the game. 
Downsides are firstly, the clue giver is under the spotlight and there is stress as the whole team depends on how you come up with clues. Also, more vocal players will dominate the game over quieter ones especially in bigger groups. 
Overall though such a simple game but yet so good I played 6 games in a row and still would not have minded to play more. Highly recommended.

I will give it credit for having made something new out of a really simple concept, but on the other hand I don't really see what all the fuss is about.  I think it's an enjoyable mental exercise, but this game is not crazy, it's not loud, it's not funny... I don't really see how it would work in a party atmosphere. 

I like the fact that Codenames is a cooperative game. It kinda reminds me of Mysterium, which is a game I really like, and yet, since there are words instead of pictures, usually the guessing part is pretty straight-forward and not as fun. That wouldn't be so bad actually though, if it wasn't for the fact that this game has A LOT of downtime. You sit there watching people thinking to come up with a clue and then listen to other people thinking out loud about what that clue could mean. Then finally it's your turn and you do the exact same thing. 

So I don't particularly enjoy Codenames and I really can't see how this could work in a party-like situation. Apparently I just don't see in this box what many other people see. For me it's boring and really too slow and long for what it is.

1st plays: Played a few games with the wife in 2p, and I was surprised at how much it plays well with 2.  I'm sure the sweet spot is 6, or maybe 4, but it really does work well with 2.  I don't know how this game didn't exist before, but it's excellent.

2nd plays: Played with gamers and 3p, as a Co-op racing the AI player.  Even better, the moments as you listen to the field agents discussing the clue and pointing at the wrong clue is so enjoyable.  The moment when you realize they've made a logic leap you didn't see coming, and trying to mentally avert the crisis.  And as the field agent, trying to figure out what the heck the clue actually means!

:cry::cry::cry::what::what::):):):)  This is what everyone's raving about? The title should be "Little box of MEH." It isn't a BAD game, exactly, but it's more of a party style activity than a game, and not all THAT interesting of one. Fine for 20 minutes of filler amusement, but not really for much else. Much like NewsRadio's WNYX was once described, this is a game that is just positively bursting with... adequacity. Or as I like to say, this game is aggressively mediocre.

This was an instant hit as a group game. Being a spymaster or agent is equally engaging, though the former is much more challenging. The number double-sided cards means the game doesn't get stale. I like that it's a little more "thinky" than a lot of party games. I always bring this to group gatherings, just in case.

I almost feel bad rating this a six because it's saved me from hours of torment playing the various terrible Apples to Apples derivatives (Cards Against Humanity, etc.) but due to its nature it's not something I want to play when I want to play games. I play it at parties. Unfortunately, I never actually want to play games at parties, I just do it because other people like to. 

So, on the one hand I sort of dislike Codenames because I don't consider it up to snuff to play at an actual game night with other hobbyists, but on the other hand I love Codenames because it allows me to cut down on the amount of time I spend playing absolute trash. I guess that boils down to a resounding vote of "OK." I also only paid seven bucks for that so it's more palatable to own it as a defensive measure. I would never have purchased it if friends of mine didn't insist on bringing out terrible games at parties.

I also rate Taboo a six and that's basically the mirror version of this game. 

The components are rather poor. The cardboard tokens are fine but the cards are flimsy and the key has the cards portrayed as square rather than rectangular which is just bad design.

Can be a great time, however with some groups it can grind to a shuddering halt.

People like it. I find it somewhat amusing to play as the spy master and to try and come up with clue. But outside of that, there's not really much game to this game. Usually, players get thrown off by overthinking the clue, not by simply taking the obvious answer that they say immediately after receiving the clue, so that certainly seems to be an indication that not much thought is really required to play this game, except as the spy master.

Which then falls back on the social experience. And, there, I feel like games like Spyfall, Resistance, or even Cards Against Humanity have a more fulfilling social and/or thematic element.

I'm thinking this one is going to fade away pretty quickly. I smell fad. We'll see.

Some people hate just to hate on the hotness. But this is great for what it is, a very accessible, interesting social word game. Being the clue giver is very fun and challenging, and guessing makes for an interesting battle as well.

Codenames is a team game. Each team's spy master knows the solution to the puzzle and must provide clues to their team in order that they can solve it quicker than their opponents.  An assassin, who can bring your round to a sudden end, adds some spice.  The difficulty for the spy master lies in offering clues that link multiple correct words, but no incorrect ones.  It all works fine.  I like it slightly better as a four-player than with larger groups and it is definitely more interesting to take the spy master role.  All the same,  this kind of puzzle-ish exercise doesn't excite me.

Πολυδιαφημισμένο party game από τον δημοφιλή Vlaada. Ο λαός λέει πως όπου ακούς πολλά κεράσια, κράτα και μικρό καλάθι, όμως το Codenames καταφέρνει και lives up to the hype. Οι κανόνες είναι πολύ απλοί. Οι παίκτες χωρίζονται σε 2 ομάδες και ορίζουν από ένα αρχηγό. Τοποθετούμε στο τραπέζι τυχαία 25 κάρτες/λέξεις και τραβάμε μια κάρτα που δείχνει στους αρχηγούς ποιες από τις 25 λέξεις είναι δικές τους. 

Σκοπός των παικτών της κάθε ομάδας είναι να βρουν πρώτοι ποιες είναι οι δικές τους λέξεις, ακολουθώντας τα στοιχεία που δίνει ο αρχηγός. Ωραία προσθήκη είναι και η ύπαρξη μιας λέξης βόμβας που αν μια ομάδα πέσει πάνω της, χάνει αμέσως το παιχνίδι. Προφανώς και παίζει σημαντικό ρόλο η επιλογή αρχηγού στο τελικό αποτέλεσμα. 

Τα components είναι απλά και λειτουργικά ενώ σημαντικό είναι πως οι λέξεις που διάλεξαν έχουν διπλή σημασία ώστε οι αρχηγοί να μπορούν να βρίσκουν έξυπνους συνδυασμούς. Φυσικά θα ήταν καλύτερα αν το παιχνίδι ήταν στα ελληνικά. Ελπίζω να βγει σύντομα μια ελληνική έκδοση.

Δεν χρησιμοποιήσαμε καθόλου την κλεψύδρα που παρέχεται στο κουτί αλλά μπορώ εύκολα να φανταστώ κάποιους που σαν αρχηγοί θα θέλανε κανένα μισάωρο για να δώσουν clue.

In Codenames, two teams compete to see who can make contact with all of their agents first. Spymasters give one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the board. Their teammates try to guess words of the right color while avoiding those that belong to the opposing team. And everyone wants to avoid the assassin.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
Two spymasters are attempting to contact their agents in the field, but communication is cryptic and limited. Twenty-five words are laid out in a grid which corresponds to a secret cipher only the spymasters can see. Hints are given which comprise a single word and a single number, indicating a clue that ties a certain number of words on the table together to be guessed. The first team to guess all of their words wins. It's very possible to pick your opposing team's words, neutral words, or the insta-lose Assassin word rather than your own. Be careful!

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
This is both a party game and not a part game. Great for big groups or 2v2. I don't like most party games, so this is a great niche-filler for me. The most interesting part of this game is the meta/lack of meta between the players. I might know a perfect clue for one person, but I have to consider the whole team. Just the same, a word I think is the right answer was totally missed by the spymaster, leading to hilarity and facepalming for everyone.

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
As with any guessing game with a time limit, you can get choked up and induce the ire of your teammates.

I could see words/clues causing an issue if the game was played too regularly, spymasters being able to recycle clues with known words... but for the most part, excellent little game.

This game appears fairly easy on first sight. The setup is very fast, the rules are plain and easy to grasp. Playing is fun and a lot trickier than you might think. The combinations of words on the double sided cards are sheer endless, so it has an extremely high replayability. It will not ever get boring. Playing with 2 players is do-able and fun, but you will really enjoy it with more. It is a perfect party game. You start to play in an instant and the fast rounds are really immensely entertaining.

Es un filler entretenido, pero esperaba más de la experiencia de juego (por las expectativas creadas), los tiempos entre el Jefe de espías y los agentes se siente lento, aun cuando en realidad pasa poco tiempo (juego con cronómetro). Lo positivo es su rapidez, lo que permite sacarlo en cualquier momento y con cualquier tipo de jugador.

Its replayability is its best feature, could just play codenames for hours and still have as much fun as the first time.

Great great game, deserves its spot as best party game. Appeals to people of all different natures.

Can Vlaada ever do anything wrong?  This game is pure genius who has done a variety of other mechanics.  

I would call this a "Gamer's Party Game".  You have to meta the crowd and think about what they might know and be very creative with clues to gain tempo on the other team.

Updated 11/9: Moved to 10.  After more replays, it is apparent that this game is a hit and everyone enjoys it.  Another side benefit is that people can hop in/out of the game while waiting for a "meatier" game.  It is almost always being played at our board game nights at any given time.

Juego de mecánicas muy simples.

Si los jugadores no entran en la dinámica, puede hacerse muy aburrido. 

También suele ocurrir que no todo el mundo es lo suficientemente ingenioso como para determinar una palabra que relacione más de dos cartas y el juego se resiente mucho.

Puede resultar tedioso mientras unos jugadores esperan a que otros determinen la palabra correspondiente.

No acabo de entender el hype que ha despertado. En mi caso ha resultado una completa decepción como party.

Patada a seguir.

To me this game is mediocre. I rated it a 7 because its a decent chill thinking party game that most people are okay with playing.  I do enjoy playing it when I do play it, but it's not a game that I am eager to play (I guess it just seems lack luster.)
I will say I have played it with a few different group of people new to the game, which includes us telling the rules and being the Spy Masters first and a few awkward rounds. So it does have a chance to get a better rating.

However derivative this one is, I'm not sure. Just a smash, though.

Codenames is best played with at least 2 people who have some experience with the game (to be the spymasters), but anyone can pick it up very quickly, and it goes over very well with almost any group.  

I think 6 is the sweet spot for player count, but it is also fun at 4 and 8.  I have played with more than 8 but wouldn't recommend it, as too many differing opinions really slow the game down.

It has been said of this game... why wasn't this thought of before.  And that is an excellent summary of the reaction most will have to this game.  It's a simple, simple game.  Executed with simplicity and yet so rewarding to play.  It scales with players and skills remarkably well.  It's approachable by gamers and casual players alike.  This is the kind of game one expects to see in the mass market and its entirely likely that it might get there.  And for the world at large, that's great because so is the game.  If you are looking for a word game or a party game that will rope the players in and have folks laughing and enjoying themselves regardless of gamer status, look no further.  A smart and spot on game design worthy of an award of two.

A modern classic. Playing as the cluegiver is a blast!

What really sets this game apart is its appeal to both the gaming crowd and also the casual crowd.

One criticism though -- sometimes, playing as the guesser can feel a bit flat and mindless if the cluegiver is playing conservatively and only going for two cards per round.

I'm not a big fan of these sorts of word games (Password, etc), so I'm not 100% on board the hype train for this, but it's nevertheless great that Vlaada has come along and more or less destroyed them with a superior game. Lots of potential here depending on who you play with, what clues you can think up, and the various placement schemata that the Spymasters have to work from. Inclusion of the Assassin ensures a game can end quickly. Good stuff, glad they have variants too, though I'd prefer to play with the Firm word rules because I feel like letting too many random judgement calls on homonyms and such will soil up a session.

I tend to dislike shorter games, there are other things that I'd much rather be spending my time doing.  However, if you need a shorter game as a filler, or a party game, this is one of the better ones.  You can teach it in 5 minutes, it works well with a varying number of players, and it's relatively inexpensive.

The theme is the most irrelevant that I've seen lately.  This is just a word association game.

Interesting concept, with great execution, and a very definite "Let's play that again!" vibe. But in the end, there's just not that much game there, and the amazing 4+-word clues just don't happen all that often, and the luster is very swiftly fading.

A very good "thinky" party game. The puzzle is really there (especially for the code giver), and there's a lot of interaction.

On the downside, it tends to be a long game for what it is, as the puzzles can be really tough.

UPDATE: I finally got why I don't like this game as much as I should (given it's a design by Vlaada, and an elegant, thinky party game). It's a "party game for introverts": an exercise in trying to read someone else, while politely arguing with your partners. For me, a party game must be loud and funny. Codenames is a decent deduction exercise, but a rather boring party game.

Zseniális!! Magasan a legjobb asszociációs partijáték szerintem. Sőt talán a legjobb partijáték, amivel valaha játszottam. Mindennél többet elmond, hogy az esseni játékújdonságoktól körülvéve is 6 partit lenyomtunk egyhuzamban. Mondjuk ez nem feltétlen jelent sok időt, volt 2 perces parti is, de a leghosszabb se volt 25 percnél több. A játék lényege, hogy egy szóval egyszerre minél több -az asztalon lévő- szóra utaljunk. Egyszerű, rövid, szerintem lehengerlő. Ezek után miért activitiznék valaha is az életben? Egyetlen hátránya, hogy (még?!) nincs magyar kiadás, mert ez igazán magyarul lenne jó. Örülök, hogy Chvatil nem csak komplex játékot tud jót csinálni.
Megjegyzés: körönként 2 szót 100%-os biztonsággal ki lehet találni egy elég faék sportszerűtlen módszerrel, de egyrészt ez megöli a játékot, másrészt nem is feltétlen nyerő, ha az ellenfél 2-nél többet tud átlagosan behúzni.

Ideally, with the key, you would try to guess the largest number of words, but it is certainly difficult to give such good keys to relate words usually with nothing in common.
Very easy, it has quite a big part of psichology, as in Dixit and similar games.

Vlada Chvátil is the most versatile, ingenious and inspired designer of boardgames in the market nowadays.
He is capable of crafting the most complex of the gamer's games (Through the Ages, Mage Knight), alongside funny designs (Space Alert, Galaxy Trucker) and now even on of the best party games ever.

Codenames is so simple and elegant, one would wonder why it wasn't already invented. Two teams of players compete to be the first in identifying every agent of their color. One player in each team must craft clues (using exactly one word and one number) to help teammates understanding behind which codename their agents are hiding.

The game is an exercise in lateral thinking, and the role of the spymaster is quite challenging: clues that group more than 2-3 words are definitely hard to find.

Codenames is one of those games you hardly abandon after just one game. Or after two or three...

Great team game for 4-6 people! If you enjoy using your brain in games this is a must, if not you may find it frustrating. There are other games out there with similar gameplay, but this is by far the best in my opinion for the average gamer, even over Codenames: Pictures. Definitely more enjoyable when played with witty individuals! Recommended Players: 4 or 6.

RATING: 5
My wife loves it. I like it. We've found it's a game that is great no matter who is around. Be sure to have the people who are the most familiar with the game be the spymaster for your first session or two before passing spymaster to people unfamiliar with the game, as that will make the game go better for everyone.

Edit: May 2017. As my wife and I continue exploring games, this game doesn't get played. We prefer more strategic options; K2/Via Nebula has been our "gateway" weight game of choice; and Junk Art is our light/party game of choice. There's still room on the shelf for this game, though, as it provides a unique experience, and is great at higher player counts. I am probably rating this a bit low, since it is very successful at what it intends to be. My rating, however, is an accurate reflection of my overall desire to play this game.

Edit: November 2017. After playing Codenames: Duet, I'm not sure we'd ever play the base version of Codenames again. Duet seems like a straight improvement to Codenames. This version will like be used a source of additional cards for Duet moving forward.

If you know what this game is, going into it, it's incredible.  It's simple to teach, quick to get to the table, and offers some very tense moments.

This is not the deepest game.  But I can get it to any gaming table without much work, and its moments are great.

I give it a few more points than a couple of other party games because there are rarely boring rounds.  Every round seems to have a moment worth talking about.

Je vormt een team met ke partner, en je moet uitzoeken welke kaartjes (met schuilnamen) tot je team behoren.
Je partner zegt een zelfstandig naamwoord of een eigennaam en een getal x.  Jij weet dan dat je x kaartjes kan raden die gerelateerd zijn tot het gezegde woord.
Pas wel op dat je geen kaartjes noemt van het andere team, want dat geeft hen een voorsprong natuurlijk.
En pas al helemaal op dat je de zwarte kaart niet noemt, want dan stopt het spel onmiddellijk.

RATING: 3
The group I played had this special way of giving clues – it totally feels like cheating, and nothing like the (supposedly) intended way to play.
Instead of giving a smart answer that may link to several words, they just built chain-words that made no sense, but each part of the chain clearly linked to a card on the table.

So, one can argue that my rating is heavily influenced by the group I played with.

Nevertheless I think that the Spiel des Jahres jury got the nomination for this game wrong. The nature of the game relies so strong on language that players' age factors in heavily => not a typical family game.

RATING: 7
It has been a long time since I played party games and this seems a gentle introduction as it is more of a thinking word game than a party game.  It is a really interesting challenge trying to find a 1 word guess that ties in more than one of your words.  At the moment I am terrible at giving the clues but there is plenty of fun here.  You do need to be able to come up with clues in the clue giver role for this game to work.  Also in a round there is a bit of a runaway leader problem as it is very hard to catch up in a round.  Still glad to have it, happy to play it.

After three plays I have a better grasp on commenting. A clever game that demands that the players are clever as well. The Spymaster must be on top of their game and I have witnessed a team's frustration when a clue word 'could' match more than the offered number and it was clear these other tie ins had been missed completely by the SM. Game is greatly assisted by the app timer. Rounds are quick so down time when its not you turn is minimal. Fun filler, certainly well thought out and tee'd up nicely for expansion decks in perpetuity. Could be an awesome experience with sharp players, will be dire with less competent players. Pick players and Spymasters wisely.

Follow on games show that the card array is 80% responsible for and enjoyable or dire game. The joy of cleverly connecting 3-4 words is massively offset by the torture of a game where not a single connection can be found. This is hell for the spy master and the team. Just to compound the angst, the game seems to compell post game autopsies where smug players say 'you should have said.....' where their offering makes no sense at all. Not really fussed if I ever play this again and certainly not a game I'd want to buy.

I have to admit this is a truly great party game, and one that will be added to my collection at some point. However, the end game isn't so spectacular. In a close match it, and most should be, it comes down to either taking a chance for the win or handing it over to your opponents to see what they can do. So, while it's a good game that provides wonderful team puzzle solving and inspires great debate, the game just kind of ends. It's like Mysterium without having to solve the crime to win. Just wishing it had that something extra at the end to close it out with a bang instead of a whimper.

RATING: 8
Really engaging team-based word game that makes you think in a creative manner without it being too free form. Trying hard to connect as many words as possible for your teammates is a fun challenge, as is the struggle to decipher the one word clue given you by your spymaster. Incredibly unique, but be warned- "party game" is a bit of a misnomer. This is a little more contemplative than the typical party fare. It's mostly quiet, but can also inspire laughter likes it's lighter brothers and sister.

One of my favorite party games.  I'm not normally a fan of word games, but this is so much more than a word game.  As a clue giver, one of the most rewarding experiences is when the single word the glues together three seemingly random things pops into your head.  You give the clue and suddenly your team has come from behind and stolen the game from the other team who only had one word left.

If you haven't played this game, go do it now!

The word association mechanic in this game really appeals to me, particularly my literature-loving side. It's always a fun creative challenge trying to find the connections between disparate words. One opponent really wowed me once with "Basketball 5". It's a great game, but the box should actually read 3-8 players, because the two-player game is utterly hopeless. Given it's usually just my wife and I playing, I traded this away in anticipation of the release of Codenames Duet, designed especially for two.

You need a flat area to set up grid of cards and non game talking between spymasters and operatives during the game is prohibited otherwise clues could be exchanged.  But game is quick, discussion afterwards is easy to do.

I was terrified to play this game because somehow I got the impression that it was a game similar to Dixit which requires creative clues based on almost nothing. That game infuriates me because I can't manufacture that kind of clue quickly, or effectively. I was pleased to discover that you actually have a lot to work with here in Codenames, and the challenge is more about figuring out simple links between multiple key words. I had a great time playing the game, and will probably seek it out again. I can see tell some people will not do as well as others when playing, and like-minded people might have an unfair advantage if teamed up together, but it's a great design that deserves all the attention it has received.

A party game winner!  I've played a lot of the Password board game over the years, but Codenames takes that idea and twists it in the right way.  Now gamers have more to do to keep it interesting.  And, non-gamers can still pretty much do the same thing (with a twist or two) and feel like it's easy enough to play.  I've had a lot of success teaching this to all types of game players.

There is a word game I like. This one is a really good party game. It's easy to explain. It generates laughter. It's clever. The possible word combinations and different colour distribution cards give this one a lot of replayability. I guess the concept of the game will get stale, before you find repetitons. Any problem? There is some downtime for those players not playing the spy master. So use the sand timer.

RATING: 2
6 Plays in with the family.  Found it very quiet, especially the first several minutes as the game.  The point of course is to have your teammates guess as many 'codenames' correctly with a single clue.  Maybe our groups were unimaginative or unlucky with the cards selected but many times it was a single codename for a single clue.  I was quite disappointed given the high rating of this game.  Might change it to a five with more plays but right now it sits at four.

EDIT:   A few more plays in , even less desire to play this game again.  No idea how this game is rated so well.  Lowering rating from 4 to 2 mostly as a protest to all of the high ratings.  Seriously feel somebody is paying for good reviews of this game.

Ughhhh like -- I enjoy this as a brain thing, kind of, and owning it is useful as social currency, but I just don't think the actual gameplay is that fun!  Augh!  There's just so much downtime, so if the mood is anything less than 100% party game with everyone totally light and happily talking and not paying that much attention, it just doesn't work that well to me.

My second favorite party game we own (behind Sushi Go Party!). It is a hit at young adults game night we do through our church. The game is simple, easy to teach, and plays very quickly with the right group of people. My only real criticism with the game is it can be a bit too easy depending on the board, and I think going first doesn't have enough of a handicap to make up for the advantage. 

For this cost, size, and complexity, you really can't do much better than Codenames. Recommended for sure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like the follow up "codenames pictures" a little better, but only a little. I would gladly play either and many people will likely prefer the words to the pictures. Ultimately the words are a little more straight forward to me and so it's a little easier to get into, but both are great games.

Christmas present 2015. This game is great game to bring to a party. The problem is if you suggest this game to group of non-gamers, the name suggest to them that this is tough on the brain or something. Once they start to play and get what is going on they really get into the game. 
A simple game, there are 2 teams (red or blue) that have one person calling out clues to their team members to have them guess and pick a set of cards with words on them that match a secret card with a grid of where the red or blue team cards are located. There is a huge stack of cards with words on both sides that are used to lay out a 5x5 grid. In the same grid of worded cards is a spy that if one of the team picks the spy then they lose. A lot of the words have similar meanings so giving a clue for a set of cards you want your team to guess might have them guess a card that is for the other team, or worse the Spy. Whichever team is the first to pick all their color's cards without revealing the spy is the winner.

I'm not sure I consider this a party game. Yes, this game is accessible to many, but just because it is accessible doesn't make it a party game. It is very thinky, and can slow down, which is why I play with a chess clock now. While the clock makes it a bit more difficult, it makes the game far more enjoyable in my experience!

RATING: 8
The weaker alternative whenever a party game is to be chosen, Codenames relies heavily on the players' (and even more so a team leader's) skills at categorizing things to be enjoyable somehow. If such is your group, lucky you: moderate fun ensues.

With the typical boneheads that plague most game meetings though Codenames might lose any appeal quickly, as playing it becomes a slog soon. [i](August 2016)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - Actually, after repeated plays something clicked and suddenly Codenames has turned into a light game we all enjoy: the reason is explained easily, the group we’ve been playing it with has changed. When party and filler games are around, these new people are less competitive and don’t aim to look like the brightest bulbs around: they just want to have loud fun, which is what I’ve always been looking for too. Codenames benefited from such a change as well, as it showed how fit for our common playstyle it is.
Hence in January 2018 I’ve raised my rating from 6 to 8.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
It's pretty amazing that such a simple idea can turn into such a fun game.  This game works really well, and I really think this would be a neat team building activity at work (might need to use this...).  I played first without being the clue giver, and was like "bah, this would be easy".  Boy was I wrong, it is super tough to be the clue giver, and when playing with a timer its super nerve raking!

A fun game that is simple to teach and easy to play. I have found that some players can really "lock up" with AP when they are giving the clues and this makes what should be a simple, fun game drag a bit. My wife loves it and that is a plus in my book.

Codenames is an easy to learn party game, but has enough depth to entertain serious gamers.

However, it suffers from excessive downtime.  The game design encourages clue givers to take their time giving clues to their time, forcing the other team to sit in silence for long periods of time.  The game comes with a optional timer, but people don't want to use it because it isn't a standard part of the game.



If you are looking for a light party game, I suggest Taboo, Dixit, or Telestrations. I only recommend playing this at parties because it does a good job of handing changing numbers of people.

I was a bit leery of this title owing to the hype, but I found it a very light and tight, short, thinky parlor game. I don't think it deserves the level of excitement that it has gained but I really, really dig it and I wouldn't let it leave my collection. The most fun part is the fun conversations of "How could you not get that?!?" and "That is crazy clever, Bill. Crazy. You are an alien." I will say that it definitely fires a whole host of lame 1980's games that tried to fill this niche. Recommended!

To be honest I don't understand the hype surrounding this one. Its ok I guess...but at higher player counts why not just play dixit, and at lower player counts I much prefer mysterium or playing an actual board game.

I find it plays best when the group actually has two timers, so one is always ready to be flipped. Every time someone has mentioned to me that they don't understand how it falls so flatly with them, that it's a largely silent affair that simply ISN'T a party game, I ask and they invariably mention they didn't use the timer.

Well, sure. But the pressure that comes from the timer (applied to both on the spymaster and his guessers, hence the need for two timers) is what brings out the voices and the party-style nature of the game.

Rarely does a game just click with all types of players but Codenames has done just that. Trying to figure out clues to give (or those given to you by a spymaster) and associate them correctly with the grid of 25 words is a great challenge that takes time to get good at. Plus it will be context dependent as certain players or teams will have different points of reference to rely on. This has earned the game of the year awards it received because while the game mechanic is incredibly simple, it opens up tons of replay ability and fun. 

Looking forward to many more games of this, and also trying variants.

At last there is a party game which involves intelligence and fun at the same time. Perfect for everybody and for different ages, does not concentrate on reflexes, knowledge or dexterity. You need a lot of clever thinking to have a chance at winning a round. Maybe it should have a little more words to choose from. It works even for 2 players, but sadly at least 4 players are needed to fully experience the game.

I haven't been an avid game collector for very long, yet, but I noticed I've been a bit obsessed with collecting games that require a substantial time commitment, and are a little over-saturated with complexity and rules. So recently, I've decided to look for games that are more simplified, and easy to pick up, because complexity does not always indicate fun. And that's how I came across Codenames, a brilliantly simple and frequently hilarious party gaming experience.

Good game.  Depending on the spymaster, it can take too long where guessers get visibly bored waiting.  Can add a timer, but becomes a bit stressful on the spymaster.  

Traded.  I'm in the minority here, but I prefer Codenames: Pictures.  More accessible to kids and some friends not comfortable with English.

It's all about getting into the other people's heads, very fun game and the real trick is figuring out how to get multiples since it is easy to give single word hints.  Great party game.

Quite a fun game word/party game genre.  So simple and elegant it's amazing it didn't already exist.  The only negative is that it really requires either 6 or 8 people which is a little restrictive.

RATING: 7
I think the idea of this game is genius, however, I am only interested in playing it with 6 players or more. I think the game play falls flat when you don't have a team to discuss or argue your opinions. Great party game, but not a "small family" game.

Best take on a "word game" I have played in a really long time. Every game will always be different. A lot of creative thinking involved. Deduction. Discussion. Analytical and abstract thinking. It has a lot of depth for being so easy to pick up and play.

Side note: My mom enjoys this game, which is a feat not many games have accomplished.

Just a fantastic party game--the best I've found. Don't take the scoring system too seriously or worry about being competitive. Just enjoy coming up with clever hints, and have a great time as the guessers argue vociferously over what the hints mean.

Very easy to teach new players. It's basically a surefire hit--I've introduced this to some wildly differing groups of people and it's been a hit every time. It works best with six people in two teams of three; seven or eight work fine too. You can also play a reasonable game with four or five, but then it starts losing some of its charm.

It's easy to bring to social events or play when space is limited. The box is small and lightweight and there aren't too many components.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I have too major complaints about this game. The first simply being too much downtime. Secondly, some people like to play where the clue giver can't react at all when they say yes to a clue because it would reveal that was the correctly associated word. This is a huge bummer for me and really defeats this games potential to be a good party game. Why play a "party" game that fails to encourage laughter and table-talk?

Overall, it doesn't live up to the hype, although these couple complaints don't kill the game for me. In fact, I can safely recommend this game after having seen so many people have a great time with it (also it's quite short and inexpensive).

It's a 6 as a clue giver and 7 as a guesser so I met it in the middle at 6.5.

RATING: 8
First two games with 4 players. Fun as I expected and actually a bit of a brain burner. I can see this being even better with 6 or 8 players. Looking forward to many more plays.

Update 09/12: played many more 8+ player games at Gamealot 2015. Still a blast and a great party game. Lots of good 'stories' to tell when you've had a few rounds.

RATING: 10
Very cool for large groups - trash talk desirable when the other team is debating about possible solutions.
Endless replay value. Like it most with 6 players. More is perfectly fine, but discussions tend to be longer and undecided with large groups.
An ingenious design.

Neat party game, that I really enjoyed. I would rate this higher, but those who have exceled in English grammar and vocabulary will have an edge. The players in the first games we played, the spymasters would limit their hints to only one code word. I could see 2 or 3 tiles matching most of the time, but I am a writer and love languages. Still, the game was enjoyed by all, and we played two in a row as a late night filler.

Codenames has quickly become my favorite 'party game' to pull out when I have a group of people who aren't gamers.

One of the things that makes it shine is that as long as you have two people who have played before, you don't even have to explain the rules! I just set up the tiles, start, and explain as I go. This characteristic makes it very easy to get to the table.

The 2 player game is fun, but the 4+ player game is fantastic.

RATING: 9
What is there to say? This game has slowly taken over my table to the point that it gets played more than almost anything else. I haven't adjusted my rating on it in a while, and if I was going to, this could be rated a bit lower if only because I can get a bit burnt out on it. I think in a year though it will be hitting the table regularly but not at the near constant rate that it is now, at which point I would probably still rate it the same. This is a true crowd pleaser. The merits of the game have been well sung. I love that it's a more cerebral counterpart to a lot of the more raucous modern party games, a great addition to any game night with serious or non-serious gamers.

I can see the appeal in this game for others and why it is highly rated but the game just did not grab me as much. Gameplay is to binary and constricted to the grid you playing on.

This game is addictive!  And everyone judges the spymaster; "they're slow" "I'd do this" "You should have said..."

But then they try it, subsequently have their brain melted and then finally can sympathize for those in the "hot-seat."  It's hard but I love the challenge!  I always go for 3's or 4's whenever I can.  
Get a copy... just do it!  Get it!

RATING: 9
Great game of limited communication, and its popularity was probably also helped by its incredibly accessible price point. However, that is not to say that Codenames isn't a fun, puzzle-y and sometimes agonisingly difficult party game. It certainly doesn't create a loud and riotous atmosphere, but the perfect time to play this game is either Christmas with the family or at the pub with friends - so it firmly sits in that category for me. The game has also been great as an icebreaker at new game groups too. Articulating exactly what makes this game so much better than the other games like it is very difficult - but the agony of choice and the in-jokes you can make with you friends around the table all go towards putting this in a league of its own. The final reason I love this game, and have racked up 70+ plays so far is how balanced every grid in the game is. It possibly sounds daft to say it, but a hell of a lot of playtesting must have gone in to selecting all the words in the box - to the point where the mechanically identical Codenames: Deep Undercover is nowhere near as enjoyable, because it is too hard to create tenuously successful combos, because all the words in that edition are a bad combination of being far too similar or completely disparate ideas (or parts of the anatomy). Codenames, however, hits the nail right on the head. There always seems to be a risk that you'll reveal the assassin but you're very rarely so stumped for links that you have to resort to one-answer clues.

Grupo de 8 personas, abrir la caja, explicar el juego y en 10 minutos todo el grupo de risas y disfrutando. ¿Qué más se le puede pedir a un FILLER? Es increíble como una mecánica tan sencilla puede generar algo tan grande. No sé si seré víctima de HYPE pero me muero de ganas para jugarlo con otros grupos. Creo que lo ideal son 6-8 jugadores.

On its own this is a pretty interesting game, it takes conepts, ideas and mechanics that we've all used since the very beginnings of our lives and arranges them into a neat little box full of cards and bits and bobs.

This is another one that I don't feel lived up to its hype. It took so long to get this and I heard so much about this that I actually think it detracted from the game play experiance.

God, did I hate this the first time I played. It seemed more like a Rorschach test than an actual game. With a couple of plays, I like it more: It's an interesting creative exercise, and does make for some memorable moments. 

I still think this is a pretty bad party game. There are very few laughs, cheers, or surprising upsets: it's just a bunch of people staring quietly around a table. For this reason, I weirdly like the two-player co-op version the best.

If you like word party games, you'll probably like Codenames. But it suffers from "it's just a party game, don't worry about it" rules vagueness and slack.

I wasn't expecting to like this at all as it seems like just your standard "give your partner a clue so he can guess a word game", but this one is super clever.

The game is frustrating in a great way for the clue giver. As soon as you think you have a great clue formulated, you find some reason that your clue is a dangerous one, as it may lead your partner toward that one word that is the opponents' word, or even worse, the insta-lose card. It's very challenging to give good clues that allow your partner to get more than 2 words, but so satisfying when you pull it off!

Overall, an amazing game for this genre. While I don't love the genre, this is the best I've played in it.

Juego de deducción muy entretenido del que uno difícilmente se cansa de jugar. Aún cuando uno vaya perdiendo siempre dan ganas de jugar otra partida para ahora sí poder vencer al equipo oponente. Al tener muchas cartas con palabra en ambos lados tiene mucha rejugabilidad. La caja dice es para hasta 8 jugadores pero igual y se puede jugar con más personas por equipo.

Nifty thing where you have to make sure that you give clues that the others will get, but nothing that will maybe accidentally point them towards either the assassin or an enemy spy.

This is such a simple party game that in hindsight its design seems so obvious.  This is SUCH a good time.

It's clever because the entire game is in trying to come up with clues that are a bit of a stretch - if you only go for the obvious clues you'll never win, especially if you fall behind by even a single word.

That makes it seem to me like this is definitely the kind of game that's better with a group that all know each other well and can read each other a bit.

A lot of people are hailing this as a party game for people who don't like party games, but I'm not sure I agree. I suppose it depends on why you dislike them. If you just want something a bit more thoughtful, then sure, this definitely is. But as I said, the thought in the game is sort of contingent on being able to figure out people's thought processes and that sort of thing is DEFINITELY not everyone's cup of tea. I'm personally all for it, but I could see why someone wouldn't care for this.

I think there is a lot of luck in how similar your words are, but there is a lot of interesting lateral thinking about how best to build a set of clues. I think the 0s add a fun element to potential clue giving. It is also very important to interpret the other spymasters clues and use that information in your clue-giving. Fun game, and playable with a wide variety of people. Nice.

I’ve said it before, but I will say it again: Chvatil is probably the most talented and diverse game designer who has ever lived. I actually don’t care much for many of his games, although I do like some of them, and I think Uwe is the best designer ever. Still, hats off to Chvatil. This time he has designed a surprisingly simple party game which has gotten a lot of hype. I have had my eyes on it for a while, but due to the hype I went out and got it earlier than expected and paid a little more. And overall I’m glad that I did.

I’m definitely not a huge fan of this game and speak about it at every chance I get, as it seems a lot of people currently do, but I like it. It’s a deceptively simple word game in which you’re trying to get your team to guess 8 or 9 words which are placed randomly in a grid of 5 times 5 cards. 

The tension comes mainly when you’re the Spymaster and need to come up with a clever clue which allows your teammates to guess 2 or 3 answers in one shot! Also, the game is tense as you need to “outwit” your opponents, while still trying to make sure that your teammates don’t misinterpret (easier said than done…) so they don’t guess an incorrect neutral word – or, even worse, the other team’s words. Or, of course, the worst thing of all: the assassin, which makes you lose the game instantly… So far I’ve never seen this happen (in more than 10 games), but I definitely think it will happen eventually.
It works well with 4, 6 and 8 players – and also with 2, which I have greatly enjoyed as a coop with my wife!

The reason I’m not totally sold on this party game is because it’s missing a little bit to be a “party” game. It’s very intriguing, but when the spymasters sit and try to think of clever clues, and when the other team is guessing, there is basically nothing you can do and it can get a little boring… This has happened several times, and the term “boring” is obviously not something you want in a party game! Still, I think it’s a very good game. Perhaps not as innovative as some claim as the overall mechanic has been seen in older games before, but Chvatil put a different twist on it, and it is a good game overall.

RATING: 4
A bit too slow and straight forward to be of much interest. The clue giver has a lot to consider whilst the guessers wait for a long time and usually guess quite quickly. Might be more fun to try with a single guesser (who leaves the room) whilst everyone else throws out suggestions for clues.

Cool game that lived up to it's hype. I really like analyzing the code to find the meaning of the clue giver, and the "push your luck" decision on top of that adds for some exciting play. There's a good amount of strategy in managing the flow of the game to position a team the best spot toward the end of the game. The more I play, the more I like.

Codenames is probably the best word game that I've played. Games are fast, there's decent enough tension, and there's plenty of reason to talk as a team.

Having played it twice now I can see the real fun is in taking risks as the clue giver.  Giving simple clues to find just 1 word progresses the game, but the real fun comes when you give a clue for 3 words and nobody gets it, and then the arguing in the team lasts the whole game and long after about some obtuse clue, missed word, or odd logic.

Worthy of the hype. Codenames is a party game with a rules set of Taboo/Apples To Apples-level rules complexity that is [i]hard[/i] to play well. In fact if the game has any weaknesses, it is that it is too much of an intellectual challenge to function comfortably as a party game.

That said, I wouldn't want to play this all the time but as a design ... my hat's just off. One of those rare occasions where you just look at a game and are blown away that nobody thought of it before because it feels so incredibly obvious in retrospect.

Vlaada Chvatil has taken the basic concept of Guess Who?, re-worked it into a party game, and re-branded it with a thin, espionage veneer.

This game is very fun while I am playing it!  But, as soon as I am done playing, I feel empty inside.

Most social games have social interactions, jokes, or conversations, while alternatively strategy games make you think, learn, and grow your abilities. This game has neither of the aspects that let me leave feeling like I have grown, became closer to friends, or accomplished something.

It is a very good and entertaining game, but it just leaves me wanting.

There's a lot of party games out there that are more just fun activities to get people laughing and having a good time. Most of the time we just simply play round after round not keeping score and soaking up the funny moments. I would compare Codenames with the likes of Avalon. Stay with me. A lot of these games don't have an end in sight (Wits and wagers, Telestrations, etc) but this style party game does. Once all of you agents have been discovered, the game is over an you have accomplished something. Again, we don't really keep score when playing this game but rather keep playing it after each act ends. There's a small sense of accomplishment as each games ends but then you want to go at it again. Truly a phenomenal game which lives up to the hype.

If you're playing with a group of friends who think just like you, then this will likely be a lot of fun.

Pros: Easy to teach, can accommodate many players, lots of variety.

Cons: Requires a certain amount of "on the spot" creativity that some players may not enjoy, or may feel pressured by.

This is currently my favorite party game. Unique, simple, easy to teach and play, with a great amount of replayability. Searching for connections among the puzzle of relevant words is challenging, and whether you're watching your team either a) make all the same connections, validating your spy-master genius, or b) make horrifically unpredictable and hilarious connections, it is one hell of a fun time either way.

Searching for a con, I've noticed certain types of players can get flustered by the "on the spot" nature of the spymaster role. Still, if a "no-pressure" atmosphere is fostered, it's hard to imagine any group not having a fun time with this.

To part, I'll offer a brief story : We had intended to do some moderate gaming with some friends and family after a holiday shindig, but my wife's 70-year-old Aunt and Uncle decided to stay the night, who are not gamers. We swapped to party games, and the degree of hilarity that ensued with Codenames was completely unexpected. 

Any party game that can leave a group of players ranging from 20 to 70 simultaneously bent over with hysterical laughter is an absolute winner in my book.

A pretty decent word game but I absolutely do not understand the hype around it nor do I think it should've won a Spiel des Jahres. (Originally rating 6.5)

EDIT: Playing a bit more with people who aren't stupidly good at the game I can see how it has its appeal to a wide range of boardgamers old and new. I really enjoying playing it with some of my friends who care not for board games and they love it :)

So, got this for Christmas and played it with my family on Christmas day. My whole family loved it. We ended up playing it 10 times. This quickly became one of my families top favorite games - and we play a lot of games as a family - some older some new. I can see this game being pulled off the shelf frequently when the family is together. 

As a side note, this game worked great with our "daughter" from El Salvador. She was able to play along with us because of the simple rules - 1 word, 1 number clue - plus the clear, clean cards. She learned some new words and participated just like our other 2 daughters. This is a great educational game for ELL students. Should be in every classroom.

This is the King of Party games, especially when played on a timer.

Yes, it is a word association game, so make sure the spymasters are at an equal level.  Better yet, don't rotate them between games.

Still, this is game is super addictive, most played and requested game in my group of 50, my friend group of 25, and the monthly group of 40.

I like this game but I have to be in the right mood to want to play it. I love games that make me think a lot but this one makes me think a lot and so I am not interacting with other people because I am so focused on figuring out what clue I want to give out or just trying to decide what the clue meant. I think it is a great game and very easy for anyone to enjoy, but there is just a time and place for it and so I am not normally wanting to reach for it. Especially when I don't have as much time as I want to for games so I am prioritizing others over it. 
If you are the kind of person that likes thinking games but not as much on the strategy kind, this is for you. Or if you have a fairly sized group of people that you play with and want to involve all of them in the same game. There is a limit on how many people should be on one game because some people end up hiding in the background

RATING: 8.5
One of the most fun party games on the market. 2 teams compete to uncover their spies from a grid of 25 tiles (hiding spies and civilians) before the other team uncovers their spies. First team to have all of their spies uncovered wins.

I like team games as party games because half the players win each game, instead of just having 1 winner.

One Spymaster states a single word clue and a number to tjheir team (such as "bird" "2" which may be used if 2 of your spies are codenamed "Robin" and "Crow"). The word clue relates to one or more spy codenames on the grid. The number designates how many spies the clue relates to. It's easy to be very specific and use an obvious codename to help your team identify one spy, but it is tricky trying to fine a great 1 word clue that identifies 2 or more spies without steering your team to a spy on the other team.

If your team uncovers a spy from the other team, it counts for the other team.

You want to pay attention to the clues used by the other team as well, so you know which cards to avoid turning over that are likely to be the other team's spies.

A really fun party game. Requires teamwork and rivalry against the other team. I loved Taboo as a child, and this reminded me of it (but even better).

Played with 6 and 7 and it was perfect. I think it's great for any number between 4-8. Any more and it CAN get hectic I think, but still good. It can also be played with as little as 2 (not as great, but doable). 

It can bring out a side of everyone you never knew existed...

Update: Wow, this crashed wicked hard after a couple more plays. The [i]only[/i] reason I can see playing it now is if you need something for a rather large group of complete non-gamers, where not even a gateway game will work. Extremely boring waiting for the clue-giver to think of the clue. Yawn.

A 6 rating is high for me for a party word game. But it's still a word game. It does fill a really nice niche of being able to play with basically any number of people (minimum 4), on teams, with people collaborating. But the side that is giving the clues requires [i]a lot[/i] of thought, and can drag if not careful. Have cattle prod at the ready!

What kind of parties do people go to where this counts as a "party game"? We found it to be surprisingly brain-burning trying to think of good clue words. Very good, but not super light!

A very enjoyable party game of connecting words together by their meaning.

Vlaada did it again. Codenames is a cooperative word game suitable for non-gamers and could even be considered a "party game" (of the "hey, that's clever" kind, not the "roaring laughter" kind). One player per team hints at a subset of 25 available terms by saying one word and the quantity of terms that are associated with it. Teams need to identify "their" words without revealing the other teams words or even encountering the dreaded Assassin, which would result in an instant loss. Plays are short but satisfying.

It's also endlessly replayable, as the cards will come out in a different combination each and every time.  Just an awesome, awesome game!

First played at the Visalia Gaming Group.  Knew instantly that it was a game that Patience would enjoy.  Game is played in teams.  25 cards are laid out.  The clue giver has a map of the board in front of them indicating their cards, opponent's cards, neutral cards, and the spy.  The object is to give clues to get their teammates to guess all of their cards before the other team guesses all of theirs.  The starting team always starts with one extra card to guess - done to even it out.

"Spyfall" just got kicked in the face and is down for the
count. This game puts less pressure on people playing
while still giving players the illusion that they are
creative and smart.

 "So, you gave a code word followed by 6 and made them all. Ooooh , Nice call bro! - Actual game record so far.

  This almost ruined our game night ,since it`s so bloody
addictive. The assassin card is pure genius. But watch out who you play with. Some folks just don`t understand the meaning of the word fun. Play to win , but remember to role play , harass and mislead your opponents.

DIY: Apples to Apples (749 Cards) Got to try out Codenames With Dixit and C.A.H Cards. (Dreamy and Dirty
spy variants.)

RATING: 9.5
So glad we finally got a real copy of this game.
 Sorry Vlaada for having to make a DIY version until
your game arrived. When the hype is this high ,true geeks
go out of their way to make the games themselves.

For those wondering how we caught 6 spys with one codeword.
USA 6 was relativly easy with the following Apples to Apples cards : Detroit , JFK , Corvette , Hamburger , Michael Jackson and Grand Canyon.

We will most likely never get this type of record with
cards provided in the original game , but we`ll try our
hardest to make it happen.

This is an excellent game that challenges the intellect in more ways than you can imagine. I`m loving it! (to 
borrow a slogan from MacDonalds)

Now I finally get the hype! This is for me one of the best party games ever. What I like most is that it's a word game for people who don't like word games. Having to come up with spelling or the like isn't necessary - this is just word association. It's very impressive to watch some of the mental gymnastics as players try to find unusual connections between words in the display.

This has a lot of replayability, and is ripe for expansions just by adding some more word cards to the mix. Love it!

The problem with this game is that it depends way too much on the ability of people to play the "right" way. Spymasters are part of a team so it's only human for them to try and influence the way their teammates think. Simple nods and gestures can get people to go to a different direction making the game very prone to intentional or non-intentional manipulation. In that regard, it's quite broken. Since the game is played as a party game, the likelihood of people skirting the rules is really quite high. My rating is a reflection on how the game doesn't put into account human nature.

Components: Nice double-sided cards providing lots of different words. Clear symbology on the key card that faces the clue-givers. A few qualms: the assassin token is unnecessary; they cards should have large-font text facing the guessers as well as the clue-givers; when I'm the guesser, I find myself reading the clue-giver-facing word upside down rather than reading the guesser-facing word; the cards should be square to make for a nice square grid.

Experience: Interesting and fun. Totally different games as the clue giver vs. guesser. As the clue giver, it's a painstaking search for patterns that involve some words, but not others. Very challenging. As a guesser, it's fun to scour the words trying to find matches, and to get inside the head of the clue giver. There are so many different ways to read into each clue, this game prompts lots of fun discussion afterward.

Unfortunately the game stifles discussion during the game, so as to not reveal anything about unguessed clues, which is unfortunate and makes for a very quiet affair. Clue givers are forced to be emotionless, lest they betray information about whether a guessed word was the intended word or not. It's unsatisfying when a game ends in assassination.

Tough one to rate. The issues I have with it are the same as others have said. First,  it's way more fun as the cluer than the guesser, but games are fast enough that you can take turns. Second, the game is riddled with tells: eyes, hands, verbal. The upside (fun word game + suspense/tension) is enough to overlook these major flaw.

Great game, but like all party style games whether you enjoy it or not is highly dependent on who you play it with. I've had amazing games when I've made loads of mistakes and my team lost heavily and dull games when my team won. Don't take it too seriously and you'll have a great time.

Codenames is the best word game I have ever played. It is a team game so everyone can participate, and yet the clue givers must be clever. It is social and gets people talking about the words and trying to guess what other people are thinking, and there is suspense with every move bringing the possibility of sudden death. Brilliant!

This is a fun game, we have played it in several different groups and it goes over quite well with almost everyone we are playing. The difference in playing as the spymaster and the spies in he field is also quite interesting. 

It is always a challenge to balance the risk of trying for one more relationship to put the pressure on the other team vs playing it safe and ensuring that you are getting your own spies home each round.

I like this game as a 2v2, especially if it is couple vs. couple.  You really have to know the other player(s) on your team to succeed.  Even then, it can lead to some absolutely hilarious mistakes as you completely misunderstand someone's clues.  That's what makes this game shine.

The best part about being a spymaster is actually the banter with the other spymaster.  Once you see what they're trying to do with their clue, you think "Wow, that's a great clue!" or "Pff, there's no way they'll get that" or "what the hell are you trying to do?"

I actually feel more connected with the opposing spymaster than I do with my own agents.

Replaced by Duet, though, as we mainly play 2p. Kept the code names pieces in the Duet box though, so the option is always there (with double the words!!)

It's less fun to be the agent, at least in my opinion, but I'm happy to play either role

One game where I can legitimately say I learn something about my friends each time I play with them, you really get a sense of how others think when they give their word associations. 

It was a bit difficult to play, though, when other players do not have English as their first language or have very different life experiences.

So we played 2 rounds of this, then moved on to One night ultimate werewolf.
While i found the concept interesting and we did have a few laughs during the game, it just didn't connect with us (in the way games like ONUW, Resistance, Spayfall or Dixit do).

some reasons (some relating to the game, others to the players):

1. it's VERY "thinky". Which can make the game drag while the spymaster tries to come up with good clues, or
2. the spymaster just uses "xyz 1" clues, which leads to sure points but also makes the game REALLY boring. 
3. Some layouts/words will probably just favour one team over the other (but probably just slightly or unpredictably or not at all because it depends more on what the players are thinking than on the actual words?)
4. the single word clues are incredibly restrictive. While some people may find this enhances creativity and forces people to think outside of the box, for us it felt a bit dull and counterproductive in a "party game" that should be encouraging interaction, which leads to
5. there is very little interaction...
6. I just never felt like it made much sense to try and "get inside other player's heads" the way you can in games like Dixit or Spyfall.

Overall it just wasn't a very fun experience and i don't quite understand yet what all the fuss is about.
I'll gladly give it another chance, perhaps with another group, but i'm not 100% sure this game will work for me.

I'd currently much rather play another round of Dixit, Spyfall, Resistance, ONUW or try out Mysterium....
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The strength of this game seems to be that the teams who work together best are those with the most similar worldviews, since they can outline connections between concepts which would be sent and received identically.  Teams that missfire are then enouraged to learn from their peers about the topics where they fell short.  However, the spy theme feels cheap, the trivia is superficial and the components are hideous.  I just want to play anything else.  Even pictionary looks like a fresh and interesting alternative.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Simple game, easy to get other involved and can be played with a wide number of players.
The game is as good as the people you play with. For the most part, a very fun and engaging game but sometime you get the person who gives the worst clues and you make sure you to never pull this out when they are around.

Definitely worthy of a higher rating, but it's the kind of game that just dominates a session as non-gamers will latch on and just...not...let...go.

But to rate it a 9 means I should always want to play it and that's certainly not the case.

This is a "party game" by Vlaada Chvatil, where you play in two teams and you have to guess a number of words simply by giving a one-word clue. 
Pro: You can introduce this game to non-gamers easily.
Cons: While it is a game you can play in a large group, it is not a party game. If you want to play a party game from Vlaada Chvatil, try Pictomania. That game gets people laughing easily. This, not so much. More of a cerebral game you can play in a big group.

I used to play password when I was a kid and this game brings back those memories. I like the concept of trying to get your teammates to only guess your words and avoiding the other teams as well as the spy. 

At the end of the day though this game is just a simple word game. It's not something that I'm going to want to play all that often. I'll probably only bring it out in new or non gamer situations.

I'm actually not sure why people rate this so highly. I wouldn't recommend this as a party game at all. It's more of a 2v2 type game in my opinion.

RATING: 7.8
Great idea, great game! It's easy to teach and learn, it can be played with nearly any number of people (though I'd say somewhere between 4 and 8 is probably best), it's fun and engaging, and it has the nice tendency to not push people that are more on the shy side onto the stage, thus involving everyone. I'd probably rate it even higher if there wasn't a considerable bit of downtime that sometimes occurs when people try to get more than 2 words a turn or at the start of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Definitely the best party game in the sense of it being an actual "game".  It requires thought without being intimidating, it encourages conversation without sidetracking the game, and it rewards creativity.  It can be funny and also provokes great arguments.

I've played it with 5 and 6 and it's great at both these counts, and I don't see it being that much worse with four.

Why do I rate Codenames a 10? Being as objective as possible, this is a flawless game design. Yes, I can understand why some people would not like this game as much as me, but you cannot argue that it is a masterpiece in game design. Codenames is as streamlined as it gets. It is both a party game and a strategy game. It plays a large group in a short amount of time, and people can jump in in the middle of a game. Virtually infinite replayability AND a low price point. It may not be my favorite game but it is a flawless game.

In Codenames liggen er 25 kaartjes open op tafel. Op elk kaartje staat een woord. Je speelt het spel in twee teams: het blauwe en het rode team. Elk team heeft een leider. Deze leiders zien een raster. Als je leider bent van het blauwe team, dan moet je ervoor zorgen dat jouw team alle kaartjes kan raden die overeenkomen met alle blauwe vakjes in het raster. Als je teamleden ooit het woord kiezen dat overeenkomt met het zwarte kruis, dan is je team meteen verloren. Als leider geef je een tip door een woord en een getal te zeggen, bijvoorbeeld heet 3. Dat wil zeggen dat er (minstens) 3 woorden op tafel liggen die met het woord “heet” hebben te maken. De spelers van je team proberen dan deze woorden te vinden. Elke keer als het blauwe team een woord aanduidt dat overeenkomt met een blauwe kleur op het raster, wordt er een blauwe kaart op dat woord gelegd. Het blauwe team scoort nu een punt. Bij een foute gok kan het rode team punten scoren of (nog erger) kan het team meteen verliezen (als het zwarte kruis wordt gekozen). Het team dat als eerste alle woorden in zijn eigen kleur kan raden, wint.

This is a really neat game. The idea of word guessing is not new, but Codenames puts it in a nice game. With one word extra for the starting team it's balanced. 
Re-play-ability is limited though. After a while the same words return, same combo's, and with the same people you even use the same links. But we can still buy the Dutch version, a future expansion, or perhaps just create cards ourselves.

Simple and accessible for everyone. Overall fairly quick although it can get some people ending up in AP.
Use of the tablet app is highly recommended to resolve this and give some extra spice to the game.
Only negative points: it looks unfair on odd number of players and loses appeal without the player interaction you have with at least 3 people per team (1 spymaster and 2 players)

Yes, some cluegivers take way too long to come up with the perfect word, and the game is much more fun for the cluegivers than for the guessers. However, this game was a huge hit at a mostly non-gamer game night, at which play continued long past quitting time. Players can join, then leave to do something else, then return.

I get why a lot of people don't like this, but everyone I've played it with loves it.

So yeah you can sometimes (often?) find yourself in a group of a dozen people all silently staring at a grid of cards of random words as the spymaster is thinking up clues, but there's a lot of fun in the challenge of being a spymaster to link as many clues as you can in a way that your team can unpack without too much risk of losing. You often have to be very creative and loose in interpretation when making clues. Then its just as much fun on the other side, having to get inside the mind of your spymaster to figure out what they meant, while arguing with your teammates about it.

Amazingly simple premise, but loads of fun!
Similar to the classic game Password, but with a spy theme and possibility that you could inadvertently help out the other team. Seriously, if you don't know anything about this game, find out now. Just go play it.

[November 2016 - 7.2]
Fun party game, but I'd say slightly over-hyped. Great in that it can play with any amount of players, with people coming in and out. It's an advanced version of Password with some spacial thinking thrown in that can be harder than it looks when being the clue giver.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great game, an evolution of the classic 'password' game. Kids can pick it up fairly quickly but it takes a good vocabulary to really give good multi-word clues. I don't know that I agree that this works best with more players. I think it works best with 4 or maybe up to 6.

RATING: 8
Very fun party game, but it's a quieter thinky party game because you can't be both paying attention and partying.  It definitely takes concentration, especially for the clue-giver.  An easy hit.

(Haven't played Codenames: Pictures enough to compare)

(Codenames: Duet - just got it and I might actually like it better than the original.  Both players are actively involved in both sides of the game and is more engaging than being a team member in the original)

Since I like being creative with words, Codenames immediately caught me attention when I first read about it. When I had the chance to play it, I wondered why no one else came up with this idea before. Codenames feels like a classic party game that should have been around for ages. Everything is smooth and the game is a lot of fun. 

Still, I wouldn't put Codenames on the table with every group. The game is quite thinky and you need a certain amount of creativity to come up with clues as a spymaster. I've witnessed games where this became a problem and the spymaster felt kind of overwhelmed and surely didn't have a good time.

But with the right crowd, I can see myself playing Codenames for years to come. After Pictomania, the next great party game from Vlaada Chvatil!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simply brilliant. Brilliantly simple. But you have to be prepared for different experiences with different people. If the intent of your group is just to have fun, Codenames will deliver. OTOH, if one or more players approach it with any seriousness, be aware that this game can be rendered completely joyless and aggravating by spymasters who refuse to maintain the required discipline while playing.

Simple yet very enjoyable team-based word game that exploits personal differences in word synonyms/associations. Wanting to go for as many words as you can is perfectly balanced with your descriptor becoming increasingly ambiguous with each additional word.  Excellent design. (November 2015)

RATING: 5
This game is great for non-gamers. It's light, easy to teach, encourages communication, gives lots of moments of laughter, and can also give some real head-scratching moments where you just look at the spymaster and can't figure out what the hell they're talking about. Everything about the game says that this should be a great time with family/friends. So why cant I seem to enjoy myself while playing it?

I think part of what stifles this game for me (personally) is just how utterly slow and tedious each turn feels. There's so much waiting to do, especially if you play with AP prone people. The game does include an optional timer to 'fix' this but it often gets people to swing too far the other way where they give 1 word clues (which is super boring for the spies) round after round until the game ends by attrition. There's also the not-so-little matter of having the spymaster keep a pokerface. Some people can do this just fine, but if your (or worse so, your opponent's) spymaster has an obvious tell, then lots of tension is removed from the game. Although not allowed by the rules it's very hard to keep people from staring down the spymaster while they decide upon clues or while you're making guesses and adjusting according to their reactions. It's even harder to keep some of the spymaster's mouths shut while they're revealing the results of a guess. I can't tell you how many times I've heard "Oh, that's not what I meant, but you guessed a word anyway". Again, this is expressly forbidden in the rules and yet its hard to fault players (especially new ones) for doing so. Which brings me to the last ding against the game... this is supposed to be a party game and yet two of your players are supposed to be nearly silent with poker faces like statues. This is completely at odds with what a party is like! On the spy side, players can joke and converse freely, but the poor spymasters are segregated from the rest of the group by this artificial wall the game puts up. It makes it difficult to really enjoy the company of others in this (ostensibly) jovial setting when you can only talk to people in one word clues and can't show any emotion.

Codenames is mechanically sound. The concepts are good and the components are wonderful, but the gameplay is just at odds with the settings that it wants to be played in. I'd still play it if someone asks for it, but ultimately it's too light for a game night and too "gamey"  for parties, so it fails to find it's niche among my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Excellent social game, provided the "callers" for each team slide naturally into thinking in terms of concept-association, and aren't inclined to just freeze up.  Nice element of suspense and surprise, as one person's idea of an obvious and narrow clue turns out to be wide-open for interpretation, and players inch dangerously close to picking the dreaded assassin card.  Fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really clever game of giving clues and guessing words. It is surprisingly difficult and makes you think in creative ways. A bit surprised to see it described as a "party game" as we find it quite brain wracking and more prone to quiet concentration than the hooting and hollering you might expect in a real party game.

Played a prototype at the Gathering but it wasn't my type of game.  Too quite and contemplative for a party and not enough strategy for when I'm ready for heavy gaming.  It was well loved at the Gathering, but I figured that was just group think.  How wrong I was!  This game has taken everyone by storm everywhere.  It's on my list to try again.  It'll never be my type of game, but I'll see it in a different light if it's something my wife and parents can enjoy.

Codenames lives up to its hype. It's my new favorite large-party game, especially for 6 or more players. I've played with fewer but the game really shines with a healthy mix of teams who can chat together over what on earth the clue-giver was thinking. I'd recommend adopting house rules on what words are allowed (proper nouns, compound words, etc.) and how dire the assassin is. All told, every experience I've had with Codenames has been a good one and I look forward to many more.

Why this isn't a 10:

It's a hit with most groups. Two other people have bought this game after playing it. The best feature of this game is that (although it is cerebral) it doesn't require constant attention from the entire group playing, so it can be played with casual players. Side conversations (which can really slow down other games) don't really hinder this game (as long as the two spy masters are dialed in).

This is a good game, deserving of most the accolades it's accrued.

As one friend said, 'I liked that, it didn't feature play doh or acting'. And I agree, though the fun factor is lower than other party games I know.

I looked at my 11-year-old son carefully and said "Chewbacca... two." He eyed the grid of cards before him, darting his gaze between several possibilities... "Pilot." "That's a blue." "And... bow." "That's a blue." Inwardly I beamed with pride... but as a Master Spy, I could not tell him until after the game what a good job he did. Codenames is great. It allows your creativity to shine and it itches parts of your brain that you love to scratch. Great atmosphere, simple rules, great artwork... this one is always on the table, and always welcome.

Chvatil is frequently called an innovator and a creator of lots of unique games, but the games I've tried from him (Through the Ages, Tash-Kalar, and Codenames) have all seemed to be transplants of existing ideas into new milieus. TTA abstracted and simplified the Civilization computer series into a 4-hour competitive game, which I appreciated. Tash-Kalar added random goals, input randomness, assymetry, and Euro-style theme to an abstract, which I appreciated much less. I'd place Codenames somewhere in between the two.

Codenames takes the controlled-communication party game style of Dixit, Concept, or Catchphrase and makes them a competitive team game. This means that the system needs to be tightly controlled -every in-game action must be carefully indicated, and each "guess" has a chance to lose you the game. The communication, too, is carefully controlled; you can't use characteristics of words themselves, only the meaning, and the number you use can't be used to clue anything. The words are carefully chosen to create overlap, and potential first-player advantage is carefully avoided.

I'm sure somebody who hates party games and loves competitive ones would appreciate this game a lot. As somebody who appreciates both, I find it less successful. I don't mind the looseness and inherently variable difficulty of traditional party games, and Codenames adds very little to the competitive game -it's more about what's removed than what's added. While some concepts are neat (the assassin, the variable number of guesses, attempting to avoid opponent's clues), I don't feel the game has much to offer to somebody who gets their fill of cluegiving from party games.

RATING: 7.5
One of the best party games for a board game lite crowd. There aren't many rules to remember and every round and game is different (3.765464 x 10^66 different permutations of the board). Basically you have a 5x5 grid of words on the table, with a hidden card that shows which word is for which team per round, and each team selects one person to give clues to guess the words. 

It's cheap, usually ~$15, easy to get everyone to play, plenty of fun for all skill levels, good for traveling, and is fun to see what your team members think of and how their mind works. If you like this, you'll probably like Mysterium or Deception. If it has a downside it's that while there is variety of the word choices, there's really one one mechanic of the game and not any real strategy. Not that that's bad, but I prefer strategic games.

It’s short enough that I can see people wanting to play multiple times in a row, which gives other people the chance to be a clue-giver.    Fun game, good bang for the buck.

It’s an okay party game for non-gamers since its easy for participants to pick up the rules quickly, but similar to Scrabble, I dislike games where the rules are not totally self-contained within the game itself, but rather rely on rules external to the game; in this game the rules rely on the rules and grammar of the English Language.   Like Scrabble, you need to play this game with a dictionary, Internet Web Browser, and/or Thesaurus by  your side (to avoid unwanted hostilities AFTER a clue is given).  Games like this straddle the line of feeling more like “work” and less like “fun.”  There is also the issue of Analysis Paralysis on the part of the clue-giver (is that a word?  Is that one word?  Is that a hyphenated word? Is that two words?)   
You also have to play this with an even number of players and it only works best with six or eight.  
To end on a positive note, the game play is fast.

Vladda seems to have hit it out of the park again, and created the perfect-ish party game.  The design is approachable and works with most numbers of players (though even is better, and if you go beyond 8 or so, there isn't enough for each player to do).  
The game encourages creativity as well as reading your fellow players, since you not only have to connect words, but guess how others will connect them.  It can be frustrating if they don't think the same way you do, and a difference in pop culture (history, geography..) knowledge or vocabulary can also be a barrier.  As long as the players have a willingness to try, it's usually a good time.  
You only run into trouble if they aren't, and just sullenly pick words without proper deliberation.  Worse still, I've run into several problems with clue givers jumping the gun.  It seems to take a considerable amount of self-restraint to sit there and not react as players discuss possibilities and point at cards (w/out touching them).   Depending on the hour, state of inebriation, and jumpiness of personality, this may be a problem for some.

Vlaada Chvátil is on fire right now.  From gamers games to this piece of simple brilliance.  This is one of those games you think, how has no one ever thought of this before?  And now they have and the world is a better place for it.  You are simply describing words as efficiently as possible by trying to describe 2 or more words with a single word clue.  And that is it.  But it really works so well.

My family of part-time (if I am lucky) gamers has embraced Codenames and they want to play it to the exclusion of anything else.  Their enthuiasm is a rare treat.

This game completely justified it's position only after a month of becoming available. It truly is the best "party" game I played. And it did not surprise me since the most played party game on almost every occasion in my case is [b]Associations[/b]. A game similar to Time's Up, but requiring lots of people,  and only some pens and papers. And a stopwatch. I really love that game. Codenames scratches the same itch, giving it interesting theme and a twist. It can accommodate uneven number of people and goes really fast (with some help of a sand clock). It is the perfect game for everybody who likes playing with words, making witty associations. The ranking might go higher. The only limitation is moderate knowledge of English so not everybody in my company is comfortable with it, but only on a small margin. Otherwise great light game from crazy [b]Vlaada Chvatil[/b].

[b]Edit:[/b] Upgraded from 9 to 9.5 after 31 plays.

[b]Update:[/b] Rating modified according to a custom rating system.

one of the newer 21st updated editions of the old 1960's 'password' game, this extended version is lots of fun -- perhaps will still appeal more to gamers than the average family, although I still can see non-gamers interested -- a good communal sit down, with some of the more esoteric clues hilarious -- this is really a thinking person's fest, and the grouping or attempted grouping of a few words can be challenging -- all in all , a really good evenings' worth over the gaming table with a few bags of crisps to stimulate the brain cells

After consistently playing as a teammate, I finally embarked on a game where I was the spymaster- it was maddening (in the best way possible)! What you think is a very clear clue, to someone else means something completely different. Different individual experiences = different word associations, just incredible listening as a spymaster to the teammates' reasoning why a certain word corresponds to a clue. An excellently enhanced party game worth introducing to family and friends who don't regularly play board games. Seriously impressed!

This party game splits the group into 2 teams with 1 member of each team playing as the spymasters.  The rest of the team members try to guess the identity of their target agents' codenames which are randomized words on a 5x5 grid.  They are given a one-word clue along with an associated number by their spymaster.  They must avoid guessing a bystander's codename, the codename of the opposing team's targets, or the assassin.  Guessing the codename of the assassin automatically loses your team the game.

This game lived up to the hype and our group enjoyed it a LOT!  The key for the spymaster is to give a clue that is associated to the most number of their targets without possibly linking it to the other team's targets or the assassin.  It is always fun and interesting to see how your teammates think, and how they think YOU think.  The first time our group learned it, we ended up playing 8 times in a row!  Highly recommended!

Codenames is a fun 4 player game which becomes more engrossing the more times I play.  I can't imagine playing it with any number other than 4.  Also, I do wonder if this would have received the same hype if it wasn't designed by Chivatal.

A word guessing game with players divided into two teams. Players are trying to make their teammates guess specific words and not others. Simple but fun. Not really worth playing without at least six people. Generally I've found people enjoy this game, but the table can be very quiet as a single player spends a few minutes deciding which clue to give.

30-45m, best with 6-8. 5+ plays.

This game is insanely popular, so I won't bother explaining the game.

The crux of the game is using word association to link as many of your words together as you can, while simultaneously trying to avoid opponents words and the auto-lose word.

It's pretty quick and I challenge you to play it once and then put it away. This game is fantastic and works well with just about everyone. It's not a hilarious party game. In fact, it's pretty quiet, thoughtful, and rewards cleverness. That suits me just fine.

Always provides some level of fun, regardless of the group dynamics. Really good game  for non-gamers, grandparents, and gamers alike. As long as you're not the spy master, there is always time to go grab a snack/beer, which I like. When you are the spy master, there doesn't feel like there is enough time to break concentration and eat that M&M or sip the Saison you grabbed.... which I also like.

A little bit of downtime at the beginning when there is soul-crushing pressure on the spymaster.  But you could always use the timer.

Upon further review, I'm dropping my rating a bit.  I still really like the challenge and I like word games, but with the long down time and requirement of extreme focus for the spymasters, it falls flat as a party game.  It's too low energy.

I thought I would like this when I first read the rules. The first time i got to play this, we played I'm not sure how many game for 8 hours straight. Then we played some more the next day. The game is awesome and addictive. It plays so fast, normally. This and Time's Up are my top 2 party games. It's fun playing on both sides. 

The only issues is sometimes certain set ups are just way lopsided, but again the game is fast enough it doesn't matter for long. Playing with dumb people also makes the game significantly less fun, because its teams and you never want to be on the team with someone unable to communicate effectively.

Its a bit of a shame, IMHO, that this is what finally won Vlaada an SdJ.  Don't get me wrong, I like this game, its fun and light, and easy to rope people into playing, but its no Galaxy Trucker. I would almost always prefer Mysterium to Codenames, as I find the experiences rather similar, except Mysterium is more immersive and social. But Codenames plays like lightning in comparison, so its good when you're low on time.

Simply wonderful word association game. Endless replayability. Easily playable with my 9 and 11 year olds who are chuffed if they can link 2 or more words together.

RATING: 8
I’ve now played with 5 different groups and the only one that crashed and burned included 3 teenagers.

Who won’t enjoy this? Apparently, teenagers who haven’t learned how to have fun while not winning. 

This is not a game to take too seriously and try too hard to win. The games in which the group had the most fun were those in which people creatively made strange associations and hilarity ensued. Like all party games, winning is not the point.

RATING: 8.3
This is one of those go-to party games that almost everyone will enjoy everytime. Teammates either love or cant stand eachother by the end of each round and it takes some creativity to come up with the categorical words to get your team the most points each round. Teammates must be on the exact same page to win this game.

A very fun modern party game for gamers & non-gamers.  

Downside: can be down-time while people try to come up with clever clues. It can be hard to think of clues, and other players must just wait while this happens.

I feel like this should actually get a 10 based on the level of accessibility and fun I have had playing this.  I will knock it down to a 9 though because I am not a fan of this at the lower player counts.  I have played this game with all sorts of different groups and I have yet to meet anyone who did not have a great time.  That is something that is really hard to do in this day and age.

RATING: 7
I must admit to being sceptical of all the hype going into this game but I have to say, for such a simple idea the Codenames delivers.

25 words in a grid, give one-word clues to your team to guess your teams words and not those of the opposition.  One of the 25 words instantly causes either team to fail the game.  That's about as complex as the game is.  The real game is finding the right clues and how creative/abstract/tenuous you can be to make them to check off as many words as possible.

A caveat must be made, that this game is ultimately made exponentially better depending on the people you play it with; with the wrong people Codenames would have the potential to be very dry, but that is the way with most party games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I love, love, love:
- the easy-to-learn rules and quick gameplay
- the after-game discussions/arguments about why certain clues were used

I dislike:
- that the game is almost... too simple?

Final verdict: A good game that plays quickly and simply and gets your brain thinking in a less number- and engine-focused way (unlike many of the Euros I own).

RATING: 6
Party game with too much downtime.  Team turns take too long, meanwhile the other people have nothing to do except talk among themselves.  Also, the other codemaster does not know how to properly prepare until their turn, since conditions change and associations they could make change as a result.

RATING: 9
Great game! Family favorite. (My family is 8 total, ages 23+)
We play that you can only use 1 word no matter what. It takes away the subjectiveness and puts everyone on the same playing field. 
One thing that pulls back from the game being a 10 is the fact that the game isn't 100% fair... 1 team could have 5 words that are all animals, and the other team could have none that go together at all. That's the only problem with it. But that's not fixable. 
It's still fantastic, and for a family who fights a lot during games, we didn't fight during this one. Everyone had a blast. Highly recommend (especially if you love problem solving, words, and stretching the way you think).

This game is TOTALLY different with children/anyone under 20 years old.
They think differently. Way differently. I mean.... WAAAAYYYYY.....
It is frustrating to get a clue "scientist 2" and the answers being "experiment" and "eye"... and you ask WHAT?! And he says, "Scientists can do experiments on eyes." As frustrating as it is, it is SO MUCH FUN! It makes the game great when someone who is "bad" does the clue giving. You have to think how they think. Clue is "Pen"... ok... "Ball" and "Point". Yep. Clever girl.

So, whether you're middle school, high school, college, post college, or all of the above, you will enjoy playing this game.

Codenames is a game that would be tough to ever say no to.  It's short, simple rules, easily lends itself to house rules (if so desired), is challenging and compelling, and doesn't feel like there's much downtime even if the other team's turn takes a while (plus there's the hourglass).

I think Codenames is a little bit overrated--as in not top-100 on BGG good--but it is still an excellent word game that can be played cooperatively or competitively as teams. It is definitely innovative and fun, but I think it plays poorly with larger numbers of people.

RATING: 7
[2016 February 26; 21 plays; 7/10]
I've been really enjoying this game! I'm inclined to rate it an 8/10 because of how much I enjoy the game when I play, but there are a lot of factors which prevent me from playing this one more:
* It's a short game with shallow strategy.
* The game does not provoke the loudness I expect from a party game. It supports a high player count, but it's like they forgot to design whatever elements of joviality they could into the game.

For now, I'll conservatively rate this as a 7/10, presuming that once the CotN feeling wears down I'll at least begin to grow tired of it.

I could teach my playgroup this game easily. (They don't like "complicated" games). Everyone thought they could do a better job as the SpyMaster...and quickly changed their tune when it was THEIR turn to be SpyMaster! Great game for a huge group because you play in teams.

RATING: 8
Very interesting word association/deduction game. It is really not a party game. For that it is too much silence. I like the challenge of finding words that can be associated with a least 3 words on the table, and at the same time should not be associated with any of the others. It is really difficult. A great idea, which could have some down time playing with "wrong" people.
The problem with this game is that you really should think a lot to come up with the perfect word. At the same time, a lot of thinking makes it boring for other players. So...

Edit: I had a much better experience with it the second time I played it. Really good atmosphere around the table, so I increased the rating a little.

I was trying to decide whether I like Codenames or One Night Ultimate Werewolf better as a pure party game, and simply couldn't pick one over the other.  Both are amazing social experiences, that elicit laughs and joy every time we play.  Both can also be pretty stressful (in a good way) when playing with good players.

I don't know if Codenames will reach the nearly hundred plays I've gotten out of ONUW and Daybreak, but it wouldn't surprise me if it did.  I am generally not a fan of Vlaada Chvatil's designs, but he absolutely knocked this one out of the park.

Its less a party game than a social deduction word association type game, and I do quite enjoy it.

I can see that with certain players there would be a large element of downtime as spymasters agonised over clues to give however the game we played flowed rather well, but we were only giving clues that pointed to one or two clues on the table.

I like the grid aspect for the spymasters and I hope to play this one again fairly soon. I am a little concerned it may become a bit repetitive and it is prone to quarterbacking but there are plenty of cards and options so no two games will be identical.

A party game and a thinking game at the same time.   Non-gamers tend to like it too.  It's incredibly flexible also, in that the team sizes can range from 2-5 or even 6 (although that's pushing it), and players can come & go in & out of the game while the game is in progress if you want a more relaxed game.   Or you can play a more serious round/game with 4 players.  Great as a filler game or as the main event.

Ummm... so why do people like this game so much? It is fairly popular in my gaming group as well. While admittedly I am not a big fan of party games, there are party games I do like, one recent one being Spyfall. And while both games are sort of open-ended, with what clues players may come up with, Codenames felt fairly uninteresting with abrupt game-end possibilities.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great word/guessing game, reminiscent of Taboo.  Ideal number of players is 4 so you don't have to deal with guess by committee.

Unless the game is close you'll end up with one team having 1 card left (which they can get on their next turn), and the other team having to guess 3-4 in one shot to win themselves (which I have done).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Codenames is SUPER fun as a small party game.  The only thing is that there's two teams, with one person on each team giving the "codes".  These codes are precisely one word long.  The code givers, thus, have to be able to keep a straight face, not flap their arms excitedly or when someone is close to guessing right or groan when someone is close to guessing wrong.  You'll need a genuine poker face or you'll ruin it.  But don't let this deter you.

I highly recommend this game.  I buy a small amount (20 dollars or so worth) of things off Amazon each month, and this is at the top of the list for next month)

Played twice with a group of 6 people. I enjoyed it a lot and found that I enjoy the balance of thinking strategically with the down time when your team is not guessing. It allows for talking and hanging out while still remaining focused on the game.

As the usual game master of my various gaming groups, I love this game. Codenames is quick, flexible, and easy to teach. Each round only takes 5-10 minutes in my experience, and a game lasts more or less as long as you want.

I've played the game in settings ranging from mid-day, sober competitions to 2am drunk plays (both examples including teaching new people), and it's worked well.

The theme doesn't work at all for me, but that doesn't bother me here.

A very quick, challenging, and fun team game.  While constantly referring to as a party game, I really don't think it fits the category.  There's too much staring at the cards and thinking/mulling for the game to be considered a party game.  Rather, it's a thoughtful and interesting team vs team game.

Ötletes partyjáték, ami azért eléggé hajaz a mysteriumra. Mondhatnánk, hogy a msyterium és a tabu szerelemgyereke. De bőven van létjogosultsága, mert egyrészt nagyon szellemesen kitalálták, hogy hogyan lehet izgalmas kompetitívvé tenni egy ilyen jellegű játékot. Másrészt pedig jóval egyszerűbb a setupja és gyorsabb is sokkal, mint a myterium. Emiatt partyjátéknak alkalmasabb.
Ahogy a mysteriumban itt is nagy előny - szemben a dixittel - hogy a visszahúzódóbb játékosok is tudnak játszani.

My all time favorite answer: I was trying to get my team to guess 'Novel' and 'Carrots', so I said, "Watership Down". With barely a second's pause, someone stabbed the word 'Sub'. Wrong, but friggin amazing!

Codenames is a clever little word game, one of the relatively few party games which are not about being fast and loud but still works well with larger groups. In that sense, maybe it isn't really a party game at all. Too thinky. Hm. Whatever.

RATING: 9
Super great, easy to teach, high player count game. I love being the Spymaster, it's such a great feeling when you come up with the perfect clue and your team totally nails it. Of course, sometimes you forget to account for the assassin card and totally lose it for your team. Pretty much always willing to play this one.

A fantastic game which appeals to heavy gamers as well as newbies. Its ingenuity is only surpassed by its staggering simplicity. A milestone in game design people will talk about for decades to come.
The game shines particularly well with (exactly) 6 players in which case it is a 10 for me.

With this much fuzz about the game I had to try it. I'm a big fan of party games (laughs are more important as tactical decissions), but I don't really like "word"-games, so it was with a little bit of mixed feelings. I enjoyed the game, but it really isn't my kind of game unfortunately. In the genre I prefer games like Spyfall or One Night Werewolf.

This is a fun and casual game but it doesn't feel party-ish to me. It is a quiet game, at least with the players I've played with.

To me, something like Werewolf, The Resistance: Avalon or One Night Ultimate Werewolf are better party games. They sort of maintain the atmosphere of a party better. Codenames just makes everyone cool down instead.

CGE hat sich in den letzten Jahren als mutiger Spielkamerad gezeigt: ungewöhnliche Themen (LETZTE WILLE, 20. JAHRHUNDERT) und innovative Spielideen (GALAXY TRUCKER,  TZOLKIEN) bishin zur Integration von Cyberspace (ALCHEMIST). Und nun also der Partytexter CODENAMES, das dich nahtlos in die Reihe fügt. CODENAMES ist eine simple, kreative Idee, in der es für einen Teamchef darum geht Überbegriffe zu finden, die möglichst viele Wörter subsumieren, die wiederum durch das Team in einer Auswahl von ausliegenden Hauptwörtern erraten werden sollen. Wie bei allen Partygames lebt auch CODENAMES vom Interaktion und Interpretation. CODENAMES wäre in seiner Einfachheit wirklich gut, wenn da nicht die vermaledeite Dehnbarkeit von Begrifflichkeiten wäre. Da werden grenzwertige Substantivierungen und Neologismen in den Raum geworfen, die das Spiel für meinen Geschmack aushebeln. Beispiel: Wenn zwei Wörter wie "Schimmel" oder "Uhr" erraten werden sollen, wird vom Spielkapitän kurzerhand das Wort "Pferdezeit" in den Raum geworfen. Wenn sich die Spielrunde in der Zusammensetzung von Synonymen genügt, wird CODENAMES nicht besser als jedes Kreuzworträtsel. Dummerweise unterstützt die Regel solch einfallslose Wortbildungen, so dass es letztlich in der Hand der Spieler liegt, aus CODENAMES das zu machen, das es verdient zu sein.

Still have trouble calling this a "Party" game. However, It still has a place in my collection. I would pair this with Dixit, for a more subdued gathering. I also enjoyed this as a 2 player experience. Very casual co-op . My hubby and I played this over coffee on a Sunday morning...perfect!! Overall, I would pull this out for a quick filler between 2 bigger games.

Simple. Challenging. Fun.

This game is perfect for any party, so easy to pick up, but a lot of skill in being able to come up with those all important links. My only criticism is that it can be  (understandably) a bit harder for people who's first language isn't English and it can slow down a bit when the spy master's are desperately trying to think of a 2+ clue.

It was OK. I really don't know how to put it, but the game had a bit too much of a "good, clean fun" vibe to me. I really don't think that that's good for a team game and I am pretty sure that it wasn't caused by our game group. I really-really enjoyed being on the spymaster side, but without the team spirit, I have found sitting on the other side a bit boring. (Deciphering the clues is not that tough, at least with 4-4 teams.) So the whole experience averaged out on OK.

I'm glad I got to try this out.  Vlaada Chvatil is not the type of designer who I'm usually seeking out. I find his games too complex for their own good. But I recognize his brilliance for being a left-field designer. So I was intrigued by This simple card game designed by someone who is clearly a master of his craft.  Turns out this is such a simple, excellent idea - and well executed.  While it may be easy for the "Spymaster" to give a clue to one card, finding similarities between multiple cards and then giving one clue word to hint at two or more... very smart!  This is a good game for fans of word games, Dixit, or nifty party games.

Probably the best gateway party game that plays a lot of people. Using the timer is recommended to keep the game moving fast. Sometimes the words are awkward for the spymaster but that's part of the game and you get some very stretchy clues which is fun

An excellent game that everyone can get into and plays a large count.

I wish the game was expandable to 30 words, as I found that fun to do during online forum play.

Pros:
- works well as a 2 players game
- very focused on interaction between players
- can be quite fun and very rewarding when you get to connect with your partner.
- risk and reward
- fast and furious
- superb value for money

Cons:
- limited number of cards meaning after you've been through them all once, it is tempting to use references to previous plays, which isn't cheating (and doesn't feel like cheating), but is certainly not as rewarding
- I can see ourselves losing some interest for it quite soon.

Overall: 14.5/25

A game that is too reliant on the people who play it. Arguably this could be said for all party games but here i feel it is more acute: with a tactical or unflamboyant group this can become nothing more than mundane as each team turtles forward with 1/2 guesses per turn. Furthermore, with any more than 6 players I feel one or two players can become overly pushed aside.

Having said that, add a few drinks and some in-jokes and it can take flight.

Hmm. People creating totally new words that don't exist to match more than one word. It's funny, but I don't think I'll play this very often...

There should be a timer that limits the one who has to name a word.

So, after playing it again, decreased to a 1. It's just as boring as hell!

If I'm ever 'forced' to play this again I will immediately give a one-hint to the tile that ends the game...

Such a simple idea converted in to an absolutely fantastic party game! Everyone I've played this with, winds up walking away saying, "wow that was a really fun game! How much was it?" Vlaada really nailed this one.
It's a word deduction game. You have a 5x5 grid of cards. There are two teams competing to guess who their spies are. To win, one team must outguess the other and identify 8 cards (or 9 if you go first). They do this, because one member of the team per round is designated as a spymaster who sees where on the grid the spies are located. There are tons of double sided word cards, and a stack of symmetrical grid cards that can be rotated on any of 4 sides. This allows for a LOT of randomization and replayability. Everyone stays engaged, the spymasters: by coming up with clues linking words so the rest of their team can guess more than one at a time, and the team members trying to figure out whats going on in the spymasters head.
A game well deserving of praise!

A gamer's party game, allowing for clever and daring plays while being socially cromulent. Very dependent on the group composition (you may get stuck with someone who sucks at giving clues) but it plays fast enough that switching teams is no problem (and preferable).

Can be a lot of sitting around with people staring at the cards as the codemasters try and think of clues.  Fun, but the down time and scant action are knocks on this game.

My favourite party game. So simple, yet so fun! It plays many and the team aspect means that experienced players won't have an advantage, just put them on separate teams. It's always funny when a clue gets misinterpreted colossally and it's a genuinely interesting puzzle to be the spymaster.

Smart design and quick to play, although clue receivers will occasionally have nothing to think about for a couple of minutes. I particularly enjoy being the Spymaster. This game really shines when wild punts pay off - and it's hilarious when a should-be-straightforward clue ends in disaster. Bought in January 2016.

Opinion: I like the idea of the game, you can think this is a party game, and this is not my opinion. This is a family game, but do not go for a party with this one. First of all, this is one of those games you have to be flexible with how you play, do not cheat saying clues, but do not stubborn either.
Choosing the clues to give to your team is a hard time, trying to find out which ones your Captain have said is the funniest part

[3/15/2017] Bumped it up a little bit from a 6.5 to a 7.  Originally I had only played four or five player games, but I played a six player game and enjoyed it much more.  I think I like the words better than the pictures as I find the words more challenging, but I should probably give Codenames: Pictures some more plays.  I can't imagine either game going higher than a '7' rating, though.

This fires my synapses perfectly. When I first introduced it to the group, we played a brainy tactical battle. That dragged a bit, so we actually use the time now when people take more than a few seconds to come up with a clue. It still plays a bit longer than it should, but honestly, I don't mind it at all and am only concerned that others might get bored with it too quickly. For me though, this is a ton of fun and I'd be the Codemaster every game if people wanted me to.

First few plays had far more "aha!" moments than one might expect from a party game. Gets to some of the multi-layer deductions that Hanabi has ("I wonder if she gave that clue because she was hoping that I'd realize she was choosing not to give this OTHER clue, in which case...") without the need for Hanabi's pre-agreed conventions. Plus, the creativity involved in picking words is more appealing to me than Hanabi.

Solid team-based party game.  Plays quick with extremely easy rules.  Often leads to unintentional, though enjoyable, humor. 

Occasionally lets you put those inside-jokes to use, allowing the association of a cluster of words in an awkward way that no one but you and your spouse/brother/best friend teammate could. Suddenly making you both feel like geniuses, all because you both once saw an obese man in short-shorts at a bbq, and it allowed your partner to guess "Lemon" and "smuggler" off of your clue of "Ben".

Personal experiences may vary.

Simple party game of word association played in teams. One player is supposed to give clues on his team's words, but it's usually very hard to link more than two words with one clue (luck of the draw can be decisive here). And if his team is winning, it's easier to go for an obvious clue for a single word, which makes the game boring. I played it three times in a row, but even with totally different words, the game already felt repetitive by the end. It's a less fun "Dixit" or "Pictionary" without much room for creativity. It's unbelievable how this is in the top 20 games here on BGG and won the Spiel des Jahres. but it certainly has a lot to do with having been designed by Vlaada.

Now it is a rare game that really grabs my attention). Anyway, I'm usually a fan of word games and this one really does have a good dynamic of trying to figure out the best way to identify the most of your team's target words without inadvertently pointing them to opponent, neutral or instant loss words. I like!

It's "Password", the old board game and TV show. Granted there is a press-your-luck mechanic and an alternate way to win (picking the double agent), but it's really just a dressed up version of Password.

Very, very, fun, but a bit lacking in ease of play. You somehow need to keep track of your words (as spy master) since it is very tedious to always refer back to the key. Writing down all words takes some (boring) time before the play can begin.

Solid party/word game.  Tough to play drunk, which is a major consideration for any party game.  It is really fast.  I wouldn't play with less than 6. The only other flaw I saw was a big advantage to people that have played before and can repeat clues from past games. It's fun though, and a great concept.  This guy is an incredibly versatile game designer.

The first few plays of this were super fun and it seems to work well with any selection of people. It never seems to get too competitive. I enjoy playing the game with my parents cooperatively as well, it's a versatile game. I've found my enjoyment has diminished slightly over time because I struggle with the patience of the long waiting periods that seem to be inherent with this game. With that said, there always seem to be flashes of brilliance whenever it gets brought out.

This might honestly just be the best party game, period. This game is chock-full of creativity, tension, teamwork, comebacks, laughter, and excitement. It's extremely easy to grasp, plays up to 8 or even more very well, rewards good players while simultaneously allowing weaker players to catch up, and is about as far from "solvable" as could be. The sheer variety of combinations and the ways the clues can be given is simply stunning. I want to play it right now.

I don't dislike the game, I just found it far less enjoyable and far less hilarious than I was promised. It's a pretty thinky affair and being successful at it can make you feel rather clever. But apart from that, I don't see anything here that sets the gaming world on fire.

Codenames is a party game for folks who don't like party games. By this, I mean that it eschews the usual creative, artistic vibe of many party games such as Charades and Pictionary (amongst others) and aims for a game of logic, semantics, and semiotics. In short, its a game of communicating the location of spies by giving one word and one number. For example, Shoe-2 might be given to help you locate agents Foot and Walker, but maybe enemy agent Shoestring is out and about too (hence, perhaps the 2 was to signal that *only* two of three shoe-related words are of the team). Great for folks who love solving and generating mini-logic problems and can be a hoot. The addition of an assassin which makes your team lose instantly can also make for funny game endings.

I'm looking forward to playing the "Dixit: Dream Detective" variant of this.

Absolutely brilliant.  Spent basically all day Saturday at Salt con playing this.  It's about as simple as could a deduction game could be, and yet provides profound experiences and insight into your teammates' thought processes.  Giving clues is stressful and exciting but receiving clues is also lots of fun.  Fully expect to play this forever.

RATING: 8
An excellent party game for 4+ players (there are alternate rules for 2 or 3 player games, but it really shines with 6+ players). A rare game in that it doesn't seem to have an upper limit on how many people can successfully play. Game length doesn't vary much even with large player counts, it is always around 20-30 minutes. It encourags interaction between players, players on teams can come and go as needed without affecting game play much, and it can be played lightly off the cuff or with a deeper strategy if desired therefore appealing to a wide range of players. We like to rotate who the spymaster is each game to keep things interesting. Everyone we have played this with loves it, and they all want to play it again. The only minor criticism I have is that the theme is just tacked on and is not really part of the game at all, but it really doesn't matter as the game is so fun to play that it doesn't really require a theme to succeed.

Fun, party-type game featuring 2 teams where one member of the team is trying to get their team to pick certain words from a grid.  I can be guilty of this but if the clue-givers are too slow then the game can bog down.  May have to use the timer that comes with the game sometimes.

If you're looking for a mellow game and an opportunity to create and solve word puzzles and/or practice telecommunication with friends, this is just the game for you. If you happen to not be on the same page as your partner, it can get frustrating, but that makes it all the more rewarding when you are on the same page.

Owned by Chris. I HATE word games. I HATE party games. To be fair to it, this is probably the best word based party game I've ever come across, the actual "game" part of it is pretty clever; ie giving clues to your team mate as to which cards need to be covered up without accidentally getting them to cover over your opponents.

Forget the 2-8 tag, it's 4 player only

I understand now why it is ranked as #1 in party games. It easy to play and explain, as well as the set up. It can be challenging for people that have recently met but it can be a perfect ice-breaker. Even it can be played with 2 players, I suggest 2 teams of at least 3 players (Total: 6).

Ahora entiendo porque quedó calificado como #1 en juegos de fiesta. Es sencillo de jugar y explicar, así como de prepararlo. Puede ser algo desafiante para personas que apenas se van conociendo pero puede ser un excelente rompehielos. A pesar que el juego se indica que lo mínimo son 2 jugadores, sugiero que sean al menos 2 equipos de 3 jugadores (total: 6).

Players are low-level wetwork operatives who have only moments to locate and liquidate targets based on nothing more than a single word and a number.  Success means the right doors are kicked, the right throats cut, the right cars bombed.  Failure usually means two silenced shots into a dude who was just mowing his lawn, and then going back for the wife after a brief argument in the van.  But beware—your team is being stalked by a legendary rogue wetboy—and he's got claymores duct-taped to the door of his decoy apartment...

Though the team is supposed to confer, come to a consensus, and then—[i]and only then[/i]—reach out to touch the agreed-upon cards to execute the contract, there are a shocking number of unprofessional "Here, hold my hotdog—" moments where a single agent will suddenly bolt from the food court, sprint up the escalator, shoot three people on the mezzanine level, and then saunter back to take their hotdog out of your stunned hand with an honestly unperturbed "What?"

The winning team will be responsible for their own individual exfils to safehouses of their choice; the losing team will spend the last thirty minutes of their lives jogging down the street with assault rifles and body armor before being "retired" by ex-DEVGRU CIA paramilitary dressed as local SWAT.

I upgraded this from 8.3 after a few more group plays. 
this is a great game for lots of people, I think 5 is the minimum.  I had a chance to play this several times with mixed friends and with family of various ages.  It went over well with everyone.  Even for the younger (teen) kids who I thought would poo-poo this away, really got into this one.  I did finally play with my regular gaming buddies and I was surprised they all took to it after just a few minutes.  Its a great, simple concept and one that, if not already, will certainly be mimicked soon enough.  We did play with an odd number of people wherein that person played on both teams.  It worked really well.  The hardest part is watching what you say.  Even casual conversation about the words in play and guesses made can put ideas into the spymaster's head.  I really reccomend this one.

We must be approaching two dozen plays by now, and I still love this game as much (or more!) as I did on day one.

The time constraint, the passive (passive aggressive?) interaction, the liquid win/loss state, the brain burn of making increasingly tenuous connections, and the omnipresent threat of the assassin... what a game!

I don't always bring it to the table, but I think that's for the best. Instead, I prefer to savour it in the ideal conditions.

Super light and accessible, this game provides entertainment for gamers and non-gamers alike.  After getting a feel for the concept, it seems everyone wants a go at being the clue giver for their team, leading to repeated plays in almost every session.

RATING: 5
It's password with a twist...I guess. Ranked fairly high for what it is. The game is functionally solid and works for most groups, but it just doesn't really feel like a game, but more so an activity. The game can either be a fast play or take a long time, while you and the other clue giver struggle finding one-word clues for their teams. 

Like I said it's not horrible and I will more than likely play it than not, but I think it's quite overrated for what it is.  It doesn't help there are Codenames-snobs that turn their noses to funner, much better party games, but say this is the magnum opus for social gatherings. Codenames, honestly, is not as fun as people make it out to be. It is highly over-rated for what it is, plain and simple. However, I can see the minimal fun in the game, and enjoy it, with the right "NON Snobby/AP-prone people. I would  still like to give Codenames: Pictures a go since it looks a lot better than just staring at words

A team-based word game that people who normally don't like word games (or party games!) might actually still enjoy. Can have some downtime while the clue-giver tries to think of a clue that will allow their teammate to guess multiple words on their list, but still a nice game.

This game has gotten a lot of play during lunch hour. Interestingly, we have played so the two codemasters are the ones proficient in English, while the rest of the players, English is their second language. Before the game they ask about any words that they do not know the meaning of and we talk about them.

The game is highly portable (see files section for my travel size tuckbox) for lunch outings.

This is a word driven party game ideally designed for 6 or more players.  Its designed by one of the great game designers of our generation.  I believe it draws more excitement than it should simply because of the greatness of the designer.  There is a little bit interesting going on, but the game does not have a lot of novel elements even for a party game.  On the plus side: its simple, stream-lined, and the connectivity of the cards are well thought out to maximize the challenges of avoiding ambiguity.  A solid party game, but it doesnt do enough for me to rate as a top 100 game.

Codenames is definitely fun the first couple times you play it, but it lacks longevity.  Clues get re-used and the novelty wears off fairly quickly.  Overall, a solid party style game, but not for me.

RATING: 8
This is a good game, but if it's a party game depends on the players. If I play it with my friends or regular gaming buddies this one is full of laughter and fun. If I play it with people I don't know too well it turns into a serious game of linking words and finding descriptions with quite an amount of downtime and boredom. I rate this an 8 with the right crowd.

As far as party games go this is a great one. I can't compare it to a Euro because that would be ridiculous. A game I see holding up in the future. Vlaada creates so many games that all are so very, very different from one another. Codenames is arguably his best light game and it's a blast as long as you have a fun group to play with. Pictures and Original can fit into one box.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simple concept, great execution.  Codenames has been a surprising hit among the casual/non-gaming set, especially so since it's a party game that consists of people sitting around puzzling over a bunch of cards with words on them. If the game has a downside it's that with a poor clue giver things really go south fast - it's just not much fun hearing a bunch of obvious "1" clues.

Everyone I teached this loved it. I gave this a 9 and not a 10 because I think the Graphic Design is so bland, especially the Typography could be much more beautiful.

Edit: Have to give it a 10. I realized that I gave it a 9 because it was requested so much by non-gamer friends that I loathed it for banishing other games to the shelf. Which is not fair - it is an easy 10.

Great fun. It's easy to explain and people are quick to catch on. Everybody we play with enjoys it and it comes out often with diverse groups. 
Only thing that gets me is that I'm not always the best at thinking up the big scoring clues. But I've seen some pretty impressive ones given out and guessed correctly!
A large batch of all sets of cards and with so many combinations, I'm sure it will get plenty of play for a long time.

Absolutely solid, "thinky" "party" game.

I wouldn't pull it out with the wrong group, but it keeps everyone engaged solidly during play.

The decisions are interesting on all sides of the table.

I've only played it with 4, and I would only go perhaps as high as 6.

This has got to be the most boring game I've played in a long time. I have no idea why this is so popular. I seriously have lost respect for BGG's rating system and the masses ability to pick good games after seeing how popular this is.

What is so appealing? You sit there and think of connections between your cards... I don't get any sort of excitement when someone guesses my cards correctly and I have ZERO sense of achievement when I guess the right cards. Not to mention it only takes 1 person with an IQ less than 100 to ruin the entire game. Why? Because they will give horrible connections, will take forever doing it, and always guess the wrong cards. One game I was on the stupid person's team and then the very next game (with an entirely different group of people) I watched as the stupid person ruined the game for my opponents. When that happens, there is no fun. You know you're going to win and that's BORING!

I give it a 1, not because it defies game description, but because everyone's hype about this game is broken and defies the game description.

I'm sorry BBG and BGG followers, but today you are the biggest morons.  Unfortunately, today you have superseded my expectations.

Still love Vlaada's work. One bad game doesn't define a designer.

Our group plays with the timer app. Once Codenames comes out, odds are whoever you have will want to try it again and again. For me, I was especially interested in trying again to see the more devious deals from the deck come out. It took about five or six games total over a few sessions, but finally, the red & blue spies' words started to overlap in meaning. I think Codenames may have benefited from being an entirely digital game, so they could program entire grids that had more similar words in play.

A title wholly dependent on the people you play with. Potentially a fun and challenging game of asymmetric deduction where one player offers a clue and the other matches it. In execution it's frustrating when your partner doesn't share the same verbal lexicon with you. Good among close friends where in-jokes are valid. Awful with strangers.

edit 3/1/2017: Original score 4/10.

Codenames has become a 10/10 party game. It really does depend on the people you play with and I've ended up in a string of perfect matches.

This is my current favorite group/party game to date. It's highly challenging, very entertaining and great for a wide range of people. Anyone can pick this game up relatively easily but beating your opponents is about your ability to decode, or communicate in a coded way making it a fun challenge each time with huge replay value. Highly recommended.

bij Pascal, 29/12/2015. Spel in twee teams (rood en blauw) rond een variabel raster van 5x5 woorden. Via een klein kaartje weten de tipgevers welke woorden rood, blauw of neutraal zijn. Er is ook een zwart woord, dat absoluut niet mag aangeduid worden of het spel is onmiddellijk verloren.  De ene speler geeft tips aan de hand van 1 woord en een getal (het aantal te vinden woorden bij die tip); de andere moet aan de hand van de tip de juiste woorden proberen aanduiden. Tof partyspel; geweldig in zijn eenvoud!

Great party game, makes you try to get into other people's heads in a fun way. I think being the person who knows where all the words are is the most fun, as it forces you to think creatively within a confined space which is really cool. But guessing the words is fun too.

This is a very fun very light game from Master Vlada.  An array of words are placed on the board.  The players divide into two teams and each team has a codemaster.  The two codemasters have a secret chart that indicates which words belong to which team or are neutral or trigger the deadly assassin.  Each in turn gives their team a clue and a number indicating how many of the words it applies to.  So for example if the codemaster wants them to pick "snow" and "hospital" he might say "hypothermia".  Different people can have very different associations with these words so fun ensues as the team tries to figure out these cryptic clues.  Each game is maybe fifteen minutes so you'll often do multiple rounds.  It makes a great filler and also as an intro to brainier games for newbies to boardgaming.  It appeals to both party gamers and board gamers as it is easy to understand but requires real thought.

This is a great co-operative game for groups of 4-8.  Quick to set up and tear down.  Good tension.  Needs the right group, obviously - pairing spouses with each other can be unfair, and someone who is win-at-all-costs and will use facial expressions, gestures, etc. can ruin the spirit...

Codenames is one of the best party games on the market, especially for non-gamers. The rules are fairly simple (though there can be some debate regarding legal clues) and there is plenty of variety and challenge in mastering the ability to give and decipher clues to the word puzzle at its core. While the game's pace allows it to be played in a casual, laid-back atmosphere, that same slow pace can also make the game drag (and make me a little less interested in suggesting it). Despite that, Codenames accomplishes its goal by being an accessible party game that everyone can enjoy.

Interesting word game. Each clue-giver gives one-word clues to his teammate(s) to get them to guess which words on a grid belong to their team. Some of the words are neutral, not so bad when you miss, but one word results in insta-loss if it gets picked. So try to tie together seemingly unrelated words while not matching words on the grid that aren't yours. Update: This game is like potato chips. I don't necessarily want a bunch of chips, but next thing I know I've eaten half the bag.

Fun party/filler game. One person takes on the role of the spy master where they know who the spies working on their side are and the others take on the roles of spies trying to meet the correct contacts by their codenames.

Only thing I wish was that it was a bit easier to read the grid on the small card. It can be tough at times seeing as the grid has to be shared between 2 people and its size can make it easy to make a mistake when trying to find out what your agents codenames are.

Can depend on the group you're with as to how to tailor your clues but that's the fun of the game.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2015)

Vlaada Chvátil is a great and diverse designer. I have still to play one of his games which I didn’t like on some level and I always buy his games. Having said that, I was expecting more from Codenames, however the jury is still out on this one as I only played it once and very quickly.

The rules are very easy to learn but the gameplay is intriguing and I like playing on teams. It seems the clue-givers have the most fun. I’m not sure how the two player version would work.

The language can be a problem with Codenames, perhaps I will get the Spanish version when it comes out.

Bottom line, I already bought a copy and I plan to play it again soon. It seems it is very group dependent but for now I feel it is a solid design.

After 20+ more plays, I´m tremendously enjoying Codenames. It´s a very clever party game and I won’t refuse a game. To properly enjoy it  you need the correct game group, that was the reason I first didn’t like it very much. It has the potential of going up in my personal ratings.

Great party game, perhaps the best of the year.

I have played the game many times and I have played it in English and in Spanish. I enjoy both editions tremendously, but I prefer to play with the English version of the game. In English many words can mean many things while in my language the words have many less meanings, so the game is much more limited.

I really enjoy this game and it's simplicity means a low entry barrier for none gamers. It also functions quite well as a get to know you game. Codenames has a very unique playstyle that i've not seen in other party games. However, due to the communication barriers that the game requires (codemasters and codebreakers don't speak to one another), i find it's a game i end up only playing with other games in a group of 4 rather than as the party game it was designed to be. There also seems to be a bit of diminishing returns with large groups, the more players you have the less fun and challenging it becomes as many players don't get a chance to answer and end up distracting others.

This game got so much hype, yet it didn't look that interesting on any of the run throughs I saw. Then I had had a chance to play it and had to run out and buy a copy, take it home, and play it again and again. 
It's quick and easy to explain we always play at least 4 games of it every time we get it out. Best with more people (several couples). Although it can be played with as few as two; I don't like it as much less than 4. 
Kids are really good at this game, surprisingly so, but only at guessing. My kids did so well guessing I mistakenly gave in to there requests to be the code mastor (one needed for each team). Kids can not be code masters!!!! But I would take any kid to help me guess. 
I highly recommend this game!!!

Codenames is easily the most enjoyable word game I have played. Layers of strategy and decisions whether you are giving clues or guessing. Do you play it safe for the sure thing or try to string together multiple words to gain a slight edge? Do you risk an extra guess if you fall behind? The presence of an assassin card each round adds a great element of suspense. Extremely enjoyable and instantly addictive. An instant classic!

This is truly a party game that I think gamers and non-gamers can both enjoy. It is a mind-twisting challenge. People who do not do word association well may have a frustrating time with this one. But even the super literal can succeed by not biting off more associations than can be chewed. My kids (8 & 13) both loved this and it is excellent with adults as well. 4, 6, and 8 are the best player counts, making for even teams.

I've never had a game go over this well with my entire game group, nor have I seen another game I was so eager to play having already played it over twenty times. When we pack games to go over to friends' houses or a game day, the question is never "Should we bring Codenames?" but "What should we bring in addition to Codenames?"

The main reason this party game works so well in, at least, the situations I've brought it to, is how well it scales with more or less players. People can easily drop in and out as they see the game and understand how to play, which is great at drawing in new players.

Fun brain-burning game. Almost like you're trying to solve a word-puzzle with every turn as a codemaster, while you're testing exactly how in tune you are with your friends as a guesser. Think there is a good amount of silent down-time with the game, but still fun nonetheless!

I'm not a big fan of very light games and I'm not a fan of word games at all. Despite that I think codenames is a fantastic game. The word element is not in creating words from a pool of letters (which I loath) but making clever associations between words. It's really more of a vocabulary game, and I find that challenge very engaging and fun.

The game creates a lot of fun moments and it's interesting to hear what associations people were trying to create when the game is over.

Codenames is a good solid game that will easily hold a place in my curated collection for a very long time. But I have to say it strikes me as a bit out of place that it ranks so very high on BGG relative to other party games. I suspect geeks are rating it highly for being a difficult game that rewards skillful play - as opposed to most party games where scoring is largely an afterthought and any skills required are of a very 'soft' sort. Where Codenames is not as strong as many party games (my initial impression at least) is in the unscientific Fun Factor.

Codenames is a word game with some elements of strategy.  So, don't expect much depth. 

Instead, Codenames is a great alternative to more tedious party games like Catch Phrase or *shudder* Apples to Apples. It is slightly deep than this games, as one must decide how specific to make clues or how many guesses to allow that will allow their team good odds of catching up.

The fact that the game can be played within 2 minutes of explanation or by watching it makes Codenames extremely accessible.  It is quick (

Sweet party game, lovechild of Dixit and taboo/forbidden word. You're playing as Spy & Co, the names of common items are pseudonyms for your secret agents, which you must not give away to the other agency.

Game designer Vlaada Chvátil seems to attract me.
See potential to turn this into a game I can use in my work.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable and quick party game. Out of 25 tiles each containing an ambiguous words, the explainer of each of the two groups has to lead his group to detecting the 9 (first group) respectively 8 tiles associated with his group (supposedly "agents"). To achieve this, he's only allowed to give a hint consisting of a single word and the number of tiles described by this, no further hints allowed. The group then points to the tiles they think are their agents. The challenge are associations of certain words, the explainer missed noticing. The result is a fun puzzle, especially for the explainer. Each game is quick enough to give each player the chance to prove his wording skills.

One minor niggle depending on the group: The German language might not be best suited for the game principle as the nearly unlimited possibility of our language to form composite words can lead to discussions what is still acceptable as a single word. Glasdeponie?

RATING: 10
This is a fantastic game. I've played this with a number of friends that aren't board gamers and they've all loved it.

One time that I was giving the very first clue of the game, said "office 3", my team guessed "post" and "chair" correctly before guessing "light". Luckily for me that was one of my words, just not one I wanted trying to have them guess. They then proceeded to realise that "server" was on the board, and that I probably meant that, so used the bonus guess to grab four correct words on the very first go!

First off, it was only 15 USD when I bought it. And I must say, that's a fantastic price for such a well-designed game!

My favorite thing about this game is the theme. I'm a huge fan of the James Bond franchise, and this gave me a chance to show my friends my spy skills! :)

The game's mechanics are simple and nothing revolutionary, but very solid nevertheless. The box says the game is best with 6 players, but I've gotten the most enjoyment out of the 2-player cooperative rule variant. The base game is best with 4, 6, 8, or any higher even number of players. Generally speaking, 6 is the best!

All the materials that come with the game are high quality pieces (minus the hourglass, which I would never use anyways). Overall, solid game - it's my favorite party game to play for sure!

The game is okay. There was too much deliberation going on to interpret the clues. Just go with your gut instinct. It's usually right anyways. And then the spymaster on the other team wouldn't look for a clue to give until the other team had finished so a 10-15 minute game was more like 30-40. Maybe it wasn't the game's fault and just the players but I was bored.

Originally only played with 4 players (two different groups). It was ok, but not the end-all, life-changing experience everyone makes it out to be.  It was fun, I'm just not sure why it's the hottest game around and "the best party game ever." Concept allows for more creativity and laugh out loud "party game" moments once you dump the instructions.  Codenames is easy and cheap so I'm not a hater, I've already got my money's worth, but I don't love it. Played it again at a higher player count after my original comments and it is definitely better, but still not a favorite and still feel it's over-rated.  Everyone seems to enjoy it though, so I'll keep it because it at the least offers an option at higher player counts and is easy to teach.

A game that non-gamers enjoy playing. 

I've mostly played this in a multi-cultural environment, where I feel that native English speakers have an advantage, particularly when it comes to playing the spymaster.

Believe the hype.  I was honestly baffled when I first read all the rave reviews.  The game sounded so simple, and pretty similar to other, um, less than stellar party game staples of yore (Taboo, et al.).  And while both of those things are true, it has proven to be a big hit with both my gamer friends and casual players.  A perfect filler that you can play when waiting for other people to arrive (since they can always jump right in when they do get there).  Easy to explain, tricky to play well.  A must for any game collection.

I love and hate this game at the same time. I love it because the concept is clever, it creates some tense moments especially in late game and you can find some really clever ways to combine words. I hate it because the start can't be more boring. 2 people stare at the table and everyone sits silently waiting for clues. After the first game the cards are turned to the other side and the game is played again so it definitely has the staying power and fun factor. As I said the only thing negative with the game is its start.

I played this at a church game night with five players who I would not consider "gamers". We wound up playing about 10 games in a row until people had to start leaving. Everyone had a blast! I've also played it with my game group (it was a friend's copy) and the three of us that didn't own it, ordered it immediately. This game is fun with just about anyone, definitely one of the first I would reach for to play with non-gamers but I also wouldn't hesitate to bring it out with hardcore hobbyists either.

Fun party game that doesn't quite live up to all the hype.  I'm willing to play if others want to but I think I will always prefer to play something else.  I hope I don't have to play this too often.

Best with six; okay with seven or eight.  Higher player counts just lead to longer turns as more players discuss options and stand up to more easily see all the words.

Four and five could be okay but they start to remove the discussion aspect of the decisions and the odd player starts to cause a problem.  Could work for two but you would have to remove the competition to win out and just treat it as a fun activity.

RATING: 7
The concept here of making connections between deliberately ambiguous words makes for a distinctive game experience, so with the right players - generally those who heckle and discuss vigorously - it can be great.
I'd hesitate to recommend it unreservedly though, as it falls quite flat with the wrong players. In particular, the spymaster needs to be willing to be reckless, both giving clues quickly (even if they might be bad clues), and avoiding the temptation to give clues that only target a single agent - guaranteeing certainty but boredom. Both of these things take the fun out of the game very quickly.
So: fun with the right crowd, but the best party games tend to nudge the players towards playing in the right spirit, and because it doesn't do so, Codenames can be risky to pull out with a new group.

A neat exercise in competitive taxonomy, like Edward de Bono's old exercise of taking eight random words and grouping them into two fours. Very elegantly gamified. Some of the feeling of Only Connect's connecting wall, or a good cryptic crossword, but always second-guessing your luck-pushing friends instead of an unknowable question-setter. Two-player is more like a single-player puzzle for the spymaster, with the solver being the voice of reason, but is still a fun exercise.

One of those games that you think you won't like...so you avoid it. Then you somehow stumble across it and look at the mechanics.
It is a truly great game, we played it with a 91 year old this Christmas and even she fully participated and enjoyed it.
Good repeat playability, thought provoking and frankly just plain fun.
With a 20 minute playing time per game..its a 'play anywhere' kind of game.
Thank you CGE.

Codenames is a very good party game that does have a couple drawbacks. For one, it can really create some terrible AP for players that don't have a great vocabulary or struggle to combine the words. You can also really get screwed if you get a bad batch of words. Otherwise, it is a spectacular game that can really make you think.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great party game when you want something other than social deduction and hidden roles. It's a lot of fun and doesn't require people to give 100% of their attention to the game. Light, easy to pick up, and can lead to a lot of laughs.

We aren't ones that are fond of many "Party Games" so it's probably no surprise that the party game designed for people who aren't fans of party games is a game that would appeal to us.  I also personally probably despise word games more than another other type of game.  For those reasons Codenames is a nice fit for my game collection.  Deduction is something I've grown to like, having avoided a lot of those in the past, as our son LOVES deduction games.  As the spymaster it does often seem hard to come up with clues that encompass 3+ cards well.  I suppose that is the point of it.  Those guessing can still do alright if they can recall previous clues and use their "one extra guess" to make up in later turns for failed guesses on previous ones.  We've played the game quite a bit with just 2 & 3 players and don't find it affects our enjoyment of the game much since it's a more serious game to begin with.  In fact, at 2 or 3 players it probably shouldn't qualify as a party game at all.  Another reason to like it.

RATING: 7.8
A game with many different levels, easy to pickup and teach.  Roughly 10 min to explain to new people, roughly 2 games/rounds required for new people to pick it up.  The game seems simple, and can be played simple, or it can be quite complex with your ability to win tied with how well you know or can convey an idea with one single word. Perfect for people who love word games, this is a game that can be played at any setting.  Works with family night, parties, or Mom's basement DnD night. You do need at least 4 however for it to play in its true form.

Must-have for party game collections.  Hits a lot of the right notes for a small to medium group of people, gamers or not-gamers - team competition, word association, simple play with a lot of depth to the effort to deduce what your team-mate is suggesting.  The theme is pasted on but in this case it totally works - there aren't many other themes that would work well here.  Artwork on the components is outstanding (looks a lot like the artwork for Archer, which is apropos I suppose) and the components are solid, will last a long time.  Buy it.

On a side-note, I'm a little disappointed that a Codenames Cards Against Humanity variant has been released. Codenames is such a clever game, and just replacing the words with dirty and/or gross words really does not work well, in my opinion, with the elegance of the original game.

Excellent party game, hands down. There's virtually no downtime because, even if it isn't your turn, you still want to try to guess what the other team has to pick, so as to narrow your choices down. It's also a deduction game that doesn't break when mixing experienced players with newbies.

Codenames can be very fun with the right number of people, in my opinion, this game plays best at 6 and above. Below 6, there is a lot of silence other than people giving clues. Also, you must enforce the timer rule so that the turns dont become very long. At 6 and above, the teams are able to discuss the codes with each other, which really livens the game up.

A party game of clever context sharing, except for there isn't much socializing while you play due to the nature of the challenge - unlike Taboo or similar, you've got to keep quiet about your speculations for the entire game round lest you tip off the other team to what to pick. An enjoyable brain-teaser, but probably not something I'd willingly play again. Ultimately, something you can construct from scratch with little effort.

Such a simple concept but with great replayability.  It's definitely not easy being the spymaster.  That feeling of being able to string a couple of words together with one word is pretty awesome though.

RATING: 8
Perhaps the biggest downside to Codenames is that it's much more fun to be the Spymaster than on the rest of the team. But I will gladly play this just about any time. In fact I even enjoy just looking at setups and trying to come up with clues by myself sometimes. Such a simple design, but it can be so much fun.

Just a few simple ideas have created quite the interesting word game. People have even adapted the concept to layouts using items besides the word cards provided in the box. The success of the game can certainly depend on the crowd playing it, like most party games, but so far it's worked pretty well for everyone.

I knew before even trying it, that I will like Codenames - and I did. It's well-made game which neat idea and such a clever and easy rules. We played it with unofficial finnish edition (=cards), but using otherwise the original components. So now I'm just waiting for the finnish publisher for this extraordinary game. I really liked it and see a lot of different places where this game rocks. Update 1/2016: Yep, the finnish edition is coming, so this one is a must-buy when it's released!

RATING: N/A
In Codenames, two teams compete to see who can make contact with all of their agents first. Spymasters give one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the board. Their teammates try to guess words of the right color while avoiding those that belong to the opposing team. And everyone wants to avoid the assassin.

It's been years since I've played a new Chvátil game that I really liked. Dungeon Petz was mediocre compared to Dungeon Lords (best of 2009); Mage Knight is just not for me; I played Tash-Kalar only 4-player which is probably not how it should be played but still didn't feel like I'd like to replay it.

And now here it is, a party game... And I love it. It's unique, it's great: as my wife said it's like Battleship meets Taboo and I quite like this definition even if it does not describe the best part of the game - coming up with clues for several cards at the same time, while avoiding some other cards. And this is how a communications game also becomes a brain-burner: even if it might result in some long thinking periods (of course the sandtimer helps somewhat), it's so unique and new that it deserved its Spiel des Jahres just as much as it deserves its first place in my 2015 list.

This is a good party game, though a notch down from the very best. 

4-6 players is the sweet spot for this one, with both providing a different slant to the experience.

With four it is a tight and somewhat tense battle of wits, while 6 players opens up some of the humor and social dynamics through intra-team discussion.

It is the kind of game that once you start you can easily end up spending the rest of the night on it, playing game after game. There are few games that can do this and still be as enjoyable in the last game as the first, but this is one of them.

A bit more thinky than most party games, this has nevertheless been a hit with gamers, non-gamers, and teenagers. Everyone I have introduced it too immediately requests another game.

I first played Codenames in a large group and I hadn't had this much fun playing a boardgame in a long time. 

However, I played it a second time with a lower player count and it wasn't nearly as much fun. I own the game, but I rarely play it because the opportunity never comes up.

It seems like everything this designer touches is gold. At first, this game didn't sound very interesting to me, and maybe even a little gimmicky, like a party game, BUT after playing it, I have to say that I think it's one of my favorite games so far in 2015. Brilliant design that's as simple as most party games, but ends up being a brain buster like all Vlaada's games are. If Dixit was designed for adult gamers, this is what it would look like.

So much fun. Easily my favorite party game. I do not like how easily someone can mistakingly cheat when giving clues, I feel like every time I have played one turn has ended due to someone giving away a spy.

I love social games with few rules and Codenames fits into that category perfectly. This game can accommodate just about any number of players and is a great team building-type of game, as you are required to effectively communicate information about specific clues while avoiding words that will cause your team to grab the assassin. Highly recommend.

Enjoyable game where you try to get your team to guess your words and avoid the other teams words from a 5 by 5 grid of words.

I'm not much for party-type games, and when people described Codenames to me I didn't really get it. But after playing, I loved this game. In fact, everyone loved it and rushed to get a copy of their own. It's such a simple idea, yet absolutely works. I've been cool on Chvatil for some time, often feeling like he never knows when to edit a game down, so it's nice to see such a straightforward design coming from him.

Its simplicity is a huge strength.  The simple concept of this game won't ever get old I don't think.  Only time will tell.

It involves getting into other player's heads, and it's all about making associations and rating how strong the associations are, especially for the person giving the clues.  I love that guessing the wrong thing could really bite you in the butt.  

I could play this with any group as a party game.

I expected this to be a bit flat, but it was actually really really good. I currently like this considerably more than Spyfall. The clues keep you engaged on both team's turns to try and narrow down the options, it's fun trying to guess for the other team and mocking them because they haven't worked it out. It's fun to mock someone for far out clues that make no sense, or working out that your clue worked but for totally the wrong reasons.

RATING: 6
Another party game that I think works better as a computer game due to what people say easily giving away extra information (though since the rules say only one word it's not as easy to game as say Dixit), but despite this being a word guessing game this is a most excellently designed game of the genre, and while party games are far from my favorite board game category I understand why this game has risen so quickly. There is a great challenge balancing giving specific clues but having a lower ceiling of number of correct answers in one turn and a high number of guesses but having to give vague clues in order to apply to more phrases. You could also purposefully lie on the number of words matching a clue to try to get more guesses (or say 0 to get infinite). As the spymaster it's also fun to watch your team come haphazardly close to guessing the instant lose word or as the opposing team attempt to goad your team to choose a word that is clearly not related to your clue, but is also a word they need to eventually guess. You need to consider choosing your clues based on the non spymasters' discussion, either so your team doesn't choose a word due to a misinterpretation of a previous clue, or by timing which clues you give when so that if the opposition is on the cusp of guessing one of your words for you, you choose to give clues to alternate words first to your team. 

Despite the game having teams 7 players worked pretty well (although unless there is a variant 5 would be weird since you would have no one to deliberate with), and having a little more than 8 would probably be fine.

Fun casual team game.  It's hard for me to truly classify this as a "party game" because it is someways anti-party.  You do not want to be playing this with loud people in the vicinity.  Most rewarding features are giving that perfect clue as clue-master.  Can take a long time for clue-master to give clues due to the number of factors they must take in.  People who do not like long down-times may find fault with this game.  My group seems to like this more than I do, but I'm almost always open to play!

For a game with this much hype, I was surprised with how little there is to the game.  The luck reliance is substantial, although a variable amount (from zero to all) of that reliance can be mitigated through cleverness.  Sometimes feels more like waiting for the next turn than it feels like a game.

I have never had this game go poorly at a game night.  Lots of laughs and fun tension built, usually followed by requests for more games.  Only drawback is that there is somewhat of a language dependency, so for my non-native speaking friends it's a bit more difficult.

Nice and easy to play game with a solid, clever, and intuitive design, but I feel it is a bit overrated. Every experience of playing it has felt exactly the same for me, with relatively little excitement or variety. It feels more like the losing team loses by making a single mistake, than the winning team wins by being better.

We love word games of various types, so as soon as I heard about this game I knew we would love it. And it has been a huge hit in our group, from non-gamers to the hard core (who admittedly are also fans of words, word play and cryptic puzzles). Trying to clue someone to get the words you want them to get while not picking the other words is often agonizing, that perfect clue is there if you could just think of it! The words in there are clever, multiple meanings to give many possibilities and many possibilities for misinterpretation too. The added tension of the death word just to spice things up even more is a brilliant accent on a very cleverly designed game.

RATING: 9.5
Super fun game that works for all crowds and ages. Perfect for 4+ people, and great for ruining relationships (BECAUSE NOBODY GUESSES "CELL" OVER "HERO" WHEN THE CLUE IS "SUPER" YOU MORON, AND FOR GOD'S SAKE "HERO" IS THE ASSASSIN WORD WHAT WERE YOU THINKING)

Ahem, anyways. Infinitely replayable, super portable (perfect to bring to kill time in the airport, waiting for food at a restaurant, chilling after dinner, etc), always worth a few laughs. It makes you think and tests your creativity. 

Highly recommend this to anyone, seasoned gamers and new gamers alike. Great family game.

Fascinating word puzzle game. (Played with 5.)  Want to play it more. Although it is considered a "Party" game, it doesn't go well with drinking, because it isn't all that social, and actually  requires quite a bit of thinking (which is harder to do after a few beers).

RATING: 7
I typically dislike party games, I don't like word games, this game has both and it is fun.  Vlaada Chavatil is a genius.  You try to give a single word clue and number of cards that matches words on a 5x5 grid of cards assigned to you as the clue giver but unknown to your team member.  Your team then tries to guess without picking the assassin card, neutral card or another team's card.  

It is nicely balanced with good components for a party game.  Now, it is not the greatest game ever.  The clue giver may take a lot of time to develop a clue.  It is light but this is a great gateway party game for both gamers and non gamers

It's the easiest rules explanation I've yet encountered.  I was able to basically throw the game at the table and, like some weird goddam 90's rap video, a bunch of chicks in g-strings showed up with malt liquor and a Cadillac EL Dorado sporting a grill built into the trunk.  It was basically magic.

RATING: 10
If you are taking this game as seriously as the rules might lead you to believe you should, then you aren't playing it right.  Lots of table talk and random-ish guessing are where it's at.  Make those spymasters work at keeping a straight face.  That, and clearly it's gotta be 'Olive'!

This has pretty much replaced all other party games for me.  At least for the moment.
Especially with the prospect of mixing in Dixit cards...

Update:  Picture cards are ok, but not as good as words.  I'll stick with the original for the most part.

The more people playing the more fun we have with the discussions.  Really fun.

Interesting short team based word game. Try a safe clue for a single answer or try a riskier clue for multiple answers at the risk of unveiling an enemy agent? The game is very quick and many can participate, making for a nice party game.

Definitely enjoyed playing the game and would like to play it again.  If I owned it I would use it often as a good starter/filler/for larger groups/ for a change of pace/for fun.  It is an excellent game, just could not live up to the hype (at one time is was hyped as an 11).

Somewhat similar to Concept, but not nearly as fun.  It's fun to be the spymaster, but not much fun to be the guesser, especially when you have to wait on him to think up clues.  I don't understand why it's so popular.  Played the 2 player version.  I'd rather play Concept or Zendo.

Second update:  It is best with people you know well rather than strangers.  It works very well with non-gamers.

RATING: 8
Great party game.  I'd suggest at least 6 players and people who've got a little bit of patience and enjoy analyzing clues.  As the clue giver it can take some time to figure out relevant, helpful clues that maximize the amount of cards it can apply to, so there can be down time, a lot of down time depending on the players and the cards.

The game is pretty quick for even non-gamers to pick up, but you might have to explain some concepts in the game a couple of times for it to "click" with new players.  Usually the best way teach this game is a quick run down of game and then an example round.  I also advise that the first two clue givers be experienced players when playing with new players.

Only cons are that there can be a lot of down time for clue givers, I recommend using a time, hourglass or digital to keep the pace of the game moving a decent speed.  Also the randomness of the cards drawn and the layout of the clues each team is to give, can sometimes lead to some really difficult clues to give for clue givers.

I've found that it's a very approachable, enjoyable game for all ages and levels of gaming experience.  Highly recommended for you party game collection.

RATING: 9
Quality party game that's easy to teach and fun to play. I love the thinkiness of it, where you're trying to find a word that will lead your team towards 3 words that are completely unconnected while also avoiding your opponents similar words. Just so much fun.

Requires people who are quick with giving clues - Some people aren't keen on having that responsibility

RATING: 7
Another chance to play this great game. Everyone must know it by now, and if they don't, they will do later this year when Codenames: Pictures hits the stores.

This was a chance to play the game with adults, which was a new experience and it did enhance my enjoyment of the game as you can think outside the box a little bit more when giving clues as the spymaster. 

I am though increasingly finding myself absolutely useless at it. These plays further compounded this opinion. I guess like everyone else I find myself giving clues that seem obvious or at least slightly clear but then once the one word clue leaves my mouth it becomes all to obvious from the looks on the faces of my eager spies that the word I was looking for to describe the clarity of my clue was opaque. For example, one game I was giving a clue that linked Tokyo and Calf and they thought I was hinting at a famous basketball player! With hindsight I can completely see their thought process and it was, I guess the obvious thing to think of, it just never entered my thought pattern

[b]Great game for people who love guessing words. A lot thinkier and quieter than other party games because as the spymaster, you can only give a single word and number as the clue, and you have to be very careful about it so your team doesn't accidentally guess the assassin. It's exciting and nerve-wrecking to watch your team mates discuss your clue. And very interesting to see how different the connections are that other people's minds make from your own.[/b]

RATING: 8
Excellent party game. Easy enough to teach, but the number of options and replay potential always makes the game one of the first I suggest. I definitely prefer it with at least 6 people, so it does not always make it to the table, but I have no issues bringing this to a party and suggesting to break it out. The amount of laughter and brain-teasing is endless.

This wasn't quite the hit with my family that I was expecting. In the end, we'd rather play Taboo or Password.

What made this fall flat, I think, was that there was a lack of tension. As long as you were ahead of the other team at all, you could give single-word clues and win. You didn't have to take risks to give multi-word clues.

For whatever reason, it also seemed to lack the "fun factor" that's essential for group games. Everyone was participating, but there wasn't any laughter or "wow" moments.

Wonderful game! Ill be delighted to play it everyday. I love the way ur in teams and one of u can see where the assassin or innocent ppl r. Then they have to say a 1 word so that ur team can cover up as many spaces as possible. Since the clues ur given r words the word the spymaster gives has to be a synonym or describe one or more of the words on the table.

Consistently fun and interesting for a variety of groups.  Minimum rules but surprisingly interesting and challenging gameplay.  This really scratches the "detective" itch.  Unexpectedly thematic because it does feel like decoding spy signals.  This works in many situations: larger groups, new gamers, puzzle fans, party where people drop in and out.  Fantastic game!

A somewhat enjoyable social game, but I don't see this hitting the table very often with a group of "serious" Euro or lite War gamers.

This game will scratch that same itch as Cards Against Humanity in my opinion.

Deserving of the Spiel des Jahres 2016 award?  I think not.  It's okay, but it's not that fun.  Also this game can be ruined by bad play.

Edit: The more the game exists the less I like it.

RATING: 5
It's a glorified word association game.  Easy to teach and can be played with a group as little as four people.

However, I feel the game has been overplayed to death at this point.  I've seen many players, especially new ones, give simple clues to list only one card because sometimes the cards are just not in your favor.

To me, I prefer something a little bit more meatier.  If people want to play it, I'm happy to play it, but owning it?  I prefer to play other games in my collection.

Definitely a different sort of word/puzzle game. I like it!

2v2: Being the spymaster was surprisingly stressful. I fucked up a lot in the first game, but improved a lot in my second. There are meta-layers of information that build up during play, and familiarity between teammates develops as well, which makes for an interesting dynamic. Being the guesser was fun, but on balance I think I enjoyed spymastering more -- although I was better at guessing.

It's a game that looks simple on the surface, and has simple rules, but which has layers and depth and elements that don't show themselves immediately. I love that. I also suspect it has more to reveal with other groups, play counts, etc.

Codenames offers a solid fun experience. Initially my biggest doubt was how well the game works with non-native English speakers but the rules are flexible enough as long as all the players focus on the fun part of the game instead of nitpicking. Actually using foreign words brings a lot of new connections between words.
The game really deserves its #1 party game rank. Fast, simple and fun.

RATING: 6
Rating based on many counts of players.

Simple and clever game. I brought this to a video game convention, and it was beloved by all.  It's one of those games where there's lots of potential to discuss and agonize over every decision, and it's good for friends AND for getting to know people. 

The possible issues that might arise is if the spymaster plays too conservatively and keeps doing _____ 1 hints (which can get a little boring) or if they're a  little AP-prone, but since the SM changes each round and there's a timer included those problems are minimal (we never used the timer ourselves).

---------------------------------
Over time this game has lost some of its lustre for me, as being the spymaster is by far the most interesting part of the game for me, and I don't like being part of a big team while guessing. I still like the game, but I like it 2v2 the most... but how often do you play it 2v2?

RATING: 8
An amazing party game. One that I will almost always consider bringing or pulling out if I'm with a group of people who seem like they might even be slightly interested in playing a boardgame.

It just does everything right:
* It can be taught in less than 5 minutes.
* You instantly start feeling the tension of the game.
* It satisfies the cravings for people who love over-thinking things.
* It creates memorable moments in every game.
* And it has the boardgame-y rules that clearly define the bounds of the game (a problem with a lot of party games: "do whatever you want!").

A classic party game from the start. And it's easily expand-able, so it will have a lot of staying power. The only reason I have a couple of points knocked off it's rating (8/10) is because there's ultimately not much here. It's an amazing concept, but in terms of awe-inspiring game mechanism, there's not much beyond just the concept. But it's still great, and exactly what it needs to be IMO. Definitely recommended for anyone who might ever be in a group of people who would be interested in playing a light party game.

Very quick game, easy to pick up and teach.  Would likely benefit from higher numbers of people where possible, but I can't imagine playing with less than 6.  At 2, it is absolutely boring, so odd that it evens offers that player count.  Takes a little bit to get used to being the Spymaster: until then, 1-word codewords seem to prevail, and multi-word codewords end up being a much higher risk.

I really enjoy the word/gameplay, and the risk of sudden death greatly adds to the tension. Plus the meta-analysis of "How do they think I think?". I've found this game works well for a wide range of players in terms of age, game experience, etc but avoid people who are non-cooperative (stick to competitive games for them).

So very solid game, but fyi two minor weaknesses:
1) the downtime can kind of kill the pace, and
2) sometimes the word distribution heavily favors one team (but this occurs infrequently).

The first can be reduced by having both team leaders thinking, regardless of whose turn it is (can help save a lot of time that way, except for very first turn). And by using the hourglass (despite the rules' suggestion to use it rarely) when people's interest starts waning.

A great party game.  Quick, intellectual and fun.

I wish it were a little easier to explain (maybe I haven't done it enough).  The vagueness of the rules (specifically what you can and can't do) is a double edged sword.  I like the flexibility, but it makes it annoying to explain.  I wish it came with a cheat sheet of the rules too.

Another thing that makes the game difficult is that new folks don't full accept the Spy theme.  The theme is important because real spies don't give away answers with their body language or prefacing their clues with "this might be a stretch" or laughing at their teammates as they work out the answers.

I'm obsessed with this game. Been playing it remotely in a 2p co-operative game but it doesn't feel dull at all. Surprisingly thinky for a filler game. The cards repeat themselves ever so slightly but it doesn't matter at all as the red/blue markers change anyway. So simple but so replayable. Genius little game.

I loved the game the first time I played it and absolutely hated it the next time. I've played it several times always hopping to be able to enjoy it again and I just can't get past how random and unbalanced it is! 90% of the games I've played have been total blowouts because one side just got better sets of words to work with... The game is just too long to have no real balance.

I like the core concept and might play the game again if they ever release designed cards with nice themed and pre balanced sets of words (and no random grid) to guarantee a close match. Random words with a random grid is far too random for a competitive game that takes this lomg.

It's way more fun to give clues than to guess, imo, because the challenge is finding one word that links multiple other words together. For guessers, the challenge is trying to imagine what the clue giver is thinking.

I have all the cards added to the Duet version.

RATING: 7.5
Neat puzzle as the spymaster. Super simple and easy to grasp and a lot of fun with wide appeal. Only downside is the game can lend itself to frustration/criticism when you clues are not interpreted correctly. Need to keep a light-hearted attitude and it's a lot of fun. Great at 4 players and fun with a big group also.

Edit: I have found this game increasingly frustrating as the spymaster, in particular, and just haven't been enjoying the game nearly as much. Sometimes a little more cerebral than I would like for a party atmosphere. I think it shines in smaller groups.

I'm always surprised by how much people like this game. I've never played with someone who has disliked the game, and it entertains people who I've never thought would enjoy a board game. After I played with my family, they immediately bought a copy and began spreading Codenames fever off on their own. This game is simple, fun, and is a hit in almost any group setting.

A great social/team game. It can take a few play throughs until everything clicks for players (and even then it can be hard to prevent them from (inadvertently) giving away too much information), but it's a fun and light enough game that it usually won't matter.

The included timer is also a great way to prevent players from slow-rolling the game without being too oppressive or another aspect of the game to worry about.

I am not as enthused as everyone else is about this game. It seems banal and trite.

I love word games, and I am absolutely positive I would like this game if I played with people who know or were willing to learn the rules.  I've seen several playthroughs on YouTube and am comfortable rating this a 10.  I think it has favorite game potential.  My one play so far was with nongamers who refused to play by the rules.  The result was... raucus.  It was fun but not in the way thoughtful way Codenames is meant to be played.  I should add my game did not come with a rule book.  The company has promised to send me one, but it hasn't arrived yet.

After a couple of games, immensely enjoy this. Brilliant concept and many pitfalls and possibilities, depending on the board. However, long waiting periods can occur, especially in the beginning of the game.

De los mejores parties que existen. Gusta a jugones y no jugones. Muy bueno para enganchar a la gente. Y es un party que no depende mucho de los jugadores. Con que tengan un poco de voluntad de meterse, es suficiente. No hace falta, ni interpretar un papel ni hacer el payaso. No le pongo puntuación más alta porque la profundidad estratégica es muy limitada y las puntuaciones más altas se las reservo a ese tipo de juegos.

Really fun team game about picking the right clue to group as many of words as possible without risking your group picking either the opponent team's words (giving them an advantage) or the hidden spy-word that automatically loses you the game.

For people playing whose first language isn't English (as is the case in my group) it's worth noting that you should have an idea of your group's English skills before suggesting this game, as I was surprised to learn that several of my fellow players were less competent in the language than I had assumed. However, it was fun despite some confusion.

Got this game to play with non-gamer family. First play through was successful. Agree with others that it is better if you have 2-3 people guessing. After 2 plays with just teams of 2, it felt lacking. Once more people were added it got better.

Update: I have played this with probably 20 different people over the course of owning it.

When it shines: If your code masters are able to connect brain waves with their people. If you can get 3+ in a turn it is amazing.

When it needs help: If the code master is struggling, it can be a terrible experience. They take forever to find more than one card and just give up and only flip one card a turn. Those rounds are embarrassing for everyone. Major analysis paralysis sometimes.

- Requires a high amount of concentration to be a party game.

Yet another excellent game by Vlaada. Super simple to explain, super practical to play (any amount of players of any age split in two teams), super flexible (we’ve had people jump in half-way seamlessly) and super fun. Word games are simple to design but very tricky to get right, and Codenames is a prime example of high value. Only caveat - everyone needs to speak the language well, I tried to play the English version with non-English speakers and it didn’t go too well.

My friend Matt said it best. While I was putting Codenames away after playing it for several hours, he commented "I understand why we're going to play something else, but I would easily play that game for the rest of the day."

Codenames is a rare breed of game. I will introduce new players to the rules, and after their first turn, they immediately understand the entire game. Codenames is a straightforward game, though it is still tense and exciting, and each game only lasts about 15 minutes. (It doesn't overstay its welcome.)

Codenames is the sort of game that sticks with you. I still remember games when my team picked the assassin on our first guess (which made our team immediately lose). I also remember games when my team came back from a staggering 4 cards behind to win the game. Though the game itself is short, Codenames is the sort of game that stays with you.

Highly, highly recommended.

It's very rare that I find I game that can engage my whole family and this was one of the few. Very satisfying and quite a brain burner at times too.

The only reason that this doesn't get a 10 is that sometimes I prefer to play a longer game with a lot more moving parts.

Great party game.  I love the chance to try and be creative to figure out good clues, but that's also the one downside to this game- sometimes players will think for a long time trying to get just the right clue.  I guess you can use the timer for that, so it's not really a big issue, but it just seems like there can be lots of downtime in this game. (If you think about it, there's three sections of waiting on someone before it's your turn to do something.  Spymaster A, Team A's guess, then Spymaster B, team B's guess.)

I made a mock-up to try this. It's easy, given the phone app, all you need is a bunch of word cards. This is a great game: the challenge is simple, yet successfully describing multiple words is quite tricky. This is also very much a game: the end game can get quite tense.

Definitely a solid party game, with some nice opportunities for "gamer" tactics, the stuff you find in other party games that are popular here (Dixit, Wits & Wagers, etc.). In this case, you want to very carefully select your clues such they point out only your own words and not your opponents'--and definitely not the assassin's. This can actually lead to a little "brainburn," which I hold against other games of this type, but somehow don't find offensive here.

Codenames has been making waves since its release, and it's easy to see why. It has an awesome level of flexibility, ranging anywhere from 4 to, I'd say 12 people, perfect for a party game. With the large number of double-sided cards that it comes with, there's a HUGE amount of variety in replay.
 The components basically consist of cards, which all seem to be of quality stock so, no complaints there!

This game really fills a gap in our collection: a word based party game. Best with even numbers of players. 6 seemed to work very well but we played it with 4 and that worked quite well too but there is less communication. Highly recommended and deserved winner of the Spiel des Jahres. This version is definitely much better than Codenames: Pictures which fails to deliver in my opinion.

And man... what can I say? Vlaada is a Genius and as done it again!!!

He managed to put a game in a Party Game... it's easy to play, to explain, anyone can play it, you can play it with 4 players or with 40!

It's FUN, but it also has skill in it, it's not just a random funny game where you just do stuff!

In this one the toughest role is being the Spymaster... trying to link the words you want your team to guess without getting the oter teams words or even worse the assassin can be very challenging!

But the role of the other players isn't easy either, they have to get inside the mind of the spymaster and decipher properly the clue he gives.

I usually don't like word games, don't like party games but this one, despite being both things is just AWESOME!

Two thoughts come to mind when I think of Codenames:
"What an amazing party game"
and
"This is the most stressful game I have every played"

It seems like it would be so easy to come up with one-word clues that cover multiple words in a way your partner will understand. This is not true.

Codenames is surprisingly psychological, as you must try to imagine how your partner, completely in the dark, will interpret your word as it connects to 25 other words on the table. The feeling of pulling off a clever clue to get 3 or more words is one of triumph.

Vlaada Chvátil manages to do the impossible here: design an AP-prone party game. The game is very short, but some turns can feel like an eternity as nothing seems to fit and you either go for a clue which is a long shot or just go for a 1-word clue.

Definitely worth picking up, as it provides very interesting situations and can be played pretty much anywhere and anytime.

I hate party games, and I'm not a big fan of word games either. But I have a great fondness for Codenames. 

For me, it stands out from most party games in that it doesn't simply present me with a blank canvas and put me on the spot to come up with something creative or funny. I'm much too slow and plodding of a thinker to do well in those kinds of situations, and I end up having a miserable time at games that require that sort of spontaneity.

It also stands out from most word games in that it's not quite so dry and lacking in context. Games like Scrabble or Boggle ask you to come up with words that fit, but any word will do, so long as it obeys the rules. The meanings of the words never make an appearance. In Codenames, the meanings of the words *are* the game.

It's tremendously fun to try to stretch your brain to connect seemingly unconnected words, and fun to guess at what connection the spymaster had in mind. There's also plenty of room for some clever analysis as you try to figure out why the spymaster chose one clue instead of another.

RATING: 7.9
The spymaster role in this game is extremely important & demanding:  if the spymaster cannot think of multiple word clues and only gives a clue for "one" word at a time: the game kind of falls apart because it is stupidly easy.  So the game requires smart, creative spymasters.  When there are good spymasters the game is addictive & fun: it is the kind of game that you can't play just once! When the spymaster is slow, or limited to single-word clues, there's really no game at all. 

(With Pictures, it's easier to find matches.)

RATING: 7
+1 Creates fun, laughter and banter. 
+2 Very flexible player numbers - tolerates adding/removing spies mid game, people not paying attention, going for a drink etc. 
+1 reasonable degree of skill for the 'spy masters' 
+1 very light game can teach in 20 seconds if you're a spy. 

-2 can be a LOT of downtime for everyone else if one of the spymasters can't think of a clue (or, the flipside, every clue is a 1 and the game becomes very easy on both sides). Which, for a party game, is huge.   
-.5 game tends to irk rules lawyers - people giving 'hints' or bending rules etc.
-.5 Plays less 'laughs and banter' with less than 5/6 players. Lots of silent thinking doesn't suit a party game. 


Fantastic as an overflow table for meetups. provided there's a spymaster who knows how to play, we can add/remove players almost at will, and it still runs fine. encourages banter/chats between folks, people can wander, not pay attention, get drinks etc. Codenames tolerates it all and still works fine.

A perfect party game if people can focus and pay attention the game, at least (I don't think it's a great party game when drinking necessarily).

The design is good, and it's even more fun with larger teams, like 6 or 8 people, when each team can discuss with each other how to reason.

Considering its rank and rating, it's really hard to beat when the price is as low as it is. It's a bargain and you should pick it up, unless you really don't like this kind of game (like word games) or rarely play together with more people (4+).

I will give it a slight minus to the fact that the box really could have benefited from an inlay of any kind.

Ok game. My expectations were much higher since I've always enjoyed everything Vlaada puts out. This is somewhat fun and playing the spymaster is agonising in a good way. I was hoping a more interaction across teams however and waiting for the spymaster is boring.

This game isn't bad but it isn't that great either. I don't understand the love this gets in bgg.

By far the worst Vlaada game I've played but that's not saying much.

I picked up a copy of this a Gen Con.  I played it with two players and it was fun but it was extremely easy.  I don't recommend it with 2 or even 3.  I was able to play it later with 8 players and it worked so extremely well.  We had spymasters squirming and general hilarity.  When my husband gave the clue "wood 2" as our first clue and we looked at the cards and saw; deck, chest, bark, nut, maple and palm the entire table exploded in shouting, recriminations and laughter.  We picked deck first and it was completely wrong.  It will be a long time before he lives that clue down.  We are still all laughing about it days later.  Great game for bigger groups.  I would play it any day with 4 or more.  I won't play it again with 2 or 3.

Bei Codenames stehen sich zwei Teams von Agenten gegenüber. Jedes Team hat einen Gruppenleiter, der dafür sorgen muss, dass sein Team die Agenten der eigenen (Team-)Farbe findet. Dafür liegen in der Mitte Karten mit Begriffen aus. Die beiden Gruppenchefs sehen ganz genau, wo sich welcher Agent befindet. Und nun gilt es, dass die Hinweise geben, hinter welchem Wort sich ein eigener Agent befindet. Zum Beispiel kann er sagen "Säugetier - 2". Daraus schließt das eigene Team, dass sich hinter zwei "Säugetier"-Begriffen eigene Agenten befinden. Wenn sich jetzt nur ein Elefant und ein Schwein auf den Karten befindet, war der Tipp super. Was aber wenn es auch noch einen Wal und eine Antilope gibt? Das Spielprinzip ist schnell erklärt und anschließend Jedem klar. Die Gruppenchefs haben hier die schwerste Aufgabe, nämlich Verbindungen zwischen den Begriffen verbinden. "Um die Ecke" denken ist angesagt. Super tolles und witziges Spielprinzip! Aber man sollte es früh auf einer Party auspacken. Ist zuviel Alkohol geflossen wird das nix mehr :-)

Simply social-teamwork deduction gaming executed perfectly to be a fun and interesting time for non-gamers and gamers alike. 

A pair of team leaders must offer a single word clue to try and direct their team towards picking various words in a grid (thematically they are agents) and the first team to get their words first wins. 

The fun of course is in creating creative clues and then seeing your team screw them up completely.

A game that should be in every collection and could easily be a household name if marketed right over the next 20 years.

Quite a fun game that can really be suited to the level of gamers that you are playing with.  Pretty easy to explain, and first timers can do the first round as the guessers -- clue giving can be challenging but very fun.  Clue-givers really need to make sure to not give tells -- don't stare at the board, don't reach for your chips prior to a choice being made, etc.  Great game for all ages -- if the younger ones don't know one of the words, just replace it prior to starting play.

I also own Codenames: Pictures, which feels significantly easier than the original, as well as Codenames: Duet.  Lots of Codenames love in my house!

Absolutely the best game I've ever played. Flawless for what it is. Addictive. Stylish. My go-to game for new gamers. My go-to game for fun with groups. Even the 2-player cooperative mode is amazing. Someday I'll sit down and type a proper, thorough review, but I couldn't let this one go unrated a day longer. Perfect ten!

Revised November 2016. Too many meta gaming and accidental cheating issues. Downgraded from perfect.

Quick to learn, quick to play, fun and involving, a brilliant but simple piece of work from a designer who is always up to something new and interesting.

It really does not look like anything exciting but has gone down a treat with everyone I have played it with. Even teens that are not known for their intellectually stimulating endeavors have excelled with this. Might be that it is more a social deduction game than a word game.

This is a fun game and a genuine hit with family and friends. The scalability is a great feature. One beef is that you have to be pretty fastidious with the rules or else the game gets kinda wonky. That can make it less of a "party" than similar games.

This is probably the best party game that I own. Unsurprising, considering it's ranked number 1 on BGG for party games!

To play this, you need two "spymasters", and each spymaster should be assisted by a team of at least two players. The exact player count is not important, but I do think that it needs at least 6 players to be enjoyable. This game highly rewards skilled play. It is a word-guessing game, but it also has a high amount of strategy, which makes it the perfect choice for any kind of group; both gamers and casual fans can have fun together. If you have enough players, you can't go wrong with this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It sounds so simple on paper. The ONLY reason this game works so well is the Codenames themselves; whilst they feel quite arbitrary, they have been painstakingly chosen by the game's creators to just share enough through-lines to make it work. Really easy to learn, Codenames is a very simple game of word association which requires teams to really tap in to each other's mind-sets to succeed. Playing with close friends and playing with acquaintances becomes a very different beast.  I'd wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.91
The game just works - at any player count, odd, even, few, plenty. One of the most versatile games in my collection, and with the abundance of words, the game has so much replay value. There is a reason it is so highly talked about.

Easy to make yourself too, but I bought simply because it can be excellent to give out the best clue ever - only to have them second guess it because they didn't think you meant that.

Can be prone to people that have a better vocabulary winning but it's not a problem anyway because the people that guess the clues have to be equally as understanding, and that can lead to some interesting developments.

From the day I'd seen Codenames described here on BGG prior to it's release, I knew this was going to be must-have game for me. Turns out it's now one of the most popular board games around. What drew me to it wasn't the word-play, but the teamwork. Team games are easily among my favorite board games just because of the fun in having to work together, and work however you can, is limitless.

For me, this game has been hit or miss. 
Its "a party game", but I feel like it is more fun when your not partying. In order to get into the spirit of the game, players must be focused and table talk must be limited. Also it's hard for new players to immediately jump into, especially with more players. This game is best with 4 players, next best with 6. I wouldn't play it with more than 6 or less than 4. You really have to get into your partner's head to win.

(After 27 Plays) 10/13/16: This has to be my favorite party game at this time. It can be played with numerous player counts and a variety of gamers. This one works well with the family as well as friends. I love giving the clues. It's a fun challenge to see how many cards you can string together with a clever clue. The discussions after are also pretty funny when you get to hear the explanation of the clues.

This is a nice compact design by Vlaada Chvatil. There are two teams. For each team, there is a spymaster, a person who gives clues for the other person to guess. Clues are in the form of a word follwed by a number e.g. animal 2, which means the spymaster wants their team to look for 2 words related to animals. The words are laid out in a 5 X 5 grid, and each time you identify a word correctly, it is marked with your team's colour. But if you guess wrong, you could uncover the opponent's words, or neutral words, or worse, the assasin which results in an instant loss for your team. 

The game can be played as a party game, as a filler or a serious game where you want to give the best clues. It's fun and educational at the same time. For instance, one word I had to give a clue to was a platypus, but someone told me afterwards it was the only mammal that lays eggs.

Got a chance to play this and even though I don't think I'll need it for my collection since there will be other games I'd rather play more for this particular mood such as Mafia De Cuba, Spyfall etc. I think the fact is this is a wonderful party game that I would rather play instead of monikers or Cranium if I'm going to compare it to other team based party games that many people can play. Excellent game. Vlaada hits it out of the park again. A down side is that the tension can almost be "too high" for how light it is. It's hard to explain but weirdly, it's a game that is easy for people to take too seriously too easily.

Fun when you can play competitively with a decent-sized group. Easy to explain even to non-gamers, simple game flow, but challenging for the spymasters. The main downside is that the game can grind to a halt while the spymasters are trying to figure out good clues.

The included co-op variant isn't really worth it. If you have 2-4 players and want to play co-op, get Codenames Duet instead.

I dislike how much downtime there is even when Im the one being codegiver. Its also a little luck based if the clues match up and sometimes theres no true linking word that everyone would follow. It has hig replay at least but not sure im a fan of the distribution/semi luck and chance of the clues. I think there are better thought provoking party games, though this one is enjoyable for itsclever word moments.

Replayed and yeah. Def too much downtime as clue giver and a bit much luck in the card flop. Clue giving is eh, and it just depends a lot on what you're dealt. I prefer other party gameslike Concept or Telestration or just big multiplayer games like Ricochet Robot or Resistance.

It’s often a little too easy to bend and stretch the rules of Codenames in a way that undermines its integrity as a team-based competition, so it’s perhaps better evaluated on its merits as a low-investment party game. That said, the consistently tenuous connections generated by clue masters provokes both elaborate mental gymnastics and raucaus laughter, making for a very satisfying passtime. 

Approved.

[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b] This game is incredibly easy to teach, and quick enough that people won't dislike it based on length and complexity. 

[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b] The inclusion of the assassin was essential. It adds intensity to the game beyond worrying about choosing the other teams agents. Because of the way the game is set up, and the way the spymasters cards are plentiful and can be rotated in any way, and also that customizing this game is incredibly easy,  the replayability of this game is infinite.

[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b] This game is incredibly easy to find for a good price. Short of an apocalyptic event, this game will remain in print for a long, long time.

[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b] This game can often times be funny. You can give the perfect clue, and your group of friends will twist that clue into something that you did not intend at all if they don't know where you were going. I've also had times where absolutely no clue I've givens should've pointed to the assassin, but if anything could find a way to bastardize your intentions, it's a group of your friends.

[b][COLOR=#FF0033]Con:[/COLOR][/b] If I were to nitpick, sometimes the cards one team has are easier to link than cards another team has. But, considering how quickly a round (or even the entire game) ends makes this "flaw" very insignificant.



[i][COLOR=#33CCFF]Final thoughts:[/COLOR]  Because of the extreme accessibility of this game, plus the nearly infinite amount of replay ability value, plus the additional expansions like code names pictures that could be mixed into the base game with no major issue... It's just fantastic. It's enjoyable for people of all ages, and I feel like any type of gamer could enjoy it. Even when your friends connect completely different words than you expect, it can still be fun to see them work out what clues they think you're giving.                [/i]

Codenames is Taboo with a spatial element, there is really nothing more to it. The Spy theme is completely tacked on. Codenames is not great, but its not bad, which actually ranks it as my favorite Vlaada game.

Game play changes significantly with more than 4 players as negotiation is needed for a decision by the guessers.

I used to spend hours perfecting my cryptic crossword fu, thanks to [i]The Atlantic Monthly[/i] Puzzlers, e.g., "Big Five Cup, presented without introductions, for uncle (1, 4, 2)" or "Blue moo (3)," the latter of which perfectly demonstrates the double definition (LOW). And then there was that period when I played Scrabulous on facebook with Adam Feldman, only every play required a corresponding cryptic clue (FRUIT: flesh fag (5); FRUITS: roiling surf, it yields flowers (6)). So naturally a game of reverse double/triple (the as-yet-unachieved quad/quint/sext/sept/oct/non) definition is in my wheelhouse, both skills- and interest-wise.

Loved it first time I ever played... but later realised that OH MY GOD it is so slow! The AP in this game is on another level.

Great team game for family gatherings as even non-gamers will probably like it, especially if they like more popular word games such as Scrabble or crosswords. Works fine with 4 but probably better with 6+ as it breaks the silence rather than just having 1 person thinking silently to themselves.

RATING: 8.2
The quality of the components is average. The sand timer was broken and the cardstock is not great. It should not be a problem because the cards will not sustain heavy use.

Codenames is a word association game not related in any way to spies. The rules are very, very simple, and the setup is fast. You will be playing 5 minutes after opening the box. And you will have fun. Because it plays out better than expected when you read the rules.

There's a couple of issues with Codenames:
[b]AP[/b]: There's a risk of serious AP here. Obviously, the more time you think, the more likely you are to come up with better word associations. The sand timer will be a must with certain players.
[b]Catch-up[/b]: If one team fails and chooses a spot belonging to their rivals, it will be almost impossible for them to come back from that. It's not a big issue, because rounds are short.
[b]Clues[/b]: There can be some dissensions about what might constitute a legal clue, and what not. The rulebook already advances some of them.
[b]Rule of silence[/b]: There are many comments or reactions from the clue-givers that can be interpreted as a [n illegal] clue (rightly so). 

None of these issues spoils the fun as long as you don't play in an hyper-competitive way. I personally prefer not enforcing the "rule of silence"; I enjoy more when people laughs and comments on what happens in the game.

It has an unlimited replayability and I think 6 players is the sweet spot. But it works well with 8 too, and although it's not ideal, an uneven number of players (5-7) will work too. I have not tried it,but it might be fine with more or less players too.

Overall, it's a great party game based on a very simple idea. Another masterwork of Vlaada in a new genre for him.

First impression : Good party game. Being Spymaster and giving clues is most fun but trying to figure out clues is not boring either. Fast to play and usually is being played several games in a row. Only real "problem" is initial time it takes for spymaster to figure out 5x5 board and which cards there are, which clues can be given and NOT given.

Party game più gradevole del previsto. Si tratta di indovinare i sospetti grazie alle indicazioni del compagno di squadra. Gioco che può ricordare Taboo ma che personalmente trovo più bello e ben strutturato. Consiglio di non utilizzare la clessidra per non stressare le squadre in un gioco che è, e deve rimanere, leggero. Al tempo stesso consiglio il buon senso ai pensatori troppo fini. Il gioco è risultato essere il party game più giocato alle mie latitudini tra la fine del 2015 e l'inizio del 2016 minacciando la leadership di Avalon.

Can be tough (and intimidating) to be the "spymaster" coming up with the clues for your team, but really enjoyable. Like games like Dixit, it helps a lot to know the people you are playing with well. One game turned out to be just "1" clues every turn which was slow and boring, but that's not common. Also played this with Codenames: Pictures combined - still fun.

I love it when party games work on some level of insider jokes or knowledge and you have to actually think about the person you're playing with and this game delivers on that. It's also just one of those games that impresses with its simplicity and for some reason despite all of his games being so different from each other you can somehow still "feel" Vlaada's style in this one.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Somehow I haven't played this again even though it seems to be everywhere. I'm not sure if it is the game itself or my general feelings towards party games. I'd much rather play a filler than party game so I've yet to play Codenames again. I wouldn't refuse to play, but I'm not seeking it out either. That said I did enjoy my one session playing and wouldn't mind trying it again. I'm just doubtful it would ever beat out Diamant, Cockroach Poker or Camel Up when we game with our extended family.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Both of my plays were with 2 and I had a blast. I definitely think 4 or 6 would be the sweet spot for me. It can definitely induce some AP, especially when the board is fresh and you have to look at everything to make sure your clues aren't too broad. I could see busting this out with our extended family, but since those opportunities are infrequent I still would rather play games like Camel Up, Cash n' Guns, Diamant or Cockroach Poker. I also think this would be a tough game for kids, especially if they were giving the clues (who knows though maybe I'm completely wrong about that).

As of now definitely a game I'd enjoy playing again, but probably not one I'll add to my collection anytime soon (although I am curious what my wife would think of it as a 2p game).[/i]

Great game. We have some funny stories already about this for example. The clue was "Body" and our friend's daughter could not contain herself and immediately touched the card labeled "Hole." Touching a card is like giving your final answer. The best part is that hole was the Assassin card causing her team to immediately lose, but hey maybe it was worth it to make a butt hole joke? Also wife had an amazing turn where her clue was "Titantic" and on the board there happened to be  the words "Jack" and "Rose" along with "Ship" and I think maybe "Atlantic" that was the first successful 4 card turn we had seen.

Password 2.0! One of the best party games that plays well with any number, even two players! The best part about this game is that you can even do an easy DIY version yourself and take it everywhere. It's a very clever word-association game that everyone can be involved in. The hardest part about the game is the codemaster keeping a straight face and never giving more information than their clue. Great game and wonderful to play anywhere!

Engaging enough to get lots of replay, but lots of downtime if you want it played well. Trying to find a clue that that your team will associate with as many of your cards as possible, but none of the opponents, and certainly not the insta-death card, is pure downtime for everyone else, so hope that they and the other team are friends and can chat among themselves while it gets worked out. But that is also the source of enjoyment and satisfaction that the game offers, when your teammates correctly associate a given clue with more than just a word or two. It's more of a thinker filler than a fun filler, but it has its place and it's generated itself a ton of replay.

"Party game, sort of. It's like a party game for nerdy people who find brainburners to be fun."

What I like:
- The game design is incredibly clever
- Everyone else seems to love it
- It plays reasonably quickly, and makes you think
- The co-op mode is a nice touch

What I don't like:
- I would rather play a non-party game
- Co-op mode is OK but not great
- A lot of the rules are fuzzy, left up to the group
- Clue-givers have to be completely flat, which reduces the fun factor

At 2-5p, I would rather play it as a co-op; at 6 or more, I prefer it with teams. It's best with 3-4 or 6+. It's a title I have to own because it serves a purpose, but I will never suggest it. 

I'm not a Vlaada fan, but this is definitely one of his best games.

A clever game of giving one-word clues to help your team find their agents.

Very clever as always by Vlaada!

Compared to Dixit I love the team mode. There is not enough team play in board gaming. (I don't count co-op's. Only team versus team can keep me interested)

Everyone will get it after you play a few rounds.

The only negative I found is the lack of artwork in the game.

This is an absolutely fantastic party game, with near-infinite replayability!  As spymaster, trying to come up with the perfect clue that will not connect to anything the opposing team has (or, worse yet, the assassin) is quite a difficult puzzle, which gets slightly easier as the game goes on.  As a generic team member, trying to figure out what your spymaster had in mind for a clue in particular was also a delicious puzzle in many cases.  This is as perfect a party game as you'll ever find.

Another quick party game and there are a few good ones but many of these I can't stand. Codenames on the other hand is a blast to play. A simple mechanic where one code master gives a hint and number to indicate how many cards match that hint, then the players must try to determine which of the face up cards the code master is trying to get you to pick out as there is a set of words that need to be selected to win. The table talk is great as people get on strange tangents to get the hint to match the clues. The game is quick to learn and really interactive and just a blast to play.

RATING: 9
Extraordinarily solid party game.  The only reason I rate it a 9 rather than a 10 is that the enjoyment level is surprisingly dependent on whether you're a spymaster or not, and whether the spymasters are any good.  If they're hyper-conservative and only do 1-of clues most of the time, the game is quite dull.  That said, I still think it's fantastic, it's just a little more dependent on the quality/ability of players than I'd personally like.

Codenames is a pretty clever word association-style party game. Players are separated into teams consisting of one clue-giver and a number of guessers. The clue-giver comes up with a word that will allow his team to guess as many of their team's words on the board as possible without hitting an opponent's word. My main complaint with the game is that it seems way more fun to be a clue-giver than a guesser. Despite this, it's an interesting take on the party game genre that we haven't really seen before. 

(5+ plays)

I'm utterly baffled as to how this game has been rated so highly. It's relentlessly boring. Long do-nothing waits while the clue-givers decide on a word, long do-nothing waits while the other team chooses their word. A canonical example of a game that's playtime is characterized more by non-play than play.

For a game I went into expecting to just kind of like it, I loved it. The rules, while not hard, are difficult to explain without playing a game of it first. You have one person per side trying to give clues to the other players on their side. They want to get all their words chosen before the other team. The trick is, you can only use 1 word and you have to avoid the assassin word which will instantly lose you the game.

If I owned this, Wits and Wagers and Telestrations, I doubt I'd ever have to buy another party game again. Doesn't replace a gamer party game, but man is this game good with everyone.

It's a good party game, I suppose, but not one I enjoy.
Part of this was because we (Dutch players) played with an English set, and not all players were familiar with all words.

But it doesn't work in Dutch, where it's too easy to create compound words that refer to multiple cards.

Guessing and discussing a clever clue is fun, silent downtime while waiting for the clue is not. Theme is nonexistent. The restrictive rules for clue givers lead to almost no social interaction between guessers and clue givers and thus take the tempo and cheer down and just make the game lacking in the fun department.

I don't really see this as a party game. It can work with big groups, but don't expect people to shout and laugh excitingly. Its really good though! It can be thinky but in a different way than most "serious" games, while still being accessible for everybody.

This is a very fun, quick game. I enjoy this most with 3 players, even though it's supposed to be played with teams of 4, 6 or 8. I enjoy one person being the one guessing the words, who is working with both players who are competing head to head. I brushed off this game a few times expecting it to be another party game which I was kind of done with for awhile, but this is one of the most fun party games I've played and I'd now recommend it.

Very fun and quick party game.  It has a neat mechanism to convey clues with also possibly helping the other team.  It seemed quick to setup, teach, and play, so a great play for any crowd.

It can be dull if the clue giver is giving one guess clues.  One needs good word skills to play.

Deduction party game that can be a real brain burner and have some actual game play rather than just be a group activity.  It's a workout for your brain to play this.

We have really enjoyed this and has been a surprise hit.

Edit: Played this some more and have come to realize that you need to play this with the right group of people. We have had this game completely fall flat for some. It was just too boring and slow for some even with the egg timer in play for both spymasters and guessers.

These experiences have hurt the game a bit for us and have caused me to lower the score a point. It's a cerebral game that takes some patience. Not a good game to play when tired from the day. People probably need to be into word games and abstraction.

That said it is still one of the better party games available but, some people are going to prefer werewolf over this (which in turn I personally hate). Understand your audience before introducing this game. 

This game is hard enough for adults. I really doubt those under 14 can be good at this game. Also found that people who have a hard time with abstract concepts and symbolic connections really struggle with this game as clues often require some less than literal thinking. In order to really succeed at the game you need to get 2 guesses per turn on average correct and that requires some outside the box thinking. Not everyone is cut out for that.

This game has taught me that some people are really literal thinkers that have a hard time making conceptual abstract connections. It may seem obvious to some but it really isn't to others. Part of the game is understanding how people think and adapting to it.

Always use the timer. Otherwise people will take ages to come up with clues or make guesses.

Finally cracked this open, as it's been sitting on my shelves in shrink since we bought it waiting for a family game night to take it for a spin.  My wife and I wanted to try it out, so we played a couple of two player games, each taking a turn at being the spymaster.  It was more fun than I thought.  A decent word game.  It is not as easy as it can look, trying to come up with a word that works as a clue for as many words as you can, especially in the two player variant (I know it is not the ideal way to play but we went with what we had) where you are trying to clear your words with as many enemies as possible still on the board.  I can see where this will be a lot of fun in its intended setting:  a large group, or when we take it to family game night and the whole family is playing.

As I expected, it went over like gangbusters with my family, so much that I think I may give this copy to my sister as a little gift.  She loves it and while I think it is a decent game, I really do not understand the hype behind it and would not miss it.

**EDIT:   Traded away in my very first Math Trade.

This game is so-so to us and does not seem to be a good party game as it is too slow (waiting for clue givers). Maybe we are not creative enough or good at word associations as we struggle giving clues that work for more than 1 or 2 words.

There is a reason that this game has won so many awards.  It is extremely simple ... almost too simple ("hasn't this been done before"?).  Yet this is the game that my gaming groups request the most.  Great team against team game of making connections between cards on the table - the more right answers you get on your turn, the closer to winning you will be.  It is easily accessed by people who don't play games.  Everyone I know that has played, loves it.

The rules are simple but the game has enough variation to keep me playing again and again. As one of the clue-givers, you get a bit of a mental workout - which I like, as you try to link as many of your team's words as you can in an attempt to get them to guess them all before your opposite number does that for his or her team. I personally prefer to play without the timer, although sometimes it is a good idea (and more tense if you do) if you're playing against a clue-giver who you may feel is taking too much time on their turn. As I said above, there is so much variation. This is because there are so many different card combinations available. This is just a really great game.

One of the hit games of 2015. This is now my first-choice gateway game for introducing to non-gamers. I have now played it as a gateway game with dozens of non-gamers and almost all are hooked and tell me they are going to buy a copy to play with their friends and family. Several find it such a revelation that I get begged to recommend other games they should try. Unlike most 'word' games (eg: Scrabble), it requires some actual understanding of the words. It is quick to teach and learn. Main problem is that the 25-word starting grid makes for an often painfully slow start, with the Spymasters having initially to take a lot in. The game has endless possibilities for development: it is easy to add your own words, and it can be used as an educational tool for language learners by slipping in foreign vocabulary. I have also been experimenting with variants to appeal to wider audiences; for example, you can play with movie buffs by demanding that all clues must be movie titles.

Among 'expansions' for this game, I have a Bonus Pack of cards (EN01) that was a promo in Spielbox 01/17. The Bonus Pack is subtitled 'Board Gaming' but it is playable because the words aren't titles and authors of board games (as in an earlier largely useless expansion) but words with a gaming association (like Euro and Family).

Plays really fast and it is simple to explain. I liked it very much but then everyone wanted to play it... I played it so much, so so so much that it started to get a bit tiresome. 

But sometimes I have guests and I really want to play Codenames, and when I do I enjoy it.

It is clever, and it has the advantage of making people feel clever. I've done some incredible links between words and watched how some people do some amazing ones also.

Played this with a random group of strangers and it was OK.  If I played this with friends it would probably shoot up to a 9

So I finally got the opportunity to play this game with friends, and it was amazing!  Pulled this out during Friendsgiving and by the end of the night everyone was playing it.  I was really surprised because Beer Pong usually is the game that dominates when we have people over, but due to the lack of an available table (from all of the food) we tried this out instead and it wouldn't shock me if some of my friends would prefer to play this over Beer Pong.  Which is saying alot because these are ex-college people in there mid-20's feeling this way.

Played this again during New Years and there was an available Pong table so this game had direct competition.  This still had more players throughout the night than the Pong table and this is in the same setting as the Friendsgiving party (very competitive Pong players).  Best party game by a long shot.

I finally got to play this game! Due to all the buzz around this game, the game has been sold out during the Holiday seasons last year. 

I knew all the rules before jumping into the game at my local board game meetup and it surely didn't disappoint. 

Code-masters are the key to victory. Its a very silent party game where everyone is making fizzy sounds with their brain while thinking very hard at vocabularies.

Too bad my family members are not equal in terms of English vocabulary skills and I don't think this can be played with giving clues in Chinese.

This will fizzle out: I was really surprised at how disappointed I was after I played it. 

If I hadn't know it was by a reputable designer like Vlaada beforehand, that would have been a jaw-dropping revelation afterwards. I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised if this had been just another nameless Hasbro-style party game. 

The game can grind to a halt if a spymaster isn't well suited to clue engineering. And unbalanced teams in terms of innate abilities gives that team a significant advantage. Both of these can be avoided if players are divided into teams in the right way, and certain players are not made to be the spymaster. And because it's a short game, these aren't super-problems. But even with really smart/clever spymasters, getting clues that could point to 3 or more words proved really difficult, which also makes the game quite slow (for what it is). 

Party games are different than other kinds of games for sure. But there are a lot of fun ones out there already, and this one only stands out because it's new. I don't mean to be harsh, but this will fade. Some groups of people will love it -- which is great! -- but there certainly isn't anything special or amazing about it. In a word: forgettable.

Played once. Too much downtime because you're waiting often for the other team or your spymaster or your spies to think. Prone to analysis paralysis as you try to figure out the largest combination of words that can be covered by one word that doesn't lead to the remaining words. Relatively dry and no theme. How this game is better ranked than many other really fun party games that engage all/most players all the time is beyond me.

In playing Codenames, at the back of my mind, I'm thinking BGG needs to broaden their categories to move this '#1 Party Game' to '#1 Word Game' as the game is AP inducing and I have to remind myself that I too should use the sand timer otherwise it just isn't that FUN. 
In fact using the sand timer and putting pressure has more chance of evoking head slapping moments, which should be hilarious so long as competition isn't fierce and it isn't team mates that are doing the head slapping or finger pointing. 

Otherwise this is a very good, tense, engaging word game, with some theme at least but really good in that it is challenging to 'network' popular perceived meanings associated with the words on display, and it doesn't suffer the mastery effect like in Taboo whereby getting good at avoiding taboo words takes away the fun, because there is little promise in Codenames of GIGGLES or BELLY LAUGHS which I think is the defining factors to get the label 'party game'.

Adott két kémcsapat egy-egy kémfőnökkel, akik egy 5x5 szavas hálóról a kódkártya alapján próbálják a lehető legtöbb saját kártyát megtalálni.
Mondjunk erre egy példát: mondjuk a piros csapat szavai többek közt a következők: New York, Las Vegas, mókus és hal. A kémfőnök azt mondja az első körben, hogy Amerika 2 (a 2 arra utal, hogy két jelölést vár), majd a következő körben azt, hogy állat 2.
A buktató ott van, ha a másik csapat szavai közt van pl. hód, vagy Rock 'n Roll, vagy hamburger.

Elsőre könnyűnek tűnik a játék, de valójában tud izzasztó perceket okozni!

Plays quick and easy and with family.  I have found this more enjoyable with more than 4 as it is always interesting to hear multiple teammates try to determine to what cards you clue applies.  

the best part is when there are those agonizingly frustrating moments  when your teammates are on the correct path with their guesses and then talk themselves out of the correct card.  Infuriatingly fun.

This is a brilliant little game. It looks so simple and is easy to explain, but becomes tough when you find out just how differently your brain works to your friends'. So many times I've given a seemingly watertight clue, only to have my team go for something completely random! Highly recommended and very replayable. 

The only disadvantage is that there can be a bit of a wait if someone's struggling to think of a clue, but the game comes with an optional hourglass for that very reason...
 
Someone suggested replacing the word cards with Dixit or Once Upon A Time for an extra challenge: will have to try that out soon.

I sort of like being the spymaster, so I can feel momentarily clever when I find a wordchain that can hit four things, but the downtime is long and being the guesser isn't very exciting.

An excellent party game; easy to learn and play, but with enough tension to please even the most hardened gamers.  Plays quickly, has terrific interaction, and high quality components.  Codenames is $20 very well spent.  Highly recommended.

The only reason I haven't given this a 10 is because I'm biased against party games and it would feel somehow wrong to put this in the same category as a giant like Agricola. However, incredible design, near infinite replayability, cross generational fun. Absolutely deserved the Spiel.

A modern classic! Great with friends, great with family, just great. Encourages lateral thinking, being creative while being careful to not be *too* creative, while understanding how the other players think. A large vocabulary can seem like an advantage as you can draw connections between words more readily, but is it? What if your teammates can't follow your reasoning?

Zuerst war ich sehr skeptisch, weil Codenames für mich wie ein unterdurchschnittliches Partyspiel aussah und ich Deduktionsspielen wie Tabu oder Activity rein gar nichts abgewinnen kann. Dieses Spiel ist allerdings anders und erreicht trotz der absurd simplen Regeln (oder gerade deshalb) jede Gruppe. Haben dieses Spiel bisher mit den unterschiedlichsten Truppen gespielt und hatten bei angemessener Spieleranzahl immer ein tolles, kurzes Spiel für zwischendurch, bei dem wir es nie bei einer Runde belassen konnten. Einziges Mankel: in nicht ganz entspannten Gruppen können die kleinsten Reaktionen innerhalb des Teams als Schummeln gesehen werden- macht uns den Spielspaß zwar nicht kaputt, führt aber doch zu ein paar Diskussionen.

From the moment I read about it, I knew I was going to love it; it tickles the same part of my brain that loves cryptic crosswords. My wife likes it as a 2p co-op and my group have been enjoying the team game. I wouldn't call it a party game though - it's pretty thinky, there can be quite a bit of downtime and it's not laugh-out-loud funny.

A fun word/party game that is easy to teach. The two different roles (spymaster and spy) feel very different, and both feel like you're really stretching your understanding of the words and your teammates the whole time. It can be very satisfying to successfully get a big clue, and it can be funny for both teams when someone fails. Because of the way the game works, you seldom have those annoying word-game situations where people are arguing over whether a word is valid or not. When the round ends, people always want to talk about the game, like "What were you thinking when you gave that clue?". That's the sign of a good game that is engaging the players.

Codenames is a two-team game that features wordplay. A 5x5 tableau of cards is layed out, each card consisting of a word (except sometimes there are two words, like ice cream). One player for each team is the spymaster, and has access to a hidden tableau showing which words correspond to that team's agents. The spymasters take turns giving clues, consisting of a single word (which relates to some number of words on the table) and the number of words that correspond to that clue word. The other players on the team then have to choose (by physically touching the word card) which cards they think are their agents. If they're correct, the card is covered with an agent tile of the correct color, otherwise, their turn ends because they've found a non-agent, an agent of the other team, or the sole assassin which autowins the game for the other player. Players must choose at least one card each turn, but may choose a number of cards equal to the number the spymaster gave them plus one. This allows for them to use this extra pick to snatch up cards that they missed out on in earlier turns. First team to find all their agents wins.

So. This is a game where the spymasters have to come up with word association, and then hope that this word association conveys itself properly to the lesser members of their team. So in essence, this is a word game that could be softly compared to games like Taboo, Train of Thought, and even Dixit in some ways, as the subtext of the word association can often be as helpful or hindering as the obvious associations.

But all I can think about is how this games design, mechanically, at its core... feels... obvious.

Saying that a game feels obvious makes ME feel like I'm that one obnoxiously pretentious panelist on a celebrity reality cooking show. I know. I'm so sorry. 

But if you recall, I compared this game to games like Taboo, or Train of Thought, or other types of word puzzle games. Because that's what this game is. The physical game is just a big random word generator, and random tableaus. The actual game emerges when you tell us to do word association. Dixit in many ways does a similar thing but with the tableau of words being a tableau of avant-garde pictures (I don't actually know what avant-garde means, so sorry for that oblique description), and with that game I love the art more than I love the game (which goes to say something considering my usually low opinion of art; in truth I just like pictures of things that are pleasant, which is why I'm so disappointed the ants battling on a pile of coins is not a picture ants battling on a pile of flapjacks). I don't think this is a bad game. I don't think it's a lazy game. But I think it is an obvious game. It's a game of word association. It's put together neatly, and does what it does well, but what it does is word association.

Codenames is a word game. There are lots of well known, and well ranked word games out there. But think about the places where you play word games, and think about the places you play other types of hobby games. There is certainly overlap, but they are not the same.

A quick and clever party/word association game. Think of it as team password, and the shared word tableau forces the guess giver to come up with something that leads to his teams words while avoiding the opponents words. To me part ot the fun of the game is reviewing some clues versus answers to see how off people can be. It can appeal to a wide variety of people.

RATING: 6.5
Another one of those quick games that just get replayed a lot. This is going to be a classic and as such I just can't take much away from it. It's not my favorite game to play, but I do have to rate it highly.

UPDATE 10/12/17: Okay I lowered the rating from an 8 to 6.5 I know it's a big drop. I think BGG ratings are supposed to be more personal I generally try to go by the actual criteria listed for BGG ratings. Generally I like to play any strategy game over Codenames. I even like games like Sushi Go! over Codenames because Sushi Go is a game about decision making rather than about word knowledge and connections between people. It's not that I don't like Codenames, its just that personally I have a much bigger itch for strategy games. If I have an opportunity to play a game, I'd much rather it be a strategy game because I just don't get the opportunity to play strategy games that often. If I were to try to rate Codenames objectively, I'd rate it a 9 or 10 game. I think it's a classic and a great game objectively. Subjectively every time our group chooses to play this game I am really disappointed. 

Also I think Codenames Pictures is the better game. Its more lighthearted fun and people don't take it as seriously. Which is better because honestly Codenames is not supposed to be a serious game.

A great idea that - like so many games of its kind - only work with the right group, because it is easy to just "break" the intention of the game, i.e. coming up with weird Codenames, by just using words for single cards instead of trying to come up with some bizarre hint.

RATING: 8
Pros:
* Inexpensive
* Plays very well as a 2-player co-op.
* Quick setup
* The components aren't handled so it's a fine game to play with food/drinks.
* Tense and fun

Neutral:
* The cards aren't handled and they don't need to be shuffled so I haven't felt compelled to sleeve the game (which is good because there were 200 cards!)
* Seems ripe for a digital implementation.
* I suppose there could be some boring downtime if you're sitting around waiting for the spymaster to come up with a clue. For our 2p plays, we like to give the spymaster unlimited time and the operative just wanders off for a bit. This is a very unusual game in that this sort of "go find something to do while I take my turn" would normally be a "con" but we put it in the "pro" column because it gives us a game we can play while we're making dinner or cleaning the house.


= 2016-01-02 - R:8 (co-op), R:? (multi-player)

Really liking this one as a 2-player co-op. We like to play while we're doing other projects. The spymaster makes up a clue and then goes back to preparing the soup. The operative guesses and then goes back to doing dishes. No "downtime" :)

 Sometimes the words come up in such a way that we can't figure out clever/interesting connections between them and the game gets kind of dull, but then you just try something crazy, win or lose and try again.

I rarely feel this way, but I think I'd rather play this on a tablet/phone if given the choice.

As of two days ago, we've played this 12 times. Starting out at 8 for the co-op game. I suspect this rating will go up once we've tried it multi-player.

June 2017: Introduced this to a group of non-gamers and they all LOVED it. We improvised the game by drawing a 5x5 grid and filling them with words of our choice (which enabled us to use words you'd never, ever find in the published game) and the Codewords Gadget app. The clue-givers also wrote out their words on a separate sheet of paper (which was shared between them).

This, to me, is the equivalent of a Marvel movie. I could simply shut my brain off while playing and enjoy the ride.

As a party game, there are still two big issues for me:
1. The cross-referencing issue of finding your team's words on the grid -- but we solved this by letting the clue gives write their words in a list so that they don't ever need to look at the app again. Probably not in the spirit of the game, but they wouldn't have it any other way.
2. The downtime -- but my friends LOVE this as they tend to chat during the other team's turn.

March 2017: Really fiddly party game! As the clue giver, I wasn't willing to constantly cross-reference the private grid and the grid of words. So, I wrote down my words, the opposing team's words, and the "taboo" word. That made my turns incredibly fast as I can think of the next clue during the opposing team's turn.

But then, I'm hardly paying attention to the opposing team. So if I were playing according to the spirit of the game, there would be a lot of downtime!

Really solid party game.  Plays quickly with as many people as you want - and they can drop in and out as they wish.  Gets a little mind bendy for the person giving the clues, but a really great game, especially for $20.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Pros:
1. Interesting. The clues that people come up with to connect words are amazing. There's always 1 clue where everyone is impressed. And there's always 1 clue where everyone is saying "Why the hell would you think that?". Either way, you end up with a great story.
2. Everyone Loves It. I have yet to play with people who did not like this game. Gamers love it. Family members love it. Non-gamers love it. It's just fun no matter what.
3. Replayability. There are a lot of word cards and each one is double sided. Not to mention the cards can be rearranged causing a whole new game with different clues. The base game can be played over and over, but you can easily add your own word cards if you wish.

Cons:
1. Silence. The clue giver can sometimes take a very long time trying to think up clues. They do provide you with a timer if this becomes an issue, but there are long bouts of silence if people are not good at thinking quickly on their feet.

Summary: This game is a must add to your collection. It is perfect for family holidays. I love using this game to wrap up or open up a gaming night. It plays fast, teaches easy and leads to lots of fun.

RATING: 8.5
I think this game is great and is probably best with larger player counts. We tend to only have 3 or 4 so it doesn't make it to the table as much as I'd like. I could see this game playing better with certain groups vs. others based on knowledge level and creativity. Certain clues are not going to be understood by certain age groups and players with a larger vocabulary will have an advantage when guessing but also possibly a disadvantage when giving clues. I'm still looking forward to trying this with Dixit cards instead of the words because we are big fans of Dixit.

First of all this was a game given to my wife BUT it is making my collection list anyway! So I am not a huge party game fan usually...but this one hits the spot...from the challenge for the spymaster of making connections between what initially looks like impossible to link words to then hoping that your operatives are on the same wavelength to the deadly mistake of getting them to pick the assassin... this game has it all.

The best party game ever made. Period.

An instant hit in our group - everybody who tried it, loved it. To the point we started the evening with "Codenames" and, several hours later, ended it with "Codenames" (with nothing else in between). So why does it play so well? It's simple and fun (and often even funny), but at the same time very thinky, at least for this genre of games. And when you're trying to guess all the cards, there are no bad answers, really. Heck, you can play it strategically, if you want to! Risk a bit more when you're chasing the score or play safe when you're on the lead. This is sure to be a classic. Cannot recommend highly enough.

It has the mental exercise of taboo with the added thinkyness of a crossword puzzle and I freakin' love it!

It is also nice that it encourages the spymaster to come up with clues that are well understood by the masses and the spies to understand various references. That keeps it balanced.

Quite a good game. It requires rather complex associative thinking to play well. Easy to learn. Outstanding game to play with novice gamers. (Initial review: June 5, 2017) Rated the game down half a point as the game is less satisfying when you don't have exactly 4 players.

THE SILENT PARTY-GAME! :)
I truly love this game but I would hesitate to call it a partygame. What happenes usually is that the spymaster is desperately thinking about clues when it is his turn, the party aspect only enters during the opponents' turn. While your team is guessing you have to be silent but it's ok, since you are silently cursing them and thinking they are stupid due to their inability to see the BIG PICTURE. How they cannot see the hidden connection between those words??? How they ended up guessing words which clearly had nothing to do with your clues??
The playcer count is practically unlimited, and the more are in a team, the more chaos it ensures. FUN - FUN - FUN! And this praise is from a serious eurogamer, who was meh with Dixit for example....
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5

It still holds up after +100 plays but it has faded somewhat. I still like it a lot, but no longer actively seek out opportunities to play it.

Such a simple concept executed just perfectly. The unique way the cards are laid out and compared to other words seems to make infinite replay value, especially when players switch off who is giving the dlues. Fun to see how other people's minds connect the dots. Party game of the year!

my first online play was very nice, so I bought the copy.

but it's turn out to be good with the right group.

Codenames adds a different type of game to my collection.  I'm more of a math type of guy and like games with theme - especially those where you build something (a city, an empire, a business, etc).  Now along comes Codenames that, the first time I saw it, seemed like a party game.  As a general rule, I'm not that in to party games ("Not that there's anything wrong with that.") but it's getting a lot of love around here so I figure I'll give it a try.  And you know what, I like it.

Why?  First, I am enjoying the logic puzzle of trying to communicate something to another person that makes them select certain words and not others.  I like trying to decide how to modify my clues depending on my partner (my wife, my 12 year old son, a friend in her early fifties).  All of these people have very different backgrounds and life experiences which make them interpret clues differently, so it's fun for me to try and customize my clues.  An example of me not doing a good job of this was using a clue of "Flash :2".  I was counting on the 17 year old I was playing with getting "Bolt" which he did, but he totally didn't get "Dance".  Being in my 40's and growing up in the 80's, most people had heard of the movie "Flash Dance" in my circle of friends.  After he failed to make that connection, I realized I had projected myself onto an 18 year old - one that was too young to have heard of the movie "Flashdance".  Doh.

I digress.  I will finish by saying that Codenames is a game that, in my experience, has broad appeal with its short running time and ease of understanding.  It's a game that I can play with people not typically in my gaming circle - my parents or other non gamer friends seem not to be intimidated by it.  Gaming with more people?  That's a win in my book.

RATING: 8.405
I agree with the consensus opinion that this is the best party game designed so far.

But you need people who are willing to have some discipline in how they play the game.  If the clue giver gives too many non-verbal signals (shaking his head "no", rolling his eyes, etc...) it can ruin the game.  But it's really a good simple game that get you thinking.

We played New Year's Eve 2015....and people were extremely engaged.....out of their chairs to get a better look at the words, etc...

Took it to a Christmas work party in 2016 and introduced it to a table of people.  Again it was a big hit.

Great discussion after each round as people are clarifying what people meant with each clue.

RATING: N/A
Description: A light word guessing, deduction, association party game, with two spymasters and their teams outsmarting each other.
Players: 4 to 8. Best with two teams of 3.

Impression: One of the best party games where two spymasters have the key to the 5 by 5 grid of different words and are trying to lead their teams to correctly guess only those words containing code names of their color. They are doing that by saying just one world not present on the board, and one number which is the number of associated words +1. Spymaster must be careful not to give a clue that is too close to a word of opposite color, or even worse, to a single assassin tile. I love this game for it reminds me of my favorite simple party game of Associations (Time's Up) which evokes similar feeling and scratches the same itch. Sometimes, it can cause analysis paralysis for a spymaster bringing a game to a stall, but the game comes with the hourglass to help in these situations. There is a little bit of luck involved as well, especially when you are a spymaster and have words like Robin, Hood, Arrow and Bandit.

Likes: That rewording feeling when your team successfully connects five tiles with one word. Number of possible girds, words and combinations offering huge replayability. Hilarious misunderstanding of some associations and/or ideas. 

Dislikes: Analysis paralysis. Too much silence for a party game. Feeling repetitive after 100 games.

This game can be fun with the right group and spy master.  I end up playing the spy master, which is a difficult job.  I tend to shy away from the game sometimes just knowing I'm going to have to do so much work.

It's fun though.  When we do play, it's always a great time.

Good word-game for gamers. It is funny how sometimes rahter vague associations are true for different people.

In the last  few moves, you can often give some hints for only one word, such that the tension rather decreases at the end, which is a minor let-down.  It can get a bit lengthy, if the hint-giver needs  to long to find a good hint. You should definitely use a timer then.

Jogo interessante, bastante original, apenas com ligeiro parentesco com o "Quem é Quem?!"

Não é cooperativo, mas tem igual capacidade para team building, uma vez que é jogado em equipas - duas, sendo também um optimo isco para a captação de novatos. Não faz o meu género, mas reconheço que está muito bem pensado...

I love Vlaada's games in general, but I'm really not into party games. As a result, when I first heard about this game I pretty much mentally passed on it. But I changed my mind in December and bought it - the reasons being that it was really cheap, had got to a ridiculously high number in the BGG rankings (about 30), and after reading a few reviews I decided that this was a game that I could definitely enjoy and might well see some play in our groups.

And I was right. It's been enjoyed by everyone and has been a pretty popular end-of-night game. This will never be a game I consider "great", but it's very good in its place.

I understand the concept of the game. The simplicity of the game is great for a party of players, even new or non-gamers. I guess it is only the players themselves that can let the game down.

So maybe it is the groups of people I have played with that is the issue. I just struggle to see what everyone else loves so much in this game. I think it is an OK game to fill time with, but really little more than that.

My girlfriend absolutely loves this game, so I've promised that I will try it again for her - so possibly to be re-reviewed in future....

6/Nov/15 - After another play, it was slightly better and have improved my score to 5. But still don't see this as anything more than a time-filler.

13/Feb/17 - Having played the picture based version, I find Codenames Pictures is definitely better than the word based game.

Codenames is a good game. It's not a party game however... sure it can accommodate a large group, and the rules are simple, but it's not a party game. People need to engage with it and it is not going to work for everyone.

That said, if people want to call it a party game, fine, but please don't invite me to your parties in that case. If you throw a gaming night together and Codenames is on the roster, then sure I'm your man.

Accessible and innovative.  

Being the master is a lot harder for most people than they initially assume it will be.  The game can become boring when the spymasters are too safe and offer synonyms to existing words only.   

There is also a huge percentage of people who take EXTREMELY long to give a clue.  Even with the timer, it can be painful to wait for them every round.

I rarely enjoy party style games as much as I do this one. Works really well with a variety of different players (gamers and non gamers alike) and is quick to learn and teach. Simply a great time and plays in about 15-20 minutes, so it leaves plenty of time for multiple rounds and switching of teams.

It is amazing that designer Vlaada Chvatil can design some of the greatest heavy games, but also come up with something as clever and base as Codenames.  This is a game that can appeal to such a wide breadth of people (even going past the traditional gaming community).  To me, this is a perfect game -I can't think of one complaint, except that I need to remind myself not to play it too much, lest it lose its charm!

RATING: 6
This is a game that MUST be played in the spirit of the rules.  And the spirit isn't always completely clear.  The formalism has huge gaps that can be exploited to trivially ruin the game.  However, I like games where I can explore the rules and push them to the limit, and I can't do that in a play-by-spirit game without risking accidentally cheating.  So, this dampens my enthusiasm.

In particular, it's highly ambiguous what information you can encode in the number you issue with your clue.

update:  I seem to like this game less each time I play it.  I really enjoy stressing the boundaries of what can be done within a rule system, and such behavior is simply not acceptable in a play-by-the-spirit game, and thus it just doesn't hold my interest after the initial novelty.

this has been my go-to "big group" game for years. not my favorite party game (A Fake Artist Goes to New York) or even my favorite word game (Balderdash), but definitely my best team game. yet, after so many plays i think i'm at the point where i'd rather bring out Love Letter, Monikers, or just drink. heck, if we're at a table anyway then why aren't we playing Murder: Deception in Hong Kong? still, with good portability and a relatively low bar for entry, return on investment for this non-mindless game has been very high. it's a die-hard. someone you know owns this game.

I like Codenames: Pictures more than this original plain text Codenames for 3 reasons:

1. Codenames: Pictures is language independent. That won't matter for many people, but I enjoy playing Codenames Pictures in Esperanto with Esperanto speakers, for example, for example, and I always play it with people who don't all have the same first language (playing the text version is less fun when not everyone understands the language of the word cards similarly well).

2. It neatly sidesteps the occasional debates and disagreements about whether a clue is legal, which come up in most word/clue type games like this and Taboo etc. (E.g. if the word is "science" can you say "scientist"? If the word is "hat" can you say "hate" or "hatch" or "that"? If the word is "car" can you say "chariot"? If the word is "goodness" can you say "badness"? If the word is "Richard" can you say "Dick"? If the word is "I" can you say "me"? etc etc etc.)

3. The cool well done surreal pictures are much more interesting & fun to look at than plain printed text.

RATING: 1.5
Yeah, I don't really get all the hype about this game. I guess part of the problem for me, being a teacher, is that it's too close to ESL educational games/activities I already use, but mainly, I just don't see the actual game in it. It's an interesting puzzle for the cluegiver if you like that sort of thing and a pretty boring co-op discussion for the other players.  Dixit is only ok for me but it's 100x better than Codenames.

Something is wrong with me that I see no redeeming qualities in this "game"? Some of my friends do enjoy it, so I'll give it half a point for getting to see their happiness, but I will avoid spending my gaming time on this trash at all cost.  I've decided I don't like Chvatil's designs no matter where they fall on theme or weight, from Codenames to Galaxy Trucker to Mage Knight.  He strikes out every time.

Codenames is a very popular game where two teams try to get their teameates to guess certain words in a grid that belong to their team.all before the other team guesses their words.  Players gues based on one of their teamates clues, but watch out for the assassin word... this will end the game immediately and cause the other team to win automatically.

Pros:  accomodates large player counts , fun competitive team play, easy rule set easy to teach and play

Cons:  no real depth of gameplay,

"I have also really enjoyed Code Names, such a simple to teach and understand game while still making for such fun thinking and overthinking."

"Codenames is the first party game in a long time that I've enjoyed. It's a perfect filler at game night, and makes sure we always end with laughter. We usually make the new players be the Spymaster first, so everyone gets that initial taste of how hard it is on the other side of the screen, and then they usually want to try again as soon as the first round is over."

Very simple party game that plays a large number of people well. Can be slightly AP inducing, especially for the spymaster in the first turn or two. The different feel of being an agent and a spymaster is nice too, as almost everybody will want to be the spymaster at some point, just to experience that side. I find this game provides just the right amount of "thinkiness" that I like in a party game.

Pfúú...
Többet vártam. A csalódás nem a megfelelő szó.
A játék egyébként jó (főleg, mert bárkivel játszható), de a sikerét nem értem. Illetve inkább a szerző nevének tudom be, mintsem magának a játéknak.
Nagy előnye, hogy akár házilag is bővíthető, kiegészíthető, még szabályokat is találhatunk ki hozzá.
Hátránya, hogy a kártyák kinézetébe nulla energiát fektettek. A tematizáltságot nem teljesen értem...
Az általános listán a TOP20 helyezést nagyon túlzónak tartom, de még a party game 1. helyezéssel sem értek egyet. Egyértelmű, hogy ha ez egy noname szerzőtől jön, akkor elsikkad a "futottak még" kategóriában.
Biztos, hogy sokat lehet vele játszani, de az sem tiszta számomra, hogy 4+ fővel mennyire jó a dolog. (Ez is olyan megerőszakolás szagú nekem.  up: most rápillantva a szavazatokra, 6 fővel előbb ki kellene próbálnom...)
---
Inkább eladtam, mert némán bámulni ezeket a csúnya szókártyákat nem jelentett egy felejthetetlen élményt.

Neither a party game (pretty much void of fun), nor a 'real' game. Finding umbrella terms is work; I have a problem with word games, and this one in particular. The game brings out the worst in me: I start to get mad at my fellow players. This doesn't happen in any other co-op or team game I play - a genre I love and play frequently! I also love the designer, but Codenames is just not for me.

RATING: 8
Nice creative brain-burner (for the clue giver). The selection of mundane words sort of break the theme, and I think they should have playtested the words more to find a slightly better selection. Even though there are 25 words on the board, you only have less than half of them that you must reveal, so the odds of finding two of *your* words which you can give a clue for is much less than the board might suggest, and you may have to veto your choice for a clue because it might fit an opponent's card. If you're ahead in the late game, you can anti-climactically win by giving obvious clues for only one card, rather than needing to give a clue for two cards (which you might not be able to do, anyway, since you have fewer cards to reveal towards the end of the game, and they are unlikely to be similar because you've already revealed the similar cards at the beginning of the game). Otherwise, it's a good party game to wrap up a game night with.

*****

I just have something of a problem with how difficult a clue becomes when you're going from one to two words. It's still an enjoyable challenge, because it's a unique *creative* brain-burner. Perhaps a tighter pool of words that made clues a little easier would help.

The words themselves seem to break the theme a bit. I feel like a contestant on a game show more than a sleuth or spy, unlike many of the other deduction games out there.

I really enjoy this game, yet I doesn't give me a 'party game'-vibe...

Perhaps it's because [thing=38713]Time's Up![/thing] is my benchmark for what a party game should be, due to all the boisterousness and laughter it brings forth with my friends. Codenames doesn't quite provide that same experience, as people tend to get more 'thinky' in this game. It does provide some hilarious moments, though (I'll never forget the time someone started the sandtimer on her husband - and teammate - because he was guessing too slowly).

Finding the best clues to give your teammates is a joyful experience, and Codenames plays great with gamers and non-gamers alike.

The best and freshest party game to come along in a long time. It manages to avoid the pitfalls of these designs in just about every direction. It's not really goofy and so doesn't require someone to make a fool of themselves (not always a bad thing, but limited in its appeal). But neither is it so difficult to grasp that it can only be played by gamers. 

Instead we have the most original and accessible game to come out of the hobby in a long time. This is already becoming a hit in the mainstream market, and will probably go down as the biggest hobby gaming hit since Apples to Apples.

Codenames is a fine game that lots of people can play, but I don't know if it qualifies as a "party game" in the same way that other games in the category do.  I know for sure that there are some parties where I wouldn't expect to be able to pull this game out with any success.  This is fine by me, though, as I'm not a huge fan of party games.

I don't always give 10 star reviews.... but when I do, they are for the game 'Codenames.'

It brings me great joy when a game like this comes along - pretty much universally enjoyed, easy to learn, approachable to a wide range of people, and a perfect blend of fun & strategic.

Pros:
-Brilliant concept, huge satisfaction in giving a great clue (and in correctly guessing!)
-An element of (fun) intensity due to the presence of the assassin word (and the possibility of inadvertently giving clues for an opposing team's words!)
-The occasional opportunity to give a clue that hints at something only your partner will know, or that approaches the word in a particularly innovative way (though I am personally notorious for trying to stretch things TOO far and trying to be TOO aggressive when giving clues...)
-Love that the grid configurations are pretty much endless, when you take into account the different configuration cards, the different ways they can be oriented, plus the natural mixing of the words on the grid, etc.

Cons:
-You do have to be careful not to make it painfully obvious which card(s) you are looking at, particularly as the playing field gets narrowed down
-If you play a ton, you do start seeing the same words pop up - thankfully, there are tons of different combinations (so the connections themselves will typically be different), but we have indeed found that, if you play with the same group over-and-over, some clues tend to get repeated (for the same word(s)). Bring on a straight-up expansion pack!!
-You do have to really keep the group honest in terms on not reacting to things, commenting on what they really meant by a given clue after it is guessed, etc. (since you want to keep it up in the air as to whether the intended words were actually guessed as intended, or if the guessers just got lucky with what they picked!)

I personally prefer this game with 4 people, but it can also work with 6 or 8 (though we've seen it result in some more intense disagreements with 6-8.... particularly when the guessers are divided on which word to pick!! It can make it interesting though.... ;) )

All-in-all, a great game that you absolutely should pick up if you haven't already.

This is called one of the best party games in the world. But is it really a party game? I would say: no!
It's more a silent brain-smoker in which you try to create better combinations than the opposite team. No yelling, jumping, laughing (almost). For its easyness and the idea: again an awesome game by Vlaada!

I love party games, but very much dislike gamey party games. If I"m playing a party game, I want it to be silly, fast, loud, fun, with acting, and revealing of people. Gamey party games seem like frankensteins to me. If I want deduction I'll play a euro.

Not being able to look at people's eyes for fear of revealing clues, no small talk. It also bugs me when other players are responsible for defining the boundaries of the gameplay, my ability to play well completely dependent on someone else's ability to make word clues. We're playing a game within the unnecessarily small space of a person's preconceived notions and imaginative limitations as opposed to a set of game rules. I guess I'm saying it's too much like Pictionary for my tastes. A recipe for frustration.  

played it, disliked it.

It's always fun to play with a group, but it has a rule that's really hard to enforce, which is that the spymasters have to keep a straight face while everyone is guessing.

RATING: 8
Delightfully easy to explain and launch into with just about anybody - almost any age and any level of gaming interest. Wonderful fun coming up with the clues and being on the other side trying to guess them. Deciphering the clues can lead to some good conversation and a lot of laughs.

There's lots of player interaction as teammates discuss what they know about the spymaster (warning - it can get hilariously personal), 400 words and many agent combinations to mix games up, and a neat timer nudge along mechanism to politely prod anyone dawdling on their turn.

This is the best group game I've played and it makes for a terrific gift for families. Winning is secondary to coming up with a really good multiword clue. But if you like the game bit then there's pressure you can apply to your opponents to catch up, a timing aspect as you wait until giving some clues (based upon other words confusing your team while they're still available), and if you really concentrate then some clue reading on your opponent's turn.

Children will learn some new words, a lot of synonyms and it's a good, fun mental exercise for everyone at the table. One game takes about 10-15 minutes and you'll have a hard time stopping at just one. Every house should have a copy.

A brilliant little party/social game. Codenames is one of those games that is so simple and refined that you wonder where it has been all these years. This is the type of game that you want to play again when it is done, and you can have a great experience however you participate: giving clues, interpreting the clues, or maybe even just spectating. I definitely enjoy this one a lot.

Part strategy and part party game. Having at least six is best, so the guessers can bounce ideas off each other. This is where you get off-the-wall associations and the spymaster mentally face-palming for their own oversight or their teammates grand imagination. Still good for larger groups.

Really solid party game. I understand all the love for the game and I do enjoy playing it tremendously, but I dont think it is as light or as much of a gateway game as everyone makes it out to be. The concept is easy but people struggle to come up with solid clues and are often worried about giving a bad clue, especially people new to the game. While I think it is a great game and a great concept, dont be deceived about its ease of play.

I like to give clues and be aggressive, so half the game is fun. Probably best with 4 then so I get to give clues more often. Give clues and try to link as many of your words as possible together with the same concept, without looping in any of your opponents' words or the Assassin.

The silent party game! Heh. 

I was having a hard time playing it (cataracts, will get fixed they say) - so it was hard to grasp the whole field of words and think around them. 

It is an interesting mind scape - you try to combine doublethink with risk taking. You can go for more words, but it's risky and a question of how much will I be understood. I ought to play it more, but it seems that differences in logic and perception are more noticeable than in Time's up. You could use the game to get to better understand how other people are thinking. 

Ultimately I'm as bad at it as with Dixit - I'm too blunt or waaay too abstract. I can make connection faster than most people do, and they can't follow! Dang. Understanding other people's clues is easier. Might be an interesting exercise for me after all, understanding other people' thought patterns.

Codenames is a rather smart word association game with few bells and whistles. Spymasters have to make their teammates guess words in a grid by giving one-word clues. These clues have to be carefully considered so as not to overlap with the other team's words, or even worse, that of the assassin's. 

The spymaster's role is tougher (and arguably more fun) as she has more variables to weigh when picking clues, so groups might want to play consecutive games with roles rotated. Another caveat is that there isn't a lot of table talk due to the nature of the game – one word clues typically don't generate a lot of discussion, and the spymasters have to keep a straight face consistently. It's still upper-tier party game material though.

2016: 8. Initial reaction: Believe the hype, this is a pretty great party game. I'm not sure this would hold up well with a more hardcore crew, over time? But what party game does?

For me, half the fun is watching the code masters, especially non-gamers, wrack their brains to figure out a connection between "dish washer" and "dragon". The other half is doing it yourself! Great stuff.

This game is GREAT. It's like Password for gamers. It is tough to be the Spymaster though cause I feel pressured to come up with a good clue quickly as the other players just have to sit there and wait. After the initial clue though, you should be able to start coming up with more clues as the players are working out prior ones.

Played this one time at an Uncle's Games demo and PAX Prime and I was totally hooked! I love word based games and this is the most challenging and rewarding I've ever played, although how well you do really depends on understanding the frame of reference of your game partners, even more so in other popular word games like Taboo or Catchphrase. 

The dependency on understanding your partner's knowledge can be frustrating at times when you think that obvious connections aren't being made, but sooo satisfying when your team is clicking and the guesses are flowing! My favorite new word game.

The best 4-10ish player game that we own. It is super easy to explain the rules to new players and get them up to speed within just one round of the game. We have played with a diverse cast of people and it has been thoroughly enjoyed by everyone. As much as I enjoy Bang! The Dice Game, this one will make it to the table much more often, and be much more satisfying. There are few things better than being super upset with your clue-giver and them being equally as upset with your team when you hit the assassin.

Okay, I'll admit: I am not very good at Codenames. That alone doesn't justify my rating though. There are many games that I'm rather bad at and that I still rated at 7 or higher.
I guess I had more fun with those than I had with Codenames. Maybe it's because that there is 'only' player interaction and the theme-less quizz mechanic here. Other games I'm bad at alow me to tell stories about it, being thematic maybe.

Considering how highly rated this game is in general I might not do it justice with my low rating, but on the BGG rating scale (which is actually 'defined' by how much one would like to play a game) I really can't go any higher right now.

It's still at a place where I would play it given the opportunity and I hope I might end up increasing my rating at some point.

Nice word association game that you play in two teams.  Great game to play with the family and it's been a hit with everyone I played with.. including my wife.  One of the very very few games that she would agree to play or even suggest it as a party game with friends.   It is slightly frustrating if spymaster takes too long to come up with clues..  I know that we have timer but it just doesn't feel right to suddenly use timer in this game for some reason.

I'm a year late to the party but finally got to try this out. We all liked it quit a bit. It reminds me of Deception: Murder in Hong Kong in the nature of clue giving but more abstracted theme, obviously. The race aspect of getting all your agents first delivers some nice tension.

We played just two people per team; I wonder if it gets easier or harder having larger teams?

My biggest complaint is that the game breaks if the spymasters aren't playing along. For new players the concept of not being able to say ANYTHING, other than clues for the duration of the game is often incomprehensible, and I don't like being the party pooper who says that "It's cheating to act surprised when your team guesses a word you didn't mean for them to."

But other than that complaint, the game is great.

I was skeptical at first about how much fun it would be because the concept seemed very simple. Don't let this deter you. This game is so much fun and can be played with a small group or a large one.

Trying to come up with connections between words that your teammate(s) would understand initially seemed fun. I really thought that because my friends have so many similar interests and shared experiences that I could pull from our vast repertoire of inside jokes and provide some really awesome clues... but the words in Codenames just have no significance to us.

Két csapat játszik egymással, mindkettőben választanak egy főnököt, aki próbálja rávezetni a csapattagokat a kitalálandó szavakra. Véletlenül, mátrixszerűen rakunk szavakat az asztalra, ebből a kezdő csapathoz 9, a másikhoz 8 tartozik. Egy véletlenül választott lap megmutatja melyik szavak tartoznak a csapatunkhoz, amit csak a főnök lát, feladata egyetlen szóval egy körben minél több saját szó kitalálására rávezetni a csapata játékosait. Az a csapat nyer, aki leghamarabb eltalálja az összes saját szavát vagy a másik csapat belefut az egyetlen rossz szóba, amit nem lehetne tippelni. A játék ötletes, páros számú játékossal működik igazán jól. Gyorsan lejátszható, lehet rajta gondolkodni. Sajnos nagyon nyelvfüggő, de tipikusan olyan játék, ami magyar szavakkal is tökéletesen működhet. Tetszett.

[2016-05-06]
Immár a magyar változattal játszva csak megerősítést nyert a dolog, magyarul is teljesen jól működik a dolog, sőt hárman is jól játszható. 4 fölött viszont igazából csak párosan jó, hogy kiegyenlített legyen a két csapat.

As far as party games go, there are definitely more exciting titles, but I find Codenames to be quite enjoyable. With 6-8 players, this game really shines. The discussion for the teams is the best part and it's always fun to see if your guesses are correct. I think that a time limit needs to be strictly enforced as the game can become tedious if you're waiting for the other team to think of a clue and guess. Also, I find the boring one or two word clues to suck the fun out of the game. There should be a 3+ limit on the words you use as it challenges you to be creative and take some risks. If you working with a more cerebral crowd, Codenames is definitely a good choice.

We played this game for the first time this weekend and it was really fun. The game comes with a large number of double-sided cards, so even with a lot of plays, I don't expect that there is a risk of repetition. The concept is simple, the rules are easy to grasp and the gameplay can be quite amusing. A great filler game.

The challenge with this game is players taking a long time to come up with their clues. Encourage players, especially when the cards are mostly uncovered, to pick two of their cards and come up with a unique word that ties them both together--then check to make sure the Assassin isn't related, and if so go with it.

Brilliant. Deserving of being the best party game out there. Divide up into two teams, each team has a cluegiver and has to give a single word clue to link one or more of the words out on the table. The clues are maddeningly difficult to give, as you have to see if your team can think like you in connecting the dots, much as it can be on the other side to decipher the clue that was given. Truly just a fun, great party game, and something I'll always be up for.

Codenames is not a party game in the conventional sense.  It may be a party game in that large groups can play it, and there are elements of teamwork and competition.  But this game is more serious, more cerebral, and has more downtime than almost any party game available.  In theory, the downtime should be a major drawback.  Ambiguity in the rules should be another.

Yet Codenames might be the [i]best[/i] party game available.  There are several reasons for this.  First and most importantly, everyone seems to like it.  I have not found anyone who dislikes the game.  This is remarkable given the wide variety of settings and player counts at which I have played it.  Second, it promotes enough thoughtfulness in play to satisfy strategy gamers while remaining entirely accessible to everyone else.  The rules ambiguity is not a real problem.  Gamers will pay more attention to the rules than others, and groups will deal with disputes as they arise, but they rarely do.  There is a spirit to the game that everyone seems to understand.  Third, everyone is always engaged.  Downtime is filled with tension and curiosity.  While one team is taking their turn, the other is thinking or obfuscating or making snide remarks.  What happens adapts with the group.  It is never dull.  Lastly, like Dixit Codenames provokes insights into how other people think.  It brings people closer together.  What more could you ask for from a board game?

Incidentally, I think it would work as well with asynchronous online play as face to face, though you would lose the interaction of face to face play.

RATING: 8
Several plays with 4 and 6.

A great thinky style party game in the Password family, but with teams. Very simple, and very fun. The 6er game may be even better than 4 since you get to talk to someone about your options -- otherwise, there's a lot of silent staring going on! And it's a lot more fun than Password, which can be too thinky and too difficult. Plus, having the challenge of choosing your teams words and AVOID the Assassin and the other team's ... great design!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Divided into teams, each with one Spymaster (clue giver). Create a random 5x5 grid of words. The Spymasters secretly look at a card which tells them:
- which team (red/blue) is first (and must find one extra 
- which of the words belong to each team
- which is the Assassin
Spymasters alternate giving one word clues, along with a number n. Their teammates then select words, up to n+1, one by one:
- if your team's, put your marker on it and continue (if you like)
- if the other team's, put their marker on it; your turn ends immediately
- if neutral, your turn ends immediately
- if Assassin, your team loses immediately

The first team to find all their words wins!

I've only played once, but it was entertaining. Playing in teams makes it more enticing to play that other games in the genre, some of which put pressure on individuals in social situations (i.e. being the spy but not knowing the locations in Spyfall, or lying to people in Werewolf -- not that I have a problem with any of those).

This is an utterly fantastic game.  Simple, relatively deep and deeply engaging, while maintaining near infinite replayability in terms of card combinations.

Simply outstanding work, and the first Vlaada game I've played where he manages to squeeze an elite game out of a basic concept and design.  I'm used to a kitchen-sink design mentality from him.  More of *this* approach instead, please!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a fantastic team party game.  The  game is played with two teams trying to find their spies out of a list of random codenames.  Each team has a spymaster that knows which affiliation each of the spies is.  As well as spies for both teams some codenames refer  to civilians that aren't affiliated with either team and one is the assassin which will cause either team to lose immediately if identified.

A team's turn is played much like the classic game show Password.  The team's spymaster will say a single word and a number.  The number refers to how many of that team's codenames on the grid relate to the word said.  So if two of the codenames are "hamburger" and "spaghetti" for example the spymaster could say "food, two".  However, you need to be careful because other words on the grid could relate to that clue.  In one of my games the opponent spymaster said "Asia, one"  trying to get his team to guess "India".  However, "Beijing" was also a codename on the board and it was one of our teams spies so he gave us a point by accident when his team identified that codename.

When a codename not belonging to one of your spies is identified, play passes to the other team.  The game ends when either one team identifies all their spies or the assassin is identified.

This is a clean, clever, and fun game that I will always be up for playing.  I will play either role but I do personally think the spymaster is a lot more fun.

I really wanted to like this game, but it kind of fell flat. There is just too much downtime/thinking for a party game. I found it frustrating trying to think of clues that your teammates would get and would link to more than just two words. This is obviously easier if your team shares your random knowledge or have known you a long time, but this limits who you can successfully play this game with.

Surprising how this designer is able to create games that are vastly different from another. Codenames is close to several other word-based games, but it's just original enough to beat them all to the finish line. Quick and fun. The balance between risk and reward is perfect, and the more you play, the more dangerous the assassin becomes as players start taking risk to take less rounds to find all their spies.

As far as party games go it is not my favorite. I think the most challenge/ fun is in the position of the spy-master who has to come up with the clue, that person gets to enjoy the puzzly main aspect of the game. The teams then guessing, I think that side of the game play is missing the mark a bit. I also have to say for a party game there is too much down time, unless you put the pressure on it can take a moment for people to come up with a clue and afterwards in the guessing phase, too. Like I said, not my favorite and I think there are better party games.

I am very happy with Codenames. It's a quiet, introspective party game, which sounds anathema but actually works very well in practice. I've never played a bad game of this and it always hits the table for numerous sessions every time we play. It will be my go-to filler for the foreseeable future.

Fun little filler/partygame. 
You can put it out, explain the rules and have it done in less then 30 minutes. 
But it´s so much fun you often want to play again straight away! :) 
I have noticed though that this is a game for young and healthy minds. Tried it with my grandmother and it did not work :)

Thanks, Vlaada! 
The first game that fits to nearly every constellation of player groups. Above all: my wife loves it (and she doesn't like playing :-/ ...) 

Less rules, less downtime and you can fix the level from light to high - whatever you want. Lots of emotions and a sweet torture between the despair of your partners (because of their ignorance) and the joy about them for understanding you. 

How could this »simple« rules be deleveloped only now? 
Great job.

I find it inexplicable why this is rated so highly.  It is certainly OK and I would play it whenever.  But it just was not that compelling even for the genre of light party games which it is.  I don't understand what the obsession is about.  I am tempted to say that it is because of the designer, but the thing is rated higher than most other Chvatil games.  Would play it again, but one play was enough to know that I had no desire to own it.

It's pretty tame as a party game. The spymaster takes a while to give is clue and then sits there in silence. The others argue a bit and pick the codenames who are mostly obvious. The party element didn't come up much in my games.

The game is as fun as the skill of the spymaster. And it's only really fun when you're the spymaster as the guessing part is as fun as Battleship or Guess Who.

I get the initial buzz because it's still a innovative simple design, but I don't get why you'd want to repeatedly play this. Once you "get" what the game is about, there's little replay value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun guaranteed with this (strongly language-dependant) party game. The only negative thing I can think of, is the time aspect: sometimes it can take too much time to think of a good hint connecting the clues—and only the clues. Without the sandglass this may be too boring for the teammates; with the sandglass too stressful for the spy masters.

RATING: 7
Word/party game where players split into two teams, each with a spymaster and a number of guessers. The spymaster must give his team a clue like "airlift 2", meaning that two of the 25 word cards laid out on the table belong to that team -- "plane" definitely, but what else? Perhaps "sky", ... no, "Berlin".

Guessing wrong normally just ends the turn, unless the wrong guess is the one card which means instant failure.

It can be very tough on the spymasters, and the complaints about downtime aren't unreasonable -- it's definitely possible for someone to sit there for quite a while agonizing over the best choice of clue. Mysterium is a good comparison: Codenames gives more more players the opportunity to give clues, which is good, but giving those clues is harder as there is much wider scope. Mysterium's clues are probably more thematic (dream logic) and I enjoy the interpretative possibilities more, but the free association of words does allow for the same sort of tenuous connection.

An instant classic.

[TWOPLUS Games Chinese 16 edition] {Spy; partnership, word-association} Codename is a wonderful party game.  It is competitive, challenging and fun.  Each team has to take risk to let their teammates to guess more words, but not to trigger the Spy.

The component design is practical, but not attractive.  I am glad that the Chinese edition has both English and Chinese words.  There are enough words for repeatable plays.

RATING: 8
A great party game.  Very simple, but can be tough to master, having to say just the perfect word.  Playing with the timer is best!

Probably the only negative experience I had was with two spymasters that kept saying one word examples.  It just wasn't very imaginative and it took the whole stressful guessing out of that game, trying to stretch the meaning and purpose of one word to apply to only the words on your team is where the game is at.

For almost a completely different experience, you can use the app with a timer.  I love the super fast rounds where your team is frantically trying to figure out what you meant.  It totally changes the pace, stress and feel of the game.

This is a great light but fun four player game.  It is engaging and encourages creativity in thinking about words that describe commonalities between sometimes very different things.  It is also highly accessible -- since there is little strategy involved and it has low complexity, it levels the playing field between more hardcore and casual gamers, so you can play with any mixture of people and it will likely be competitive.

Great, great game. Chvátil does it again, and brings out the easy to teach, engaging to play filler Codenames.

Basic premise is simple: try to describe an association that covers your set of words as much as possible, without the association triggering any neutral or (worse) opponents' or (even worse) the assassin card.

Sounds simple, but is so hard to do elegantly. Spymasters have a really tough time here, while players do have that tension of assigning probability to each association in hope to trigger any 'correct' ones first. As one wrong move and your turn (or even the game) is immediately over.

Great game with huge replay value, can see expansion packs being brought out for this that take the game into a themed direction.

Requires 6+ persons to shine and is more of a 'brainy' filler, but it fills that spot very well.

An excellent game to play with everyone.
It is great for people who have no experience with games, and do not like rules. Very easy to learn, everybody can guess words.
And here comes the best part of it, it is an excellent game for experienced gamers, because when you sit as spymaster there is no limit on how long one can theoretically think about the best one word codename for your agents (you should of course not spend to much time thinking). This makes it fun for both casual gamers and people who like to twist their minds.

Not a game I would play with my dedicated gaming group on our gaming nights, but one of my favorite "casual" games.

RATING: 7
Codenames is simple, engaging and fun but I found it did not facilitate much social chat and therefore I don’t think it’s a great party game. Two of the players are required by the rules to stay silent for much of the game which is challenging. I think all the times I’ve played would have ended in disqualification had the rules been strictly adhered to.

RATING: 8
12/22/16: ~Hype Detensifies~ 9 to 8. I find myself knowing this game works so well with groups, especially non-gamer ones, but feel that fact jives so well with everyone that we never play anything else. Codenames is like the "Top 40" of contemporary boardgames...

7/24/16: 10 to 9. Lately this game has devolved into a slower experience. Where players sit and wait for far too long for the codemasters to come up with a clue. Setting timers makes a "fun casual" game feel too strict, plus leads to uninspired clues. Still a super accessible game though.

12/20/15:Makes people who typically turn their nose to games become obsessed for hours on end. Enough deduction for veterans to be satisfied, simple enough concept and rules for even the greenest of noobs. Game can be taught in literally seconds, especially if most already know how to play. Nearly infinite replayability. Virtually everyone realizes how big of a hit this game is after only a single game.

I usually don't like word games, but this isn't really a word game, it's just Dixit with words in stead of images. Quite interesting and lots of changes to be creative with the hints. But also challenging.
I like it, but I don't get the extremely high rating this game gets. It is very good and lots of fun, but I don't think it's one of the best designs ever.

Codenames is quite fun and Vlaada remains one of the most creative and original designers in the field. Codenames is wonderfully simple and yet has the potential to be both brilliant and tense. I thoroughly enjoyed being the spymaster, but being a regular spy afterwards with a little anticlimactic and after 2.5 plays as a spy, I was ready to move to something else.

That's not to say it isn't a wonderful design, it just doesn't have quite the same magic that his very best designs do.

Update: I think I just seem to have a lot less fun playing this compared to everyone else.

I had a very frustrating experience playing this game (well, it is actually a Remote Associates Test developed by Mednick in 1962).

It is not easy to come up with hints for 2 or 3 words.
While thinking about them, other people get annoyed because of the long wait between turns.

People also give hints, like "this might be a stretch, but...", or even watching their eye movements. The rules warn against it, but you can't help it of course. They should have included some sunglasses with these mirror-coated glasses so that you could not see the eye movements.

If mindsets do not agree, even single-card clues can go wrong, imagine that!

After every game, serious discussions about what really was meant with the clues.

Since I will not ever play this horrible game again, I give it a "2" according to BGG rules...

Thank goodness there is an easy way out: just give a single-card clue for the Assassin. This will end the game and you can move on to a better one!

This game is excellent.  Seems so far to have great replayability, it's a simple game, but it lets you try to think out of the box and get on a wavelength with your partner.  

So far I'm loving it.  Don't know how it will hold up over time, but it's quickly shot up my play list and I'm always happy to bring it out some more.

The only real hinkiness in the rules is the whole part about keeping a straight face, and not giving anything away.  Of course it's essential to play a straight game, but it's hard not to high five your partner if he gets what you were trying to go for on something brilliant.

Taboo for the 21st century. Lots of fun. Once your group gets a feel for it, it should alternate between the brow-furrowing, eyes-down silently for a few seconds kind of fun, and either simple celebration or playful yelling: "What kind of clue was that? 'Good 2'?"
Yes, it's another simple-concept party game, but the little details feel so clearly thought up by an experienced, talented /game designer/, and that sets it apart. The way the first team has an extra word to deal with for no reason other than balance, or the system that allows players great options-- the structure of the clue mechanic is less alienating than Pictionary or Charades, yet not as arcane as most trivia games. It isn't closed off to people who aren't good with trivia or drawing or performance, yet still rewards creativity, knowledge, and player familiarity as much as any classic party game.

Definitely a great game worth the merit of being BGG's #1 Party Game! Very easy to learn and can be explained really quickly! No one game will be the same with a huge amount of words and also the way teams perceive their clues. Had so much fun with nearly every group I introduced it to. The co-op mode is the best way to teach the game, but remember to purposely mention a clue that can go both ways. It helps to in demonstrating how words can be perceived differently.

Solid game and good for playing with the family or at a party.  The great part of it is the use of only one word as a clue!  How many times that has tripped us up while playing.  Very fun game.  For the younger players that might not know some of the clues on the board we take a second before starting and have the younger players ask questions about words on the cards so that we make sure they know what they are!  Just a tip when playing with younger players.

While I typically don't gravitate towards party games, I picked this one up to play at a 007 themed birthday party for my mom.  It was superb, and we continued to play it with the family throughout the course of the holidays.

This game puts the pressure on the 'codemasters' of 2 separate teams to get their respective groups better word association clues than the opposing team.  25 cards with nouns are placed in front of both teams for the captains to work with.  The game provides the codemasters a very high pressure job, while the rest of the team is left to debate the meaning of the clues given by the codemaster.  

One of the most satisfying parts of the game is when a round is over and the captains can reveal their thought processes with the clues they chose to give.  Great game, and very easy to have fun with it.  So far when I have brought the game out, the entire group will ask for 2-4 more rounds after the initial first, taking turns being the codemaster for their team.  Few games allow for the amount of accessibility this game brings to the table, pleasing gamers and non-gamers alike.

On one hand this is the one of the most thought intensive and suspenseful games around, and on the other it is a fun party game where you guess cards based on clues...just depends on what side of the cards you are on. A really fun game that everyone we have played with has really enjoyed, including us. It is funny to see someone who was a guesser berating the cluegiver take on the spymaster role and either give a bad clue due to "tunnel vision" or realize just how daunting the task can be. Always great for laughs and you feel like you accomplish something each time you play.

I waited to rate this game, as I played it a couple of times at 2015 Dice Tower Con and had a pretty bad experience playing it, so I wanted to wait until I played it with my regular group.  We finally got to play it on New Years Day, with the group including some wives/SOs.  I had a better time with it this go around, but it still seemed like a game I would play if other people wanted to, but not one I would suggest.

My new favorite party game, probably by far. It most closely resembles Dixit in the type of thinking required. However, where Dixit is a peaceful and contemplative game, Codenames spices up the mix with tension brought on by the chance of revealing your opponents' clues. Lots of fun even when you are making mistakes. Definitely looking forward to playing this around the holidays with my extended family.

I can not get enough of this game. The problem is other people can.

Try to give clues good enough to score multiple cards but avoid your opponent's cards, the innocent, and the killer card.

Lots of duel sided cards for lots of boards.

If a clue giver will not take chances, the game is slooooooow!

Codenames is great fun, and works for many different people. However, it is essentially a word game and a "think like your partner" game. Some people will hate this or not be good at it and not really enjoy it. In my experienece this is pleasing with 90 percent of people.However, you don't always need to be good, as part of the fun (if you lose) is laughing uproariously as someone makes a hilarious mistake (my brother didn't realize I would associate "bomb" with his clue of "france")

RATING: 7.7
A thinky little game, more a puzzle than a party game. But a good one. It centres on the ability to connect words with a single clue, and the uncertainty that comes with that. As well as the potential risk. Sometimes one team may have more easily linkable clues than the other team, but in such a short game it makes for a fun challenge.

Extremely well constructed party game, the game makes you have hard decisions both as the spymaster and the agent. Like most Vlaada games, it really showcasts how rules have impact in the game: the best example of this is the assassin, which forces the spymasters to really work on their clues as well as making the game not be a foregone conclusion until the end.

RATING: 9
Really seems like a 6-player-only game (or possibly good with 8 players too, but I haven't played that way yet). After my initial 4-player game I didn't see what all of the hype was about, feeling like it was just an okay party game. But the 6-player game really opens things up. You have another person's perspective to help with deciphering clues, and as the clue-giver you have two people who can hopefully correctly figure out your clue. The game also has a really smart way of handling the first-player advantage (the start team has to essentially get one more point in order to win).

[b]Player Count Verdict: 6, 8[/b]
You need even-numbered teams, and you want more players, so the game is best with 6 or 8.

Update: After several more plays, this game just keeps getting better. It can be incredibly tense as the clue-giver, as your teammates discuss whether or not to pick a card that you know if the assassin. Really fun.

Fantastic little game.  Theme is not really apparent, or important, but coming up with a clever clue will really make you feel smart.  Missing the fact that there are, say, three countries on the table and you call 'Country : 2' will make you feel like an idiot.  I have done both of these things.

To be honest I had too high expectations with this game based on the exhorbitant ratings. I think it doesn't deserve all the hype but that doesn't mean I don't like the game, it is quite nice, simple, but with a lot of downtime. If it wasn't about words and linking concepts in your mind I would not put it a 6 but lower, but since I like these kind of games, it felt like it could have a 6.

I am mildly surprised at the great heights that this one has reached on the BGG rankings simply because I don't understand what this is doing so much better than other similar party/word games.

That said, it is unique and definitely fun. I have had nothing but great success with all groups I have tried this with so I have no problem with the ranking. I'm just surprised.

This could actually surpass Dixit as my go-to party game if only because it so easily accommodates larger numbers. (Dixit is still cooler though).

Update: My rating has slipped a bit from an 8 to a 7. I am a little tired of it, but I do understand its high ranking. It is always wildly successful when I introduce it. So much so, that I am hesitant to do so because it means it will be constantly requested and, as I wrote above, I am a little tired of it.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 4.5

This is a well designed game. By all means, brilliant. A bunch of cards, some clever rules, and a game that anyone can play and enjoy. But I just...don't find much interest in playing it a lot. I like that it can be played with a lot of people and has crossover appeal, but I feel pretty meh about it now.

Codenames is essentially a party type word game in which you are attempting to solve the riddle of uncovering your teams agents - each represented by a single word - on a 5x5 grid of cards.  In actuality,  what this game has done,  is solve the age old riddle of longevity in the party game genre.

There has always been one caveat attached to most of the glowing reviews one might read,  concerning the party game genre - and that is - the fun contained within,  always came with an expiration date.

Take for example,  a highly popular party game - and one of my personal favorites - Wits and Wagers.  While being a great game,  it has a finite amount of cards,  which once you become familiar with,  render them essentially useless.  It is hard to deny the fact that this problem is basically inherent in the genre itself.

Codenames deftly skirts that issue by using 25 cards at a time.  Because of word associations,  the variable mix,  the key cards and the orientation of those cards - the usual stigma that is affiliated with this type of game - disappears,  like a stack of chips at a casino.  Add to that,  the fact that there are no definitive answers - that everything relies on individual interpretation - and you have stumbled upon something that is truly unique for this game model.

If all this game managed to do was break the mold,  it might deserve accolades for,  at long last,  simply performing that feat.  But there is more on display here than that...much more.  Beyond it's near limitless replay value,  there is much fun to be unearthed in that small box of sparse components.

This quickly became my number one word / party game of all time - although if you don't have an affinity for words,  I suggest you proceed with caution.  The game system itself,  is ingenious and versatile enough to allow one to widen it's scope.

:star: being a captain or one of the players gives very different, but fun in both cases, experiences

:nostar: sometimes it seems that you can just get stuck and not be able to combine any two words into a clue, and giving clues for just one card isn't much fun

I love this game for the brilliance it tickles out of the players, and how it gets better every time you play it with the same group. My only (minor ) problems with this game are the slightly arbitrary rules when it comes to which hints are allowed and that there is no system in place to penalise a spymaster giving additional hints. Not even remotely enough criticism to not recommend buying this game though!

Wasn't a huge fan of this game. When I played it I thought the concept was neat, but for a pseudo party game, it's not all that exciting to just sit around and look at words. It fell flat for me even though the other people playing seemed to be entertained. I'd maybe play it again, but there are many more games that fit into that larger group almost party game style, and this is just not that exciting to me.

Brilliant example of elegant game design. So approachable and simple to teach, the game is basically a single kind of challenge repeated but the challenge is infinitely mutable and so enjoyable with every iteration. I don't remember who said it but I once heard "Simplicity must be designed." One can tell a lot of work went into making this game look effortless. The theme is a bit pasted-on but that doesn't effect the experience at all.

First Impression:
Excellent Party Game.
Solid team play, great deduction of player choices, flawless and fair system with push your luck elements, fast and very fun gameplay.
So, anything wrong? Well, the only flaw I can point is that the master spy has a very hard time not reacting to the various theories that are being hastily discussed by his team and it is very easy to break and "cheat" even without wanting and also very unfun to try and hide his/her emotions. Master spies really should be in hidden in my opinion, able to express their emotions at least in mute to each other without giving hints.
Overall, it's an excellent design of a party game.

Solid party game. Two players act as Clue givers to their team. Their team must select from a grid of "Codenames" (see what they did there?) to find the names associated with their team. Picking incorrectly can give the opposition a leg up at best, and lose the game at worst. It is a party game.

A great game to play with a large (ish) group. Fast to set up. Fast to teach. Difficult to master. An ideal game to play with non-gamers.

My only qualm with the game is that no fewer than three games is ever enough for one sitting!

I like party games where the humour occurs naturally, and not just as a result of forcing the players to be goofy or even necessarily creative. Codenames is now my favourite party game, because it organically creates laugh out loud situations. This truly is a game that everyone can enjoy. The only problem now is that this may become the only game friends and family want to play!

Codenames is a new party game that I've wanted to try for a while now. I was pretty sure that I'd like the game as it falls into a category of party game that I like... ones where you give clues to get your team to guess the right word.

What's unique about Codenames is that there is a 5 x 5 grid of words that is visible to both teams. Each team has a spymaster. Both spymasters can see a card that shows which words in the grid are for the blue team, red team, neutral or the deadly insta-death assassin card. On a team's turn, the spymaster gives a one word clue and a number. The number tells the team how many words in the grid the clue applies to. Then the team has to guess word by word, which words match the clue. They can guess as many words as the number that was given and one extra guess (to try and get previous clues). If they get a word correct they cover it with their team marker (either red or blue). As soon as they get a word wrong the turn is over and it is the other teams turn. If the wrong word was the other teams it gets the appropriate marker on it, and if it was a neutral word it gets a beige marker on it. When one team gets all their words correct the game is over. Or if anyone guesses the assassin word, they instantly lose.

The game is a lot of fun. It's challenging to come up with clues that match multiple words without matching the wrong words. Interestingly, the opposing team can help you out... if they guess a word for their clue it will be covered (right or wrong) and so is out of play. Maybe you wanted to give garden as a clue for slug, grass and stick, but were worried that your team would guess yard in error. When the other team guesses yard, your clue is now perfect. The hardest part of the game seems to be when the spymaster doesn't realize that their clue might apply to words they didn't mean them to. Sometimes this is just an oversight, sometimes it is because they didn't go as deep as the team did, and sometimes it's an association that they just didn't know. In our game one player had never heard the expression "to pound sand".

The game is a lot of fun and does something new in the word association party game genre. It encourages you to be clever in trying to tie multiple words to a single clue... something that only occasionally happens in other similar games. I like what this adds to the genre and look forward to playing it more.

[floatright][ImageID=2582929medium][/floatright][thing=178900][/thing] is a social deduction party game, in which players are split into two teams: red and blue, with one player of each team being the spymaster (the one that give clues and knows the board - which words are red spies, blue spies, bystanders and the assassin) and the others being the operatives (the field agents that try to crack the "code" (word) given by the spymaster, in order to try to find their own agents in the board - i.e.: using the clue to point to the cards that are the agents of the same color of the team). [thing=178900][/thing] also has a light memory aspect to it - those that don't like this, don't really have much to worry about. It plays quickly and is easy to teach and learn (it is a party game, after all). [thing=178900][/thing] has one advantage over several other party games: it doesn't provide loads of yelling. Finally, [thing=178900][/thing] works well for those that are more on the shy side, since the "social" part isn't as strong as those in [thing=147949][/thing], [thing=24068][/thing], [thing=41114][/thing] and [thing=151369][/thing], being closer of that in [thing=39856][/thing] - where the purpose isn't discuss, but "read" the purpose of clues.

[b]Rules[/b]
Are pretty light. 25 cards are used to forma 5x5 grid. Two teams are formed, with one player in each team assuming the role of Spymaster - this will be the player that will give clues to the others of the team. One key card shows wich cards in the 5x5 grid are spies (and of which color), bystanders and the assassin. The goal of the game is for the team to find all the agents of the same color in the board, by poiting the words connected to them. The first team to find all the agents wins the game. But the teams are also trying to not hit the assassin - the team that does this loses immediately.

The clue given by the Spymaster must be of a single word and a number. The word will (hopefully) lead the team to connect it with one or more words on the board. The number has two purposes:
a) it indicates how many words on the board are, even slightly, connected to the clue;
b) the number of guesses the team has is the number given +1. But the team can only keep guessing if they are chosing right, by finding their own agents (pointing to the cards that are of the same color of the team).

So, say I'm the Spymaster. I could give the clue "Board 2". Then my team would look at the table and see:

[c]regular public    ingredient  cat	   line
bash	unity	   person     afternoon    full
dance	fill	   tax	      wife	   anger
oxygen	delivery   geology    fish	   shut
ashcan	arithmetic chain      survival     pork
[/c]

Now, which words you think are connected with "Board"? The Spymaster said "2", so, for him, at least two words fill the bill (or, maybe, in a previous turn, he said a clue that the team didn't got completely, so the Spymaster might have said 2 in order for the team to choose right for "Board" and use the 2 extra guesses in order to pick the cards they didn't understand at first, but, now, they do). Of course, the "connected" is relative with the person that gave the clue.

But lets say the clue was really for two words on the board. So, for instance, for one person, the "Board" clue might connect with "bash" (the leader) and "cat" (in the sack). For another, it can be for "ashcan" (Pete, an investigator from [thing=15987][/thing]) and "unity" (a hero from [thing=102652][/thing]). For a third could be "oxygen" (because of [thing=72225][/thing]) and "wife" (multiple reasons). For a fourth "anger" and "pork". And so on. The key to unlock this is to know where the Spymaster is coming from and what he/she might be thinking and, of course, if he/she considered what [b]you[/b] might think, your history.

If the team got the clue right, the team can continue guessing until they decide to pass, or pick a wrong card (choosing one that is a bystander or belongs to the other team), or until the team reaches the maximum number of guesses (number given +1). Then is the other team turn. The game continues in this back and forth until a team finds all their agents (the first team to do this wins the game) or until one team picks the word belonging to the assassin (instant defeat).

That is simply all there is to [thing=178900][/thing].

[b]Interaction[/b]
Is a the crux of the game. All the game is interaction. Not direct, mind you. One team don't act when the other is up. I can't interfere in your play, if we are in opposing teams. I am able to try some mind games though. However, the interaction I mean is between the Spymaster (clue giver) and the operatives (choosers).

We had a pretty good time trying to understand the clues. "What do you mean, godamit!" "That is THE best clue you can give?" And the confidence between the parts are important, and can also made your team crash and burn! One time I gave a clue I thought was awesome: "Backbone 2". I was going for "Head" and "Center" (yes, "Center" (of the body) - for me it made sense at the time). They first pick "Head". Great! Then, about this time or a little sooner, it dawned on me that the Assassin was linked to the "Doctor" word. Oh, shi... After the first guess the operative was a little lost, trying to understand my meaning. And sure enough the finger went to the "Doctor" card. And that was it, game over, we lost!

Therefore, there is important interaction between players, just not really with [i]all[/i] the people playing. [thing=178900][/thing] is not a team vs team like the one in [thing=142079][/thing] - the dispute isn't totally direct (the part where the teams "touch" each other is when one pick an agent of the other, and when a clue is understood by the operatives of the other team, so they know wich card to don't pick). So, not high confrontation here.

[b]Luck[/b]
Well, with wild guesses (and they are integral part of the game, as even with a "1" number being given, the operatives are allowed one extra guess) there comes luck. For instance: in our very first game, after the first clue was given, the operative couldn't understand it to zoom in to just one card. So he said "Well, I will try to guess one anyway". Of the 25 cards he could pick, he went directly to the one that was the Assassin! Defeat for the team in the very first choice. This was 100% pure luck for our side.

But this isn't a luck derived from dice rolls or blind draws from decks. Is comes from people. In the situation above the player [b]choose[/b] to pick a card at random - he could have passed. The same luck that comes from "will they understand?". They might. They might not. But the clue is always a choice made by the Spymaster, one that he must choose considering the people receiving it. The less he/she does this, the more luck the team will rely on to get it right.

So, there is luck, but it doesn't drive the game.

[b]Components and art[/b]
Are just OK. The cards with the words, to be clearer, contain, well, only words. But the design was well made, as is possible to read the cards from either side of the table, as the word in the cards are written twice, one upside down. Simple enough, but could have been overlooked.

All the art on the agent tokens is average, at best. Nothing remarkable. The box is medium-small, and is the perfect size for the game, with room for expansions (words are easy to come by) and fit everything with sleeves.

[b]Difficulty[/b]
To learn? Almost none. To play? Still really easy, with the difficulty not actually coming from the game, but in understand the hidden meaning of the clues, and, of course, coming up with the best clues, the the best ones are those that allows for more than 1 guess, linking two or more cards in a single clue, as the game is a race - the first to reach all agents on their side, so speed in finding them is necessary.

Is easier to give one-off clues - one that is directed to a single card. Notice I said "easiER" not "easy" as the limitation of a single word for the clue means no articles or prepositions to set up the word. For example, considering the words I used above, saying "the leader" could lead to "bash" (among savyy players) - but only "leader" might open more the road to words like "wife" (among most households), "public" or "person".

Mind you that,clue-given can specially induce a lot of AP to some, while they try to find the perfect clue, and this can lead to some stress, when the others are hurrying the other and calling for a clue. Some players might not want to be involved with this (but they can still play [thing=178900][/thing], but always as the operatives/choosers).

However, is this "difficulty" that is the heart and fun of the game. 

[b]Time[/b]
When we hit the Assassin, the game usually lasted around 15-20 minutes. But the times we went until one team found all their agents, it took longer, around 30 minutes. To give the clue and to try to crack "the code" of the clue weren't done quickly sometimes.

So, while I can't say that the official 15 minutes isn't completely wrong, it also isn't all that correct also.

[b]Theme[/b]
Yes, this part is seriously lacking. There isn't any real attachment with how the game work with the theme it has. Sure, it uses names like "spymaster", "operative", "agents", but don't be fooled by this. The theme could be anything:
- You are two crews trying to find the treasures of your country - England x France, Spain x Portugal, you name it. Find the sunken treasures in the sea, but stay away from the Kraken!
- You are two races fighting for survival, in order to do this, you must find planets in which you could live (while trying to not lead the others to planets where [i]they[/i] could live!). So, find planets to colonize, but be careful not to enter into the Blackhole!
- You are two teams trying to find first all the hidden easter eggs. Blue vs Red! However, you must not run into the Killer Bunny!

And so very many others re-themes, without changing a single rule of the game. If you are looking for a thematic party game, you won't find it here.

[b]Summary[/b]
[thing=178900][/thing] is a good and efficient party game. It knows the lenghts it wants to cover and do it well. The game doesn't over reach - it wants to be simple, quick, with low(but there)-confrontation of teams.

And, as psychology has proved, all it takes to make people competitive at each other, is to simply divide them into teams. "You are red, I'm blue, you are dumb and I hate you." So it will be given that people will try hard to win, not only for the win itself, but to do well in front of the friends/audience. To get ir right an obscure clue is great to feel accomplished - is a undeniable proof of smartness, above average inteligence and raw sexiness. Failure means turning into an outcast.

The game is made to accommodate up to 8 players, but it works well with less, maybe with less laughs and discussion, but with, well, play for the ones playing, since the challenge remains the same - pick a card. With more you just divide this with others.

Clue: recommended 1.

Excellent party game for big groups. Very fun if people don't take it too seriously and it is possible to freely drop out and come back during the game since the setup is so loose with a lot of people playing. Works very well with drinking and men vs women as always a blast. Easily best with 6 or 8. You can also play this with "serious" attitude --> clue givers think best possible clues for a long time but then the game is not nearly as fun as a pure party game (so i recommend that you play this without too much stress about winning) . Theme is easy for non-gamers to get into and rules are extremely simple but at the same time there is a lot of replayability.

This is an excellent party game that requires a lot more brainpower than the average party game.  It is like a more interesting version of Password, it really takes a lot of concentration to come up with various associations between words.  The game is always different each time you play, and it's been a hit with every group I've played it with so far.  The only problem I've noticed is that the game can drag on when the clue giver can't think of a good clue (being the clue giver is difficult!).  It's a great game overall.

Light, casual party game. Pretty fun, works best with 6+ but is playable at 4.
The most important element is the set of key cards, which show the Spymasters which card slots are on which team. If you don't like staring at a bunch of words, use the key cards from Codenames, but set up the board using cards from Mysterium, Dixit, or similar.

RATING: 10
FABULOUS fun!  there can be a few "only really good" rounds, but overall the experience is a "ten" for me.  always want more! 

Just introduced this to my 8.5 yo kid.  Went over surprisingly well!  She needed a bit of coaching (which we had the opposing-spymaster provide) when vocabulary was a bit of a stretch, but she was on the winning team 2/2 plays.  Mostly she needed to be reminded of multiple definitions to think of - which she could come up with if she was prompted to slow down.  (I thank JK Rowling for expanding her vocabulary.)

I despise party games.  Except this one... and Catchphrase.  This one is really fun, and reminds me a lot of the classic Password game.  It's great trying to get multiple answers from a single one-word clue.  And, unlike password, it's replayability is through the roof.

Codenames is a fantastic for families, first time gamers and for breaking the ice! The replayablity is the strongest asset to the cult classic! The reason I give it a 7 is because it's not typically the game I favor. If I could choose any game it wouldn't be this. 8s, 9s, and 10's are must-play whenever possible. All in all a good game that is worth having in your collection.

Great partygame.
But theme is constructed and i don't think it's good. It is a pure abstract game and they should definetly go the same way as link and keep it abstract.

there is downtime when the group leader thinks about the right word that connects a lot of other words for the others, but that was very okay for our group since it was really fun.

Maybe a bit too much for a light family party game, but it's a great gamers party game if you have a game night and just want to have some fun.

Fun party game.  However, the game does demand that all players pay attention -- you can't really walk off to the fridge or snack tray when it's not your turn.  Easy to teach, easy setup, and quick play keep it entertaining.  The players I introduced this to all wanted to play again.  This is like the old 'Password' tv game show.  

Codenames is a competitive game between two teams.  I've only played this with four or five players.  Three is workable if the group can consider the clue giver to be a neutral party.  I'm skeptical that two players (playing against 'par') would be engaging.

There is no reason why a child couldn't play this, however the deeper your vocabulary, the better you will compete.

RATING: 7
Played a 2 player version. Clearly better as a team-based game. I can see the potential for this game, but again, with all party games, the success or failure of Codenames lies in the group. This game is language dependent, so in a mixed crowd with different English proficiencies, this game may fail or drag. Also, there is a trivia or cultural aspect to this game as well. So, again in a mixed crowd, this game may not work.

Overall, an excellent design. I wonder if visualization of clues to link all the codenames can be "improved" over time. This would indeed be a cool game if you can improve this aspect of "linking" obscure "clues".

Played with 4 and the game is good. Yes, it is not easy for some, but the "ah ha!" moments are priceless in this game. Some folks may not have an easy time visualizing the links and connections in the game and it can suffer from some cultural or language-dependent advantage like so many other word games, but in the end, the game is a winner!

Works differently with different numbers of players.

It's kind of a weird mix of party game, word game, and deduction game.

It really works, and I like it a lot. But if you're going to play with five people, just play the coop. Unless you have two people who are really serious and three who just want to have fun. Then you'll be okay.

Full disclosure: I received a review copy from the company.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's good, but so much of the fun seems to come from trash talking and acting like fools when playing, which is fine, but says nothing about the game. Also, there's always one or two who aren't so good at English in the group, which means they have less of a good time. For me, this isn't as good as a party game as it is as a small group, competitive game. Which is odd, considering how much 'fun' people have when 'playing' it. 

I've decided I'd rather play this with non-gamers than gamers, as with gamers I'd rather be silly and have fun with something else to actually play, rather than just sit there shouting random words at people to put them off, fun as that is.

I love 80s game shows like Super Password and Scrabble, the TV version - this game replicates the feel of those games in your own home.

Still, this game is both challenging and fun.

A brain-burning version of word association. I enjoyed trying it, and it's a great design, but it's not what I'm looking for in a game. I usually don't care about downtime, but it's pretty vicious in this game. I'm not convinced that it's really intended to be played with fewer than 6 players without a variant. Or maybe I missed the train on this one. Oh well.

RATING: 10
HIGHLY recommended!  This game is relatively casual but does require some good thinking from the two codemasters and can be played quite seriously with the right crowd.  The only downside is how long the very first clues require and the very last clues require to come up with for most codemasters.  Even very good codemasters might delay the game excessively because they want to perfect their plan.  It is hard to set a time limit too because sometimes the options are either nearly non-existent or the only good clues overlap with the assassin or other players cards too heavily.  

My favorite experiences in this game have been playing it "pass and play" 2-player variant with my girlfriend (now wife) by setting up the gameboard and writing the clue down on a whiteboard so she can write her guesses in order of priority on the board and I can score it next time I go past and have an infinite amount of time to do my next clue.  2-player rules are in the rulebook and work well for having fun maximizing cluegiving and interpreting skills.  We have even played by picture message on phone updating the gameboard and texting clues and guesses.  Game speed varies a lot played this way and requires a dedicated space setup for codenames but this is just loads of fun.

Best new party game I've seen in a while. Must have, and it's only around $17 on Amazon. Give one word hints to your partner or partners that connect two or more random nouns together. The partners on your team then try to guess your words and not the opponents'. Very simple yet captivating game.

This game got a lot of buzz when it came out. I rushed right out and got it as soon as I could. I had a family get together a few days later and I was really excited to play it. We played a few staples before we got to Codenames; Cash N' Guns, Wits & Wagers, Spyfall. Then I unleashed Codenames on them. What a letdown. Everyone was having so much fun...Codenames put an end to that pretty quickly. I just don't get it. Every time I've played this game with people who have never played it before...one game is enough. I know there are people who like it, but for my money there are MUCH...MUCH better party games. Any of the other games mentioned above for instance.

Two teams compete to see who can make contact with all of their agents first. Spymasters give one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the board. Their teammates try to guess words of the right color while avoiding those that belong to the opposing team.

Great game in general, but I find fault in how much the rules limit table talk. In a party game setting (which is ideal for this kind of game) it's really frustrating as a Spymaster that you can't say ANYTHING outside of clues, and not even show emotion. It makes you feel super isolated. I hear this is less of an issue with more players, since the non-Spymasters are not restricted nearly as much.

Can't think of a better game to get a large group of people involved. It's so simple and quick to explain; team captain gives a clue and his team tries to figure out which words best associate with it. Other spy themed games wish they had such a streamlined deduction mechanic without devolving into a game of Guess Who. And that's not even getting into the staggering amount of setup variation within just the base game itself, let alone the other standalone variants.

On the downside, you do need to clarify the "flexible rules" with newer players so they don't unintentionally sabotage their team's chances with illegal clues, which can lead to some disagreement among players. A bad spy master or poor communication can also derail your chances of winning very quickly though that's a matter of player skill, separate from the flawless game design.

Bottom line: This game will be a permanent fixture in my collection

RATING: 3
Ugh.  This game is annoying, and the fact that it seems to have cross-group appeal between gamers and non-gamers makes it show up everywhere.  Clues are intentionally clipped and thus usually uninteresting, and there's little room for creativity.  You either think of the word, or you don't.  Furthermore, one player can really ruin a team's fun, either by giving bad clues or by dominating the guessing side.  And worst of all, this game has a tendency to drag as people overanalyze the clues endlessly.

I would be happy to never play this again, though I probably won't be able to avoid it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The fact that you can take such simple words and make them into such a compelling game is very impressive.  This is a word game where having a huge vocabulary isn't as important as being able to find that odd connection between seemingly disconnected words.

Sometimes the result of that connection is brilliant, but sometimes that clue that YOU think is brilliant makes no sense to your teammates.  Of course, this is best at 4+ players, but giving clues is so enjoyable that it's a pretty fun game with 3, and a neat activity with just 2 people.

RATING: 9
'Codenames' is one of my favourites. Admittedly, our team had a ropy start, and as with games like 'CSI Files', providing clues is more about knowing your fellow players as much as appreciating the niceties of opthalmology. I think reflecting on what clues can be given, as well as those that can't, may make future games easier to follow. The letter 'D' as in the connection to the word; day, falls outside the parameters but there are no hard feelings as we ended up on one clue left even though we managed to guess two grey tiles, to boot. We even threw in a few for our opponents as well! Good game as always and still the highest scoring UK Expo game within the club

I really enjoy playing codenames. The downfall of this game (and the reason I do not rate it a perfect 10) is more often than not I find people don't want to play it because they think it sounds boring or a little too hard. But the game itself is extremely easy to understand and play and is actually really fun when you have a decent sized group of people. I personally think it should only be played with a minimum of 4 people which makes it harder for me to get it on the table as most of my groups consist of 3 people.

I love the way it makes your brain work in unexpected ways, trying to link two, three or even four words … EUREKA! You got it! And then your team gets it all mixed up – having completely different word-associations.

This game is quite an achievement, the small scale Holy Grail of "A party game that Jeff actually looks forward to playing". The rules are the epitome of simplicity and can be explained in 2 minutes, even in a room full of drunks.

The gist is one player tries to find a way to connect 8 or 9 randomly selected words using as few clues as possible, with each clue consisting of a single word and a number. The number represents how many of the random words are linked by that particular clue. His team then tries to guess as many words as they can (from the displayed list of 25 total words).

A second player and his or her team does the same, using the same set of 25 words, but with a different selection of the 8 or 9 words as targets. Then teams alternate attempts, eliminating words as they correctly guess them. The first team to guess all of their target words wins immediately.

This all sounds pretty easy, but there's a catch. One of the words is a trap. If anyone chooses the trap word, their team automatically loses.

It's a lot of fun and I have to say, being the clue giver is much harder than you might expect. Linking the words is fairly easy, but not also linking to words that belong to the other team or the trap word is much more difficult. Often you will focus so intently on creating a clever clue, you will miss an obviously wrong answer match, trapping your team.

The other thing I enjoy is how well it scales to player count. Usually the more eyes you can get on a puzzle, the easier it becomes to solve. Not this one...In fact, the more minds you add to the think tank, the more clouded the answers become. All sorts of questionable relationships start popping up, as more and more outlandish connections start to be made between the random words.

It takes about ten to fifteen minutes to play a game, but once you start it's easy to lose a couple of hours, especially when a metagame starts to form around different ways to link the words using movies, shared experiences and inside jokes. It's an awesome amount of laughs, but still manages to be a challenging an engaging puzzle. I would not feel bad about a copy of this being in every gamer's collection, from casual social gamer to heavy lifting GMT guy.

Really disliked this game and honestly have to wonder how much of the love is due to it being put out by Vladda (who deserves it).  It's an awkward game where a bunch of people sit around watching two people have analysis paralysis.  Then those two people have to shut up on not move.

On the other teams turn, everybody shuts up and doesn't talk because there isn't anything to talk or think about.

Good game, great for playing with the in-laws and non-games. I do wonder if this game would be rated quite so highly on BGG if it weren't designed by Vlaada... It's a very simple and clever word game, but has some problems too: distinct advantage for first team, and (bigger issue) can really drag at times. You can combat the slowness using the timer, but then you get less clever clues, which isn't as fun.

I'm not the biggest fan of word games, but this one steals the show! Clever, involving and simply fun! My favourite party game right now, it deserves all the praise it gets. 

Just keep in mind that you have to play it with the right people - the only reason why I'm not giving it a 10 is the fact that the wrong person in the spymaster chair can ruin the whole experience (both in terms of giving weird clues and causing excessive amount of downtime). So yes, it's heavily group-dependant, but when it works - man, it's just amazing. I've spent countless evenings with my friends just having a blast with this game.

Great gateway and party game. Fun, no matter who are you playing with ;)
Game requires some thinking (but not the heavy type) and lets you learn a lot about your teammates, and, at the same time, is really fast (so there is no problem with playing several times in a row).

In my top 10. So easy for non game folks to enjoy. You can hop in and out of the game if need be and can enjoy a nice beverage while you play. Also, it is a game that every time we play, we want more of it (3-4 rounds seems average).

I played a prototype of this game a while back and I did not like it.  But I played at a con and I thought that maybe it just wasn't the right group.  Then it blew up.  I figured I must be missing something and I should give it another shot.  So played two more times, and I just confirmed my initial impressions.

There is a lot of down time in this game.  It is not engaging.  If it was an app game where you could go on living your life between turns I think I would like it.  This is a challenging puzzle and a pretty cool one at that, but I just don't feel it works as a board game.

Everyone was talking very highly of Codenames during Gen Con and every time I saw it I was underwhelmed. I didn’t quite understand the point of the game and never read too much into it and ignored it for a while, but eventually I just decided to buy it and make up my mind for myself and I am very glad I did.

I’ve played this with my meetup group five times now and two of those plays included the entire group and it was a blast. I enjoy playing as both the spymaster and their team and would be happy to play either. Crafting the clues is incredibly difficulty, but also a rush when you get one just perfect for your team.

The biggest problem is remaining straight faced as the spymaster and giving no clues about how accurate any guess is. No reaching for a card, no nodding or shaking of your head, no noises, no smiles, nothing. You have to sit there and be straight-faced, it’s a little exhausting. Still, the game is excellent and will be a go-to party game for a while.

This is a good word based party game. A clue giver for each team tries to give one word clues to relate a set of words and get their team to guess all of their words before the other team. The game is simple and easy to teach. However, it is so easy and well received that I have burnt out on it already. I am not a huge fan of party games in general, but I don't particularly enjoy any game 16 times in a row... literally.

The great thing about this game is that it has the flexibility to handle a wide number of players, anywhere from 2 to upwards of 8 or more at parties. It's also reasonably simple to explain. That said, it's definitely not a strategy game, so while it's entertaining, it's not completely satisfying.

Pretty straightforward party game, but for some reason people always get carried away while playing it, especially when it gets close towards the end. We went on a board game retreat with 25 people recently and this one got played the most. Buy the game in your own language though, to give everyone an equal chance at winning. Not everyone knows the three different meanings a word might have in English.

This is a party game I greatly enjoy. You need a large group for it to shine though, anything less than 6 and it isn't worth pulling out as it just becomes a very quiet and unexciting game.

Being the clue giver can be so stressful but it's so rewarding when your team picks the right words and no that pesky assassin.

Codenames is a great, simple party game.  It is quickly taught.  Very accessible for those that don't play board games.  It is a fun way to use your brain, have fun with some friends, and spend an evening together.

It is a word game, so it will fit some people better than others.  It also has the same issue that other word games do that the better you know your team members, the better you will be.  I have seen someone give a Harry Potter based clue that netted them a 4 point turn.  I've also seen a very simple sports based clue that was lost on the guessers, as they didn't follow sports at all.  So knowing the person you are giving clues to helps.  We normally mix up teams every game or two to keep it interesting.  

The words in the game are not that complex so there isn't really a big issue with having to know obscure words/terms like there can be in other word games.  

There is also a disparity in the game in the level of difficultly based on if you are giving or receiving clues.  The job for the person giving the clues is much harder than the one guessing.  It is best if those new to the game guess clues first before trying to give them.

One minor downside to the game is that it slightly unbalanced due to the starting player phenomenon.  The team that starts guessing first has to guess one additional clue to make up for the fact that they get to guess first (since it is first to guess all of their cards wins starting first is a large advantage).  Additionally, if the first team does get some of their cards right, choices are removed from the board possibly making clue giving for the second team a bit more easy (as some potentially dangerous words have been removed).  Even with both of these effects our experience is that the team that starts will win the majority of the time (80% in the games that we have recorded information for though the sample size is too small to be statistically significant at this point).  So while it is probably the best that could have been done, it just wasn't enough in my opinion.  

The reason that there is a disparity even with the extra card is that in most games, a team will score 1 3-point turn, then mostly 2-point turns after that.  With in mind, the starting team will win in 4 turns (3, 2, 2, 2).  The second team will win in 4 turns as well (3, 2, 2, 1).  Unfortunately since the second team goes second, they will lose.  So finding that one 3-point clue is key as is making sure there are 2-point clues lined up.  Pulling off 2 3-point turns is very hard so compressing the 4-turn win down to 3 is hard for the second team.  The second teams best chance of winning is a mistake by the first turn team.  

Regardless, it's still fun either way and people really don't care so much about if they win or lose.  It's still just fun to play.  Plus it is fun to win with a disadvantage so it makes winning from the second position more rewarding.  I remember a game where the second place team got had two cards left as did we.  I was unable to come up with a good 2-point guess so I looked at their two cards left.  They had "Thumb" and "Van" and didn't feel that I had to push for the win so I opted for the 1-point safe route.  Then the other teams clue givers says "steer" and I knew the game was over.  That second place win was very memorable.  We also had a game where we got a 4-point clue on the last turn to snatch a win away from a team that was certain to win without it.  So even though the odds might be skewed, it's still a blast and the skew can actually create great situations in a very short game that wouldn't be there otherwise.

Additionally there are ways to mitigate this effect through playing multiple games if you like.  You can play two games, one with each team starting first and then sum the scores of how many clues you got when the game ended to determine the winner.  You can keep a score per player and just allow teams to be random and see which person did the best that night.  Etc.  We don't care enough about who "wins" to do this, but it seems that there are reasonable routes to reduce the effect through multiple games.

I highly recommend this game for anyone.  New to games or not.  Fantastic time nearly every game.

Some people spend way too much time over thinking the clues.  Others like to break the rules and give clues that are clearly not allowed.  The game isn't fun when either of these happen; the first makes the game take too long and the latter makes for a very unbalanced game in favor of the cheaters.

Otherwise, this is a pretty good party game that I would likely recommend anytime someone tries to pull out a traditional party game I loathe (Apples to Apples, Pictionary, etc).

I normally avoid party games, but Codenames is at the top of the food chain.  Things I like:

Clues from previous rounds help partners - and opponents! - in later rounds.

The mounting pressure as one team falls behind.

Tenous connections between words, friends, and acquaintances.

Fighting ninjas.*

One minor drawback is that the game starts with an immediate lull while the clue-givers digest the word grid and ponder potential clues.  But one man's lull is another man's naptime.


*This could be ninjas fighting each other, or me fighting a ninja.

Theme/Art:
The spy theme works pretty well, the art looks fine, but it's both not that important as Codenames is a party game and the words on the cards are the most important part of it.

Production quality:
It's all small cards and light cardboard, which are fine. However, the hourglass isn't the best I've seen in a game. It's completely optional though.

Replayability:
There are a LOT of different word cards, which have a different word on each side, and each spymaster-card can be used at all four angles, so the combinations are endless.

Depth/Difficulty:
The game is explained in about 5 minutes, but coming up with good hints can be really hard.

Strategy:
You have to think of hints that lead your team to as many spys as possible, but keep them away from the assassin and members of the other team. The two player variant recquires a bit more strategy, because each round the spymaster has to choose an enemy spy to uncover.

Luck:
The cards and the spymaster card are random, but you can come up with good hints for pretty much everything if you are creative enough.

Codenames takes abou 15-30 minutes to play, depending on how long the spymasters need to think of their hints.

It is a phenomenal party game (although not for big parties, more than 8 players could get a bit much), the only downside I can think of are the downtimes when a spymaster takes a long time to think. You can use the hourglass in this case though.

Having played this game a number of times times, and being horrible at it, I still enjoy it a lot. It is such a simple design yet it is so difficult! You are at once at the mercy of the card draw and your ability to convey the clue to your team, but at the same time, you're at the mercy of your teammates being able to understand the obscure clue that seemed to make sense to you but ended up taking them down a completely different path than expected.

I'm not the greatest with "word" games but this is one of those social games that I enjoy quite a bit and one that has gone over well "gamers" and "non-gamers" alike.

The theme is rather pasted on and it is a game revolving around word association. However, it has immense replayability. It requires more rather than fewer players to play well. It also works better if one plays it with friends or relatives, rather than strangers. Component quality is above average while the artwork is simple but effective enough. The rules are really simple, so it can be taught in under 5 minutes.

I have Codenames, Codenames: PIctures and Codenames: Duet and I'm logging all plays under Codenames rather than adding extra games to my collection and dividing plays among the 3.

This one took me by surprise, I'm a bit burnt out on party and filler games but Codenames cuts through all of that. I like that it will play a big group, the rules are in no way esoteric and the theme is fairly neutral which makes the game very accessible.

I prefer words over the pictures.

Duet is really fun.

cool team guessing party gameish thing... associate words together in groups using a "clue" word, then give that clue plus the number of words you've associated to your team guessers... race the other team to find all your team's words before they do... tricky...

RATING: 4
Fun word-centered party style game. Can lead to some laughs, groans, and an overall decent time. Sadly I don't see the game working well in Swedish, given that we use compound words excessively, so our "one word clues" could with some trickery encompass all 8-9 cards that you want your team to locate.

I also don't know why this appeals so much to people, as it's too calm for a good party game, and not interesting, nor deep enough to be such a quite time. It's just not my bag.

It's as great as everyone says it is. The English is sadly a problem for some friends, especially since the game leans heavily on synonyms and such wordplay. Dutch version will be released soon so I'll probably get that one too.

A present from my BGG Secret Santa 2016.

It's a really fun game with a big group of people. Although sometimes it's really hard listening to those discussions going back and forth when the hint was so clear! (Well at least I thought it was clear). ;)

Codenames has been a runaway hit with family, friends, and even my high school students. I've played with every number of players from 2 to 8. While team interaction is removed from games with fewer than 5-6, any size group works. I've even played with two players many times.

RATING: 6
I don't particularly like word association.  I simply lack the type of creativity to do particularly well with it.  I also don't like games where there is substantial downtime where you can't be thinking about your next move. So... my first experience with Codenames was a complete flop.  When I finally played again it was with a much faster playing group and I saw a lot more of the fun of the game!  I'm not sure it would ever be my "party game" of choice... but I won't be actively avoiding it in the future provided there are always enough people for proper teams and we use a timer.

It's not just a party game, it's a psychological profiling tool. You'll never be able to get a better vocabulary mind-mapping of your tablemates than with Codenames. ("WHY would you associate 'China' with a WEDDIN... OHHHH.")

An excellent and really fun word game that works great for medium to large groups :) I had a blast with this game. Trying to get into your partner's head while also trying to recall words which were used before is a wondrous combination. This game works great! Also, we tried it with a variation by using Cards Against Humanity answer cards in place of the regular words, and it was crazy! But really funny :)

EDIT: I've lost a lot of interest in this game over the last year or so. Phenomenal for the first good amount of plays, but I just don't really enjoy it like I used to.

Clever word game by Vlaada himself.  It appears to be a party game but it isn't.  Early play in each round tends to get bogged down while players look for links between the 25 word cards.  Picks up speed as the game progresses but the next round grinds to a halt again.

RATING: 2
This game is good in theory, and probably fine for people who are good with words/language, but as a math/science/numbers guy - I hated this. It was tolerable as a guesser (once there was actually something to guess), but it was just awful as the clue-giver. There's so many words on the board and you have to think of a phrase that suits your own words but not the opponent's, and it either winds up taking forever to go through all the words and come up with a good clue, or you just hurry up to move the game along and don't make much progress because the clue you give isn't as useful as it could/should have been if you'd had more time to think about it. This would be much better in a different format, like an online message board maybe, where you could drag the game out much longer and take several hours to come up with the clue. Trying to do it live in just a few minutes is just terrible because everyone is basically just sitting around waiting for the next clue, which is boring.

After first 2 games: Feels like the game is always really intresting and challenging for the leader, but it felt a little boring (too easy) for the agents (guessers) at least when the leader gave only 1 hint everytime.
The problem is worse if there are more agents in the teams, because it gets easier when there are more brains to solve the puzzle(hint)given by the leader.

In my opinion the game is best with 4 players (2vs2) and next time we try the game with obligatory "2 hint rule" to add more challenge. 
I bet the game will be real fun after that mod :)
All in all easily the best word quessing game on the market! +++

This is a fun party "game". it has variants for lots of different # of players. and I like the rating of win states at the end of the game based on how long it to to do the puzzle. All that said i have to give the game a one as it is not really a game, its a word association puzzle, that requires at least 2 people to attempt. 
Now if this was rating it as a puzzle or an "ice breaker" socialization tool, i would have to give it a solid 8. As is I have to rate it as NOT a game.

GAME: Star Trek: Customizable Card Game (first edition)
RANK: 4458
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
As it was one of the first CCGs, I can excuse the mistakes, but this game is pretty broken.  Without any kind of cost structure, the Rare cards are just WAAAAAYY better than the common ones.  You can play Data (with amazing stats) or Ensign Redshirt (with awful stats) for the same "cost", so which would you guess is better?

Aaaagh!  Why did Decipher ruin it with 2nd Ed?!  I have collected all but 7 cards of the entire set.  If anyone wants a game, let me know and I'll be around in a sec.

I have 2 complete decks, and probably about 1000 "extra" cards.  I hope to actually play this game someday.

RATING: 2.5
Played this a bit back in middle school.  Not all that enjoyable. Kind of non-confrontational feeling with players going to planets and doing stuff for points rather than interacting with each other. Interesting, but boring idea for a CCG.

Also, it seemed like you needed a lot more than a couple starters and some boosters to make a deck that you could actually work with. There were just so many different types of cards you got (like planets, events, ships, crew, missions, all for different factions), but really needed a number of specific types for a decent deck (like, maybe a number of decent ships and crewmen all from the Federation or Klingon empire). Also, cards didn't have a cost to put into play; this means that cards were highly imbalanced in that rares were [i]always[/i] better than commons.

RATING: 1.1
So how bad are collectible card games?  Even though Babylon 5 is superior to Star Trek in every way imaginable and unimaginable, I rate both of their CCGs the same: CCG has enough suck to pull B5 down to Trek's level.  It's like comparing infinity + 1 to infinity + 100.  Both are infinity: thus, the suckiness of CCGs: able to neutralize any inherent advantage one game may have over another (namely that B5 is way better than Star Trek).  If it were possible for a CCG to be any worse, it would be [thing=483][/thing], which is why this actually does not get a 1 rating.

So you buy a "game," but the problem is you can't play it.  The [i]idea[/i] behind a game is that you buy it and then you buy expansions to give you a richer gaming experience...not so fast, my friends.  With CCGs, you buy a broken & unplayable game, and then after you spend a significant amount of money -- I won't tell you how much, just keep chucking that money over and I'll tell you when it's good -- THEN, you have an actual [i]playable[/i] game, and if you spent more than everybody else, you win.  Sound fun?  Why not?  You get pictures of Picard, Data, and the Enterprise on it.  Isn't that fun?  How can you call yourself a loyal Trekker and say that game isn't the most awesome thing e-vah?

But if you replaced the crew members of the Enterprise with dinosaurs, I think I would buy every expansion.  Instead of a boring, Shakespeare-quoting, Earl Grey Tea-drinking wuss, your captain would be a roaring, flesh-eating T.Rex?  Man, just [i]thinking[/i] about that takes me to my happy place.

RATING: 5
A servicable ccg with frustrating card rarity and large scale rule bloating as it acquired expansions. Decks tended to be very similar either due to the power level of chase/rare cards or the limited viable options with out such cards. Later expansions tried to drastically increase the scope of the game with new mechanics, these generally resulted in confusing interactions and poor playability between eras of the game.

Run around trying to complete missions before your opponent can do likewise.  The only problem is that the Major Characters are so much better than the ordinary crew member, so why would you border to put those in your deck.  No real players interaction.

RATING: 6
CCG -> Paper Crack.  If you have the wallet to enjoy a CCG, then this is a respectable option.  The game captures the partial military - partial scientific nature of the Star Trek universe.  Cards depict images from the Next Generation Star Trek series.  The cards are well produced, but some of the cards appear to be reaching for elements to include in the game.  Game play is quite reasonable and interesting 'stories' emerge during game play.  [GTI Code: TPSL]

Of the various CCGs I was foolish enough to collect back in the day, this is the one I dropped the most staggering amount of money on. Gameplay was horrible (not at all helped by me being horrendously bad at it; though at least that got me a free t-shirt as a consolation price when ending last at the one tournament I visited). About the only positive thing I can say about the game is that it had really shiny images of the starships, which was what got me started with this in the first place, as I used to consider myself a fan.

RATING: 6
Well...it seems like an ok game that needed further development to be more streamlined. The foundation does support possibilities for various strategies but it lacks discipline in the rules and the mechanics I think, and the main set collection mechanic to achieve goals should be more lenient. Overall, not as professionally designed as other CCG's I'm afraid.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Certainly a fun game, true to the universe. Implementation though was a bit tedious, requiring about 15 minutes set up time (significant for a card game). I played it a lot in the 90s, in fact it was my first CCG, but was then replaced by Star Wars and Middle Earth CCGs.

This game had some promise. It captured the "away mission" theme very well. You could win by going on missions and could avoid direct conflict if you chose. I recall it had a card or two that seemed to be broken. I played it for awhile until Star Wars CCG came out. I sold all of my cards.

Used to play this a *lot* when I was a teenager.  Only now I realise how bad it really is.  Has been improved a lot in its 2nd Edition re-implementation, but still relies a lot on memorising skill lists for each of your (and your opponent's) personnel.  Dilemma resolution also involves too much reading-and-checking, too.  Despite all this, the game still holds a special place in my heart (Decipher.com is still my homepage).

RATING: 4
Lack of deploy costs makes this a game of He Who Spends The Most, Wins.  For that reason, there's absolutely no point in using no-name characters if you have mains.  Hated the linear "space-line"...  Couldn't they at least have made it circular?  And the seeding phase takes too long.  Good-looking cards, though!

I'm a Trekkie and I have competed at tournaments in this game, but..

The games takes a long time before anything happens. When the download-mechanism came it went faster, but it's still far from the best CCG's.

Yes, I own all the cards from 1E. Never tried 2E.

And I mostly played a Ferengi-deck. Not because they were good, just because they are the most fun the Star Trek-universe has ever came up with.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A very poorly designed CCG that used to give me hours upon hours of fun with a friend.  Half or more of the fun came from the puns and other humor we derived from the alien names.

I have trouble imagining that I will be talked into playing this again.

I wish this game was more fun, but as is, all you have to do is build a deck with the Enterprise and its crew, wait in the starbase until you have assembled them all on the ship, and then go solve missions easier and faster than Data reading a novel.

I bought a shitload of these, following up on my Magic the Gathering addiction. I figured I really liked the TV series, so I'd probably love the cardgame too, right? Wrong! I thought the game was not compelling at all. Probably played about 5 games and that was that.

PS: lots of 1E Premiere (black border) and even some boosters (unopened, of course) for sale!

My collection of the Star Trek CCG 1st Edition consists of six various starter decks, along with lots of the Premiere base set of cards. Plus a variety of cards from: Warp Packs, Alternate Universe, Q-Continuum, First Contact, and Deep Space Nine expansions. (Filling up two 14" length card storage boxes.) Let me know if you have any questions or if I can give you any additional description.

The first edition of this game was a dismal failure for one of the main design flaws in ccgs - failure to attach costs to cards.  Thus, first person to play Red Alert wins... very, very disappointing.

But then!  Second Edition!  And a complete revamp that adds costs to cards and greatly polishes up the basic game.  I've enjoyed playing this even though it is often two player solitare.  How is it the universe cannot create a decent game with this most profitable subject matter?

Played this in my teens and really liked it but everyone i played with moved. Then i sold all my cards only to buy it all back last week. I havent played it 8 years but im back with people to play with. This time ill just keep it all. Its a great ccg game. Theres so many cards to pick from there is some over kill since you only get to pick 60 cards to play with.

I spent an awful lot of my lunch money on this during elementary school.  I even saved for months to spend over $100 ordering the 18-card Fajo collection.  But after being asked to repurchase everything after the re-release when they dropped support I gave up on TCG's for a long, long time.  I'm glad I didn't bother with the second edition, because they dropped that not long after.  Still, at it's core this game was fantastic.  Especially with all the first contact content added.  I only wished that the borg were playable (And I played as though they were with anyone who would let me).

My friend and I used to walk down to the game store every lunch period and buy some boosters. On the way back to work, we would bust open the packs and see what we got like two little kids at Christmas. This feeling of discovery is one of the reasons CCGs can be so addictive; sometimes a big payoff for a small investment. Unfortunately, like heroin, it eventually ruins your life, because the high gets less and less rewarding as the expenditure gets greater and greater!

Oh, anyway, about the game...it was no [gameid=463] or [gameid=1301], but the theme was solid and the gameplay was interesting enough. I believe this was one of the first games to make rare cards more powerful, which to me, is just plain mean.

Played once. One game was enough for me.

I am a Star Trek fan. I loved the next generation series. It's the reason why I bought some starters and some boosters in the first place without checking out some information about this card game. 

Not as fun as I thought. I am happy that I found a buyer for my cards. Some rare cards are very powerful. Deck wise it can be unbalance for some players. It would be a challenge to play with just common and uncommon cards in your deck.

Not something that I would want to play anytime soon. It's simply not my kind of card game. It doesn't really impress me as game.

It's very doubt full that I would replay this game any time soon to see if my opinion changes.

It doesn't really hold my interest. There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time. Why would you spend time playing a bad game when you can play a game which is more worth your time and enjoyment?

I don't plan to play Star Trek: TNG card game any time soon.


SOLD IT.

One of the more complicated CCGs out there, brimming with unnecessary rules that get more absurd the more expansions one picks up.  All that aside, Star Trek is a blast, and captures a feeling of adventure better than almost any other CCG.  Star Trek is best kept simple, with as few expansions and affiliations tossed in as your inner Trekkie will allow.  It has a very distinct feel to it, with the pre-game "Seed" portion of the game requiring immense strategy, and the main game having a sense of menace and risk as you uncover unknown threats on planets and star systems.

With every expansion came the promise of an expanded gaming experience but the same thing happened again and again: a new deck paradigm was made king while existing ones were hozed.  Suffered badly from card specific strategies which had to be countered in a very precise way.  The silver bullet formula of fixing problem deck types was a Decipher specialty (cards that counter other cards by name is a bad idea).  In the end the game was unplayable and I look with remorse at the amount of cards I acquired.

I have a lot of nostalgic memories of this CCG from my youth.  I remember playing this during lunch in junior high and being the only one with a Romulan deck (this was pre-expansions).  Unfortunately it doesn't hold up that well as a game.  I think the lack of a costing system really kills it.  Why would I put a crappy common character in my deck when I could stack it with rare characters?    This one will always have a special place in my heart.

Not bad if care is taken to ensure that both players have access to the same set of cards to customize their decks from. Lot of interesting possibilities and strategies are available.

However, if this is not ensured - so that one player has access to thousands of cards and the other one only to a few hundred this can be quite a meaningless exercise.

Rather dull and uninspired collectible card game. Attempts to "spice it up" in later expansions just created a mess. Still, there's a good game in there SOMEWHERE - if only I could find it and make use of the 1000's of cards I collected. 2nd Edition cleaned up play some, but lacks a true Trek "feel" IMHO.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
If you play the game without the Borg affiliation and the bloat of extra rules that followed (that put many off it), it is a good game. I use a dilemma deck (like the 2nd edition) and created decks with 50 cards for six affiliations. The missions are seeded from a deck with the appropriate icons. This means any two players can sit down and play without either having to own the game like the "Two player game."

Collected these when they first came out - thank goodness I had a job! Put away in the attic for 20 years without knowing anyone to play with. 

Pulled out of the attic and played my very first game with my 11 year old. It was like I bought these as a teenager just to play with my son. 

Huge online community still playing and releasing expansions. Very fun and feels like trek.

RATING: 4.5
Beam down to the planet with the right skills to succeed at various planets or attack opponent ships -- but the game wasn't designed from both and it shows in initial plays before any expansion. Not really attractive to players not interested in Star Trek already.

BIG PLUS: star characters (while rare) not necessary
BIG MINUS: neither goal is strong enough to drive play, mechanics are weak

I have only enjoyed playing this game solo; I just didn't get why the first version of this game was so popular. You HAVE to be a Trekkie to enjoy this game. You had to be a gaming fiend to be successful in a competitive environment; dilemmas were too easily abused by the advanced player.

Version 2.0 is much better, more interactive. It is because of the 2.0v that I have given this game a "6" otherwise it would be a "4"

I'm not normally a CCG fan, but I tried this one out (I got my hands on a sample pack), and actually enjoyed it.  Still, there are better Star Trek-themed games out there - and certainly MUCH more detailed - and I would rather not continually spend the money to expand a deck or two for ANY CCG...

It's not the "Seti Alpha V" of Star Trek games, but it's not a "Risa" either...     ;)

A classic Star Trek experience. In some ways it pushes the CCG genre into role playing territory allowing you to do tons of things from the Star Trek universe even if not strategically useful (i.e. go back in time to 1986 to rescue some whales). Some clunky rules aside, the game is still being actively managed and improved by a Players Committee. Lots of fun.

As a Trek fan and a SW:CCG fan I wanted to like this game. There were severe balance issues during this game's run. Barring those issues the game was fundamentaly boring. The game was playable (with help) in limited (sealed deck form) so that makes this game better than many ill-concived ccgs. Yet, the lack of engaging constructed play really hurt this game. A strong license and a modest fan base kept this game alive longer than it deserved.

Deciphers other large CCG plays a little differently to the awesome Star Wars but with a similar level of complexity. To win you have to beat your opponent to 100 points by crewing your favourite starships and sending them off on missions, just like the TV show this does a great job of recreating that feel.

This is by far the CCG that I have spent most money on, and why? It's Star Trek. Unfotunately the rules and card are not overly balanced, which is probably why I hadn't lost a game in over 4 years when I was still playing. I had more cards than anybody else, so I had the potential to make killer decks. Not at all fun. But I still like the game, and now people borrow cards from me to make decks, so the playing field is being leveled, but there are still to many ways to break the rules and make killer decks to make it a fair and balanced game.

The first CCG I ever owned. I enjoyed the mechanic of mission completion for victory. When the game introduced the Borg as a playable race and gameplay became more combat-oriented I lost interest in the game.

STCCG was a good game but, as is usually the way with CCG and LCG, it got bogged down in complexity as each new card release came out. As a collector, each new set was greeted with eager enthusiasm, but heaping complexity on complexity made the game increasingly unplayable. Decipher realised this and introduced a revised game but, by then, the damage had already been done, and the game lost all but its most die-hard enthusiasts. I still have my collection, with all the rares and super-rares, foils and other gimmickry, but if I want to play the game, I stick to a couple of simple basic decks. I still have enough unopened packs in reserve to enable 'sealed deck' games (the most interesting and playable tournament version of the game). The tin box shown in the BGG listing was an early reissue of the entire first (pre-expansion) set; as such it is just the tip of the iceberg.

I used regularly to take Edmund to official STCCG tournaments in London when he was 9 or 10: which invariably meant he was by far the youngest and I was at least marginally the oldest competitor.

Ah, yes... ST:CCG. The CCG back in the day I truly wanted complete collections of. The problem is, when it got to the point where the boosters I was purchasing revealed nothing but commons I already had way too multiples of, a rare card which either; a) I already had, or: b) made me incredulously react as to have no understanding why such a crummy ability was a fucking RARE (USS Hood, anyone), I started shoplifting. No, not boosters, singles. And rares too. My apologies, I was young then and didn't really understand or have anyone to talk about the inherently manipulative and profit-seeking model of the trading card business. so, being the egocentric that I was, I just stole wodges of rare singles from one card store (they've since closed down, I can't imagine why considering the nature of the industry). I pretty much collected all the rares I needed from Premiere, AU and First Contact. 

Anyway, here endeth the history lesson about my attachment to the game. Unfortunately, I only played this game once, and thought it was unbalanced, and mechanically boring. Boring such that I hate any game where the goal is to race to a high score. Boring such that there were no away team or space battles. Good riddance to you, Decipher. I hear you made more errors of judgment about this game than I could ever conceive. Live and learn, 'eh?

1st edition was, for me, a mess of style over subtance by the end; it was marred from the start by the lack of proper costing, giving undue power to unbalanced rarer cards. 2nd edition of the game cleans the slate and builds an elegant and impressive game. Suffers from buy-the-most-win-the-most less than many CCGs, and is nicely balanced.

Wildly unbalanced; no "casting cost" equivalent led to rares being strictly better, by a lot, than commons - and also, any character you have ever heard of was rare. Did not age well at all. Part of the Great CCG Flood, and not one of the good ones.

This was the first CCG I ever really got into, and I played and collected it all the way up until The Borg expansion, when the shop I played at closed down. It got better and better with each expansion and became a really immersive experience in the Star Trek universe. Sure, the rules blew out with each new expansion, but when you were playing it at tournament level, you just accepted that and moved on.

I first purchased this trading card game as a present in 1994 but the person I got it for wasn't too interested despite being big into Star Trek. Less than a year later I aquired it as I too was getting into Star Trek: TNG during my weekday routine as it was shown on Sky One at 5pm. I decided to play the game for myself and found that a nice little section of Virgin Megastore was dedicated to trading card games. I quickly gorged on the booster packs and Autumn 1995 release of the Alternate Universe Expansion.

For the next six years Decipher knocked out several more Expansions but the game became so large and cumbersome that I eventually lost interest. Some trading card games, such as Magic The Gathering, can work well with all of the expansions clumped together but Star Trek couldn't properly accommodate all of the many hundreds of new cards and they were really better off played on their own. If only the gameplay was refined and a little more restricted this could have been a series that lasts to this day but they got over-ambitious. A shame, since I have many happy memories of playing this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Nice use of theme, but "fragile" card relations (some cards obviously more powerful than others, subsequent cards released specifically to neuter the unbalanced cards).  Stretched the theme to breaking with release after release until I just didn't care anymore.  Can be fun for ST:TNG fans, but not worth the effort otherwise.

The second attempt at a Star Trek CCG, better done than before, but still not complex enough. Once again enourmous cardbase, nice screencaptures and good gameplay mechanics, but becomes boring after some time, because of to much repetetivness.

Well...I LOVED this game. The theme being the First 'Non-Freaky-mytic-sword-and-sorcery' junk that PERFORATES all types of extreme gaming!?! THANK GOD someone did a CCG, or GAME for that matter, that featured what was then "the number ONE licensed intellectual property one EARTH: Star Trek"!I 'WISH' they had explored/developed more 'official' variant Rules. We played often with Minis - and did COMBAT type scenarios, limited deck size, etc. I appreciated 'Warp Speed' and Multi-Player formats, of course. I like the "no duplication in the universe" optional rule. LOTS of great options - sadly never properly pursued by the 'un-creative' group who lucked on the license.Then, they just got more 'limited' in their vision coming out with 'second edition' - all because just a couple of 'talentless geeks' with nothing better to do go their 'ear' and fed them a bunch of stupidity!?! Oh well...it just goes to show you: the people on the Internet causing most of the ruckus - are 'exactly' the people who wont be buying your game in bulk anyways - so do the 'opposite' of the suicide they suggest and you'll succeed!Anyways, I've got a LOT of nice cards - many of them still SEALED!!! I'm sure interested in seeing some Variant stuff here.

I normally dislike CCGs, but this one actually isn't too bad.  I played 2nd edition, which I'm told is better than 1st.  There are some nice mechanics at work here.  The game seems very long for what it is, but that may just have been our inexperience at work rather than the game itself.  There are a lot of rules to assimilate, but I got the hang of it fairly quickly once I started playing.

Another CCG that I never really liked but for some reason, I seem to have a lot of cards for. It‚Äôs been too long for me to remember the specifics of why I didn‚Äôt like it, I vaguely remember the mission system never felt natural, it was clunky, and the player interaction seemed limited. The TV series suffered from being painfully politically correct and I recall the card game suffering the same traits.

I began playing this game in 1995.  I really do enjoy it, although it can be really difficult for players to learn, as it is very rules heavy and players can manipulate things so there is a lot going on.  www.trekcc.org is the place to go.  The Continuing Committee still puts out virtual sets that are free to download, print, and play.  Very dedicated and active community.

Another game where I love the idea of it, but something seems not quite right.  Love the cards, characters, ships, and concept, but the actual gameplay is a little dry.  It seems that a super crew can take on most anything, and a small compliment can be stranded in space in no time.  I feel like a rules tweak could somehow save this game, but I'm not sure what could be changed to do so.

Would recommend for Collector-Trekkies. For a CCG it has a very strong "storytelling" aspect - plays almost like watching a good ST episode. Downsides: Rules for combat & player interaction are flawed. Exhausting deck construction & "seeding" the space-time-continuum is not for everyone.

RATING: 10
Love this game. Captures the flavor and enormity of Star Trek brilliantly. You can do almost anything you can think of from the shows and movies. It's a huge and complex game. 

Star Trek CCG First Edition has drastically evolved over the years. It's changed a lot since Premiere, the first set from 94. I would recommend introducing yourself to the game with (the still available and now very cheap) Voyager starters and the printable cards from trekcc.org (where new sets are still being released). There are also several players online using LakceyCCG. The game has a serious learning curve but it's worth it.

There were some major drawbacks to the first edition of the game that were fixed in the second edition. However, the charm with which the game was built can't be replaced. Each expansion brought an appropriate expansion into the greater Star Trek universe and timeline; something that was skipped over with the 2nd edition, probably in hopes that it wouldn't feel like a total loss and step back in time to players who were very set in playing 1st Ed. with the array of characters available to them.

A sentimental favorite; this is the game that hooked me into constructed-deck card games. In retrospect, interaction was too limited, the cards were imbalanced, and the rules were overly complicated; expansions generally exacerbated these problems. However, true Trekkies will enjoy this game's almost fanatical devotion to its theme.

Only played this a few times and I really did enjoy it. I rated it low because I couldn't afford to keep buying the cards in hopes of getting the darn bridge crew. I gave up... didn't even get one of the bridge crew. This was probably the end of the end of my playing CCG's

As a trekkie this game was a no-brainer for me a decade ago. And it is a good game. It suffered from all those additional rules introduced with each expansion. There is still a very vibrant community for this game, but the second edition is much easier to get into.

Good game, but it can be better if sometimes it's not a rules experiment for Star Wars in some apects. And the politics of "more rules for expansion" from Decipher don't help to make it easy to play. Feels like they're try to fix rules that doesn't work with expansions.

Played quite a lot when I used to play CCGs. It wasn't a bad game, but from what I remember, rare cards were really needed to build competitive decks. Some of the ideas were interesting, it looked thematically faithful (but I know next to nothing about Star Trek), but I would definitely not choose this CCG if I wanted to play one again now. I suppose I still own my cards somewhere.

Beautiful cards featuring facts and characters from the long TNG run. Game system is quite good and chances of success high even without the big names (all rare cards of course). Strategy may depend upon card draw a bit too much but the seeding phase of dilemma is a nice way to counterbalance early luck. I have lots of TNG cards, and almost all the First Contact and Voyager series.

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#FF9933][b]aaj's FAVORITE REALTIME GAME[/b][/BGCOLOR][/COLOR]
New players can pick this game up very quickly, and defeated players are always hungry for another chance to defeat the temple. Once we've won the base games, there's alternate soundtracks, curses and treasures, Queenies, and expansions to throw in the mix. 

I honestly can't see myself (or my game group) growing tired of this game because Queen provides so much control in adjusting the difficulty of the temple. With the exception of teaching newbies (which remains difficult because they aren't used to the game), no rounds are ever ho-hum for me.

Some folks have grown tired of the game around on the forums, but playing one or two rounds a month has kept it pretty fresh in our group. It's definitely long-lasting, and the expansions go even further than the base game in keeping it fresh. 

I have run into some trouble when playing this game with other people -- due to my wife and I playing it two-player so often, we're [I]very[/I] experienced in the temple and we can often be bored by a temple that others consider to be quite difficult! We get around this by either handicapping ourselves in some way or by sitting out of the game and managing it (selecting the different quests to tune the difficulty, etc). Overall, that's just a disappointing wrinkle on a great game.

Escape was one of the first games I bought, and the basic idea of a timed game with a soundtrack and real-time dice rolling will never get old to me. That said, the game isn't without its flaws, though it's still a venerated favorite in my collection.

I'm not a fan of a frenzied dice rolling fiesta. With that said, I found this very difficult to play well, given the pressure one is under due to the timed element of the game.

It's not bad for what it is... I just expected something a bit different, I suppose.

Gotta love games played in real time.  I've never seen such a frenzy of dice rolling in my life.  The soundtrack that you play as the timer really lends to the panic you feel that you might be trapped in the temple.

Escape is a pretty unique game that uses a soundtrack as one of its main mechanics.

LIKE: Rolling dice is fun, the cooperative franticness can get quite crazy.
DISLIKE: High energy, can get loud. Sometimes difficult to know what to do. A little bit fiddly, but not too bad.

OVERALL: I fun game for a lively group. I can't play this too often because it gets too loud.

RATING: 7
Early on, this game is wildly fun. But if you play it enough times, you'll understand there is a fairly routine way to defeat the game. Then you find yourself tossing in curses and treasures - and even adding a few gems. This is all nice in that you can increase the difficulty. But after several plays, the excitement dampens and the game loses interest. More of a cute exercise - and I appreciate it for that. But this one likely does not have long legs.

RATING: 9
I love this game.  I like the real time aspect.  It is only 10 minutes long, learning curve is fast. There needs to be Individual cards to explain the curses, and treasures.  This is what slows things down at times. "UMMM what is this curse again."

I steal this comment in toto from User Wentu, as I agree whole-heartedly:
"the admiral game of Queen at Spiel 2012 is a light cooperative real time game that can be played once, just to see the novelty, and then left in its box forever. the fun is limited, the chaos is not.
you simply throw dices over and over yelling to other people how many colored masks you have. pointless."

This game came out really strong the first night we played it, and I was pleased enough to give it a 9 after several plays for being tense, exciting, and challenging.  We'll see if this initial enthusiasm holds up, but I have high hopes!

I'm discovering that I really enjoy real-time games like Galaxy Trucker and Space Alert, and Escape is so far an excellent addition!

Update:  Ouch, looks like the honeymoon is over!  This game hasn't hit the table in a long time.  I think my group either wants something deeper, or wants something more competitive.  Dropping to a 6.

RATING: 7.5
As far as I saw, I tend to like real-time games more in theory than when I'm actually playing them at the table. The frenzy of going against a clock makes in fact this kind of games quite exciting while you are playing them, but more often than not I unfortunately leave the table with a strange feeling of dissatisfaction. I don't know if it's because these games are so light or because I expect more from them, but I don't seem to be able to particularly enjoy them. For the most part Escape makes no exception to this rule.

Yet I really like this game. It has clearly many strengths: the production quality is very high, the game is easy to teach and play, it's very fast, it's cooperative and it's quite exciting while you're playing.

I wasn't happy with some elements of its game-play though. For one thing the game seems pretty easy to win and that usually isn't something you want from a cooperative game, because the frustration resulting from the losses is very important to build up to the moment you actually beat the game and cheer. However this might not be necessarily a flaw, if you're looking for a more family friendly experience. What bothers me more it's the repetitiveness of the game-play. It's not just the fact that you're basically rolling dice for 10 minutes, but more that the game plays out the same way every time: explore the temple, remove crystals, find the exit.

Fortunately both of these problems were solved by the many expansions that the game has. In particular I think that the Doomed expansion brings a good deal of variety, thanks to the treasures and the curses, and a new level of challenge to the game. It makes it for a considerably better experience.

So, summing up, "Escape: The Curse of the Temple" is a pretty good product as a filler and a game to play with family. It deserves its success without a doubt. Personally though, I feel the game needs to be played with the expansions in order to satisfy my personal gaming taste. Still pretty nice though! Very good game.

Rating without expansions: 6.5

In this game you have to explore a dungeon, collect as many gems as you can, and exit, and do all of this in exactly 10 minutes. The mechanics are simple: you roll dice and execute the rolled icons. It is cooperative, as you win only if all players have exited. It is fast and funny, a good partygame.

I'd rather play: JUNGLE SPEED (realtime shenanigans)

The tension is great, but two issues -

i) it IS just dice-rolling. There aren't really any decisions. Sometimes you have to go back, or choose a direction, but these aren't meaningful. 

ii) people cheat a lot accidentally, and sometimes just because pressure mounts -YMMV.

Real-time game which is easy to teach and fun to play. You really feel as if you're escaping a temple, and really feel like dying when it collapses on you. 
It loses a point for gameplay, not because it is a bad game, but just because the amount of thinking required for this game is minimal. The Zombie version supposedly fixes that, bringing in some more strategy, which I think would do the game good.

It was hard to resist the excitement from many of the video reviews I had watched prior to picking this up, though after experiencing it myself, It did not wow me in the same way. It's mildly amusing. That's my box quote. Mostly it was chaotic and stressful, and the dice hitting the table constantly from everyone creates an Awful din! It's so hard to hear the soundtrack over it, you have to crank the volume, and that just isn't pleasant.

Pretty much the definition of "mindless fun with dice."  Silly soundtrack, good realtime components, and well-handled atmosphere makes it a game that's generally good for a quick sit-down without much teaching of finickiness.  A bit of detraction for needing a sound system and a surprising amount of table space.

Only played once, and the hectic dice rolling does give a primal satisfaction. However, if you have any in your group with less than exceptional honesty, you might want to consider something else as there is no oversight from one player to the other for honesty in rolling.  Otherwise a great concept and execution, even if I don't always have the energy for it.

I have a lot of fun with this game. My wife... not so much. I still have yet to play the modules that the game comes with, so I am excited for that. I still have fun with just the base game though. My only real beef I have with this game is that I wish the tracks on the CD ended with a clearer note. I'm not sure what it is, but when I play this with my family we notice that the second track has started and we didn't hear the end? But maybe that is because we are so enthralled by this game and our hearts are pounding not to be stuck inside this temple forever! It is a lot of fun and like an Indiana Jones theme which is just awesome.

It's quick, cute, and chaotic. The basic concept is very simple, and it can be a real riot as you get up to 4 or 5 players. Nicely cooperative, and simultaneous action reduces the "backseat driver" problem some coop games have. Using the soundtrack really adds to the theme of the game and ratchets up the tension. Fun, but despite its deceptive difficulty, it won't ever be much more than a filler to me at 10 minutes max.

The other great co-op game with dice, this one is great for an evening warm-up or Indiana Jones themed gaming night.  The only issue I have is that the game is pretty easy!  With the standard amount of gems we usually exit the temple before the second gong/pause.  The expansions are good but not great - they vary up the experience but using them all makes the game too convoluted.  However properly implemented to make more themed temples is a great way to spice up the base experience.

Not a bad game, but not one I felt like I had to have in my collection.  It didn't take too many plays to start feeling repetitive.  

If I had a need for a 15 minute filler I would have considered keeping it.  Since I don't like keeping games in my collection that I don't plan to play often, I had to cull it out.

Frantic... If I had to summarize this game in one word.  This is another anti euro game.  There is a small amount of strategy and a high amount of luck.

If you are a person who gets flustered easily, needs minutes to plot moves or has a hard time adapting to rapidly changing conditions this game is most likely not going to be one you will enjoy

RATING: N/A
Played at two seperate games nights (2 times each night) and it was pretty fun if not very deep. I have yet to win, but that's ok, the fun is in trying. My main complaint so far, is that the simultaneous nature of the game makes it hard to teach to others and make sure they're being adhering to the rules on their die results.

RATING: 5
Simple to teach, simple to play, frantic, and somewhat fun with the right people. Need to be in the right mood to play this though. The game just wasn't that interesting to us as a 2-player game. Sold to make room for other games. Also, we couldn't help but laugh every time the game started and the voice called out "ASS CAPE!"

En una primera impresión es gracioso y original pero tras unas cuantas partidas pierde casi toda su gracia y encanto.

Demasiado caótico para mi gusto, es demasiado simple hasta para ser un filler. Tras la sorpresa inicial se disuelve como un azucarillo y resulta repetitivo. 

Aunque los componentes son de buena calidad, el juego resulta caro para lo que es capaz de ofrecer en el medio plazo.

En la parte buena, las primeras partidas son muy divertidas y las risas están más que aseguradas.

A fast and fun co-op dice chucker. The soundtrack countdown keeps you on your toes helps hide what is a very simple game of matching symbols. The game works best when everyone is invested in it and putting maximum energy into it. Otherwise it can fall flat a bit.

The first game with my friends was a huge disapointment :-( they really didn't like the real time stress. When the 10 minutes were over nobody wanted to go for another 10 minutes.
What a pitty... Two years later (summer 2014) I played the game with my nieces and the game really worked great. We had a lot of fun and many many requests to play it again allways increasing the difficult level.
With some experience and a good team work you really can master the game and it provides a lot of fun and excitement.
I had to gave a copy of this game as a birthday present (which has already seen plenty of games played).

Klang in den verschiedenen Reviews recht interessant. In der Praxis muss man sich auf den Echtzeitdruck jedoch erst einmal einlassen. Der Zeitdruck und das Dauerwürfeln sind nicht unbedingt jedermanns Sache. Aber wenn man sich darauf einlässt, dann ist es ein sehr spannendes und kurzweiliges Spiel!
Am Anfang sollte man einen Soundtrack mit klaren Ansagen verwenden (der Directors Cut hier auf BGG ist sehr gut dafür geeignet, da er jeweils die letzen 10 Sekunden anzählt) ansonsten verpasst man in der Hektik den Gong und ist noch eher einen seiner Würfel los.

A real-time game done right. Simple rules for quick decision making that is just fun to play.

The game is very thematic; the time pressure and intensity you experience as you play makes you actually feel like you are in a collapsing temple needing to make quick decisions. You also feel a sense of camaraderie as you work together with the other players.

The only downside is that if the dice actually go your way and you work well together, the game can actually be too easy and a little anticlimatic. In a way, you kind of hope things don't completely go your way so that you can enjoy it even more when all of you make it out of the temple with seconds to spare.

I knew that it was pretty fun and accessible when I bought it, but I was still surprised to see it become one of my most played games. It is just so easy to play with anyone. The list of challenges on BGG is very nice to have. The down side is the desire for expansions (the Quest expansion, in particular, is important) and for promos. Queen Games can drain a good amount of money if you're not careful.

RATING: 7
Quick playing games are hard to find and frequently suffer from lackluster play.  This title is fast enough to hit multiple plays or can be the perfect filler for a longer game day.  The game play is very straight forward.  Its easy for players to start out without cooperation (and ultimately lose), but with a little cooperation and individual play, a team of players can beat the game without too much challenge.  This could be a problem, except that there are able ways to ratchet up the complexity of the challenges and should result in the game play being able to stand up to repeated plays.  This is not a gamer's game, but it is fairly novel in its design (or at least in limited company) and it really shines as a express filler.

Manic die rolling on a 10 minute timer, with lots of thematic dangers like curses, magic gem activation and countdown checks that keep your adventurer meeple on the move. Possibly the best tabletop translation of that infamous Indiana Jones scene on the market...and it only gets better with the variation that its modules and add ons bring. Curses and Treasures make it even more deadly and rewarding. Pure fun, sweat optional.

This game is super fun. It is really simple and doesn't involve a lot of thought or strategy, but it abounds in laughs and shouts of joy. I haven't played this game with anyone who didn't immediately ask to play it again. This won't ever be at the absolute top of my rankings because it isn't my preferred style of game, but this is perfect for non-gamer friends and family members. It is just a super-fun game.

I love Space Alert but I'll never play it with my family. That's why I love Escape! The idea of cooperation in real time just works perfect. This is so stressful that after three games in a row (come on! 30 minutes? it's so short) the only thing I want is to get rest.

To be frank, this isn't my type of game. I enjoy games with meaty decisions and ones that reward thoughtful play. That being said, I will play light/filler games every now and then... but not this one.

I found the time limit and dice-rolling fest incredibly aggravating, chaotic, and repetitive. Not to mention, the time limit strongly discourages players from working cooperatively and acting strategically. Despite being very short and despite being a player who eagerly plays games that take all-day.... I felt this game was too long.

Not my cup of tea.

1 to 5 players. This game is fun, but it's extremely simple, you simply have to roll dice as fast as you can and work your way through.
It's a real time game, so no turns or rounds, and certainly no A.P.!
Standard level is very easy, you should use the expert level (+3 gems) most of the times.
It can get very tense as players have to work against time.
The cooperation works quite well where you sometimes have to go through some tiles to help another player that got stuck. The best strategy for the players is to stick together and go for the tiles that allow to activate 3 gems.
The basic game comes with 2 extra modules, the treasures and curses. While the curses are drawn as soon as you discover a cursed tile, the treasures are put on the drawn temple tile and later you have to roll 2 keys to pick it up.
Probably best wih 3 or 4 players.

This game really needs expansions, because the game only comes with a very simple expansion. And the base game is way to simple for repeated plays, it's only good for introducing new players.

Real-time play, furious fun, chaos and lots of laughter.

Escape is a unique game, a crossover of yatzee and Space Alert (well, quite lighter than Space Alert...), where everyone keeps rolling dice (and subset of dice) to move and explore a maze of tiles, find gems and search an exit.

It is not my cup of tea, but it is indeed quite fun to play once in a while.

Very easy to teach, learn and play, this game is always a favorite. With the soundtracks available for this game it makes it fun and suspenseful with every roll of the dice.

Also, as you have to work together in order to win, this is a great game for kids (and adults) to play to sharpen their teamwork skills. 

If you have 10 minutes, you will LOVE this game. Also, don't be afraid to add the curses and other expansion items, they will add difficulty, but also a LOT of fun.

Absolutely no regrets on buying this. I want all the expansions and promos now. The realtime component is a blast. It lends very well to the cooperative chaos. I've done 4 plays now. Lost two and won two with two different groups. Big hit with both groups.

Tremendously fun game with a very intersting, and not so popular co-op mechanic. The game is short (10 minutes per game) and SUPER intense. After 2 rounds you will feel like you just came back from jogging. It's not something you can play the whole evening but it's one of the better fillers you can get. Who can say no when you propose a game that will take "literally 10 minutes"?
Plus, the game is quote hard. It will kick your ass many, many times. And if it get's too easy, it's possible to make it even harder.

An adrenaline-based dice-rolling game of exploration, curses and treasures.  Fun at most player counts, it shines when there are 4 or more players coordinating their actions while feverishly working toward the exit before the temple comes crashing down around their ears.  The first game I've owned which has a soundtrack integral to the game.

Fun soundtrack use during game and like the definitive timelimit of 10 minutes, but a bit too chaotic. The real-time playing is very difficult to implement in a game succesfully and Escape only succeeds partially. And in general cooperative games are not my main favorites.

Fun game.  It is everybody's favorite game, which means I am sure sick of it.  I wife finally is sick of the game as well.  I play it more than any other game.  Though it will never be a gamer's favorite game to play, it will likely be many non-gamers' favorite game to play.  As such, it really belongs in every game collection. I can't see myself ever getting rid of it.  

The game very much needs an expansion.  I like the Quest expansion, but one of them is necessary in my experience as without one of them, the replay does not hold up enough to get the game if you are a gamer.

This game is insanity with a layer of rules wrapped on top of it. Once the time begins and everyone starts rolling like mad it is easy to lose track of what all the players are doing. I just love trying desperately to coordinate our efforts despite the time pressure. It seemed with every passing moment the volume in the room would just elevate more and more. I like the fact that expansions were included in the box, in case you get too good and organized at the base game. Plus you really can't beat this kind of fun gameplay all wrapped up in only 10 minutes. It was a treat to try, and one I hope to play again soon.

Here you try to escape from a temple (go figure) as quickly as you can by rolling dice as fast as you can. A hokey soundtrack plays with creepy noises and music giving you only ten minutes to get out, but by the end, I have to relax and take a breath; I am so tense. It's frantic fun.

this arrived today - tested out the components etc with a few single player game and it seems great - put the soundtrack on my phone - who uses CD's? Will try some games with more people soon hopefully tomorrow then I can add a score 

Played 2 player and its good fun will play some more with the other variants over the holidays - got to try the Curse and Treasures modules which make it slightly more challenging - decent additions

I have had two bad experiences playing this game one playing with a bullying rules Nazi and the other just chaos so I think I prefer it with smaller numbers with people I know and definitely with the soundtrack very audible

I'm not a huge fan of dice rolling randomness, but this was pretty fun for the time we played it.  We only played the vanilla version, so a 6.5 is what I would rate that alone.  The other options for play would probably make the rating increase to around a 7 or 7.5.

The tension!! As much as I love a good thinky Euro, I really have a deep love of the adrenaline rush of this dice chucker. It's push your luck while under the intense pressure of a realtime time limit. There is so much variety to add with the various expansions, that the game really scales well for newcomers and veterans alike. I'll usually get 2-4 games in a row, adding in various modules with each go. My favorite is using base game, plus illusion tiles with the special rooms, and throwing in characters and quests. Then maybe I'll throw some curses and treasures in for good measure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My expectations for this game were low.  It looked like a silly, speedy dice-roller where you just scatter about the temple.  Turns out it's loads of fun and it seems like it's even better with 5 or more people.  I expect to pick this game up and I didn't try it with the expansion yet, so I hope there is more to explore here with the family.

I received this game as a gift and my wife and I are having a lot of fun with it.  A 7.5 is way beyond what a game like this should probably get, but that properly describes how much fun I'm getting from it... quite a bit.

This is a definitely a fun game. It is very addictive and it gets you heart pumping.  

…But, it REALLY should have included the illusions expansion. The base game just feels incomplete. There is a definitely lack of variety.  After one hour of play we were ready for something new.

If all the promos and the illusions expansion had been included in the base game, it would have deserved a rating of 9. As it is, playing the base game winds up feeling repetitive very quickly.

Co-operative games need to have different challenges to take on and new goals to achieve. Removing gems to make it harder just isn’t enough.

RATING: 8
This is honestly a great game and it's super easy to teach to people. The real-time mechanic is fresh and exhilarating. My only qualm with this game is that it gets too easy too fast. There is never a benefit to splitting up - the strategy seems to be to stick together at all times, explore one side of the board, and then go back and find the exit on the other side. 

I believe that this could be fixed with expansions if they ever release them.

Revised: As suspected, the expansions (specifically, the second expansion: Quests) add challenge and variety to the game.

I was originally interested in this game, but a few things are putting me off. 1) The cost just seems way too high based on the game type, components, and replayability and 2) Several reviewers mention that is is fun at first but has no real substance in the end. If it were cheaper I might try it out as a fun filler game, but right now it just isn't worth it for me.

Update: Played it at a local game cafe and am very glad I never purchased it. It just seemed boring.

So, it is fun, but this is the FIRST game my 7 year old son ever got so stressed out that he actually cried. His anxiety got so bad that his strategy was just to check out and hang out by the temple start tile for safety.

Very frantic fun. Lots of dice rolling, but not completely luck based. Some strategy, some push-your-luck mechanisms. Played with 5 people a couple of times, I think this game will be best with 4 or 5. Quite fast paced and almost stressful, we played 2 ten-minute games and that was about enough for me. Still can't wait to play again. I do have a suspicion at some point this may slip to a 7, it will depend on how much the expansions add.

The moment you press play and the audio starts creates such a suspense in the room... everybody is waiting for the go. And suddenly hell breaks loose.

An intense, stressful, hilarious gaming experience. Really recreates the "Indiana Jones" feel of running from booby traps and just making it out in time. I was turned off at first by the rampant dice-rolling but I'm so glad I tried it. There really is a skill at choosing which dice to roll and which to keep, and players have to collectively balance the benefits of staying together vs. splitting up to explore more territory. A truly cooperative game (made painfully clear when someone draws the "silence" curse). Awesome.

Crazy, loud, chaotic fun.  Every time we play this we have a blast.  There really isn't an overwhelming amount of strategy (I mean, it's pretty much a dice fest), but if you play it the way I think it is intended to be played, you will have a lot of fun.  My only gripe is that the soundtrack is muddied by so many ambient sounds that we have actually missed the first gong a few times.

Fun in small doses. It only works if everyone plays honestly. That is fine for adults, but my kids tend to "forget" to put aside their black mask dice or commit other small transgressions if it enables them to "be the hero" and come to another player's aid or lock down a gem. Nevertheless it is enjoyable and I recommend it.

RATING: 9
Really fun - a bit surprised to see my geekbuddies are not huge fans of this. What's up with that, gerkbuddies? You are usually pretty reliable. Don't make me come over there! For a 10 minute game of frantically rolling dice, there is also a surprising amount of strategy in how to explore and how to balance the risks and rewards of spreading out.

The only downside here is that the base game alone is not *quite* challenging enough once you get some experience, and the expansion situation is a bit out of control. Lots of mini-adds, some are good, some are not. I think the Traps expansion is actually the best. The curses are good but the iconography is not always great and the last thing you need is to have to go to a reference sheet in a timed game. Keep the set of curses small and comprehensible, don't just throw stuff in there. In general just add a couple small things to the game each time. This is not something you're going to play so much that you're going to master all this stuff.

I should also mention, for gamers, the Zombie City version of this is better - more dynamic, more thematic, more challenging, more interesting, more attractive, better mini-expansions, but also slightly more complicated.

Escape is a very innovative and fast-paced real time cooperative game.  Players are explorers trying to escape a tomb, and must frantically roll dice to overcome the obstacles that the tomb presents.

Dice must be rolled in order to run into adjacent rooms, discover new rooms, and complete challenges which will eventually make it easier to escape the tomb.  For example, one room might require you to roll 7 torch symbols.  This is problematic since each player only has 5 dice!  Thus, teamwork is required since it is much easier to obtain 7 torches amongst two or three players.

There is one die face that, when rolled, curses that die and makes it unusable until the curse is removed via another certain die symbol.  Sometimes, via very unlucky rolling, a player can become stuck, and another player must rush in to save that player by rolling the curse removal symbol for him.

There are no turns in Escape.  Rather, everyone is continuously rolling dice the entire game, trying to complete everything as quickly as possible.

Eventually, the explorers must find the exit and escape!  The players must complete all of this in 10 minutes, or the tomb collapses and the players meet an unfortunate ending.  This creates a very tense game, where players are playing at a frantic pace the entire game, while also working as a team as best as possible.  A team that is too slow or does not cooperate well will find themselves trying to do better next time!  If a team masters the tomb, there are additional components that may be added for additional difficulty!

RATING: 7
Fun, but stressful, real-time game in which players need to escape from a temple by rolling dice for 10 minutes and hoping for the best. Definitely chaotic since every player rolls their own dice (as opposed to a common dice pool like in Fuse) and rewards good communication between players, especially when some get stuck with locked, cursed dice. Obviously not a super strategic game, but a really nice filler or a great way to start a game night before jumping into heavier fare.

RATING: 7.15
This game is an absolute blast.  It packs tons of fun into a 10 minute experience.  The real-time chaos is exciting and never lets you go.

So, with all this praise, why is my rating not higher?  I'm a tad worried with the longevity of the game as it proved rather easy for us (4 players using the Curses/Treasures modules).  The book does offer certain tips to add difficulty but I wish there was a more interesting official way to scale the game besides just adding more gems.

I also don't think you could play this game every week multiple times as it would start to become dull.  It's not terribly deep (although strategy does help) and is more about the experience.  It's like riding a roller coast - if you ride the same coaster 50 times in a row the 50th time is not going to be as fun as the 1st.  Now if you space those 50 times out across a couple years, then you can retain the excitement longer.

Yahtzee on speed! I said it! It eventually got a little too easy, even for first timers because we all seemed to communicate way too easily. Adding the expansion didn't kill it either. I know of another couple of ways to make this more difficult, but can't wait for expansions to up the danger level even further. This game is BRILLIANT when it is tight to the finish. It is OK when you finish in under 6 minutes... My 5 year old loves it. My 8 year old is scared of the soundtrack

I really like this simple, real-time game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A relatively mindless game of rolling dice as quickly as possible. Which is fun in spurts of a few games, but I'm not going to play it for an hour straight. The game improves with the addition of the expansions, giving you a little more to process while you play, and becomes special with the addition of the challenges, giving a sense of growth to the game.

The biggest problem with this game is that it is so unforgiving to the less experienced players of the group. Even playing just the base game without the expansions they are often overwhelmed as they try to keep up with everyone else resulting in just doing what everyone else is doing and not really making their own decisions.

The second biggest problem is that while the game is very light to play (few decisions) it is very difficult to explain. There are a lot of rules to remember (for a ten minute game), and once you have experience, it is really only fun if played with lots of expansions. But, you can't just throw them all in, so you have to separate and sort, remember how to do set up, then remember what each mini expansion does, which is a whole bunch more rules. Now, in many coöps, rules are less of a problem because if someone forgets a rule, you can simply discuss it and it doesn't create a problem as it does in competitive games. However, in this real time game, you might need to pause the timer every minute or two while someone looks up what a particular curse does or a quest or a treasure. And that's after you just spent ten minutes explaining it all. For a ten minute game.

Much like Space Alert, I think this game is best with a dedicated group of players who are going to play it frequently enough that they can remember all the rules. It is fun, but without that group, probably more time used outside of playing than time having fun playing.

RATING: 7
Surprisingly enjoyable. There's not a lot going on here, mechanically. It's just rolling. But rolling under the pressure of the 10 minute timer is what makes the experience.

Generally, I don't like super high-stress chaotic shouting games. But here, since it's so short, I don't mind at all. There's some fun to the meta-game here. With a high number of players, this is a hard game to win, so coming up with a strategy game-to-game on the way to optimally play is kinda fun.

Play with the "silent" soundtrack - it's clearer when something is happening AND less annoying.

This was the first real-time game I played, and I was impressed the first time I played. It had simple rules, and was tense and fun to play.

Play it once and enjoy it for what it is, but there's no staying power here.

I usually only like to play this occasionally, for a change of pace. The game gets repetitive after beating it many times, but it only plays in 10 minutes. I like to have it in my collection because there is nothing else like it and the difficulty could be adjusted based on skill level. Nothing like throwing dice frantically for 10 minutes, my heart beats so fast in this game. Very attractive game for new players.

[b]Copy includes the promo #1 Escape: The Pit and #2 Escape: Doomed.[/b]

Escape is a wonderfully approachable real-time cooperative game where everyone is trying to escape the temple before it collapses and must roll dice combinations to move from tile to tile and place gems onto tiles. It's fast, frantic and all done to a soundtrack that times everything.

The game is flat-out fun. I can teach relative non-gamers how to play, but even "serious" gamers should find enjoyment in this if they approach it with the right spirit. The game comes with a second tile set of curses/treasures already in the box, so even though it's a 10 minute game, there's variety built in, which helps ease seeing that sticker shock on a 10 minute filler.

A possible knock? The game has been relatively easy to beat, but that's remedied by ramping up the gems you need to place beyond what the rules state. I haven't yet played this with the full complement of five, but I imagine the more the merrier to create an added amount of chaos and group dysfunction!

Normally I'm not big on real-time games, but I really like this game!  Crazy, frantic fun as everyone rolls their dice looking for the right combinations to unlock the gems needed to get out.  Separate from the others to scour the tomb more quickly, but you could get stuck and need rescuing if you roll all black masks.  The timed soundtrack is a great way to keep track of the time -- and for adding mood music.

Collectors Edition - I do wish this contained a little more... something, anything, thematically-releated to set it apart from the standard edition. Ah well... that aside, a neat multisensory little game, that all comes down to the roll of the dice. I can't help but think that some special stone-based dice would have fit the bill for the edition niceley, and perhaps a greater selection in soundtrack choice (I made a loop of music from the videogame Spelunky, for example).

If I had to pick one word to characterise this game, it would be FUN. It is hectic and loud and just fantastic. Components are of excellent quality.

If you are the kind of person who can't be a little silly, then DON'T play this game. If you (and the people you're playing with) throw yourselves into the game, you'll have the best time. There'll be lots of shouting, working together, laughing, etc. Each time we've played, everyone wants to play again.

(TIP: When we play as a group we put the soundtrack through an amp and dim the lights to make it more thematic)

This isn't a very "thinky" game - it's 10 minutes long! But I think with multiple plays you come up with strategies to increase your chances of winning, so it definitely isn't mindless.

I think this game would appeal to a variety of ages (I've only played with adults) though it is probably too stressful (with the time limit) for young children.

There is one caveat to my glowing review though: the price. I don't know what it sells for elsewhere, but in NZ it costs $90 NZD (about $70 USD), which feels like a lot for a game that lasts 10 minutes. This put me off getting the game for a long time. It IS worth it, but somehow I feel like it should market for slightly less because of the short duration of a single game. If it were cheaper, I could see it becoming a mass-market classic.

I bought this game because I thought that it would be perfect to a have a short (10 minute) game that plays up to 5 and is easy to explain and play. Boy did I screw up. Although this game should only take 10 minutes, you WILL play for 40 minutes or more because you Can't Stop (After playing this game I now believe that Sid Sackson's classic game title is false advertising compared to this). 
Normally I would not rate a game like this a '9' but I ALWAYS have 10 minutes to play a game and I ALWAYS want to. So this game is able to get a high rating due to a technicality! (And because it is awesome fun!)

I always preface these reviews with the fact that I'm not the target audience for these games and basically play them only at cons and only for the benefit of sitting down with people who I enjoy gaming with.

Escape is a dice rolling co-op game. Players explore a temple using 5 dice which govern their ability to move and get rid of the cursed treasure that is preventing them from escaping. The play is completely free-form, you roll and roll and roll trying to get the correct dice to move or match the requirements for whatever room tile you're currently in. Dice can become locked on a black mask side and getting them unlocked requires the use of a gold mask (another side of the dice) by either yourself or your team-mates.

The main issue I see with this design is that there is no penalty for keeping all of the players together at all times and in a larger group this makes it pretty easy to fill each of the treasure tiles quickly and also largely negates the threat of black masks locking up dice. I played it twice and we were owned initially by splitting into 2 groups and by not paying attention to a timed requirement to get back to the entrance to avoid losing dice (bad for obvious reasons). The second play we stuck together and defeated the game pretty easily even though we were not efficient with time in the middle portion of the game and still lost some of our dice in the first. In short, after two plays I don't think there is anything else to see here. That said, it's 10 minutes. That said again, people might insist on playing the soundtrack instead of just using a nice, quiet sand timer. Shrug.

A fast manic game of dice rolling temple exploration. Yeah, it scratches a couple of itches I regularly have. My only issue with it is the noise involved while playing. We were rolling dice onto a hard surface which made it a bit loud. Then of course we're excitedly shouting at each other which also made it a bit loud. Amid this sound, the soundtrack (which we were playing on an iPad) wasn't really distinctive enough. For me the gongs could have stood out more from the general atmosphere noises. But properly preparing your play space could alleviate most of the problems and make the soundtrack easier to follow. Based on one play.

From reading the description, it feels that this game is either going to be a mess or it's going to be awesome. I hope it's the latter.

It was nice. I like dice rollers (custom dice are always a nice touch), and the idea of simultaneous play is fun. I guess it might lose its punch after a few plays (mostly because activating gems is a bit too linear a goal), but the expansions seem to help. It also is really short, which makes for excellent filler.

RATING: 3
People just love rolling tons of dice; and this game offers it in spades. Plus it all needs to be done hurryhuryhurry lest the CD proclaims they are out of time and doomed to stay in the temple forever. The atmosphere is frantic, and everyone is psyched. Great lightweight family material for sure. 

But as a serious game... no. I just do not belong to the game's target audience, and expect more than just endless dice rolling waiting for the correct faces to turn up. Perhaps there's an interesting challenge: code an app which does all the dice rolling for the players in 10 minutes. In a nice low-level and obscure language, say Pascal or Modula-2. If you don't have the necessary compiler, download the one and only Turbo Pascal [url=http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/20803]here[/url]. In any case, the rate reflects [i]my[/i] desire to play this game, which is very low, unfortunately.

Phenominal experience.  10 minutes of your time spent screaming, shouting, rolling dice as fast as you can trying to get out of a temple-OMG THE GONG I NEED TO GET BACK TO THE CENTRE HELP ME GET THIS DICE!...

On top of the simple game that is very easy to get into, you can add more stuff into the mix to make it more and more complicated: treasures, curses, weird illusions, a chalice, player character powers, a ghost(?), more curses, and those traps that I haven't gotten yet...WHAT? It is bonkers the amount of game you can get out of it. Emotionally draining after every game, but it' the most efficient usage of 10 minutes in your lives. or 30 minutes, depending on how much time you spend explaining or playing again.

I really like this one. Try it at least once if you can.

When I heard how Escape works, I thought, "Not for me."  I'd played Space Alert a few times, and decided the intense time pressure and shouting involved wouldn't work for us.  But then my husband surprised me by saying he wanted it as a gift, so I thought, "OK, why not."

And while the game is very intense, there's a simplicity to the rules which makes it easy to remember while you're under the gun with that timer.  A group that can play this multiple times will be rewarded by seeing themselves get closer and closer to that exit in time.  Fair warning: this game is possibly addictive!

So while this might not be for everyone, if you want a lighter game in the real-time genre, this might be for you.

Played the prototype at Spill-O-Rama. And what a fresh breath. I immensely enjoyed it. Its not another Euro. Its original, even though there are a few resemblances, and will easily stand it test of time. Its the game youy begin the evening with and the game you play before its time to leave...and then you leave a bit to late.

Somehow i missed the Kickstarter, but its a must buy.

Will you play only this game a whole evening, no.
Will you play it only one more time, yes.

After several plays, I'm bumping my rating - for all that the base-game is way simpler than I'd like (I really want to try with the curses and treasures), it creates great play experiences.

I quite like the ambiance the soundtrack brings. The real-time coordination between players feels like it costs more (in time) than it helps at first, but now that I've played with slightly more experienced players I'm seeing it work out much better.

Components: Solid components all around. Good iconography on the dice.

Experience: So, so manic. It's very difficult to play without accidentally cheating because so much is going on at once, and dice are flying off the table, and we trying to move between rooms and to help uncurse each other.

It's a fun experience, and we got much better as a team over the course of three games. But now that we've won once, it somewhat dampens my desire to play again, without at least adding in the modules.

Played this 4 or 5 times now, twice solo to learn the rules, which bored me to tears..  First proper play (the recorded play)my wife played and she was bored to tears as we played without the soundtrack to show her the rules.

Then, when we put the soundtrack on everything changed and she began to enjoy the game.  The highlight of the night came when she pulled a "if you drop a dice off the table you lose it" curse, to which her response was "Ha! as if thats going to happen!" Well, you can guess what happened next can't you?

All in all a great game, and the first "filler" of my collection.

Edit: After more plays my wife doesnt like this one and as such its mission failed.  Getting traded.  Too simple.

HURRY!  If you don't mind being timed to 10 minutes (some board gamers play board games so they *won't* be timed), this game is a fun dice-chucking run with a cooperative/solo ruleset.  Pretty chaotic with multiple players; I prefer it solo with some headphones on.

RATING: 7.5
This is a fun game, but very chaotic. 

Escape is a cooperative game, you have exactly ten minutes to flee the temple and only if all the players have succesfully exited the temple, will you have won the game. So you win or lose together.

Each player has five dice to start with. If you throw a black mask with one or more of your dice, then these are deactivated until you throw a golden mask. If all your dice are deactivated, you can either wait for help or add a gem to the pile, which makes it more difficult to exit.

Everyone playes simultaneously, so you can help each other. Usually, there's a lot of shouting involved, as time is very short to find the various rooms, activate the gems and find the exit in time as every three minutes, you need to be back at the start tiles or lose one of your dice.

To add to the stress, the game comes with a CD with an Indiana Jones-like tune, but unless you turn it rather loud, players will probably overshout it :)

More dependence on dice-chucking. Only this time, you can try to reroll nearly as much as possible against a ticking clock. This just creates stressful chaos, where it's insane to try and keep track of what other players are doing or saying while remembering what you are rolling and when people have used their dice or unlocked yours or used your unlocks. I just don't have the tolerance for such a messy game.

So stressful! In a good way!

I have pretty much all of the expansions as well, but I don't know if I'm ever going to get to the point where I'm incorporating them as the base game seems hard enough as it is. I guess if I played it nightly I'd want an increase to the challenge, but I don't see myself getting to that level of play any time soon.

Anyway, a really good game for many different kinds of players except those who panic at speed games.

A lot of good ideas, a pretty fun game overall and the short playtime really makes this a nice choice for a more casual crowd or as a starter to an evening of gaming.

That said, after just playing three (and winning one) game AKA 30 minutes, it already felt like we had seen everything the game had to offer. I love rolling dice as much as the next person, it just doesn't really feel statisfying; there's no real strategy involved, there are no meaningful decisions to be made.
Maybe it's just not my type of game. As said, I like the idea, but it grows stale so damn quickly.

Escape is a quick fast paced 10 minutes game that keeps everyone on their toes. As stand alone game it's very very simple and gets easy after very few plays. Luckily the game comes with 2 additional modules out of the box which improves longevity.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A lot of cooperative games still let a player break off from what everyone else is doing and do their own thing (it might not always be the best thing to do, but you can). In Escape, you are almost certainly screwed if you don't actually cooperate, work together:
There's nothing you can do if you went off by yourself and all your dice are locked. 
Maybe you'll find the exit faster, but you won't be able to put out enough gems by yourself to get out.

Quick, frantic fun. Literally, a ten-minute game that gets more requests than I initially thought it might. But it is definitely fun.

Grab friends and go on the Indiana Jones-type expedition you always wanted to. Keep in mind that this is a cooperative game, but it is still a fun time.

Played this for the first time today (Dec 22, 2012), with five players. Played the basic game twice and messed up some rules - then beat the basic game twice - then lost 4 more games - two with just Curses - two with Curses and Treasures.

It's an experiental game - fun and fast - but I think it lacks the staying power of similar games which I like better (Galaxy Trucker and Space Alert).

The fact that it only take 10 minutes to play (and only a few minutes to set up) is a plus, though...

Real-time games have a core problem that is very difficult to overcome.  When everyone is playing at the same time, who is checking to make sure the players are doing things correctly?  Escape is no different.  We won but we're pretty sure that we screwed up.  Not only is no one looking at what we do.  But we are pressed for time and more apt to make a mistake amidst the chaos.  How many torches do we have.  I think it is 10, get 3 gems.  Wait, 2 of the torches we counted aren't in the room.  What, I was in the room but left.  No, you were in that room.  Whatever, the clock is ticking, move those gems!  Kind of funny in a non-game way.

I liked the game though, but this issue makes it teeter away from what I think is a game.

Players are Indiana Jones type explorers, racing through a temple, trying to solve puzzles to unlock the exit, before it collapses.  Fun real time game, fixed at exactly 10 minutes in length.  Players play at their own pace, there are no turns.  Players roll their own set of five dice, and use the results to open up the temple by revealing large, chunky tiles.  To move into a tile requires a certain combination of results, and about half the tiles have a "puzzle" to solve - a result that must be rolled a certain number of times.  Solved puzzles are recorded by placing gems from a pool onto them.  Somewhere near the bottom of the stack of temple tiles is the exit - players must throw a number of "key" results equal or greater than the gems remaining in the pool to exit.  If all players make it out inside 10 minutes, it's a win, otherwise it's a loss.  

This is a fun game, played against a 10 minute soundtrack.  The free form nature of rolling and using dice works well.  The cooperation element is strong, as some tiles require two or more players to pool their dice results to fully solve the puzzles and drain the gems (thus making it easier to escape).  Additionally, the cursed die result typically requires players to help each other out with the gold "break the curse" result.  The two gongs that occur on the soundtrack, forcing players to return to the entrance tile inside a minute or lose a die, is a nice touch - adding a dash of chaos to the already frantic experience.  

Looking forwards to playing more of this, with Illusions, and Pits, and Curses, and Treasure!  Well done, Queen.  This one does get the blood pumping!

RATING: 7
Played once without the curse cards to learn the game. It was a little underwhelming, but I hear that the curse cards are what really make the game. 

I have played a few more times now. I still find the game enjoyable, but I don't like how easy it is to unintentionally/unknowingly cheat in the rush to roll the dice. You could say that's a problem with the player and not the game, but when we beat the game, I always wonder if we really beat it fair and square. It makes the victories feel a little tainted because I just can't be sure.

Played this with my 9 year old daughter.  She loved it and the cooperative aspects of the game.  The fact that she liked it is great for a family perspective and a family game night.  From my perspective alone, I'd not give it much game play, as it is a simple beer/pretzel game that would basically wind up on the shelf after an evening of play.

A ten minute long cooperative real-time game in which players are attempting to escape from a collapsing temple.  Frantically roll dice to try to collect the symbols you need in order to move on to the next room, collect gems, and break curses.  Cursed dice may stop you in your tracks, necessitating a frantic rescue by the other players, because if even one person fails to make it out alive, the entire group loses.

RATING: 7
Frenetic, incredibly stressful, and thematic; what's not to love? It's a quick game that's guaranteed to take ten minutes or less, and everyone will be engaged the whole time*. It's a near-perfect icebreaker or gateway game for players willing to deal with the excitement and stress the game offers. The game forces players to work together through the black and gold masks, and there's constant communication and discussion and yelling and general fun.

There are a few quibbles that take the game from amazing to merely good, unfortunately. Staying together makes the game a bit easy and excessively dependent on the way rooms randomly come out. I much prefer splitting up; there's more tension and the game becomes more dependent on how quickly the players can get particular symbol combinations, which is the more fun part of the game. The soundtrack is a little unclear (I prefer playing with the timer), and the base game can be a little samey (and expansions complicate the game enough that new players don't do as well.)

*I've had one player who wasn't quite up for the game once, but it wasn't the game's fault. Board games were really Not His Thing.

Seems to be a likely SdJ nominee.   Simple and innovative concept with high production values.   The soundtrack CD is essential to the experience.  I can't imagine the sand timer variant would be an acceptable substitute.   The co-op aspect is emphasized as players will need to be rescued by other explorers when their dice lock up.   There are certain strategies which seem to be dominant.  In the end, you are just rolling dice and matching symbols.   That's my biggest issue.   I think the game experience, while unique, will get old very quickly.   Expansions might help that a little bit (as evidenced by the sheer number of them available/included already) but I bet not much.

[b]11.1.12 Update:[/b] Seriously, this game is ridiculous. I've owned it for merely a couple of weeks and I'm 1 play shy of 40 plays! Of course, the short play time has a lot to do with this, but it's also how incredibly fun and addicting it is. Just one more game... with more curses!

Really fun, really INTENSE 10 minutes of gaming. Seems so-so solo but boy is multiplayer a ton of fun, with everybody rolling constantly, shouting out what they're doing, asking for golden masks, and really racing against the ominous gongs of the soundtrack. Easy to learn but challenging to beat. I'm not sure how often I'll play it in the long run but in the short run it's definitely a hit with my groups.

It's a dice game. Which is usually enough for me to turn the other direction. But this is a really fun co-op game that uses your dice and the dice of your teammates in the same room to unlock doors, find treasure and eventually escape the temple. The game only last 10 minutes and has a soundtrack. Amazing new dynamic. We finished the night with two games and it was the perfect end to the night!

RATING: 7.5
Fantastic!  One of the coolest formats for a game I've played.  It's a race against time and you have to work together as you're going through the temple attempting to escape.  If all but one of you make it out, the whole team loses.

The only reason I don't rate this a 9 is because my nerves can't handle more than about 2 games per session!  Therefore, I couldn't say that I always would want to play it.

From a technical standpoint, I find pretty much no flaws with this game. It is well-designed, simple to explain, and most importantly, lots of fun.

At the same time, it is also a little repetitive. I appreciate that it comes with modules for added variety, but since playtime is so short, and since you are so likely to play several times in a row, it still doesn't take very long to figure out the path to success.

I think the key to making this one last is to pull it out sparingly, and with different groups, preferably with a lot of new players. Like any cooperative game, you'll enjoy it more if success remains uncommon.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Never before in my life have my hands shaken while attempting to beat a board game...Until Escape:Curse of the Temple.  You and your fellow teammates have 10 minutes (timed by a soundtrack.) to get out of the temple. There are no turns. Just people with 5 dice attempting to roll their way out of a dungeon. The soundtrack isn't just pretty sounds letting you know time is up. Within the ten minutes there are two intervals where a gong sounds. You HAVE to race back to starting square before the door slams or you lose one of your 5 dice. believe me you NEED all of your dice to open new rooms, move in and out of them, and solve puzzles making your escape easier. 

I have seen sheer panic on my son's face as he is screaming for help to get out...It is an INTENSE game. Co-op and helping each other is highly encouraged because if all members do not get out...everyone loses. The game also is not overly hard or easy. I have won just as many games as I have lost.

RATING: 6
Massive dice frenzy - which is fun. By all means.
But there there is litle tactic or strategy to the game.

I can see how some people love to just solve obstacles by rolling dices. But for me it was just too light.

But I must say the game is a great idea!
And having the music track guaranting 10 minute play time exactly is a huge pluss for this game. 

It will probably by somewhat popular with my gaming group as it's easy to sneak in a play while you wait for people.

It's noisy, I like that!

Out of the games that I own, this is definitely the most fun. I have yet to play another game that has gotten my adrenaline going like this one will every time me and the wife play it. I will admit this can be a bit much of excitement and fun sometimes. If you're looking for a relaxing deep strategy game this is NOT it. If you want 3-4 10 min. intense sessions of edge of your seat excitement, this will definitely fill that niche. I'm pretty sure this is one of the few games in my collection at the moment that my wife ACTUALLY would recommend to play.

Escape is a frantic real-time game experience.  Another example of this type of game is Space Alert.  There are big differences between these two games however.  The biggest difference is how much easier Escape is to teach players than SA.  Escape also plays faster than SA.  SA is mainly driven by cards whereas Escape is driven by dice rolling.  I think there is a lot more variation from game-to-game in SA but Escape is easier to teach and faster to play, so it's going to hit the table a whole lot more.  Escape also seems to have better experiences in how well it plays within the listed player range than Space Alert (ie I think Escape is good with any number of people whereas SA is probably 4 or 5 player only.)  The bottom line is: if you've never played a frantic real-time game you should try Escape and see how you like it.  If you like it and you think you can get a dedicated group to play the more complex Space Alert regularly, you'll probably want to give that one a try.  I could see owning both in a collection.

Edit: I would now completely recommend Magic Maze over Escape, unless you really despise silent coops.

Each progressive play is less fun than the last. My first play I would have given this an 8 I guess. It's just complete, "And.... we're rolling dice." The game is all atmosphere. Once that wears off, it's just annoying. "Oh look, I rolled black skulls again!"

Yawn.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) An interesting conundrum. I enjoy real-time co-ops like Space Alert, but this is, with a full complement of six players at least, almost [i]too[/i] real-time. Everybody is rolling frantically, splitting up, regrouping, and fun things are taking place, but there is no chance to register anything beyond what is happening on your own tile. Unlike Space Alert, there is no chance to lovingly relive everyone's mistakes and moments of glory without the time pressure. It's all silly and fast enough not to matter much, but I somehow feel like I'm missing part of the fun. Will have to try it again.

Played it, don't like it. 
It's not so bad for a small game, a nice idea with the totaly dice-throwing-10-minute-chaos-element, but after two plays what is still there? Not so much, but you have to pay the high-price of new Quenn Games first...

Maybe for ten bucks you should take it, maybe 15, but don't pay the full price before you had the change to test it. (otherwise, afterwards you could sell it to me..., for 10 bucks!)

"Hey, I'm locked up again!" Took about three times in a row that happening to ruin the game for me. Luck>Skill in this game by too large a margin for my taste. Pair that with the fact that others are screaming for you to be luckier than you are so that you don't rob them of a win, and you have unfun game.

This game is a lot of fun. Really more of a high 7, but not a true eight rating. The gating factor is the adrenaline. It is not a relaxing game, although it is quick. I find it is easy to mess things up in the frenzy, although it doesn't matter too much because of the fun factor.

Very intense and fun game! It is very easy to learn the game, yet in each play, there are enough randomness and strategic decisions to make.

While it is intended to be a fully coop game, my family decided to add a house rule: when we heard the last gong, the game turns into a save yourself race game, with each player tries to get out the temple and ignore the other players. The ones who get caught in the Temple lost, the first to exit win. It adds a lot of tension to the game!

RATING: 7
Very good real time game. The cooperative mechanics are well incorporated in the game, and you feel a little stressed when the music is getting loud towards the end. Real time games are just not my type of game, but I see that most other players have a lot of fun with it.

Random chucking of dice, driven by a soundtrack.  So freaking fun.  This is easily my SO's favorite game - and despite playing five or six times in a row some nights, we haven't tired of it yet.  The combinations of different modules from the base game and expansion makes for a very flexible experience.

RATING: 8
The first 'real time' strategy board game I have played and still enjoy today that is  easy to teach and learn. My wife loves the cooperative aspect as well. Don't forget that a gold mask can unlock two black cursed mask dice; a vital rule that can be easily overlooked and make the game very frustrating if you play it 1 for 1 die. Finally started playing the expansions which are fun as well. (Limited edition gold foil box).

Myself and family and friends who have played it all hate this game. Way too many dice rolling at one time, some confusing or unclear rules which can't be researched in the heat of the game, and no skill whatsoever. Watch a random number generator while trying to drive to an event you're very late to. It's about the same experience. Played it a few times to see if I was wrong. I wasn't. Sold.

I guess it maybe shouldn't be so enjoyable, but it is. It's just fun when needing to make a dozen little decisions causes you to freeze up, no longer sure what choices to make... until you find your way out of it — and head off to the next challenge. I did finally get rid of it, though, since I suspect it simply stressed my child out more than he already mentioned it did. Anecdotally this seems to happen a lot, which surprises me but then the music IS delightfully thematic...

This game is REALLY fun. If you're looking for a game that's easy to teach, requires teamwork and cooperation, and is quick, this is the game for you.

It's light, but that's the beauty of it. The expansions and modules add more flavors that really spice up the gameplay. There are so many ways to play that I can't see this getting old any time soon. I've played over 20 games so far and I'm still raving about it.

Everyone I've turned this on to has absolutely loved it, many have immediately asked where they can buy it. I highly recommend Escape.

Ratings history: 6|8|8[/b]

This game is exactly what it promises to be: a 10 minute, real-time dice-chucking scramble to escape a temple. The base game in the box is too simple (just move through rooms, getting combos to enter, and to collect gems that make it easier to escape), but the base game includes two small expansions that make it more fun.

[b]-1st play-[/b] A little simpler than I'd originally hoped for, but plays quick and does what it sets out to do: speedy, roaming co-op. Nice visuals, easy to understand rulebook.

RATING: 8
A very good, very unique, real-time dice-chucking fun as players cooperatively try to bust their way out of a collapsing temple.  The fact that it actually plays in 10 minutes with no scoring or post-game activities to work through is a plus.  This game demands repeated plays more than probably any other game in my collection.  Each game can start feeling samey when played at the basic level - once you've solved it once, there's less motivation to keep going and try again - but the game comes with a couple of additional modules that keep it from feeling permanently "solved".  The soundtrack is great (one of my 12-year-olds was genuinely a little creeped out).  I don't know if I've seen so many people I've introduced it to so taken with a game after their first play or two.

This is pretty fun, but there's something just a tad off. Maybe it's the difficulty. Cool idea of a real time Indiana Jones type adventure, and there's certainly plenty of dice rolling, but I don't really like the timing method (an audio track approximately 10 minutes long; alternately you can use an hourglass), and I don't like how often the dice get locked up. I guess I felt frustration as much as anything else - and a bit of dice whiplash. There is a lot of activity in this game! This is one to get the game blood flowing and then move on to something else.

Tegnap nekem is volt szerencsém kipróbálni. Nem annyira rossz játék, de biztos az elvérások különbözősége miatt (míg, ti valami borzalomra számítottak, mikor először leültetek, nekem már meg már nagyon be volt harangozva) annyira nem vágott földhöz. Egyszer-kétszer el lehet bohóskodni vele, a rövidsége miatt biztos gyakran előkerül, de azért a világot nem fogja megváltani. Hátrányának érzem, hogy klubban gyakorlatilag játszhatatlan a nagy hangerő miatt, ami igencsak zavarna másokat. Persze van homokórás változat, de egyrészt az az üvöltözésen nem változtat, másrészt a homokórát figyelni és becsülni a még hátralévő időt, nem lehet egyszerű.
Szóval próbálja ki mindenki bátran, tetszeni fog.

6/24/2015-Here is a good description of how the game goes: a hectic tornado of rolling dice ,getting rid of gems and trying to get out of the temple before crashes around your ears.dc 


This is the best! I love this fast-paced game. You run through temples,put gems places, and try to escape the curse of the temple.xs

 

I like this game. it makes me feel like I'm actually in the game  running. I feel like I'm going to die saying help. I rate it 3 stars so run or your going to die. colo

Real time rolling wears down after a couple of plays but it's still a good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
While Escape is sort of related to Space Alert, it is a lot less demanding with its primary focus on (re)rolling the dice as quickly as possible. And while the cooperative element - you cvan share dice with fellow adventurers in the same room - is quite important (some of the more difficult tasks are impossible to achieve on your own, and it's easy to get stuck with a few unlucky rolls) it is not particularly engaging.

Escape is not exactly un-fun to play but despite being a very short game I don't feel compelled to play "just one more time." Maybe what I miss most is some sort of feeling of accomplishment after a successful escape from the temple.

Initial rating of 9 based on only solo plays so far. I doubt playing with others will lower it. The real time aspect makes the game. I have only played basic game but the curses and treasures look fun. I can see so much potential for fun variants that I probably wont regret buying this. Simple tangible in your face fun. Roll roll roll. 

Update. Played multiple times with different people. Its a fun game and doesnt over stay its welcome since it only lasts 10 mins. Adding curses is a little clunky until you learn what each of them are. Also you do need some table room to spread out much like any tile laying game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The luck-based nature of both the generation of the temple and rolling locked cursed dice is mitigated significantly by its cooperative nature. Ultimately on the simple side, but the balance of helping each other and trying to travel around the temple manages to entertain under its very short time limit.
The most pressing factor is how well the game kills the alpha-player problem through simply making the game real-time: Players cannot micro-manage each other without performing worse for themselves.

RATING: 6.317
Provisional rating of 8 based on one play family (and that was abortive as the family thought the game music made the game creepy) and one solo play. Real time dice game; light but i can see the cooperative interaction would make this fun as you race time to Escape.  Enjoyable in that there are solo rules, albeit a bit easy. I guess you can add extra gems, but I can see where this shines as group play. (2/2/14). UPDATE: Ultimately, this game is silly nonsense, albeit fun silly nonsense.  Worth keeping for the unique mechanism, the light party feel filler alternate, but it is essential that you play it with the CD soundtrack nice and loud - more a 7 rating game now (March 2014).  UPDATE: To be honest, It's only brought out for show as an example of a real time gimmick dice game, no real desire for further investment,, rating drop to 6 (Dec 2014). UPDATE: Its unique, and maybe on the rare occasion a bit of fun (Rating 6.317, Jan 17)

A real time dice rolling game with a map that changes with every playthrough.  It's short, but everyone is exausted at the end of it and laughing at either how close they are to winning or how close they were to not winning.  Not to mention one of the few games that plays well with 3 as it does with 5 (and probably 6 if you add in the expansion).  The soundtrack also adds an air of atmosphere that really helps it that much more.  Only complaint I have is that the insert in the box is kind of out of shape as it's just not wide enough to hold two widths of tiles.

Still, play this game, it's a blast.

YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY THIS GAME! I can only image what expansion might come next. Everyone must escape this dungeon alive or you all lose. It is a real time cooperative game that gets your adrenaline rushing. You must work together or your doomed. A blast to play. Fairly easy to learn.

The game is cool in 2-player mode, I won't have the possibility to check it in higher player counts, but I suppose it will only be more chaotic and frantic.
The main issue with the game is that it benefices keeping tight with other players. Otherwise you might be stuck somewhere on the completely other site of the map. Plus - using keys to open treasures or to get rid of crystals is easier in a group.

To sump up - okey, but as I bought it for 50 PLN and was able to exchange it for Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage in 27 MathTrade (polish edition), I have no concerns. :)

Incredibly tense! Not for those who get anxious. It's mainly due to the soundtrack. Be prepared for somebody in the group (playing) to soil themselves- there's that much tension! If you play with the timer, the tension is reduced somewhat, but less fun. Cheating on the rolls (saying you got an icon when you didn't) will ruin the experience- so don't! Only problem is that it can get a bit samey after awhile.

RATING: 7
Tense! Takes a little explaining and some sample playing before everyone gets the hang of this game, so make sure to do that when playing with new folk. When you do start the music, the game gets crazy, in a good way. Will the game wear off after a while? Maybe, but I think it is enjoyable and there are expansions for the game that mix it up for experienced players.

RATING: 8
Fast, silly, chaotic. Can be a bit stressful due to the real-time nature, but it's so short it doesn't matter if it all goes horribly wrong. My only complaint is perhaps that setup takes quite a long time compared to the game length, but that will likely always be a potential issue with a game on a ten minute timer.

Holy cow is this game fun.  Easy to teach, and tense every time.  I love that it only takes ten minutes to play and since it is a Queen game we can expect a "few" expansions.  Not the right game for everyone because some people don't want to feel stressed while they play a game, but I definitely enjoy it.

EDIT: Now that Magic Maze exists, my will to play this has dropped drastically. It just does real time simple coop so much better.

This is such a simple but captivating game! The simple rules mean that I can play it with anyone, and the speed means that I can play it at any time. Real time dice rolling is just fun and screaming for help from the other players around the table is a blast. It will usually be played multiple times in a row, which is a high compliment from such a fickle player as me.

It's perfect for what it is: a fast-paced, tense, exciting, mad scramble of dice and tiles and luck and risk and "Oh no!" and "YES!" and "No wait! Go back! AH!!"  :)  It's a lot of fun and I'm really glad we added this to our small collection of games.  But it stresses me out and I don't love all the luck at play.  I never really want to play it, but my wife thinks we should keep it because it's unlike any other game in our collection and it's easy to pull out with non-gamers.

UPDATE: We (I) never wanted to play it due to the anxiety factor, so we sold it.

Escape is a frantic 10-minute game of frenzied dice rolling and tense banter. I recommend that anyone who enjoys cooperative games should try this if they have the opportunity. I thought it was a lot of fun, but I don't think it would continue to be fun if played repeatedly. The simplicity and compactness that makes this work so well as a walk-up-and-play filler would become a weakness if the game saw heavy play by the same group. So I guess I view Escape as a novelty game. I'll be happy to play it, but would never buy it, especially at the exorbitant Queen Games price level. Talk one of your more profligate friends into buying it!

Normally I don't enjoy mechanics like "cooperative" and "real time" and theese are the most important ones in Escape (beside dice rolling). The game keeps it promises. The Soundtrack works fine, and the Kickstarter Goodies are cool. However I don't remember why I preordered this because I feel too stressed rolling and rerolling dice as quick as I can, it's too light that it creates any wish to play again. At least you can adjust level of difficulty by adding/leaving away curses or treasures. However I am sure that with the right group this game is hilarious fun.

1-6 Players.  This game is a major hit in all 3 of my different games groups.  It is a 10 minute "filler" game, but it usually gets played about 6 times in a row because everyone wants to play "just one more!" with added difficulty.

People are yelling, screaming for help with their black masks, laughing uncontrollably (when someone gets the "can not talk curse" and we heckle them to just tell us what they want and stop mumbling), rolling dice like mad, cursing when they can't get keys, and cheering and panting when the game ends.  It is a very high energy game.  I tell people to stretch out before the game starts so they don't pull something!  I can't wait for future expansions.

Great game! I have yet to introduce it someone that hasn't liked it (adults and children alike). It is a real big hit with children around 9 to 13 years old, don't know much past that since I only play games with children under 13 or adults 25 and older. It is intense, fast pace, fun and is over in 10 minutes. I cant think of many other 10 minute activities that beats this. After I teach people this game they usually want to play it again and again.

I have the Big Box edition and when people look at this game, they are understandably intimidated.  And then they are skeptical when you tell them it will take only 10 minutes to play.  It will take some convincing, but once they play, they will be instantly hooked.  It is perhaps the most intense 10 minutes of board gaming you will ever find.  I would say it leaves you wanting more but the truth is that you're so exhausted by the end of the first play you don't even know if you could do it again.

Preliminary rating after one really fun games in Essen 2012.   Personally I'm not a big fan of cooperative games since most ccop games suffer from the "smartest player leads wthe group" pproblem.  Nut this one is really different: it's one big, chaotic dice rolling frenzy.  The fixed 10 minute limit and the 2 intermidiate countdowns is what creates the special flavor of this game and they leave no time whatsoever for anyone to boss around the other players.  

Edit: Plus, my son (9 y/o) and his friends really liked the game.

This is good as a family game. Not something I would play with my competitive gaming group. More strategy comes in to play as you load the depot up with more and more gems, or mix in curses. Our win rate is really high, but we have fun doing it. We are nearing 10 plays with no signs of the game getting stale.

Update: I took this over and played with a guy from my gaming group, and surprisingly it quickly became one of his favorites. Playing with him was much better for me as well. We managed to clear win a game with 15 gems in the depot (2 players) without curses, and as many as 12 with. I will note, however, that when we added the curses it became more difficult to win with 2 at higher numbers. We lost several times in the 10-12 gem range and you become much more vulnerable to bad dice rolls. Increasing my rating to 9.5. We are now at around 15 plays and the base game shows no sign of getting stale.

Update 2: Nearing 10 plays with my buddy from the gaming group (about 20 total) and we are becoming very proficient. Now having no problems knocking out 12 gems 2 player with curses. Will continue trying to find the right balance of difficulty and excitement. The game remains a good filler, we remarked yesterday that it is the best 10 minute game we have every played.  

Update 3: After 20 plays this one was losing steam. Mixed in the Illusions expansion and that freshened it right back up. If you love the game I would suggest adding that for more replay ability.

Update 4: Zombie 15 has taken over as our real time game of choice. This will stick around as it is still fun to break out every now and then, but we prefer almost everything about Zombie 15 more except setup time.

Update 5: This game has pulled back even with Zombie 15 on account of the fact that I can pull this out and start playing within minutes. It is much more random, but the setup time holds Zombie 15 down. Still fun for a quick filler.

If you only have 10-20 minutes left in a game night and want to not waste it on small talk or something else, pull out this bad boy!  It's per-minute intensity and fun is unprecedented in any game I have played.  It's not something you'd likely want to play over and over again, but I could see it being pulled out at least once per gaming night with how short of a game it is.  After all, you can't have all 60+ minute games (sometimes a lot more) in your collection.

This is the game Space Alert should have been (though it's a much lighter game). It's probably the best real-time game I've ever played. It's amazing how well the game allows players to do their own thing while still helping each other out. Most cooperative games, real-time or not, don't manage this balance nearly so well.

The custom dice, large and chunky tiles, and oversized meeples all look and play great. The theme is instantly relatable and works very well with the feel of the game, all running around the temple and trying to help each other out for a few frantic minutes. 

Out of the box, it's probably a bit too easy, but this does make it very accessible for non-gamers and there are myriad options for increasing the difficulty. The price point is probably a bit high for what is essentially a filler, but the component quality is excellent, so it's forgivable. 

This is a game the succeeds perfectly at what it sets out to do. It's possible it could wear thin after many plays, but the thrills and teamwork this game offers are unlike any other. This one is a definite winner, even though it's not my favorite type of game.

A great little coop game, which takes no more than 10 minutes to play.

Only 6 pages of rules.  Initially used ALL the tiles, then figured out there was a basic set as well as a Treasure and Curses set...  And most importantly, there are 13 tiles to a set, PLUS 4 tiles with multiple gem locations.

Components are great for what they are.

Everyone enjoyed their first experience... so much so we played 8 games in a row, in just about 90 minutes.

HIGH STRESS!  Great fun to play 2-3 times, then you need time to recover, lol.  Due to the speed, accuracy can be a problem.  Someone can yell they have an unlock and multiple people can pick up their locked dice before they realize others have already done so.  It takes too much valuable time to sort it out, so while we try our best I've noticed slip ups.  Since we just play with our family, it's not an issue for us but I know this can be a sticking point for some people.

RATING: 7
This dice-chuckin' co-op does what it means to in a frantic way, and it works nicely for what it is, though I can see why some copies are turning over as people burn out on it.

Basically, a whole lot of rapidly thrown luck is generated by a set of action dice. They can lock and unlock on their own, and there are a number of things you need them for to turn over temple tiles, unlock cursed gems, and try to get to the exit tile with enough keys before your 10 minutes is up.

It's fast, it's fairly frantic, and there is a lot of luck- some games it seems like you throw what you need, others you can't seem to roll a break, and end up with all black idols staring up at you.

Starting this at a 7, with room to move.  I don't think it hugely appeals to the family, so it's staying power may be tested here.

Even as a teaching game, I don't think the game should ever be played without curses (if there's at least one person who knows the symbols). I've played this at higher counts, which is fun and chaotic, but it's a very focused at two. It's very good solo as well, but at all player counts, you must improvise ways of increasing the challenge over time (more crystals and the like). We also tried the sand timer once, but the audio track is important. We've started playing with Quests as well as the newer starting system devised by the designer. Quests is a fantastic addition to what already is a super replayable game. 

I ultimately traded it because after around 40-50 plays, I think I'm all set on how fast paced the game is (more a personality thing, but it says a lot that I still loved Escape so much!). I also didn't get to play Quests as much as I would have liked because it's just too much to juggle with new or intermittent players. Overall, I'm glad to have owned this for a few years, but I may wait a while to revisit the genre.

What a great game.  Does not even feel like 10 minutes when you are playing it.  Does seem to cause panic with some people, which is the point I guess.  So easy to play this over and over, but you really need a good table for it.

Rating is based on the niche this game fills. A 10-minute filler that is real time and a fun way to blow off steam and exercise different parts of your brain than you normally exercise while board gaming. Seems like a fun palate cleanser, but could easily overstay its welcome if it comes to the table too often, or too many times back to back.

If you ever find yourself sitting around, bored out of your skull, wishing there were some way to get two fists to squeeze the crap out of your adrenal glands for ten minutes straight, well, this is it.  We've literally had people soaked with sweat—in the depths of winter—and needing to go outside to get some air afterward.

Played at SPIEL'12 in Essen, seemed intereting and fun when I watched others play the game. When I finally got a table and was able to play it, it was just throwing dice against the decreasing time, so a stress game with some cooperattion between players, but nothing I would like to play often, although only 10 Minutes playing time is a big plus for the game.

If you have ten minutes to spare, Escape: Curse of the Temple gives you an experience like no other. I've introduced this game to so many people and it has gone over amazingly well. Each play of the game, even with just the base tiles, is unique and different enough to warrant tons of plays. But more has been added in the form of Cursed tiles and treasures that changes how certain things work, making for a harder or easier experience, and is great that it is included in the box.

Update: I ended up selling my copy (of the big box version) after over 30 play( I haven't logged all my plays on here) I still very much like the game, but it's a bit light even for a real-time game. I think Escape Zombie City may be more "gamey" than this one, and Zombie 15' was definitely a better real-time game, but that one really fails in the setup department. IF it hit the table I will definitely play, but a game like Project Elite would be a better real-time game with more meat.

Very fun coop experience. If you are looking for something that generates the real-time frantic cooperation of space alert but that isn't so mind-rendingly difficult and complex, this is a great game for you. You can teach it in 5 minutes and be off. The only issue I have is that in a smart group that can cooperate well (my group plays lots of coops) it doesn't seem to have a ton of depth. In our first night playing with 4 players we managed to beat the game with both mods added on the hardest difficulty.

I'm not sure that I approve of established publishers using Kickstarter. Either a game is worth publishing or it isn't, you shouldn't be transferring the quality control risk to the purchaser.

Nothing here will challenge the intellect, but be warned, a narrow escape will leave you breathless!

RATING: 7.5
A great, quick game for a broad audience (from old to young, from seasoned to new players, etc.). Easy to learn, a blast to play, and the soundtrack makes it immersive right alongside teammates shouting in you ear with both panic and revelry.  I suggest an untimed playthrough at first to help orient new or young players to the rolling mechanics and to ward off unintentional or intentional cheating (that may emerge under the pressure of the clock). Gameplay is a delightfully frantic 10min but you'll likely want to play multiple times in one session. Really creates a co-op vibe, builds camaraderie, and fulfills that 'just plain fun' portion of the collection. Components are rugged, durable, and of high print quality... a very solid investment. I suggest buying the Big Box edition which includes additional expansions that give the game added dimension, value, and higher replayability.  ESCAPE!  ESCAPE NOW!  You won't be sorry.

Pure Insanity! That is the best way to describe this game. From the moment the gong rings (yes...there is a gong) the room you're in will be deafened by the sound of dice slammed to the table as everyone is trying to roll as quickly and as often as possible!

This is one of the few games that I can say, "This will only take 10 minutes to play" and that's because....it literally takes 10 to play. This game is the filler of filler games.

Definitely play with the "curses and treasures" expansion that come with the base game. These make your experience hilarious since some curses forbid you to talk, play with one hand on your head, or penalize you for being to crazy with your dice rolling.

It plays a bit better than I was expecting, and I was expecting good.  It's not going to change the world of gaming, but it's a coop I can get behind.  A domineering player can still be a dick, but it is at reduced strength thanks to the real-time basis and the focus on your own dice.  The ability to share gold dice is a brilliant way to build camaraderie too!

RATING: 8
Fast paced and frantic real-time dice rolling game, in which you are trying to move through a temple constructed from tiles and complete small "missions" on these tiles in order to escape.  The game is cooperative in the sense that you all win or all lose, and there is limited scope for sharing dice.

The time limit on this game is only 10 minutes, this is good for several reasons.  Firstly, it makes the game frantic (and loud, if there's a few of you playing!) which is very thematic and adds much needed tension to what is basically rolling dice.  Secondly, the game is so short that you'll want to play it several times every time you get it out, which is great as it gives you a few goes at beating it, other cooperative games often don't give you much reason to try them again if you lose.  Lastly, it makes it a very good game for newcomers to gaming, as you'll only waste a few minutes if people don't enjoy it.

All the components for this game are great - the dice are clear, the tiles thick and colourful, and you get some lovely green gems.  The game is dripping in theme and really helps it feel atmospheric with the soundtrack playing in the background.

Very highly recommended, especially for people who like to keep "gateway games" in their collection.

After one night with it, and 3 or 4 back-to-back sessions, I'm intrigued, but unsure if Escape reached total greatness. As a group of 5, we totally botched the first round, but came into to subsequent rounds with a better understanding of our goal, and a strategy to boot, and had far less problems winning. Perhaps the added rules will add the right amount of intrigue. My only fear in buying this is that the game succeeded with our core game players, but I could see my more casual game night attendees fudging the rules to keep going when nobody's over their shoulder.

I see this becoming a 9 very quickly, but the first few plays were tainted slightly by badly misinterpreting the rules, playing with a 4-year-old who was absolutely not ready for the game, and using only the basic tiles.

RATING: 8
So got in a few games and its everything its supposed to be and you think it is. Thematic, fast, fun, frantic filler that can be stressful (probably TOO much for some people, best part for us!) if you are really 'playing' the game (hurry, hurry! [The two midgame races back to the entrance coupled with the music REALLY add tension here) Its also pretty unique and the theme really shines through.   

I mean its a 10 minute dice rolling filler, so of course there aren't lots of juicy decisions to make, but note you wouldn't have TIME to make them if there were! Its really just a nice real-time co-op race against the clock, and I think it does it mostly right especially if you get the difficulty right and come 'close' to winning or just barely win which most of our games have been tense finishes(and difficulty is VERY easy to modify due to the design).  

Will be a big hit this Christmas with all the non-gaming people I know, and I'm sure I'll enjoy playing it with them too (note the wife rates it 9.5). Hard to say how long this enjoyment will last, I am thinking 30 maybe even 40 games, enough to make the rounds with it anyway (although its SO short, it could turn out to be more). Note that it already feels somewhat samey after 5 games, since all you do is roll and explore the same rooms, but for some reason it seems to matter less than many other games as I think you are just too caught up in the race and beating the game (and many people are reporting playing 40+ games and still wanting to play so its a shared effect I think) 

I'm thinking best with 4 but will scale pretty well to any number of players (including solo which I even tried first night I got it to take a quick run through it, first time I ever played a boardgame solo). Oh, yeah after playing I think the two person per tile 'rule' needs to be there

[u]Update[/u]: Played 2 more games, have now played 1,2&4 players, 4 was the most fun for sure with much more yelling and chaos, we played 2 people could only stay on a tile, so just split into two groups and it worked great. I'm tempted to up it to 8.5, I think its very near the same fun level as Space Alert, which I have as 9 but I do worry we will burn out on this one too quick if we don't shelf it for awhile after 15 or so plays. Note have not Escaped in 7 games (edit 10) which I think is a good thing (I also included curses from the start) as I love a good challenge and know many others do too. Here are a couple of my comments from SA that also apply here:  

[i]Like most co-ops group dependency will dictate how much fun you have, our whole group loved it and we played 6 times in our first night of discovery with this game. That says a lot coming from me anyway and I feel it has a great addictive quality where you want to play again to improve, take on harder challenges or just beat the ones you just lost. The game has a nice tension to it with needing to act "under the gun" and boy can things go to hell in a handbasket in a hurry if your not working together. [/i] 

[u]Update[/u] - Yep, 15 plays and the dazzle is lost, but note we did them in like 5 days so that part is our fault I think.  If you (can) keep plays to occasional it will go farther, but regardless I would like to see some more drastic changes (other than just curse or room) in an upcoming expansion to breathe some life back in this one

-----------

Beat the clock real-time co-op filler that plays in a guaranteed 10 minutes and has many tense finishes?  Sign me up. Sure its ultra light and dice rolling but damn 10 minutes flat has an appeal, especially for weeknights :zombie:  If you keep the difficulty up and you and your group 'get into' the game I can see this really getting the blood pumping...

From the great walk-through video that was made (watch it if you want to know EXACTLY how the games plays), I know this will likely be an 8 - 9 game for the wife and I and a hit with some of our 'non-gaming friends', another reason to have it (who are slowly becoming converted...bwahahaha)

Possible houserule - My friend M.Webb inspired - Only 2 (3?) players can 'stay' on one tile? Its pretty easy to see this being an issue, and I definitely don't want it being too easy so will likely play this way.  
[q=CortexBomb] The main issue I see with this design is that there is no penalty for keeping all of the players together at all times and in a larger group this makes it pretty easy to fill each of the treasure tiles quickly and also largely negates the threat of black masks locking up dice [/q]

Simple rules, short play time, and pure chaos.  First board game to actually make my heart pound! If you like your games laid back and strategic you'll probably dislike this hectic dice chucker.  I enjoy this anytime, my wife however doesn't appreciate the "stress".

Will say adding in the curse and treasure cards made it all a bit much for 10 min time limit.

Love the cd timer idea, quality components, and rush this game brings to the table.
Dislike looking for errant dice (almost a mini game all by itself)

I really enjoy Escape, but I find it is one of those games that is difficult to get to the table and keep it there.

The soundtrack adds much to the fun, but can't be used in loud spaces (the variant with the sand timer is nowhere near as fun).

It's also a game that I find people don't want to play more than once or twice. Given that it only lasts about ten minutes, I want to play it more to continue improving and eventually add in expansions to make it more challenging.

I'd love to play this game more, but it just isn't getting the attention I'd like it to get.

I have to admit my daughters, 13, love this game.  We bought it on ebay with all expansions so we have been incorporating them slowly.  The treasures and curses do add to the game excitement.  When the time is running out I get nervous and forget what to do.  My kids help me and we do win more than lose.

We played it six times in a row in the first sitting.  It's a quick game, but still.  I don't usually like speed games, or at least that's what I tend to believe, but this one was fun.  Maybe it's the co-op aspect.  Maybe it's just that the time limit didn't feel particularly oppressive.  We'll see if it stands the test of time.

This is a super fun game to play with first-timers. The curses add a lot to the game, but I'm concerned that it could quickly go stale. I hesitate to play it as often as I do, but it's such a good short game and one game usually turns into two or four. It could very easily drop from 8, but currently rests there because of how much fun I'm having playing it.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (January 2013)

Fun familiar (loud) dice fest game. After hearing this had a soundtrack a la Space Alert, I was keen on trying the game. The good news, the game plays very fast, it has very easy rules to learn, and the components are very well done. However I feel the game is too simple for my taste. I have to say I played the version without the curses when you reveal a new room. I believe I would like more the game that way because the game gets pretty easy after a couple of runs. The cursed dice is a stroke of genius, this makes the game very cooperative and fun to play as there are a lots of yells to get “un cursed”. I really like this “time pressure” games.

I´m concerned about the replayability to the game, it is fun but I think this is not a game to play often. I feel with more plays it will get old very quickly (As I said before I have only played the basic game and I have not read the rules).

As the game plays so fast you want to play again after each loss :D and that is a good sign.

The theme is ok but nothing that appeals to me.

I believe I will buy this game because it is a great familiar game, but I generally don’t want to play it in my usual gaming sessions, if I want to play something like this I will play Space Alert (a superior game in my book). However I won’t say no to this game as it plays so quickly AND it is fun.

As I suspected, Escape: The Curse of the Temple is MUCH better when you play with the curses, they are very fun!! I love when a player can’t speak and he is ignored by the loud yelling of other players :D. I won’t ever play it without the curses. I have yet to try the treasures.

- Man do I enjoy this game. Some people don't though, as it can be HECTIC.
- Makes for great fun with 5-6 players grouped round a table, frantically rolling dice and shouting at each other. Then the gong sounds and everyone rushes to get back to the starting chamber. Inevitably someone has a crap roll and gets stuck.. Do you run back to help a mate? How much time do you have? Maybe 10 seconds... Is that enough?
- It's great to see people pull together as a team to help each other through this.
- I think everyone has a great time playing this, but some people find it too stressful and don't want to play anymore after a couple of games.
- I have the big box, which is okay, but really you only need the base game plus one or two of the tricky rooms to add in. We've never played with the Illusions expansion as it just seems too daunting. We also haven't played with the player powers as, even though they look fun, I'm not convinced they're worth the extra rules explanation and thing to remember in the heat of it. Particularly if you only play this once every now and then with a mixture of newbs+experienced players.
- I'm looking forward to exploring the expansion modules, but I won't be too bothered if I never get to, as the game is really fun as is.

This is a very fun, very fast game. There's a timer capped at 10 minutes, so no surprise 2 hour long games, which is a comfort. It's very luck-based, but it's also cooperative, so good teamwork can overcome bad rolls of the dice. It'd work great as a time filler, but it's good enough to just play many times in a row.

Um belo jogo altamente frenético. É verdade que todos os jogos duram o mesmo, 10 minutos, mas a pressão é intensa. Trata-se de um jogo cooperativo em que é fundamental as pessoas jogarem com fairplay ou retira toda a viabilidade ao produto. É um jogo com dados, em que cada um controla essencialmente o seu jogo. Para quem gosta do género é recomendado. 15 em 20.

Yeah, your heartbeat goes a little nuts playing this game, and eventually you get too good for it, but it's a lot of fun. It really demonstrates cooperative games a lot (and the importance of not cheating for actually challenging yourself and having fun).

This game hasn't come out in a while, but that's mainly because my collection of good games is over 100 now. The curses expansion increases the difficulty in a fun way. Highly recommended!

Why it's not higher: we did hit the ceiling on this one, so not enough meat there to make it a forever, but I know I'll bring it out for the foreseeable future

Escape: The Curse of the Temple is a great way of adding suspense to simple dice rolling.  Putting the players in a situation where they must rush through this temple, collecting jewels and trying to find the exit, is stressful, but mostly just plain fun.

RATING: 8
Note that I am rating this as a kid's game, as I think the replay value for an adult audience would be very limited.

However, with my 7 year old daughter and 12 year old son, this was a blast. Very tense dice-fest where you continuously roll dice in order to get certain combos that allow you to discover new rooms, move into them, and power up gems that allow you to leave the temple while a 10 minute timer soundtrack plays. You have two mid-game objectives of getting back to the start room that keeps it tense throughout.

The basic game is so simple that I could see lots of modifications to add interest and difficulty as required. Obviously there are a couple of expansions already. But even in the base game you could limit grouping, have gold masks free up less black masks, add to the dice requirements to acquire things. Really, the way this game is designed, it's wide with possibilities. This one had the whole family jumping out of their seats!

Excellent family co-op game.  Included CD has a 10 minute soundtrack, with cues for when certain gameplay events take place.  Lots of tension, with the soundtrack timer, speed dice rolling, fast discussions, arguments.  Many ways to configure at setup time, and even more if you own the Big Box version or individual Queenie modules.  Can scale difficulty by adjusting the number of gems you have to activate, the number of room tiles in the deck, which rooms appear in the deck (e.g., remove curse rooms to make it easier).  A very fun, unique game experience.  One that I can come back to over and over, because of all the different ways to set it up.  Even with the same setup, the flow of the game can take different turns depending on the order of the room, curse, and treasure tiles, and where they show up on the board.

Frantic, pulse-pounding, fun.  

Still, you're ever at the mercy of the dice, which, while not a fault of the game, doesn't produce the effect of providing the player with much options or strategy other than how many dice to roll and which room to explore next.  

For my time and money, this equates to a great experience, which never overstays its welcome (even when played 3 or 4 times in a row).  However, it isn't a game I will be thinking about once it's out of my sight.  Great fun though, and it will stay around to keep diversity in the collection.

RATING: 6
Not the first timed cooperative game (e.g. Space Alert) but still rather unique. It's just that I would have enjoyed it much more twenty years ago when I loved to play speed games like [gameid=943]. Nowadays, one game of Escape is stressful enough without enough compensating pleasure to play again. It's also a bit bothering that I myself know that I repeatedly made mistakes while frantically rolling the dice. Main offenders are the skulls, golden or black. This makes Escape a haphazard affair as a boardgame, more feasible as a fun activity.

Escape is fun.  A lot of fun.  So much fun.

In fact, it's so fun that I almost feel bad for giving it a 7 instead of a 9 or 10.

My biggest problem with Escape is also one of the things I enjoy most about it.  The idea that everyone is working at the same time to ultimately achieve the same goal is really intriguing; but this ultimately starts to falter when you realize how chaotic this gets in a game like this.  Dice are flying everywhere, everyone is incredibly spastic, roll liberties can be (and are often) taken...it just seems to me that if the chaos and panic were reigned in even just slightly, this would be top tier.

The difficulty is against you from the outset, so adding in extra modules CAN certainly increase the fun, but it can also make it even MORE chaotic and add too many things to have to grapple with aside from dice and time.

It just doesn't take long to play. And that's almost an addictive quality to it. It's very chance-based, but the problems with so much chance is offset with the real-time element. You're rolling and rolling and rolling. If you aren't rolling, you're wasting time. 

It's a very fun game. Easy to understand. Difficulty can scale quite a lot. If you find it too easy, making it more difficult is very easy to do.

Though I don't really like cooperative games at all, Escape has two of my favorite things in games - frantic dice rolling and a soundtrack. IMO soundtracks are not used enough in games - Space Alert and Squad Seven are both great games, and I can't wait for Panicobloc!

That said, my main reservation with Escape is that it's too easy to inadvertently cheat with all of the dice rolling over and over again. I don't care about intentional cheating - that's just silly and I wouldn't even know where to begin. I'm talking more about people making innocent mistakes due to the speed of the game. I guess it doesn't really matter all that much (I still am rating it an 8), but my OCD side finds it bothersome.

I am going to have to keep an eye out for this designer. I also really enjoyed Mammut, though I wish that his games would go to a company other than Queen. The way they've handled the release of the Illusions expansion is really stupid, and I really dislike how they've been using Kickstarter to fund their games.

Somewhat hectic Indiana Jones-like cooperative game where you and your cohorts are trying to escape from a cursed temple (just like the title says). Too much randomness and luck for my taste. But if you enjoy elevated blood pressure, this might be for you!

Frantic and crazy chaos, everyone is yelling and jumping around. It's nice knowing the game is exactly 10 minutes long.  So far it's been a tough game to beat. We have the soundtrack on our phone and that works nice.  It seems to appeal to all ages.  Everyone in my group seems to love this one more than I do, I don't ever seem to want to play it.  At least three people we have introduced it to have got their own copy after playing.

What a blast! Bought this game, brought it to game night the same day, learned it and played it within 20 minutes. Then everyone immediately set up the tiles for another game. We played it twice more when we got home. Co-ops for the win! The only thing I would suggest is if you're considering using the hourglass, to use your own phone as a timer set for 4:00, 3:00, then 3:22 (the times from the audio track) instead, because we've timed that thing and it's only 2 minutes 47 seconds each time, which is a huge disadvantage.

I like that its a quick game, it's really intense in a good way.  The only real problem I have is the long set up time and some of my family members aren't exactly the best with the locking of dice.  Our youngest isn't so great at remember what he is supposed to be doing so we are constantly having to tell him what we are doing so he can tag along.

I won't try to argue whether the few decisions in this game are meaningful or not but I will say they certainly are not any fun.  If I want to roll dice endlessly I'd much rather play a buckets-of-dice style battle game.  I purchased the Big Box edition of this game and even all those additions do not change that all you do is roll dice over and over and over and over again until you roll what you need.  Or don't.  What interaction there is with other players is just annoying tedium as is the game itself despite it lasting only 10 minutes.

Awesome filler game. This ~~is~~ *was* my gaming group's go-to filler game at the moment.

This game seems to get a little dull after a while. I just don't play it as much as I used to. The curses module seems to make it more difficult to escape for the sake of making more difficult to escape. It doesn't make the game any more enjoyable for myself and my group. I don't know if I'm willing to shed out even more money for the expansions. Overall, this games has dropped from an 8.3 to a 6. It's a good game, but there is 
*IMO* not a lot of replay value without the expansions.

(Coup is our filler game now, and I'm going to pick up the expansion)

UPDATE: Game is now for trade, it just isn't as good as it was before and I really don't want to keep buying the expansions.

Great fast paced game of temple exploring, works great at all player counts and the rush of running for you life at the sound of the gong is absolutely amazing.

I really like it!  If it were longer I probably wouldn't, there's not much to it.  But the fact it's only 10 minutes long makes it suspenseful, exciting, and incredibly difficult (so far, 2 or 3 games lost with my wife).  It's addicting since it's so quick and fun.  I'm sitting at work wanting to play again!  

Updated the score to a 7 down from 8.  Hate to see it go down, but now that the wow novelty has worn off, we just rarely get it out anymore.  Maybe we'll get back into it.  I still think it's a great filler.

Quick to setup and of course, very quick to play. Great to be able to play it solo but a very different experience than the chaos of 4+ players. Nice option of using the 'turn of fate' ability if you are unlucky enough to get all dice showing black masks. Amazing fun with 4+ players but not a game you want to play too often. So far haven't tried any expansions with 4+ players, insane and hard enough as it is!

Interesting concept: like a multiplayer co-operative realtime Yatzee. Fun experience, although I'm little worried about how many games it takes before you have a feeling that you have seen everything. 
Updated: yep, Escape is more or less a game, which works only couple of first plays, but in a longer run it just doesn't offer enough new things. Even the co-op -part doesn't feel that good. So I had to even lower my rating a bit 5 -> 4, because I don't see any place or reason to come back to this any more - even the 'Illusions' -expansion won't save the game.

I can see people are divided over this tile. But I just love silly fun, especially if it’s tense at the same time. It’s just way overpriced for this amount of box contents and this kind of light dice roller – yes, extreme pricing by Queen Games strikes again, why are they doing this? – but it just moved on my wishlist. I’m going to have fun with this game with my kids too, in a few years' time.

I have mixed opinions. It's a fun game to play with all the yelling and panicking and the music. But it's an extremely easy game to accidentally cheat at. Even if we win, it always feels like we probably took a few accidental shortcuts. Because of this, when we want a fast-paced, dice-chucking cooperative game, we'll usually play Fuse instead.

This has become one of my favorite games over the past year.  It's just so much fun!  It's so addicting and just really well done.  I love the soundtrack, it really adds to the atmosphere, I love that it's in a Mayan temple.  I love the artwork, I just love everything about it, even losing isn't too bad it's such a fun game!  What really makes this game the best is the expansions.  The base game is a lot of fun, but once you get used to it the Illusions expansion adds a lot more variety and fun and differences.  The Quest expansion though is just amazing, it makes the game pretty much perfect.  I love the quests, I love the player powers, I love the artwork and the little ghost.  It makes the game deeper and more satisfying, and still fun and atmospheric. If you like the base game and win a lot, get the expansions, especially Quest!  Play this along with Tzolk'in to have a Mayan themed game night with two amazing games!!

RATING: 6
FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

This is no brain burner, nor does the game take a lot of thought.  BUT, I really found myself enjoying this game for what it is - a race against time and the game.  One really feels the pressure if the dice rolls fare poorly and going off alone is not a good idea!  Plays in 10 minutes or less!  Match symbols, work together, and find the exit.  There are one or two times you have to race back to the entrance if you didn't already exit or you will lose a die.

===============================================

Still quite good as a non-gamer's game, but it is a chaotic mess when playing! :-) There are other real time games that I prefer and hold up better over time.

Quick cooperative real time game that benefits and suffers from its format.  It is engaging and chaotic so it can generate a good deal of laughter with the right group but ultimately it's pretty thin on lasting charm and is more of an niche game to bring out every great once in a while.  Playing too much too soon highlights its shortcomings and lack of depth.

Heard a lot of good things about this and it sounded like a fun time. It’s…okay. The main thing is the low level of player interaction, which is odd, since it’s a co-op. There’s the thing where you can unlock others’ black dice, and the thing where you team up to do multiple gem places, but even so, you’re always just focused on your own little set of dice and I dunno. It just seemed to be missing something.

I love the idea of this game, the mad rush in real time to all get the hell out of there. The problem is this just involves constant, manic dice throwing. Now, I've never been inclined to cheat in a game before but does anyone really have time for those black skulls and is it too easy to ignore them? No and yes, in that order. I generally find cheating pointless and I don't know why people do it, but this game also seems pointless. It's not really a game, just something to do for ten minutes. After five minutes I don't care enough to start shouting at people to give me gold skulls while I'm cursed with one hand on my head.

I believe my only timed game. I actually like Escape! for what it is. A frantic, on the fly decision making dice chucking game. It's fun and good.

But I do tend to prefer a heavier game most of the time.

RATING: 6.5
8.5 to 6.5 - A distraction for the ADHD generation.

Excitement and rush of first impression has been diminished by the fact that though it still gives an adrenalin high you quickly become jaded to the roll-move-repeat mechanic.  I predict you will quickly start looking for other gaming highs.

A realtime collaborative game with CD soundtrack.  Roll dice to escape dungeon.  Though halfway through the game you have to return to your starting point - maybe someone left their coat or purse.

The games strengths are also its weaknesses.

Escape as a collaborative game succeeds because of the limits it sets upon the players.  The most obvious example of a limit being that the designers set is the 10-minute time limit as there is not enough time or 'mental' space in this game for a single player to dominate the direction of the game.  It is a joint rush through the dungeon rather than a follow the leader type of game.  Therefore, everyone will feel involved and an equal part of the outcome.  Furthermore, you can't go off and do your own thing as you need to be together - a person on their own who is cursed is well and truly cursed.  Finally, at the start you only have 5 dice each so you can't be a hero on your own.  Therefore you have a real collaborative game due to the limitations rather than the expansive goals and roles found within some examples of the genre.  Plus with the ten minute time limit, quick rules and quick set-up it will find a space in most game nights.

However, the limits also mean that there isn't much depth or mental engagement in the game. Roll and move, share some dice, roll and move and so on.  With an artificial construct of returning to the starting point meaning you will have to roll and move some more there seems to be an abdication of responsibility by the designers. This may be rectified by expansions but a solution should be in the base game.  There is no gaming logic why they should return to the starting point to just repeat the first few minutes.  Maybe this is rectified in the expansions but this is a lazy design approach.  Maybe the players should have something valuable in the starting tile (as part of the victory condition) which they can't take unless they find certain objects on other tiles.  This would increase the challenge and create a reason for them returning.

In conclusion Escape is fun, frantic, very light, accessible, with great components and has design merit (the positives outweigh the negative design choices) however I do not think it has the substance or enduring quality to be a game you return to again and again.

Escape is one of my favorite real time games. I love the frantic dice rolling, and the music and way that the tiles work really put you in the mood of the game. There really aren't enough timed games where you have to respond and act in real time, and this is one of the better ones that I've encountered. I'm always down for a game of Escape, especially when a drink or two is involved.

Simply the purest most adrenaline filled time pressure experience, which in many ways trumps Space Alert. I think the soundtrack is a must as the sand timer makes it more about time management, which seems dull to me.

RATING: 8.7
Type: 1-5 player cooperative timed game of reflexes and dice-rolling.

Best with: 2-4
Weight: Light
Duration: 10 minutes timed
Notes:
time-based dexterity game with dice-chucking
requires interaction and talk to help each other out
some room for dice rolls onto floors or on boards
fully cooperative game
app or mp3-based timer

Players have 10 actual minutes to chuck dice as fast as possible to move around a mysterious temple, discover rooms, unlock chests, find treasure, and reach the exit. Sometimes players are cursed, other times they have dice locked from use, or even get locked in the temple forever if they don't hit certain checkpoints! Oh, and all players are chucking their dice and moving at the same time, as fast as they can.

This game is such sweet fun. You have 10 minutes to work through the temple and get out. This is ridiculously fun, and has just the right amount of interactivity to try and use up crystals, find the exit, and help each other out with locked dice issues.

I also like that this game is easy to teach. While a timed event for a newcomer is stressful, it really just takes one fun run through the game to get what's going on and start making runs that are geared towards success. Throw in some curses like not being able to talk, and you get lots of fun ways to interact with each other while still trying to stay heads-down with your own exploration.

9/2012 Every once in a while there crops up a new and exciting game that's nothing like the rest.  This real-time co-operative exploration game is just excellent.

And it's very easy to balance the game difficulty to fit your groups ability and achieve that touch-and-go intense buzz.

Outstanding cooperative dice rolling game with intensity. Similar to Space Alert in style but with dice rolling, the game is much quicker and very intense. It plays very well solo as well, and it's very easy to customize the game by using several tiles from different modules and adding more gems.

What a fun experience in ten minutes. Everyone has enjoyed this, well I say everyone, my two younger children do not like the soundtrack that comes with the game and will not play it as they are frighten/worried by the tension the game creates. I can understand this and will re-introduce it to them when they are a bit older. My eldest daughter loved it, although I am not sure she plays it in the cooperative spirit of the game. She was howling with joy and laughter after she escaped leaving me behind in the collapsing temple. "Counts as a win in my book!" she laughed. This seems to happen a lot when I play with her!

Great fun. A mad dice frenzy of fun. Again very quick always going to be 10 minutes, which is a bonus for me. I do not plan to get any of the expansions as there is enough for me in the curses and treasure tiles that come with the game.

One I will keep for now.

Played this a bunch at BGG.Con 2012.  A fun and chaotic co-op dice rolling game.  Essentially everyone is working together (for the most part) trying to lay tiles in and escape from a dungeon.
The CD that comes with the special edition makes it pretty fun, though you can get the regular game and download the music track just the same.
Before I played the game I would notice others rolling frantically.  The first time I stopped by and watched it seemed as though those playing were going crazy on a game they'd just made the rules up to.  It was frantic and hilarious.  I highly recommend a few play throughs if you get a chance just for the experience.

10 minutes to teach, 10 minutes to play (and man are those tense minutes!), and it's like popcorn: each game leaves you wanting to play another...which is just fine, since another game only takes 10 minutes! And it's a hoot: chaotic, messy, tense, and above all fun.

There's a lot of luck, but that's fine by me in a short game -- and managing that luck through teamwork and strategy is a key aspect of the game. We played three times on our first time out, trying a different strategy each time; the third time we produced a strategy that led to our first victory -- by a hair.

The components are top-notch, up to Queen's usual high standards. I like that they bundle an expansion with the base game. I love that there are multiple soundtrack options, including downloads from their website. The silent soundtrack is by far the easiest to use, followed by the sand timer. I can't imagine playing with the (much prettier) musical soundtracks -- it's way too fucking hard to hear separate the countdowns and gongs from the music.

RATING: 5.7
I expected this game to be phenomenal. Instead, it is merely good. The greatest advantage of owning this game is its play time. You can knock out several plays in less than an hour, including set up time. Escape is a little light for my taste (in terms of strategy). I do appreciate, however, how the designers have scaled the difficulty. Without the expansions, the game is far too easy for any experienced, adult gamers. With the expansions, there is some tension. Still, I'd simply like the game to be more difficult. We played seven games straight and only lost one because of a stupid mistake. An unfamiliar coop should not play that easily with expansions. I'm excited to try out Escape: Quest though. Hopefully, it will bring more variety/strategy to the game.

A stressful game that gets the heart rate up when playing with the soundtrack. I enjoy the definitive game length, but i'd say gameplay is a bit repetitive after a few plays.

Escape: The Curse of the Temple is an intense, timed, co-op game.  In it players are Indiana Jones-like explorers inside an ancient temple.  It comes with a 10 minute long soundtrack, and when the soundtrack ends the temple collapses on top of anyone who's left in it, and game is over.  So, players have just 10 minutes to search the temple, find enough gems to get out of it, and leave.  The temple itself is a modular board made up of tiles that will be placed out as players discover new rooms.

There are no turns.  As soon as the soundtrack begins everyone starts rolling dice frantically.  The dice are custom 6 sided affairs.  They depict various pictures instead of numbers, or pips.  The co-op aspect of the game comes into play in the sharing of these dice in certain situations.  For example, dice can be lost if the "cursed" side comes up.  Another player can "uncurse" your dice if you've lost too many.  Also, players' combined roll can be used in some rooms to get rid of gems.  Getting rid of gems is important, because to leave the temple players will need to roll 1 "key" more than however many gems are left over.  Everyone must escape for it to be considered a win.

Escape: The Curse of the Temple is pressure filled.  You know you only have 10 minutes, and the soundtrack really ratchets up the sense of near panic.  It starts off slow, but increases in tempo, even featuring a pounding heart-type sound.  The only drawback that I sense is they game does become repetitive after a few plays, as all you're doing every time is rolling dice as fast as you can to get the symbols you need.  It's a good one to play though if you've never played it before, and a really great game to show others.  Watching their reaction if fun!

RATING: 5.5
First there was Space Alert, which I still consider the essential realtime game despite pretty hardcore learning curve. Now here is Escape, another well-received realtime game. It's way easier to setup and teach. Also, unlike Space Alert, you do the resolutions in realtime aswell while frantically rolling your dice so it feels more lively. Curses are fun too. Sounds pretty perfect so far? Here comes the downside - the replayability is pretty bad. When you've played it ~5 times you'll be winning pretty consistently. 5 games may sound like a lot, but you have to remember that they're 10-minute games. The expansion helped for a while but not in the long run. It's a very fun game and if you haven't played it, I highly recommend it, but its place in a permanent small/medium-sized collection is somewhat problematic. I'm keeping it for memories if not anything else and maybe after couple of years it'll be fun again? But if you are thinking of buying, think twice and play someone elses copy first if possible.

2-Player Comment:
* The more the merrier, but Escape works well with any player count. We play 2p with 12 diamonds.

Running back to the entrance before the door closes and trying to escape before the Temple collapses. Quite enjoyed it.

RATING: 10
I'll just say it right away: this game is amazing! Mechanically, it's really simple: you roll dice to explore the temple, and when you have activated enough crystals, you can escape. It's cooperative, so everyone works together to escape, and if someone fails, the group loses. The catch is, there's a soundtrack that gives you exactly 10 minutes to do everything. And there are no turns. Everyone rolls their dice as fast as they can. Roll a black mask and you can't reroll that die until you get freed by a golden mask. Get 5 black masks and you're stuck, and will need help to do anything. It's a seriously frantic and fun social experience. Fast set-up and tear down. Works very well both with casual and with experienced players. It's stressful and tense, though. If you want to sit back, relax and think your actions through, this is not the game you want to play. No alpha player problem. No doubt, one of my favorites.

RATING: 7
A great, 10 minutes, stress-filed escape game. The lack of turns and real life count-down genuinely adds to theme of trying to escape and is cleverly built within the dice mechanics.

The need for separating and sticking together makes choices hard, especially when players are locked down and need help. The game only really feels complete with the sound-track, and is certainly not the same without it. A must buy, only if you can handle the tension.

What a tense game! I love it. The randomness of the dice and the blind draws, the frantic cooperative gameplay and it only takes 10 minutes. Almost like playing a DMD pinball machine. The only negative point is the price of this game: it's quite high, though the components are great. I knew about the price, so I don't mind.

Edit: chaos! I love it! Also played 1 game with the sand timer: not as fun as with the soundtrack. And you can forget the timer completely...

Edit 2: luckily they made a kind of silent soundtrack (nr. 3 on the site), so you don't have to use the sandtimer anymore. Extremely fun game: near perfect for me!

Edit 3: the novelty of the game is gone, but it's still an extremely fun (filler) game.

Edit 4: this game (especially solo) helps me train to have less AP. :)

I expected to hate this. A 10 minute real-time dice rolling extravaganza?

Boy, was I wrong. And its not the game. The game is pretty simple. But the time pressure adds elements to the cooperative game play that no other coop has. You have to help each other, there is constant vocal interaction and racing around to help. Not much room in that pressure for one player to take over either.

Fun, fast paced, and frantic. The game hits the flavor very well, though there are some issues with ensuring that players are all playing by the rules and not fudging (accidentally or not) their rolls.

The foreboding presence of the curse dice and the on-the-fly strategizing and decision making are high points, with the bad beats and inability to fairness check being low points.

Fun game, nothing close to anything I played before. The co-operative element is well worked out, as the more players you play with, the more important it becomes.

Game in a Nutshell: Explore a temple in a timed co-op using rapid dice rolling to move, search for treasure, and ultimately escape with your lives.

Played as: 5 player

Pros: It's certainly a different kind of Co-op in that there's zero time to "huddle-up" and come to a consensus once the music starts. There's excitement to the frenzied sound of a table full of people re-rolling dice as fast as possible while shouting needs over the top of it.

Cons: Maybe I just didn't "get it" but at its core it's just a game about rolling and rerolling dice to try and get a certain result. Imagine rolling a handful of dice needing a six... roll, nope, re-roll, nope, re-roll, yep! What's next? A five. Roll, nope, re-roll, and on and on... where others find continued value in this beyond a simple children's game is beyond me. I also think required sound-tracks are bothersome.

Other: I was surprised how solitary my one play felt. It's more about everyone zoning out on their own little dice game in unison with others than a true cooperative experience. For Pete's sake, I played the Escape Experience with 12 different copies of the game going in unison in a small room and wasn't even able to take in the grandness of it all for how into my own "solitaire game" I was.

Best Use: A co-op with a bit of adrenaline edge when the family needs a pick-me-up.

Since it is a real time game where you don't wait for your turn as in a more regular game, the game play could be a bit chaotic. New players should try first without timer to get the hang of it.

Don't remove the rule of returning to the starting point twice. The temple will be a snake otherwise and hard for players in the other end to get out in time.

It happens very rare I come across a game that leaves me completely in love. But boy is this game fun!!
The game scales extremely well with any number of players and can be enjoyed by both hardcore and casual gamers alike.
Different setup rules helps determine how hard the challence at defeating the game will be, thus can be ajusted to suit the players abilities.

Even though the game is all about roling dice I believe there is some real strategy to it as well, that will keep you comming back for more.
I dont think the basegame alone will grow stale for the first many games, but it is nice to know that comming expansions will further encrease the possibilities for an even more challinging game, which will help to keep the game fresh as you can mix and match the individual modules as you see fit.

Without hesitation I can declare this beauty an instant classic.

Awesome filler, lots of fun to play, acomodates up to 6 players (with the expansion), and only lasts 10 minutes a game, meaning you can have up to 3 very fun runs in barely over half an hour! Everything in it is quite nice to look at, too!

The only reason for not giving it a higher score it's the fact that the expansion is very desirable (for the 6th player, and even if not for that, to add some replayability with he extra tiles), and both are pretty expensive for what you get (component-wise)

Easily the most talked about game at our house immediately after Christmas 2012, but I question it's staying power.

EDIT: Staying power has indeed dipped. However, played this the other day with a fun group and we all just survived (within seconds) and it was quick, great fun for all. Still, with us winning more and more it gets played less and less, hence the slight drop in rank down to a 7. Still makes a great filler and I see it pop up every other month or so to keep it fresh.

I like dice games.  I like co-op games.  This one seems like it should be a great fit.  But there should be more to a dice game than *just* rolling dice, and there should be more to a co-op game than *just* sharing items.  Unfortunately, this one doesn't bring much to the table beyond the basics.

Stressful but addictive game with an enerving soundtrack in the background. I think it gets easier the more you play it but then you can throw in the expansions. We need to play with these to be sure if it still stays interesting in the long term. Our most played game of 2013 and we only bought it at Essen in October of 2013, so that already explains how much fun it is!

RATING: 7
There is some fun to be had in this 10 minute game, but I'm afraid this is a flash-in-the-pan game with little staying power.  What strategy there may be is quickly learned after one play.  That strategy is for everyone to stay together and don't go be a hero exploring by yourself.  If you like rolling dice at a frantic pace, this may be your game.

Kicsit csalódás a játék. Úgy képzeltem, hogy mindenki állva üvöltözik, miközben kockák röpködnek mindenfelé. A tanuló játék (háttérzene nélkül) közel sem volt ilyen, mikor azonban a CD elindult, no az hihetetlen mennyit dobott az élményen! Ezt nem gondoltam volna! Azonban így is mérsékelten volt izgalmas, simán nyertünk, és már nem is hagyták a többiek, hogy bedobjam az átkokat, kincseket, mondván úgy izgibb lesz, mert nem akartak vele többe játszani. Bepróbálkozom másoknál, viszont ott nem élek majd a fokozatosság elvével. Bumm bele minden, hadd szóljon! ;) :P

2017 -
Újrapróbáltuk. A gondom az, hogy nem izgalmas (bár továbbra sem próbáltam az extra dolgokat). A kooperatív játékokban a döntések okozta feszültséget szeretem, itt viszont a kocka általi szerencse dönt, és ez okoz izgalmat. Illetve okozna, mert valamiért egyáltalán nem tudom magam beleélni az omladozó templomból menekülő kalandor bőrébe. Szerintem viszonylagos sikerességét egyedül a játékhoz adott hangfájloknak köszönheti, ami mindenképpen rengeteget hozzáad az élményhez. Azonban ez így is kevés.. Jelenleg 6->5

RATING: 6.5
In bester Indiana Jones Tradition, versuchen die Spieler in Escape aus einem antiken und verfluchten Majatempel zu entfliehen, bevor dieser über ihnen zusammen bricht. Die Spieler arbeiten dabei zusammen und die Flucht läuft in Echtzeit ab. Im Spiel liegt eine Audio-CD bei, die die dramatische Flucht mit einem 10 Minuten Musikclip untermalt und auch an zwei Stellen ins Spielgeschehen eingreift (durch ein akkustisches Signal). Der Spielverlauf ist recht simpel: Alle Spieler würfeln gleichzeitig und versuchen, wie bei Kniffel, die passenden Symbole zu erwürfeln. Dabei müssen die Spieler in manchen Räumen gleiche Symbole erwürfeln, um diesen zu verlassen. Escape ist ein hektisches Spiel, was als guter Filler oder als Einstieg in einen Spieleabend gut funktioniert.

An awesome real time dice game where you have 10 minutes to cooperatively explore the temple, brake the curses and escape before the soundtrack runs out.

There is very little to the gameplay here, there's not even a turn sequence- just the start signal goes and everyone starts rolling and shouting and grabbing at their pieces for 10 minutes!

It plays incredibly well though for what it is. Its intense, simple and fun, making it a great short length cooperative game and even a good filler (as long as you have thick walls so your neighbours can't hear you shouting 'I'VE GOT TWO TORCHES!' and 'HELP ME! I'M LOCKED DOWN!!').

I found the game quickly lost its novelty value without the addition of the Curses/Treasures variant. We found after our first two games the base game held no further challenge and we won every time. The Curses/Treasures variant fixes the game and makes it a challenge for adult gamers, although I expect the base game will be enough from a family perspective and casual gamers.

Escape causes you to panic. The game takes place in a "real time" situation, as in the game will always take exactly 10 minutes to complete, win or lose. The soundtrack makes the game too. It's the real cherry on top. My only problem with the game is I find it easy to cheat. I have caught people rerolling dice they shouldn't be able to reroll, and may it be on purpose or not, I would rather loose a fair game than win an unfair one. 

Game does get significantly better with the curse and treasure tiles. The panic and relief these cause fluctuates depending in what you draw and can cause things to go good or bad real fast. Good for experienced players, but makes the game loads of fun.

Frantic fun. Our first real-time game and we enjoyed it. Takes little time to set-up and play as well which is a bonus. It will eventually need more expansions to keep it fresh (and they're over-priced in my opinion). Until that day, we'll continue to enjoy it.

RATING: 6
A real time dice rolling game in which the players must work together to place gems at key locations to stop the curse and then get out in the real time time limit of 10 minutes.

I'll be honest this one just didn't float my boat. Novel idea but for me (a dice rolling fan) the rolling here just seemed a little tedious. The audio CD does its best to add tension to the game but for me this game is not worth its investment.

Really a filler and one that you don't want to be pulling out all the time or it will wear thin quite quickly. 

Some have the same feeling about 7 Wonders. Well my personal bent is that 7 Wonders has way more going on than this and will hold my interest far longer than Escape can.

Has a fun gimmick, but I was over it after a few plays. Rolling dice frantically in a cooperative, real-time environment where you can't be sure if everyone is playing entirely correctly doesn't really appeal to me. As a solitaire game, it just felt kind of mediocre.

The MSRP on this one is daunting ($60!), and the cost per minute of play is pretty high ($6 per person). But I love the simultaneous actions, the look of the engraved dice, the tension, and the commitment to the game by the players. One quibble with the soundtrack: I think it probably plays well in a CD player, but playing it in a noisy store with the full complement of players yelling and flinging dice makes it hard to distinguish the sound of the gong. There is a sand timer you can use, though.

If you can get it on sale, get it.

We are TERRIBLE at this game!!!  There is a 1 in 6 chance of rolling a black mask, which locks one of your dice up, and we roll them constantly.  It can be rather frustrating.

All the same, Escape is fast and a lot of fun.

I also own the Illusions expansion.  You can fit everything from the base game in the Illusions box with room to spare, which is awesome!

I did rate this game as an 8 because I like it and think it is unique among board games that people have played. It is a great way to start a game night, and to introduce people to the world of table top gaming. It is short enough not to outstay its welcome, and to desire at least one more play through. Look forward to trying it with the curse and treasure modules in the box.

Also, my wife likes it. This takes it from an 8 to a 9.

Reviewed rating on Sept 2. Lowered score by 1 point. Still like the game but I think that my time with it is over. I have pretty much figured out the best way to play it so that I can maximize wins. I have found that people that are new to the game absolutely LOVE it.

It will stay because it is a great time filler.

It has come out a few times this year and has worked well with people. I have found that a few simple strategies make this game fairly simple though. As I play with newer people most of the time, they tend not to enjoy jumping into the expansions.

Found this game quite challenging because both players kept locking themselves up with cursed masks. I'm definitely not a lucky die roller.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The fun of the game comes from all the kinds of problems that emerge from group splitting. However the optimal strategy is to do the exact opposite, forming one big party that tackles triple gem rooms easily, has some use for the spare golden masks from its 15 rolls per second and follows an efficient room exploring pattern:
- 1st pass => east half staying close to the entrance
- 2nd pass => west half staying close to the entrance
- 3rd pass => exit

Once you've figured that out, Escape is unfortunately pretty bland. While it might work as party game with clueless people, cold-blooded fast rollers will have a breeze of a time. The bundled variant tiles raise the difficulty without adding any meaningful challenge. Perhaps a further expansion has figured that out and given incentives for the group to split, but that probably means replacing most tiles of the base game, which is already quite expensive thanks to Queen Games' usual pricing policy.

Then there's the real time component, which I love in theory, but doesn't work because of golden masks, often leading to multiple people unlocking black dice when someone says "I can unfreeze 3." Little approximations that can hardly be checked because everyone is busy rolling and shouting simultaneously, resulting in a lot of gentle and unintentional cheating.

This is the favourite game of my 9-year old. He would most definetively rate it as a 10.

Often he refuse to play other games if we don't promise to play escape too. At the same time, his little sister mostly refuse to play Escape because she find it to scary(!) And I'm honestly not always in the mood for playing Escape myself either. In other words; it have happened from time to time that we have ended up playing nothing at all because we couldn't agree about playing Escape. 
And THAT is quite sad. 

Without the constant nagging about playing this game I would probably have rated it as a strong 7...

In this real time game, players have 10 minutes to escape from a collapsing temple. Players are continuously rolling dice to either: explore a new tile, discover a new tile, activating gems, or rolling to escape. The dice also have black symbols, which make the die useless, but can be recovered by rolling a gold symbol, which reactivates two black dice. Players can escape when they have activated enough gems so that the escape roll is manageable.

This is a frenetic dice rolling game, since you have to go back to the start chamber a couple of times during the game, otherwise you lose a die. Teamwork is essential, since some players can roll too many black dice, and need help to get out. 

It's fun, having played the basic game, the curses module, along with the treasures module. I'm looking forward to more plays.

This game is ridiculously fun with a full five players. The box artwork isn't great, and the write-up on the back doesn't do it justice. However when you unpack all the stuff inside (and there is a lot of stuff) and start rolling dice with your friends you'll all be laughing and shouting.

Both a pro and a con is that the game actually does only take ten minutes to play. That means you can play the basic game once to get started, then increase the difficulty with curses and make more options with treasures. Great fun, if a little short. It'll get your game night going no problem!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun, silly, simplistic, chaotic.

I wouldn't suggest this to someone that purely likes strategic games, as this game is so fast paced and crazy that strategy is generally thrown out the window for quick thinking, gut instinct, and decent luck. 

It's a co-op game that generally avoids quarterbacking, mainly because the quarterback is too busy and too under pressure to make decisions for everyone in the group.

It is interesting how some groups may decide to stick together to share golden masks (and therefore keep all of their dice in use), but some other groups I play with like to split up and explore large parts of the temple in  a short time span.

The game, for only being 10 minutes long, certainly finds a way to make sure those entire 10 minutes are filled with maximum intensity. 

I'm generally someone who's into something a bit more... thinky? (as pretentious as that sounds), but escape is one of those games I've played quite a bit, for quite a while, and it still hasn't gotten less fun.

RATING: 5.8
We are experienced coop players and have played a couple of games... but it was just too easy. If you're acting fast enough with your hands and once you've understood that you should travel in pack rather than split up, you'll obliterate the game pretty much every single time, even when including expansions to make things harder. Sold it as the replayability value was low. This being said, it may still be a very pleasant game for unexperienced coop players or people whose personality is prone to unproductive panic...

RATING: 6
Simple concept, chaotic gameplay, raucous fun, but despite its size, it is basically a filler. Interest in Escape is like a flash-fire; burning brightly, but for a very short duration.

E:tCotT's extremely short play length may increase its entertainment half-life, but only in number of plays, overall time spent with it will likely be very brief. The Curses and Treasures module[s?] included will likely get just a single play, because they don't change what the game is, rather they just add unnecessary complexity.

Escape may be too difficult to win with any regularity. For the amount of gems needed to escape there are just too many useless empty rooms in the draw pile. Replacing them with the tiles from the Treasures module might ameliorate the problem.

The biggest issue I have with Escape is the soundtrack. The gongs aren't audible enough. I wish there was just a person who said "Explore, Run, Explore, Run, Explore and Escape". That would be far more clear.

Escape is the sort of fun, cooperative experience that is just right for introducing boardgames to those that have never.

RATING: 4
Silly fun in the beginning, but the chaotic game play that this game fosters irritates me.  In general I am not a huge proponent for games that feature simultaneous play.  I like the CD in the background telling you when certain things happen, but still, I am not a cheater and because of the chaotic game play there is a BIG chance that a few of my dice MAY have been cheated on.

For what it is worth this is a great simultaneous play type game...but these games are not for me.

RATING: 6
I'm mixed on this one, I like that it only lasts 10 min.  The game does instill a frantic feeling and gets your heart racing which is cool. The components are nice, maybe too nice (expensive) for such a simple game.  Its so chaotic with everyone talking over each other that it is easy to miss sound cues.  Also you are on the honor system as to your rolls which, at least it is a co-op so it works.  It works better as the warm up than cool down game of the night because after a night of gaming it just seems exhausting to play.  The game has deliberately short playtime and you see most if not all of the tiles each time, this makes repeated plays unappealing, yet you need to play with the same group enough to toss in the curses and treasures in which is just more chaos and requires you to memorize the symbols on the cards. YMMV.

RATING: N/A
This game is a frantic dice-fest. It can be fun, just because racing against the clock really gets your heart racing. You have to coordinate and act very quickly, so it can often help to group into pairs if you're playing with four. My main complaint is that the audio cues aren't that clear to me, and while the soundtrack is very thematic, I'd probably prefer something with a more precise sound cue. Just toss a beep in there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I must first say that I love dice games. Escape was an immediate buy for me. I found it very original and refreshing. 

The components and the graphic design and very nice. The rules are quite simple and very easy to teach, but the translations are just horrible. Basically, the games plays differently depending on the idiom of the manual you read. I think I've never seen such a thing in the many, many games I own/owned. 

But the game is very fun and it's worth the while. There is some people that do not like cooperative or stresful games. But if you're not one of them, Escape is at least worth a try. The game is guaranteed to last only 10 minutes!

There are some expansions and many queenies that add plenty of new content. I think most of it is uneeded and will only contribute to increase confusion and setup time. Only for those that are deep into this game.

First impression (5 players):
It's a big chaos both in positive and negative way. Main thing I don't like in the game is the fact it is way too easy to accidently break rules. Since game encourages to do things fast it is a little too easy to do it just a bit too fast. Other big disappointment was the timer. I almost would say it's broken since it was really, really hard to hear when door slams shut or temple collapses. Too much thematic sounds there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I know that this is not the best, most well designed game out there in existence, but man, is it fun.  I really, really enjoy this game. It is great to introduce it to others and see their reactions to the fact that there is a sound track, and you have to go fast.  

I am finding quickly though that playing a few times really does make the game infinitely more easy once you know what you are doing.  I encourage you to pick up this game if it sounds interesting, if it does not, well, there are plenty more games out there.  Great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fund and quick game. Since it has a maximum duration of ten minutes, it's nice to play at the beginning of a boardgame evening, while waiting for more people to arrive. The more players the better. Some expansions should improve the game a lot, but I haven't played those.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really intense and hectic real-time dice rolling experience. Not much content decision-wise but that's not really a problem in a ten minute game. When playing with the curses included, definitely needs a large number of players to mitigate the damages. Otherwise it is very easy for a single player to get completely swamped by the curses.

I'm a bit worried about replayability. The fact that the expansions mainly just increase difficulty seems to support this view.

International version with wooden dice; Where to get the plastic dice?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I don't get the hype. Ok, it's fresh and fast (10 min.) but... it's nobrainer. Zero decisions to make and what I'm doing in the game IMO it's not fun at all. And it should be fun, because it is a party/light game. 
It's not a bad game, but for me, it's boring. Replayability probably is also very low.

This game is intense, loud and FUN! I took two copies of this game to a gaming group that consisted of twelve kids 11 to 15 years of age. They played with five players at each board and I played the sound track over the classroom PA system. Wow! Talk about intensity and excitement!  Yelling, laughing, cursing (I asked them keep that to a minimum) and profuse sweating was the course of the afternoon.  Since each game only lasts ten minutes, they were able to rotate in the left out kids frequently. Some were glad to be out to rest. They played this game (two simultaneous games actually) for the entire hour and a half!  They loved, loved, LOVED this game! 

For as much as that particular group loved the game, it is too intense for some.  I played with a smaller group of kids at my house (two boys, two girls; all aged from 11 to 12; one was my daughter).  Sure enough the intensity was just as high as with the older kids, but at the end of the ten minute game, one of the boys began to cry.  It was way too intense for this sensitive little guy.  I quietly put the game away and got out Stone Age, which he and the others loved.

For many, this game is loads of loud, intense fun.  But there are those that prefer something a little quieter and cerebral.  In spite of this caveat, you should have this game in your collection!

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This game fell quickly; my kids found this game really stressful and never requested to play it. Also, after 15 plays, I feel like we saw everything it had to offer and adding expansions wasn't really going to change much. This is another co-op game that has fizzled out with my family, therefore I traded it away.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8.5):[/COLOR]

[i]- Great soundtrack, really sets the mood for this game.
- The theme comes through; you feel like you are trapped in some horrible temple with little time to escape.
- Nice artwork and components, I really like the Indiana Jones meeples.
- Plays in 10 minutes making this a great beginning/end of night game.[/i]

Too easy to cheat and get lost in the frenzy of dice throwing.

Intensely Intense game! This is a fun party game. The intensity of trying to escape the temple is heart felt by all players. The base game is difficult in and of itself. Add with the treasures, it still is difficult, add in the cursed tiles and the difficulty increases even more. So far, with our first play with a group of non-gamers at a party, the immediately discovered that a 6th player was necessary because of all the people having a great time. My wife joined in with the 6th player equipment from the illusions expansion immediately. This game is so well balanced and the components are top top quality. At first I thought this game is so hard, when will I need any of the expansions. After a few plays we became ready for more, adding in the treasures...and more, adding in the cursed tiles and 6th player. Everyone loved this game! As my wife was playing with a group and intensely trying her hardest to get back to the entrance before the doors slammed shut. I whispered in her ear that this may be one of the best party games ever! She couldn't speak at the time, but later she agreed! One of the best moments of the game was when one player playing her second game, screamed "Get Back...Get Back everyone!" just before the doors slammed shut. 

Some great elements of the game are losing a die because you cannot get back to the entry room in time and the opportunity to give someone one of your dice when you safely leave the temple. You are passing a bit of equipment on to a fellow adventurer to help them get to safety. Also, helping each other gain enough dice for collecting gems in the gem rooms is a sweet bit of cooperative play.

遊戲重點是快速判斷要留那些骰使用那些骰啟動
使用了擴充之後最好能優先解決擾人的詛咒
不過基本上還是運氣很重要的遊戲
規則:
*起始板塊放中間，出口外洗勻抽兩個放起始板塊兩側，抽四個跟出口板塊洗勻放板塊堆下面(1~2人時把出口插在中間)，根據人數1~2/3/4/5人時放7/11/14/16顆寶石在寶石板塊上，下面再額外放兩顆
*每個人拿五顆骰(1人七顆)跟一個顏色米寶放中間，一個顏色標記放面前
*遊戲根據音樂進行10分鐘，逃出獲勝，遊戲開始就可以不斷擲骰
*板塊右下角為進入該板塊要花的骰面，中間為拿寶石要花的骰面，放板塊是要出口相連，黑色入口則是一開始打開時要用來跟目前的任一個入口相連
*骰子不斷重骰並保留想要的骰面，黑色不行，黃色可解除兩顆黑色，同樣位置可幫解除，執行行動後用過的要全部重骰，保留的也可重骰
1.進入板塊 使用對應骰面進入該相鄰有入口的板塊
2.發現板塊 兩個綠色面且有出口沒連的可拿一個新板塊來相連
3.啟動魔法祭壇 骰出對應骰面 放一顆寶石到祭壇，可多人合作，多個祭壇的只能完成一個
4.逃跑 在出口骰出等於剩餘寶石數加1的藍色面，逃出後可把一顆骰給隊友
5.可把寶石圖板外的一顆寶石放進寶石圖板來讓所有人重骰黑色骰面
*停到銅鑼聲時要在時限內回到起始板塊，否則會少一顆骰
***模組1跟2**
*使用新的13個版塊擋開出的版塊有神像拿一個詛咒版塊，獲得詛咒效果可單獨擲骰解決
*有寶藏就放寶藏，擲出結果可拿，都是一次性效果

One of the worst games I have ever played. When the game was being explained I thought it sounded interesting in that you navigated the temple through press-your-luck dice rolling. Then the sand timer was introduced and the game descended into yelling and frantic dice rolling making moderation impossible.

RATING: 7
Frantic dice rolling fun for those who like frantic dice rolling fun. Count me one. You've got one eye on your dice, rolling and re-rolling to explore for new rooms (roll 2 greens next to an open door), enter a room (roll the entrance combo) or acquire gems (roll keys) in the gem rooms. At the same time, you're keeping an eye on all the other players, talking and agreeing what you'll do together, because if you're together you can help each other out getting rid of any black results you roll (which lock those dice away) and also combining rolls of keys to get gems. At the third and two-thirds points, as gonged out by the 10 minute soundtrack that you play within, you need to race back to the start so that you don't lose a die. Or do you just cop it and keep going? 10 minutes just flies. It's not easy, it takes practice to win, which is a good thing. It won't be easy to get to the table with non-gamers because frantic dice-rolling usually isn't everyone's cup of tea, and it's not going to sit well with studious euro-gamers, but there's a bunch of people in between who will enjoy the ride and the co-op strategising on the fly. As meaty a 10 minute filler as you can find.

RATING: 8
"Frantic dice-chucking real-time co-op. Great theme, and requires actual cooperation. Even after over a dozen plays, I prefer it without the expansions. I wish the soundtracks had less extraneous noise and clearer meaningful signals."

What I like:
- Co-op with actual cooperation, and no "boss players"
- Quick to teach, quick to play, fun
- Nice components

What I don't like:
- It's pretty easy to accidentally cheat
- There are too many curse tiles in the expansion
- Soundtrack might not work in all venues, and a sand timer is a poor substitute

For me, I would want to play the basic tiles at least 5-10 times before adding the curse/treasure or other expansions. I didn't have the basic rules down, and the curses and treasures just added a bit too much and overwhelmed me. After the base game is second nature, I think adding the other tiles for variety would be good.

This game combines three things I'm not a fan of: cooperative play, Yahtzee-style dice-rolling, and time limits.  You roll dice, using the symbols you roll to move around and complete challenges (often needing others to help you with the challenges), while frantic music plays in the background.  If you roll a certain side on your dice, then your character can get stuck, and you need to get other players to come help you by rolling another symbol.  If you like frantic dice-rolling mayhem, then you may enjoy this.  I don't.

Probably the most board game fun you can have in ten minutes. Doesn't overstay it's welcome and you can't just play one game. A great way to open and/or close a game night. 

It can be mentally and physically exhausting to some due to the rapid pace and stress inducing intensity. not a good game to play if you are tired. 

best played with expansions after you have played the base game a few times.

RATING: 6
Solves three common problems in gaming: zero down time, almost no set-up and 15 minutes start-to-finish.

The black skulls are tough. We essentially end up with an eliminated player every game, but that player only has to wait another 3 minutes, so it isn't really a negative.

The game is strangely exhausting due to the chaos of simultaneous action. 

The curse cards are great. We love the no talking curse and the play with your hand on your head curse.

Sets up and plays quickly. Because it's real time, it's intense even when things go well for you. And the resolution is immediate: You've either won or lost by the time the sound track ends.

Stress.  Noise.  Real time, tile laying, temple searching, exit seeking, stressful game.  Only dice game that I really enjoy the dice.  There is LOTS of dice rolling...I mean L.O.T.S. of dice rolling.  Everyone constantly rolling dice while also yelling at each other for help and complaining.  This occurs while a soundtrack plays anxiety fostering music...drumming...bonging...  This game is loud.  This game is stressful.  This game is tiring.  This game usual ends with "Can we try again?!"  This game is a guaranteed ten minutes of guaranteed fun!

Very intense play sessions that usually end with a last second victory. On the other hand, all you are really doing is rolling dice as fast as you can to get certain symbols. Some planning and teamwork involved though there's definitely a sense that the theme and timer mask the illusion of a game.

RATING: 8.5
Fast and fun.  It seems like it would be a good gateway game, but I find that it stresses out new players. The game without any special tiles becomes quite easy to beat after a few plays. However, adding in the curses and additional gems add some additional challenge to the game. The games has several of my partner's favorite things in a game: fast, cooperative, and lighter decision making.

This is a real time game, that means, there's a clock, and when it is over, the game is over. it is also a cooperative game.

This game is so quick and chaotic, my SO says it stresses her so she doesn't like it. I, however, love the chaotic nature of it, I don't think I've ever had a game that wasn't exciting. Playing with the penalty cards is really good, and I LOVE when a player's dice get all blocked and starts panicking.

hugely recommended.

I got to play this game finally at my local board game meetup. I think the rating would have been higher if we have the sound track going, but instead, we used the hour glass. I played this with 4 other players, and I teamed up with the person sitting next to me. It was a nice co-op experience but it was just throwing dice and moving. I thought I'd like this game more, but it feels ok to me now after 2 plays. 1 play with original base set and 1 play with all the KS expansions thrown in since the guy who owned the game KSed it.

Don't know if it's inexperience, but I seemed that everybody is more doing things on itself shouting he needs a gold dice sometimes and just at that moment you'll have a look where he is. But off course the short playing time is a big plus, you'll start over right away.

RATING: 7
Escape: The Curse of the Temple is a light, innovative, real-time tile laying game in which you are trying to escape an ancient temple before the exit is sealed shut, trapping your intrepid adventurer forever. The 10 minute soundtrack keeps the players on task while they frantically roll dice to discover new rooms, unlock the mysteries of the cursed gems, and try to crack the lock on the exit. 

The game play is, as you might imagine, fast paced and breathtaking. There is no downtime here! Well, until one of your dice goes careening off the table and you waste that last few precious seconds to find it! 

The base game is a good introduction to the game play, but does tend to be rather easy. For an intermediate level game, I will mix half of the base game tiles with half of the Curses and Treasures expansion, which comes with newer editions. For a more challenging experience, go all in with the Curses and Treasures - and then add some extra gems! 

The one minor criticism I have is with the soundtracks. A number of soundtracks are available on the website. My favorites provide a rich tapestry of background effects that really enhance the mood. Unfortunately, the level of the background effects is too high for me to easily hear the gongs (timer cues), so I'm stuck listening to the soundtrack versions with no sound effects, just the timer cues. 

A note on set-up: The instructions suggest for a solo game to insert the exit tile somewhere in the middle of the tile stack. This makes for a game that is far too short. Instead, set up just like for multiplayer games by shuffling the exit tile with the top four tiles of the tile stack and then putting them on the bottom.

Quick, fast fun even solo!

This game is just plain fun.  It is rare that a board game gets your heart pumping but this one does because you and your friends have to escape from the temple together before the timer runs out.

A nice feature of the game is the you can play on your own or with a total of 5 players.  The game scales nicely although in my experience the game seems to get harder with more players because there needs to be more cooperation and negotiation.

That's because in this game everyone plays together.  To win everyone has to exit the temple before the time runs out or everyone loses - trapped underground forever.

The game mechanics are really simple to teach which is another major plus.  You just roll a few dice and the symbols tell you what you can do.

There is no waiting time.  Everyone plays at the same time which creates a sense of drama and chaos which is not felt in many other games where you have to wait your turn to play.

Finally, the game is short. 10 minutes.  This explains why you can play so many in a game night and why it has been the most played game of the holidays.

Fun quick game rolling dice. The realtime aspect can make it stressful and cooperation is highly recommended.

The initial setup with 7 jewels is good for learning the game, but once the stress level drop the variant with 13 jewels and no extra jewels to get out of a bind is needed for a real challenge.

The Curses and Treasures modules are another great addition in the base game, adding challenge and variety.

No one can escape the appeal of this game; it has been successful with almost everyone I have introduced it to. It can stress some people out. Not much replayability though; after you play the second game [always with the Yakety Sax edition linked below] then people have usually had enough. You could always go to Space Cadets Dice Duel from there if you had enough people.

What a whole lotta fun this is! Lots a frantic dice-rolling and tension. Haven't played enough to actually be any good but it is a blast. If there's one thing I have trouble with, it's the soundtrack. I often miss cues. I either don't hear them because we are making so much noise ourselves or I am so caught up in playing that I just stop focusing on the soundtrack all together. The sand timer helps for this.  Still, great fun and unique among our games. Even our 2 yr old gets wildly excited over it because mommy and daddy are yelling like lunatics. :)

This is a hilarious real-time co-op played to a 10-minute soundtrack. Each player uses 5 dice and unlimited re-rolls to try to explore a temple, collect gems, and get out before it collapses.

I'm simply not a big fan of real-time games, and I also struggle to follow the soundtrack in all games of this sort.

That's not a proper gaming experience.

Frenzy dice rolling, yelling and screaming and insane amounts of noise of dozens of dice falling on the table. Requires you to have a CD player or you have to have mp3 versions on your phone. Fun for one play, nothing more.

Because of the constant chaos, you will not be even sure what you've rolled, what you've grabbed from table and if the actions you're doing are actually in line with rules. Time-limited games are not my way of "having good relaxed time with board game". I have time-constraints everywhere in everyday life, so I'll pass here, thank you very much.

Insanely overpriced for 10 mins of "fun" it provides. Components are nicely done, though.

Escape: The Curse of the Temple captures almost perfectly what a *Gateway* Game should be.  Have actually played this several times now and it scales very nicely.  It has great artwork, a fun theme, very interactive gameplay, is very easy to learn and offers enough depth to keep everyone engaged.  The game screams with intensity and just when you think you have it conquered, there are a number of things that you can do to amp up the challenge.  That's nice. A VERY well-designed game that gives more in just 10 minutes than some games give in hours.  A must buy.  This is one of only three games that has earned a "9" or better rating score from me.

What a wild and frenetic game.  It's a good gateway game for folks willing to engage in the energized gameplay.  There is some strategy too--how you add tiles and how you stick together impacts your success.

A great game bogged down by the realities of the table; it takes too long to set up for the reward/fun it brings.  It is very fast paced and prone to accidental cheating. Obviously, no one is purposefully cheating a co-op game, but when enough fudges occur gameplay diminishes and the misplaced sense of panic feels cheaply derived.  Currently I am finding Zombie 15' is executing this style of game much more to my liking.

I think I need to play this more frequently because each time I play it I feel I have to re-learn the dice symbols and what they mean. This is a real-time game that plays in 10 minutes exactly, so you really need to have the rules embedded into your brain.  I just don't play this enough to get to that point, so therefore this game isn't as enjoyable as it could be.  This is totally my fault, but I'd rather invest the play time in other games.

The dice and tiles are good quality, and it's always satisfying to place one of the large tiles when you explore a new room. Players are under constant, and usually pretty heavy stress because this game is time based. The game is a co-op, but it's co-op elements are a bit ignorable. If you roll blacks masks on the dice, then you can't reroll those dice, and if all of your dice are black masks then a friend must come in to give you some gold masks to negate the black mask effects. Also, there are times where you're supposed to roll a certain number of dice (like, 7 torches) in order to get a lot of gems, and your friends can help with that, but otherwise there's really not a lot of cooperation going on. The game is too hectic to really talk things out in grand detail, but this isn't really a negative point because grand detail isn't exactly needed to think your way out of this game.

The game only lasts 10 minutes, and it may make it seem like an experienced group could blast through this game quickly without a real moment of any suspense, but there are suspense moments about every 2 and half minutes where everyone must return to the starting tile in about a minute or else they'll lose a die. There's a lot of opportunity for scares, fun, and cooperation to help someone make their way back as the music amps up, the heatbeat sound begins, and you know there's only seconds to get them back to safety.

Overall, I'd suggest this game somewhat highly. It's lack of strategic depth may make it's replay value somewhat low after the "new game high" settles down, but it's something I'd always be willing to play just because of how quick the setup is and how quick the game is to play.

One crazy game. The simplest concepts are often the most fun. This isn't one I'd be in the mood to play very often though , as it is guaranteed to be extremely chaotic and loud.

Crazy game.  Extremely high energy!  Fast dice rolling game.  You try to get certain combinations on the dice in order to explore the dungeons or free crystals (which will allow you to exit the dungeon at the end of the game).

It can get so crazy and intense that you will feel stress! :)  Recommended.

I know I don't like pure coop, but this is on a whole new level of a "bad game"

everyone rolls 5 dice in real-time trying to escape the temple together - extremely chaotic (have you got the treasure? no? ok well I rolled 2 to help you...3 sec later I'm trapped help! Somebody roll a golden mask to help get rid of my curse!)

impossible to make sense of anything

Roll dice Roll dice roll dice, repeat for ten minutes or less.  I've only played solo with the base game and the first two modules.  This game is a very unique experience.  It can be tense since it is real time and you must know the rules before playing because there is no real pause in the game. Luckily it is a very simple system to pick up.  I think the game simulates its theme quite well and almost has a video game feel to it. Unfortunately it odes seem to lack with replay value as it feels so same-y each time you play.  I suspect once you add the expansions this might not be the case.  I suspect this game shines more with 2 or more rather than a solo as the player interaction is a key element of the fun of this so I hope I can try that out someday.

7.0 Initial rating based on 2 plays.  Its a fun filler.

Increased rating to 7.5.  Whilst not the most in-depth game out there, if you play it for what it is, a light 10 minute filler to get everyone awake after lots of Christmas turkey, its a real blast.  Managed to persuade my wife's parents into having a couple of games after watching us have a 2 player game.  They seemed to enjoy it.

This could become one of my gateway games of choice.

Extremely average game whose novelty wears out in exactly 10 minutes.

This is one of the most unique cooperative board games I know. I don´t usually like games played in real-time (I always prefer turn-based games), but this is THE EXCEPTION. The game has very good components and very good price. Plays  last for ten minutes, and are extremely fun and exciting! Of course, you end up nervous and  exhausted from both, throwing dice and all the mess (everyone talking at the same time, shouting, the background original soundtrack of the game... A real dice party!). I highly recommended it if you don´t  suffer from tachycardia and paralysis analysis! Everybody must to be quick throwing dices! It´s just pure fun!!

RATING: 2
29-05-2014. Rated after 1 game (a while back). Real-time game lasts exactly 10 minutes in which you 'try to escape from a temple'. You try to escape by rolling dice frantically while you're trying to get some amount of eyes rolled together with your collaborators. If you roll poorly, you lock dice down which others can cure etc. 

While I see the charm of the game and if you like real-time stuff I think Escape is pretty fun. But I hate real time games. I hate them with a passion that I cannot explain, because it stressed me out I presume. This is a game I henceforth will avoid (ie. refuse to play).

This game should be for kids with its desperate dice throwing but it is one of my absolute favorites. I have yet to teach it to someone and have them hate it. The tension that soundtrack and timer creates, the desperation to find the gems and escape, the need to go pick up fools who have wandered to far without getting yourself killed, all adds to the theme and realism of the game. Great experience.

An absolutely amazing 10 minute filler - the only downside is having to annoy everyone else in the area with a loud soundtrack, so not one for playing in a games club too often.  But it's so much fun - frantically rolling dice, working with others, all with a large time constraint.  The basic game was a bit easy after a while, even with the curses, but adding in an expansion has definitely upped the difficulty.

A koncepció világos, a játék maga szép.
A hangulat viszont kicsit sem ragadott magával. Nagyon nem az én játékom. A játékmenet agyatlan, egyedül a gongszók és a behatárolt játékidő teszi érdekessé.
Többet, jobbat, mást (?) vártam. Ismét bebizonyosodott, hogy a Queen játékai nagyon nem nekem valók.

Note that this is a 10 thanks to the huge amount of content I have for it. Without the expansions (particularly Quest) it would be around 7. Good, but not beyond entry level. The concept of the soundtrack is awesome, and the curses & treasures are a good start, but it's the quests, character powers, illusions and special chambers (in that order) that make each game so different and enjoyable. I've also had a LOT of fun with this one solo, but that requires a fair amount of house ruling.

If there are any down-sides... maybe resetting the tile deck, and the fact that most people won't want to play this more than a few times in a row (and it takes a while to build them up to the really cool modules).

I'm not usually one for hectic games full of confusion - Galaxy Trucker is usually my limit, but the idea of a 10 minute dice fest I could play with the kids attracted me to Kickstarting this. The eight year old finds it too hectic (Puerto Rico is more her thing), the five year old thinks it's great (his favourite games are Lancaster and The Castles of Burgundy). Both could be roped into more games easily enough. The curse tiles are particularly appealing to them. The wife hates cooperative games (her favourite game is El Grande), but merely dislikes this one. Me? It's better than I thought it would be and is a peg that suits a suitable hole in my collection.

The box is packed full of value. You've got your 13 starting chambers for a basic game. When you've conquered that you can ramp up the difficulty by adding more gems to the pot. Crank the complexity up a notch by substituting the base chambers for the curse chambers and you'll find yourself doing things like losing dice that fall on the floor, playing with one hand or playing in silence until the curses are broken.

Players are in constant discussion, but unlike Pandemic and other co-operative games there's extreme time pressure. The dominating player has no place here - all players will need help and really work as a team to succeed. It's a stressful game, and if you play to unwind and  relax then you might want to avoid this because by the time the ten minutes is up you'll need a few minutes to chill and sit back in your seat.

Good fun, but they really hit the nail on the head with the ten minute time limit. I see this hitting the table often as a filler and it's very welcome to do so.

What a crazy riot this game is! Our family played it a ton our first weekend with it, and my kids especially really loved it.

My almost-14-year-old son describes this as his favorite game because there is no down time, turns are fast, and the game doesn't last too long. After playing the basic game and then introducing the curse cards, my 12-year-old son said we should think of our own curses to add on. And my 7-year-old son quickly caught on, plus he is good at making sure he shares his golden masks to un-curse dice.

But really, it's just chaotic fun. I didn't realize how intense it might get. And my kids think just because they escape and I am still in there trying to roll 2 more keys, they don't lose. (But I can't think of a thematic reason to convince them otherwise.) We'll be playing this game a lot at my house.

Escape! A chaotic, tense and slightly feverish game of real-time dice throwing. Escape the hidden temple before it collapses.

Easy to learn game-appetiser. With its 10-minute games (it has a timer), you'll get through multiple games within half an hour, and it gets everybody in the good mood for a fun evening!

One of our favorite party cooperative games. Seeing people's faces when we start to explain it and they get nervous but then after the 2nd play they are begging to add in the expansions to make it harder and we end up playing at least 4-5 games in one sitting. Always a big noisy, laugh filled hit in our house with guests.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
10 minutes of rolling dice and screaming and trying to work together and rolling the dice really really fast and crying for help and absolutely no breathing. A real time co-op done simple (unlike Space Alert) which meant we could dive just in and still had a lot to chew and trying to learn the lessons of working together in real time. Soundtrack adds a lot to the game so it's highly recommended (I liked designer's track found here on bgg which has a countdown). 

And that's it - I'm not a fan of co-ops but real time ones create a nice tense "in over our heads" atmosphere and take only 10 min. to play for when you have people over who might not be best for competitive games. We had a lot to do even without the added "expansions", so I don't think replayabilty will be a huge problem, but it's not one of those games one would play the whole evening anyway.

I have had a lot of fun playing this game. Everyone I have taught Escape to want to keep playing. The games are only ten minutes long and they go by fast because of the frantic real time play of the game. I will say that for people who play it a lot the game can get easier. Escape is easy to modify with what's in the box so it is possible to make it harder then even what the instructions suggest without making it feel cheap. I definitely recommend this game if you want fun frantic action that most people can pick and play quickly and enjoy.

This game is one of my favorite to introduce to non-gamers. Once everyone understands how the dice are used, the game is usually a huge hit. People who don't play board games have no idea they can be so stressful and I think that is a novel element that these Escape games offer.

Super frenetic real-time co-op where players are have 20 mins to roll dice to explore a temple, find gems and escape.

A fixed soundtrack triggers off detrimental effects.

This is definitely a fun game. It involves A LOT of frantic dice rolling with a good dose of player interaction and sometimes confusion thrown in.  That combination makes for some tense games and good times.  There is nothing really deep or complex, but that's fine for what it is.  The game plays in only 10 minutes each time and seems to be a win with box regular gamers as well as non-gamer friends and family. I was skeptical about this game at first, but after playing it with my regular group a few times I decided that I had to get it and have since really enjoyed the solo play.

SOLO PLAY:  Escape: The Curse of the Temple is another cooperative game that can be played solo. However, this one is all about rolling dice and is filled with tension and excitement. The game isn't overly complex, but there are various ways to increase the difficulty as well as additional modules to increase the variety.

Real tough one to rate as I do like a good dice roller... But still not sure about this.

Findings after a solo run through and 4P game

Things I like:

 - Quick play
 - Modular board
 - Component quality (as with most Queen releases)

Things I don't like:

 - Easy to get 'locked out' of rolls so you're stranded waiting for help
 - Due to time constraints have seen on more than one occasion players mistake die rolls an take rooms etc with wrong rolls.
 - Due to time constraints it's impossible to (even quickly) refer to the rule book if we have queries during game play.
 - Soundtrack that come with the game.

A great introduction game to a board game night.  Fast paced, tense, simple, and short.  There is never anytime to relax and you are racing against the time, cursing  your die rolling luck along the way.

My cautionary warning is that this is just a luck dice rolling game.  I play this game because it is chaotic, cooperative, and short.  With that combined I find it a great way to kick off the board game night before getting into games with a bit more depth.

Még csak most kezdődött az év, de meglepne, ha sikerülne rosszabb játékot találnom a további időszakban. Hihetetlen, hogy ez a játék volt a tavalyi évben Essenben az egyik legfelkapottabb. Egyszerre dobál agyatlanul mindenki kockákat, sietve, hogy 10 perc alatt kijussunk a Cavehez hasonlóan lapkákból épülő templomrendszerből. Célunk kristályokat elhelyeznünk a termekbe ezzel csökkentve a készletet, mert a kijáratnál annyi kulcsot kell dobnunk, amennyi kristályt nem tudtunk felhasználni. A játék kooperatív, egymást kell segítenünk a kristályok elhelyezésében és rossz dobások után a kockák feloldásában. Talán az ötlet miatt volt felkapott, de nem tudom. Gyerekekkel talán lehet benne fantázia, de felnőtteknek szerintem bármilyen kockajáték jobb ennél. Számomra óriási csalódás.

Collective relentless rolling. Roll. Roll. Roll. Roll. Roll.  Hey can someone help me out here so that I can roll more. Roll. Roll. Roll. Roll.

I guess that there are a number of tiny micro-decisions. Mostly, I felt that you were just along for the ride, and then you see what the results are.

I will say that the soundtrack sucks. We had a difficult time determining the warning for the gong and the gong itself.  It could have just used a sand timer.

I question the re-playability of the game.  The modular board ultimately feels insignificant, what does it really matter which order the tiles come out in and what shape the map has, especially when everyone just moves around in a pack.  OK everyone go in this direction, when the gong warning comes up, turn around to get to the center and go the other way, you will hit the exit no matter what direction you go in if you all stay together.

Played about 10 times with between 2 and 4 players, and once solo. At this point I rate it an 8. Definitely more fun with 3 or more players. My 7 year old loves this game and the fact that you can setup, and play a game within 15 minutes is a bonus when he wants to play a game and it's nearly bedtime. His grandparents have played once and refuse to play it again. We always play with more gems than the setup rules indicate or else it is too easy. Not sure what the longevity of the game will be. It's probably a game that really needs expansions to keep it interesting. Just as long as they are good expansions.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Players each have their own set of dice. The board consists of a few starting tiles; a pile of other tiles are nearby, face down. Players simultaneously roll their dice, trying to come to whatever combination is necessary to accomplish the task on the tile (explore a new tile, collect a gem, move to a new tile, etc.). Players may allow each other to use any of their rolls, but only if their meeples are in the same room (tile). One side of each d6 is a skull -- the die stays locked if a skull is rolled (the other dice may be rerolled freely). Must spend one gold die to unlock up to 2 locked dice.

The game is played with a (10-minute?) timer. During that time, they must return to the starting tile once. They must also collect a certain number of gems and then escape back out of the temple.

10 minutes of utter chaos and tension.  Talk about capturing the theme!  Finally a yahtzee mechanic that really makes me go "WOW!".

Absolutely loved this one.

Despite the dice, it's cursed by being a coop, not my favorite genre, and it's too chaotic.  Interesting idea but I'd rather escape the room when this one hits the table.

I was pleasantly surprised by this game.  I completely dismissed it when it was on Kickstarter as a game with not enough meat, even "kiddie", and what I heard and saw of it after release didn't change my opinion.  A friend in my regular game group brought it by though and for that price I'll at least try it out.

I still won't buy it myself because I don't think it has a long shelf life but I enjoyed it.  The tension of games played in real-time really adds a great dynamic to games that might otherwise not be very fun.  The decision tree for this game isn't very large but when added to the stress of time constraints become your world for a few seconds.  Your friend needs help because he has 5 black masks but you already collected 4 keys needed for those gems and you need to head back to start soon aaaahhhh!!!!

In the end though I have to agree with my original assessment.  The game is simple and just doesn't have enough meat on it for me to last more than a few plays.  And it does seem "kiddie", it is a game you can teach and play with children and doesn't offer enough to hold the interest of adults who are after more like me.  I did have fun with it and I will play if someone asks because for those ten minutes your adrenaline is pumping and you're having a great time.  I just think that feeling ends after a few plays, especially if in succession.

Also, as a disclaimer, the game is a dice-fest and completely random.  Our first game we smashed it, collecting enough gems to get out easily early, all getting back to start in time twice, finding the exit, and winning with 1:00+ left on the clock.  Second game we were murdered, all constantly rolling 3-5 black masks, not getting the symbols to move into the next room let alone collect the gems, losing dice during both closures, and ending the game nowhere near having a chance of winning.  I like that (to a certain extent) but what I just described sounds like hell for a lot of people.  Full disclosure, we did play with the curse tiles the second game which added some difficulty but the majority of why we lost had nothing to do with those tiles and more to do with just horrible luck with our rolls.

RATING: 7
Solid game for what it is. Fun and frantic, but we never end up wanting to play it more than once per night. 

I LOVE using this game to introduce non-gamers to the hobby. It's such a departure from what people think of when they think of board games (e.g. Monopoly, Sorry, Yahtzee, Apples to Apples, etc.) so it opens a whole new world/paradigm for them. For this reason alone, it will ALWAYS have a place in my collection.

RATING: 6
Lots to like here, but I've noticed that some in the group I play with simply pick up their dice w/o really following the rules.  I get that there's a ton of chaos in the game, but it breaks down if people don't properly track what they are doing during the action.

This is a nice gimmick of a game, but I can't see myself play this a lot. I'd probably tire of it quickly. I don't see much replayability. Sure, the game already has a few expansions, but they look more of the same to me. Quite surprised to see this was the big hit at Spiel 2012.

Fun!  Can you play it a lot?  Well, I can't, there's just not that much to it.  but if you need something to get your blood pumping before you have to drive home from game night--this is great.  It's actually too nerve-wracking for my wife and daughter--they will only play if they're not feeling stressed in the rest of their lives :)

It should be in everyone's collection, as it fills a unique spot...at least so far.  We'll see if anyone else can improve upon it in the coming years.

RATING: 5
Cooperative real-time Yahtzee: roll the right symbols to do actions (like move into a room or place crystals); some actions might need 10 of a given symbol, requiring multiple players in the same room to cooperate.

It's like Space Alert for non-gamers -- it's got the time pressure, but not the same degree of cooperation or decision-making. (In fairness, the expansions do seem to add a little depth; in future I would not play without at least the curses.) 

Not bad, good even, but not enough to it to grab me: I like games with difficult decisions and Escape doesn't have any at all. Unlike Space Alert, there's also a pretty good chance you'll feel like you failed just because you rolled poorly, rather than any failure of planning or communication, and I hate that.

I might still be inclined to break it out as a quick filler, but the somewhat onerous setup requirements with the CD make that infeasible.

RATING: 4
An enticing and original concept: a real-time dice game.

However, in practice the game doesn't quite work. The real-time aspect means that the game almost needs a referee/GM to work properly. There's no time to answer rules questions or spot mistakes once the game has started (e.g. we had players picking up black dice, moving through walls, moving the wrong playing piece by mistake). The need for the soundtrack also makes the game difficult to play in the kind of communal spaces that most gaming clubs happen in (pubs etc). Traded away in June 2014. Likely will not play again.

Ten minutes of action and awesome!
Well, ok, it's only 10 minutes if you can stop at just one game.
Simple basic mechanics, but it makes for a very exciting, fast paced and fun game. The variety of included modules let you vary up the game quite a bit.
Works very well with any number we've played with (2,3,4,5).
Soundtrack isn't so hot; too hard to clearly make out the key game sounds.

I don't like co-ops and this doesn't change my mind. However it is part of that second generation of co-ops that actually allow individual choices rather than having to abide by the prevailing group think. For that reason alone it's refreshing. Only lasting 10 minutes also means it doesn't outstay it's welcome. Illusions makes it a little more interesting and is probably worth having just to increase the game's longevity.

Yes it's quite a fun little game that only takes 10 minutes to play.  I suppose this is really its only strong point.  The play can sometimes get so chaotic that it is hard to know what's going on, sometimes I think playing to fast is probably more detrimental.

In the end, the game just gets tired.  Plus there is a lot of inadvertent cheating, and I just can't handle that in a game, and there isn't much way to avoid it either.

Reduce because, without expansions, it can get very samey.

CAUTION:  For those of you serious gamers who have forgotten that games should be fun, don't bother with this game.  It is explosively fun and should best be left alone if your raison d'être is to show how massive your brain is.  

In my opinion, however, this is the best game of the last few years!  Seriously fun and heart pounding!  I can't see other games the same way any more... 

I can see this working in almost any game group and with ages probably from 7 (minimum) on up.

Waiting for so many more varieties of this same mechanic.  Dungeon runs, mazes, clowns, space ships, zombies (of course), war games...

I'm sure this, or something like it, will be found in Walmart, I predict, by maybe 2018 or so.

An unwavering 10! 

ALSO:  Just played it with my wife and daughter six times in a row.  My daughter said: "This game is awesome!"  She was waving her hands around and looked like she was crying and laughing at the same time.  Never has a game had this reaction from my family.  Never...

I like how fast it plays and how unique it is.  Too light to play a lot, but fun to play on occasion.  I'm really looking forward to Space Cadets Dice Duels, because I think it will use the best elements of Escape and Space Cadets to form a fantastic game.

This game has caused some real laugh out loud moments and has been a blast to play up to now. I am however worried that it will become a lot less interesting once our group manages to 'solve' it. We'll see how that goes. In any case I think I got my money's worth out of it and there are expansions available to keep it interesting.

Escape: The Curse of the Temple is part dice-roller, part co-operative, and part children's game.  This is a unique real-time design driven by a pulse-pounding soundtrack.  Depending on your tastes, it is either 10 minutes of exhilaration or 10 minutes of exhausting tension.  A die-hard PS3 gamer ranked this title a one because it was too hard for her to keep up.  The kids should like it, if you can get them to cooperate.

The curses are really fun and the way they affect the real world is something you don't often see in a game (players have to hold a hand on their head, etc.). Because of the soundtrack and the time limit, you really feel the pressure to move through the temple.

Update: Still liking it. The difficulty here is something that I think every co-op game should incorporate: you can usually win the game on the normal difficulty setting. This means that you can have fun and be confident of a win with new players, then increase the difficulty as you wish. Some co-op games just seem hopeless, like Ghost Stories, even on their lowest difficulty setting. Can't wait to try it with the new expansions that will be coming out.

Update again: The Quest expansion and the designer's new recommended setup are now essential for this game. The quests make it more difficult and now change up the strategy quite a bit, while the characters help balance out the difficulty a little and just make the game much more fun.
Previous to this expansion, we would commonly just move one way from the beginning, sticking together, then after the first gong we would explore out from the other side of the start tile. Now with Quest, you want to spread out a little to try to find the quest tile and beat them early so you can escape before time runs out. With Quest, this went from a good game to a great one.

Sold, replaced with the Escape Big Box.

Your heart continues to pump as the dongs get louder and louder.  This "real time" game is 10 minutes of heart palpitations and sweaty palms; as chaos continues to overwhelm each player.  This game is a frantic masterpiece that continues to shine, if you're looking for an adventure.  Team work is the key but you must keep your composure and Escape The Curse of the Temple...

This is chaotic dice chucking tension.  I love that it's a strict 10 minute timer and that we're all trying to move as quickly as we can. This doesn't get a ton of play time because it "stresses out" some of our family members.  Good fun though.

2-5 players.

Each player has 5 dice and all of them must attempt to traverse the temple to discover all the rooms and the cursed jewels inside if they want to escape. Dice can get locked and the most valuable treasures all require cooperation.
The catch is that the game is played in REAL TIME! Music queues hustle you because if anyone doesn't escape, you all lose!

A frantic co-operative dice chucker. It's a shame there's no app for this game, as it would be much moire convenient than a CD and would allow for variable surprises during the game.

A game - adrenaline shot. 

If someone on your group is ready to go to sleep and potentially bring the night to a quick end - bring this one out. A couple of games will wake him enough to keep playing until the first light!

Edit: I am gaining a better understanding of the game and the symbols, and while still hectic, this game doesn't feel quite as messy as it did with my first play through. When in the mood for a crazy game such as this, it was actually quite fun. It is also great game for introducing to non gamers.

Real time games aren't really my thing and snap decisions aren't my forte. So I was a little nervous about whether this game would break me. But the decisions in this game aren't really that deep, so there's never a time when you need to invest much thought into them.

But that also means that the fun part of this game probably isn't going to be in making interesting decisions. And it's not. What's fun about the game is the hectic scramble. Rolling, rolling, rolling, shouting and screaming. Desperately trying to get stuff done before you get completely hosed.

I found the game fun for what it was... a short filler game. We ended up playing five times in a row and by the end I was getting burned out on the game, but for a filler and just a play or two, it's great.

We bought this game the same night we bought Castles of Burgundy (we found them super cheap at a local store). Having no prior experience of board games other than the standards (monopoly, life, clue, etc.) we had no idea what we were in for. This 10 minute real-time game had us screaming and shouting at our kitchen table like it was the most exciting sports event in the history of mankind. The fact that it's only 10 minutes makes it great for playing multiple games in one sitting. This game is easy to teach and a good game for mom boardgamers. It showed us that board games aren't all boring things our parents forced us to play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game is great like its amazing and simple enough to teach,pick up and play However its not perfect as there are a few flaws with the game with its overall nature that cant be avoided.
1:The high stress nature of the game can be off putting for some people who arent fast acting.
2: You can easily overlook rules due to the high stress nature of the game you might overlook and forget like taking curses when you are supposed to or re-rolling a black die when you arent supposed to.
3: The game is determined on luck somewhat the luck of the draw of room with expansions to bad die rolls but the game uses a bit of strategy and quick thinking without being to complex.

A must buy for anyone to play with friends or family as this game brings people together as everyone wins or everyone loses so it wont make anyone afraid of losing. You will have a blast and crave for more as its just 10 minutes you'll always be saying one more game again and again when you actually cant stop. The game will lead you to buy the expansions once you warm up to this base set.

RATING: 8
This is an interesting and unique game that is unlike anything I've played before.  The title is accurate - it really makes you feel like you're rushing to get out of a cursed temple.  The soundtrack is a brilliant addition to the game.  There are definite moments of excellent tension when someone is locked and you need to rescue them before time runs out, and you really do need to rely on each other to do well so it easily builds a sense of comradery.  It is easy for a group to become too good at the game after a few plays though, and if a group is too good then there is no tension.  The curses and treasures module really helps with this problem though.  It's a fun one to pull out every once in a while, but there isn't enough meat there to warrant a super high rating.

Escape plays like a co-op, more elaborate version of Shark Attack!, in that it involves realtime dice throwing on a timer. Because of this mechanic, gameplay is a little chaotic and quite intense, making me question its replayability in the long run. Consequently, I am not always in the mood to play it. That said, I liked it more than I expected, because the co-op factor really shone through during our second play. Components and artwork are very appealing. Probably nice to play every now and then.

Very enjoyable real-time co-op. Most players are polarized by the hectic real-time aspect, but the ones that like it really like it. Curses like "can't talk" or "one hand stuck to your head" force you to improvise in ways other games don't.

Fun, easy to explain and set up, and most people are willing to try it when they find it only takes 10 minutes to play.

RATING: 7
One of a handful of real time board games in my collection, Escape's Norwegian designer, Ostby is slowly climbing up my ladder of notable new designers in the Euro game genre. Both his games thus far, Escape and Mammut have been quite unique in game play while his third creation I have played, Hotel Samoa, was just mediocre. In Escape, players roll five dice simultaneously and as many times as needed to advance their avatars around a maze of tiles as they try to escape a cursed temple that is about to collapse. Using a sound track ala Space Alert to mark the passage of time, players have to cooperate to unlock specific activation sites to capture gems which will facilitate the final escape at the exit. All players will race against time to unlock as many gems as possible without getting trap in the temple at the end of 10 minutes. There is plenty of frantic die rolling coupled with lots of incoherent chatter among players. This game has shades of Ligretto Dice crossed with Space Alert and while it breaks no new ground, the game play is certainly unique enough that it warrants a place in any collection that prizes novelty. One thing of note, the base game itself is quite challenging that with the expansions and additional hazards, the game must be quite daunting and brutal. Playing a few times with a similar group of friends will greatly help in communication.

With 2 players it is calmer, not as loud, but my husband and I still have fun.  With 2 players, it seems like it's easier to add all the expansions in to see how they work together.  Gives me the feeling I have more time to get things done. 

 If we haven't made it out of the temple after a couple tries and everyone else it ready to stop, I have even had fun playing solo to see if I can make it out of the temple alive.  

You can teach the base game to anyone and they will learn it quickly.  More experienced gamers will probably want to add in more of the expansions to make it more challenging.

RATING: 8
This may be preemptive but I really enjoyed this game. It gave me a great adrenaline rush in a short time frame. There's no extremely difficult decisions to make, and there's definitely more luck than strategy, but with the tight time limit there's no time to think, and the kinetic rush of rolling die after die really pumps up the tension.

it's pretty fun, but it lives on the novelty factor to some extent. 

2016 update:  I like this more than I used to.  It's probably my favorite real time game, especially with my kids.  Once I played it 4 or 5 times, the chaos and stress decreased with familiarity, which was great.  If you can get over that initial hump, it gets more fun (imo).  It seems like some people have "played it out" and don't love it anymore, but I don't bring it out that often so it still feels fresh and innovative to me

I generally hate cooperative games for several reasons (they feel a bit like solitaire and one player frequently runs the show), but this game ESCAPES these problems by adding a time element.

When looking at games you can play in 10-15 minutes, it's pretty hard to beat this game.  I hope to see more cooperative game with time elements in the future.

-Sometimes feels easy and you will definitely become better at some point. But the losses still come regularly as long as you ramp up the difficulty enough. If it's too easy just add diamonds and you'll be losing again in no time :)

The short of it is that this game is just straight up fun to play.  It's frantic and tense, and it has everyone shouting around the table ("Does [i]any[/i]one have any yellow masks?") trying to maintain the chaos that's threatening to bring the temple down on top of you.  Sure, it's a little prone to luck, but all of the game's moving parts come together in a game that's a bit more experience than game, but still leaves you with a sense of satisfaction once it's over.  My only issue is that the atmospheric tracks can be a little unclear the first few times you play, but there is a track on the website that removes all the incidental parts of the track so you can know when things are happening.

So, I gave the game a rating of 8.  I own the game, have played it about 6 times with many different groups.  I would recommended the game to anyone who wants a different board game experience, that is not very thinky, and has lots of yelling.  I know of no better game for feeling excitement.  But, that is also a turn off for many people.  If you want strategy, or don't want to expend the energy of 10 minuets of high intensity dice rolling, then this game is not for you. 

But, I love this game, and find it to be very, very fun, so I give it an 8 and a permanent place in my heart!

This is an entertaining game but definitely not even in my top 10. I am not huge on dice rolling games in general and this on is a unique game. Yet really what I don't like is there are not too much interactions between you and the other players. For the most part, I feel as though we are all so concentrated on our own exploration that we lose track of the other players. Yet if you have a good group then it is a decent cooperative game. Fast paced which is a nice switch up for your typical board game and each match is only 10 minutes long making it easy to play spur of the moment. I did find that some of my other friends enjoyed it more than I did so overall a fun game for people.

We love this game (2P). It is quick to set up, plays exactly 10 minutes, and is just crazy chaotic, hectic fun.

This game manages to elicit strong emotions, which is quite unique. The tension/panic you feel as the seconds wind down and you frantically role the dice can be quite intense. Your heart bumping, you will often fall into the sweet relief of laughter. 

Amazingly, there is some skill involved as well, which is why the expansions are important. You get good rather quickly and the added challenge keeps things fresh.

This is one game where my initial impression was proven (for the better) wrong.  It's a good game for what it is and doesn't outlast its welcome.  At a 10 minute game, it's easy to teach and fast to play but probably more fun with the right familiar crowd.  It won't replace The Adventurers for me but still has its place as a party game. My rating might even go up with more plays and after adding the expansions.

Not something I can replay too many times in a row but definitely a group favorite that's good for a few plays.  Also creates great moments and stories that last after the game.

I don't like realtime games that involve dice rolling.
I think it creates so much chaos that plays tend to cheat unwillingly. People always tell me to take it easy and see it as a fun party game, but I really don't like rolling the dice knowing that plays including me are to stressed to know that they are rolling a dice that is not in play for some reason. I think there are many other great realtime games that gives the chaotic feeling but does not use dice rolling and therefore there is not as great a risk of "cheating".

I had backed this on Kickstarter, but ended up selling it with the expectation that I wouldn't play it much, and after playing it once that was a good decision. *However*, it is a pretty great game, one I would never turn down.

The basic premise is you (and 2 to 4 of your friends) are stuck in a temple and need to get out in 10 minutes. You'll discover new rooms, move between rooms, place gems in rooms to appease the temple, and eventually escape. And you'll do all of this by rolling dice as fast as possible because **Escape** is played in real-time. You can roll your dice as much as you want, but you'll eventually roll dice that can't be re-rolled unless you get another die face to "unlock" them. It's possible to be completely locked, in which case you'll need a friend to come over and help you out, so it's best to not completely split the party (but you knew that already).

In my one play, we had a full compliment of 5 players and the game hummed along. The soundtrack did it's job of making us even more tense than we otherwise were and the 10 minute timer is absolutely perfect, this game *can't* overstay it's welcome.

So why am I glad I didn't buy it? It's a fun game, but it's one I would only get played in groups and I have so many other games to play with larger groups.

Didn't expect to like this - looked too chaotic. Played with my son without the curses, and with four players. You have to work together (we paired up). Shame one of the dice was misprinted.

This cooperative dice-a-thon far outshines [i]D-Day Dice[/i], as there are actual decisions regarding collaboration and splitting up the party.  My suggestion is to play the basic game only once, as the curse cards (I put my hand where?) are truly enjoyable.

[i]Space Alert[/i] is also a great timer-driven game, but its advertised 10-minute playtime is off the mark due to the post-soundtrack game resolution.  [i]The Curse of the Temple[/i], on the other hand, is literally only 10 minutes long.  My kids and Ameritrash-friendly gaming groups are sure to get a big kick out of this one.

This is a pretty enjoyable cooperative game.  Easy to learn and easy to play.  My issue with the game is trying to keep your dice rolls straight.  I assume that there are a lot of mistakes made by players throughout the game.  That is, keeping track of what was rolled, what dice were used, what you still need, etc.  The fast pace of the game invites these kinds of errors.  Even with this minor flaw, it is a fun game to bring out especially for newbees.  It is notable that some people do not like the stressful fast pace of this game.  One of our gamer friends will not play it for that reason.  It gets her heart racing and she does not enjoy that aspect of the game.  That's the part I love.

Fun, but not that into real time games. Also may be a little to stressful when play with my family.

RATING: 7
The game is crazy fun and chaotic. It's the only game I know that can simulate the frantic feeling as you try to escape from a collapsing temple. But as it generates stress playing this game, it's also its detriment. Most of the times I want to play a game to relax and chill with friends, instead of shouting at each other because I'm stuck and in dire need of help.

Don't get me wrong, this game has a special place in my heart, but I don't want to own this game. 
I like playing it occasionally for that special frantic frenzy of shouting and panic and then not having to play it for a long while.

Rolling dice repeatedly for 10 minutes turns out to be a chore.  Disappointing.

Nothing plays like it. Sure the novelty wares a bit but introducing it to new people is a guaranteed blast... I can't say that about any game in my collection. Plus it's so fast. 

Expansions can only make this game better and more re-playable. Sky is the limit with this system.

Played it with my 8 year old daughter, she loved it. I loved playing it with her, this might be a ten for this reason if it stands to repeated plays. Also played with gamers and loved it still.

Excellent rolling dice kinda game in real time, that delivers the most fun Indiana Jonesque experience in a board. Easy to learn and play. It comes with a soundtrack CD that guides you for the diferent phases of the play. A 10 minutes adventure fun. Recommended!

RATING: 6.5
10 minutes of pure chaos, plain and simple. It only really lends itself to a couple plays in an evening, but it's great when you don't have a ton of time to play something, want to just have some goofy fun with friends, or want a quick filler between other games.

The game devolves down to frantically rolling dice, screaming to other people what we should be doing as a team to escape the temple all while having this creepy soundtrack playing in the background that is dictating the pace of the game and acting as the games timer.

More or less a dexterity dice-rolling heart-attack inducer than anything else. Strategy is all but thrown out the window as you are essentially herding cats through a burning building.

I haven't played this game in a long time but is something that I'd like to get back to the table again soon. It's nice to play some games once and a while where it's more about the experience than winning or losing the game.

I was pleasantly surprised by this one. This will join the ranks of games that I didn't expect to like but very much enjoy myself with (like Kakerlakensalat, One Night Ultimate Werewolf and Dixit). 

Sure, there is barely any control and everyone blatantly cheats (usually without noticing), but somehow I enjoy the frantic stress with my fellow players. 

Also: the Yakaty Sax version of the soundtrack comes HIGHLY recommended from my friends and me :)

A 10 minute real time co-op game for 1-5 adventurers. Players must roll their dice as fast as possible to navigate a modular temple, grab the treasure and get out. But the wrong roll can lock your dice and you'll need another player to rush to help you out.

A very entertaining game!  A nice change in pace from the more strategic and in-depth games.  Very fast play, cooperative, and an all-around fun game.  Both my wife and I really enjoy it, but find it better with more players.

Update: Ultimately I traded this away.  This was due to a combination of it being co-op (not my favorite), being better with >2 (I normally game with my wife), as well as having other gateway games that I like better for when we have larger groups.

Rather chaotic but nonetheless a little fun. Adhoc cooperative mechanic makes the game interesting, but replayability is low.

Absolutely love this game. The real time aspect of the game provides out-of-your-seat fun and exhiliration. The frantic yet exciting atmosphere in the game as you explore the temple via continuous dice rolls to find the your way out is very well designed. Not for everybody though. For us, FUN!

Escape is easily one of the most enjoyable and tense games I have played in ages. I absolutely adore it!

I never thought I could enjoy a real-time game so much, especially with a soundtrack gimmick, but it just works, and works incredibly well. The game also scales well and works equally well at all player counts.

I highly recommend this game to just about anyone, I just can't see how you would not like this game. Unless of course you have a heart condition.

After 15 plays I have yet to tire of this game. I have also not introduced it to anyone that hasn't loved it.

There are quite a few comments hereabouts repeating the same Euro-y dogma: [i]the game's pointless.[/i]

What a moronic thing to write. This game fills up 10 minutes with laughter, and the opportunity to spend time with family and friends. How can that be pointless?

Everyone who reads this comments section has more 'worthy' games. Fine, but you'd be VERY hard pressed to find a more exhilarating 10-minute filler game.

TIP: Always play the game with the soundtrack CD, is my advice.

Good frantic party game, but you need to be in the right mood to play it, and it definitely doesn't work well at first play: for this reason, being it a party game, I can't give it more than 7, even if it can be A LOT of fun to play with the right people.

Great real-time cooperative dice rolling game. The time limit really amps up the tension, and the curses module add some neat twists. A bit stressful so we rarely play it more than once in a game night.

We’ve never played a real-time game before this one. We’ve looked to this one before, but it could never convince us to buy it. Then we bumped into a very nice offer, which could convince us to “buy before we try”. Very little time we have to play a boardgame these days, but last night we managed to find some time. Setting up the game will take about 10 minutes (well, if you placed everything in zip-bags like we did). Playing the game will also take 10 minutes. Not a single second more.  One thing we hated about this game, was the huge amount of noise it was generating at a convention like Spiel last year. The solution from the publisher is that they have placed a sandtimer inside the box, so man wouldn’t need to play a CD. But we were at home, instead of an convention, so we used the soundtrack provided. And to be honest, the amount of tension the creepy music is creating is huge. The tension which there is, is the magic of the game. Not the mechanism, that’s just rolling dice like a mad man, until you’ve rolled the right combination. Is this a fun game to play? Yes, it is. And that is something we didn’t expect that we would say. Don’t expect a deep game, this is a party game. But it is a party game, which is different. No strange questions are asked. No knowledge is required. You won’t have to do weird things. Just roll the dice. Work together to get rid of the gems, and escape…..

Absolutely frantic, but fantastically themed. The soundtrack adds so much depth to the game, leaving everyone panicked and distraught by the end. 
It's very simple to alter the difficulty level of the game, either by A) adding more gems, or B) adding in other "useless tiles" or even the dreaded C) You don't start with the "start" tile on the board. You have to find it before the first gong. 
(I don't recommend C unless you are masochistic.)

Very unique. I really disliked Space Alert (although I didn't really understand it, so it didn't have a fair chance), but the real-time element works great here. I wouldn't want to replay this with the same group very much, but a lot of fun the first time with new groups.

Mmmmm.... No! This is not a game I enjoyed! I felt like I was just rolling dice with other people at the same table, without actually interacting with them. I'm quite happy to have tried this before buying it, because now I know I don't need it!

This game is wacky.  Roll dice at warp speed and try real hard not to accidentally cheat.  There's a lot to keep track of: don't reroll black masks, gold masks let you reroll 2 black masks, you can give gold masks to coplayers who share a room with you, how many keys do you need to escape, do you have to have a hand on your head, are your gold masks nerfed by a curse, listen for the gongs and know how far you are from the starting room, and on and on, all in real time.

I, for one, enjoy the real time aspect of this game.  My biggest knock, oddly enough, is that it can be chaotic.  This is, obviously, a big part of the real time aspect, but it is very difficult to play with people who tend to be relaxed playing games.

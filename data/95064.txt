A good addition to the base game. Adds 2 players, and surprisingly, the downtime with 6 players is not that bad when everyone has played a few times. The Fate mechanics that RotF adds makes the game more interactive, which also encourages you to keen an eye on what happens on other players' turns.

Aesthetically, a nice continuation in backstory and artistic vision from the base game. 

Mechanically, Fate and Samael create enough additional complexity to make the game more compelling, but no less manageable. 

Dynamically, a fuller game with less tempo blowouts, though I worry buying Mystic is the default play for most early games. 

If you are going to play Ascension, buy this and the base game. The pace of the game is quick and shrewd - takes the appropriate time for what is really just a ten-fifteen minute exercise in efficiency.

This expansion is actually what I bought first and it works as a stand alone game. It's small though so I bought the original and added the two together quite quickly. Not a necessary expansion but adds variety if you've played the original a lot.

RATING: 6
This is so far my best Deck-Builder with two... unfortunately it seems that it falters significantly with more, and expansions only dilute the core mechanics.
This game begs for "cube" construction but I really don't have the time.

RATING: 7
A so-so expansion, adding about 6 new cards of each type (void, life, mecha, enlightened, and monsters), but barely breaks any ground with mechanics or themes.  You would have to pay super close attention to pick up any story changes, that is if you were following it.  It is interesting to play 2-player with just these new cards, but that is just because they are new.  Eventually the newness wares away, and they just are normal cards, almost like a box of promo cards extending the original game.  Really I think 'fate' is the only new mechanic, and it is hardly used to any effect at all.  Still it extends the concept without messing up the original.  You get a 7 then.

General thoughts on Ascension: I generally like the game, having the right level for complexity for what it is. It's definitely better with a low player count, as with five or six players (which you can play with only by combining two sets) the downtime gets a bit too much and the center line changes too much after your turn to really care about what is there. Combining sets is also problematic, as it make the deck unshufflable. If I were to ever buy a copy of Ascension, I probably get only set and player as a two-player game.

Works very well when combined with the base deck. Only a couple of plays with the physical game but 100s with the ios version. This set (with the base deck) is definitely the simpler version to use - there is more to think about on each turn with the Storm of Souls set.

More cards for more variance in the center row is of course the way to expand this fine deckbuilder.
The fate cards add some dynamism to the game, but there's no great innovation other than that...
In the end, this expansion feels slightly less useful than the following one, but of course it is smaller...

It's no secret that I'm not a huge fan of Ascension and the complete randomness of the center row.  That being said, I try to rate expansions on how well they add value to the base game.  So, I was fully planning to have a mediocre time and give this a 5-8, depending on the new ideas.  But, a funny thing happened, and Ascension:RotF managed to do something few other games have.

It made me angry.

You see, with RotF, you can now play the game with 6 players.  I'm guessing they just added more counters and upped the number, as opposed to playtesting it.  Playing Ascension + RotF with 6 players was one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever had.  You're constantly waiting what seems like ages to take your turn.  It is utter agony.  Unlike Dominion/ Thunderstone, where you can at least moderately plan for your turn, the center row in Ascension is probably going to look completely different when it gets to you; further lengthening play.  I tried as hard as I could to put my "fun cap" on, but going into hour two (yes, TWO), I was begging for this game to end.  Never again, ever.  Whoever put the number "six" on that box should be shot.

RATING: 6
I like the new Fate mechanism, but its on so few cards in the expansion that when its combined with the original portal deck its seen once or twice in a 2 player game.  Some of the new expansion cards seem widely overpowered like the new 6 cost Lifebound hero that gives 5 Honor each time it is played.  Same for the new Enlighted hero that lets you swap a Apprentice/Militia for a Mystic/Heavy Infantry and use the replacement card that turn.

Add in the controversy surrounding the decision to change in "quality" of the cards and this expansion falls flat for me.  Proposed solution from Gary Games is to sleeve the cards which I have already done.  This does mitigate the size issue, but introduces another unacknowledged change in quality from Gary Games.  The new ascension sleeves do not match the sleeves I purchased when the base game came out.  So even with the sleeves you can easily see where the expansion cards are in a deck.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Missed opportunity from Gary games.  After having a year of feedback on the game, they end up using a cheaper cardstock on the cards, make a 120 card expansion that really only adds 60 cards, and non of the cards really change the base game much.  Feels like a step backwards, and after over a year, this expansion should have improved the base game...

Tough one to rate.  As a stand alone game, I think it's just okay.  There's not enough interaction between the cards included to make it really interesting.  That and the rulebook is still awful.  The solo rules are really half baked.  Seriously guys, toss your ego aside and have someone else write the rulebook for you.

But as an addition to the base game, there's a lot of interesting possibilities.  Overall though, I'd have to give it a lower score than the original.

Expansion Specific: Overall it is a welcomed addition and has a good feel to it. But be forewarned, the power-level of the new cards are higher than those of the base set.

Size Difference: For the casual player this will not be an issue. Not once did it have an effect in our games.

Bonus: The cards easily and comfortably fit into the box of the base set.

General: Ascension has the quickest setup of all my games and is easily learned by nongamers. It's better than Dominion in this regard.

Expansion / 2 player game.  (Part of "Block 1" with Chronicles of the Godslayer/Ascension Deckbuilding Game).  Probably better as an expansion, than a standalone 2 player game.  

All of the sets in Ascension are not particularly deep or strategic.  There is randomness in the way Ascension plays.  But I love the Ascension sets because they're quick to set-up, the  turns are quick, the ease of play, trying new sets mixed together is fun and being able to play cool combo turns when you get some really good cards in your deck is so much fun.

Return Of The Fallen gives more of the same as the original base game, Chronicles of the Godslayer.  (Re-named as "Ascension: Deckbuilding Game").

I don't like this expansion as much as the original.  It was fun to see the new cards and play for a while, but there are a lot of new random elements which reduces the skill in the game.  It is always discouraging when a card drops down and kills important cards that were part of your plan, or adds to your hand, or gives a key construct to a player who just happened to purchase it.  Part of why I really like the original set is that there is a tremendous amount of hidden skill.

RATING: 8
Assuming you own Chronicles of the Godslayer, this expansion is amazing.  Even if you don't, the 2 player experience in RotF is a pretty decent time and you should be able to get a decent number of plays out of it.  I do feel this expansion slightly tilts things towards going the Mystic/Rune path instead of Militia/Violence but that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable.  The fate mechanic is ok, but didn't really do anything for me.  Owning this expansion plus CotG means you can play Ascension 3 ways: Base or Base+Exp, or just Exp.  At the time of writing this, I'm nearing 1500 plays of Ascension... yeah, mostly 5 min sessions on iPad but that's still amazing.  Do yourself a favor and pick this up on iOS or in physical form.

This is a very tasty expansion.  

The basic game of Ascension I only rated a 6.3.  As deck building card games went it was okay.  This expansion really improves the game.

It added 120 cards, includes the Rat King Promo, and plays 2 more people--very important for our crowd.  I love the fate cards and other fresh new cards which do not complicate the game.  The beautiful art work continues.

This expansion will bring the game to the table more often, for sure.

EDIT: I recently placed an order from the publisher's web site, and had a complaint which I registered by email. Gary responded immediately with apologies and corrected the problem with a very surprising bonus. This is a top notch company who cares about their product and customers, and they go the extra mile. Thank you, so much!

Co najbardziej podoba mi się w małych dodatkach do Ascension to to, że można je wymieszać z dowolną podstawką, a same w sobie służą jako gra dwuosobowa. Return of the Fallen wprowadza nową mechanikę losu (Fate), gdzie karty trafiające do center row wywołują natychmiastowy efekt. Poza tym doszła możliwość odpalania nowych komb, dociągania kart oraz ciekawa mechanika wrzucania do talii Potworów, z których bonusów można skorzystać, nie zapychając ręki. Zarówno jako gra dla dwóch osób, jak i grana z podstawką czy w ramach sojuszu, sprawdza się bardzo dobrze.

This is definitely the weaker expansion. Storm of Souls is often, and I'll often play it alone or with the original game. This one has some interesting cards, but doesn't add much to gameplay. For example, killing Sammael and conscripting monsters sounds fun, but rarely happens more than once or twice in a game.

I initially found the new card mix to be a bit head-bendy, especially after a bajillion plays of the super smooth and tight [i]Chronicle of the Godslayer[/i] on the iPad.  But the Fate mechanic grew on me, as well as the expanded play-space and fun combos you can pull off.

And if what I understand about the expansion is true—that it completes a unique story arc when combined with [i]Godslayer[/i], with no further expansions to that "block"—then it's genius.  Not being a fan of endless expansions and bloat killing a good thing, I applaud the creators' ability to self-edit.  Art wins over commerce... this time.

Story-wise, it's mega-cool that you can become that which you loathe—Samael Himself—and gather His monsters into your deck instead of sending them into the Void.  Nice nod to Nietzsche.

UPDATE:  8 --> 7  Wore it out with an enormous number of digital plays.

This expansion is a true successor to Ascension. It does everything that the first one did, only better.  Mechanically, it's more refined, and introduces nuances without damaging the integrity of the base set.  Thematically, the game seems more coherent somehow.  Even the artwork is improved. At least there are no notebook paper lines behind the images anymore and they appear to have actually been cleaned up beyond the sketch phase this time before going to the printer.

A nice, basic expansion of the first core set.  The art is slightly more stylized and the Fate cards add a minor new feature, but otherwise, more of the same (not that that's a bad thing). I have this permanently mixed in with the base set now, so I don't log its plays separately.

I would prefer to trade my 3 Ascension sets together, if possible.
I do not have the original boxes or rule books for these, but every card from all three sets is included as well as the Rat King promo. All the cards and the board from Rise of Vigil are in a 1600-count card storage box with plenty of room to spare. I'd be happy to send a pic of how I have the cards stored, if interested. I'm happy to include 300 Ultra-Pro Black Matte sleeves (the majority of which have never been used), which is far more than is needed for the game.

With this expansion, which I was excited to see given my feelings about Ascension, I actually cooled off the game. Maybe the deck is simply too unwieldy with so many random cards to churn through.

RATING: 7
First off, I would not recommended this as a stand-alone game.  If someone is interested in trying out Ascension, I'd definitely point them to the main set first.

As an expansion played with Ascension, however, this game really shines.  Upping the card count helps keep the games unique, as certain powerful cards will only show up every 3rd game or so.  At first I was disappointed that only part of the deck was new cards (it also adds enough starter cards to play with 6 players), but after a few games I've found the card count to be enough.

I don't really feel the game works optimally with 6 players though; it has a lot of down time that way.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2013)

Ok light game. I like the new cards and the fate mechanic is (more or less) fair as it affects both players. The art is great but I dislike the tactical nature of the game (lots of uncontrollable luck). In general I dislike Deck builder games in which the card offering is variable. You can’t plan ahead and the winner is decided by luck (If the card I need/want is in the offering when it is my turn). I also miss that the game has no buy limitations making this a very simple game. Still Return of the Fallen is an entertaining game, just not very deep. You will know all the cards and strategies very soon so I think it is best to combine it with more expansions. That is, the game has very limited replayability on its own. Also as a standalone game, it has more luck than its predecessor.

If you mix RotF with the base game, you can now play with 6 players. I think that would be a horrible mistake as the downtime would be excessive. Truth be told, I only want to play Ascension as a two player game.

In conclusion, I feel Dominion is the better game by a mile but I play Ascension from time to time. I think it is the best tactical deck building game out there and it is a welcome addition as the base game need the additional cards to continue to be enjoyable. 

Current Rating: 6.0

An excellent stand-alone 2-player expansion that adds more center deck cards and a fresh 'Fate' element to an already solid deck-building game.

Rating is for 2-player games w/base set.

UPDATE:  Interesting solo variant (start w/50 tokens) where you play against 'Samael' who simply acquires/defeats the two right most center cards w/o effects each turn, thereby accumulating Honor tokens by defeating monsters during play and Honor points at the end of game.  Once a card(s) in the center row is played the remaining cards are moved to the right and the left most space(s) is replaced.

Fate, the only new mechanic is nice, uncomplicated and doesn't change the game too much. Each time when a card with fate enters the center, an event takes place.

Beside that, it's more welcome variety. Perceived changes to card distribution are an increased percentage of mechana constructs and cards with deck-thinning potential. Other than that, more variety might lead to more biased games, e.g. favoring money-focussed or strength-focussed decks.

More of the same, not really changing the game too much.  I do like the additional cards, but it seems like they will only be truly useful when mixed together with the base set.  Playing it on its own leaves me feeling a little disappointed.  However, when mixed in the base set, I wonder if it dilutes it too much. 

I suppose I'll get a much better feel for this when the iOS implementation finally comes out.  What's taking so long?!

well I played this with the basegame.

the expansion adds a lot of new things to the mix.
I am not sure how powerfull the eight monster is, but it could be a potential dealbreker. Both games we played the person that defeated it won the game.

while the seven monster is pretty strong in the basegame it doesn't award you the victory (well if the 8 construct is up for grabs it does most of the time)

I like the choice of discarding card (s) to keep construct(s) in play.

I've played the basegame vanilla over a 100 times. Stopped logging Ipad games and I can still do without the expansions.


I rate it a 7 because at the moment it offers new things but I don't feel they add much to the allready excellent gameplay of the basegame.

I wonder how the standalone twoplayer is. Because that would be a different feel than the basegame.

the cards I saw make me think I prefer those of the basegame.

After two games of [i]Return of the Fallen[/i], I bought [i]Storm of Souls[/i] for myself.  And then, after a dozen or so games of [i]Storm of Souls[/i], I went out and bought [i]Return of the Fallen[/i].

A fine addition to Ascension: COTG.  

The new Fate mechanic is fine, but not great.  Overall I find it detracts more than it adds.

My one complaint is that it's not as easy to destroy an opponent's constructs.  COTG has the Sea Tyrant (3x) and the C. Widow (4x?) to destroy them.  This game has precious little in the way of monsters that do that, and the Mechana constructs are just as powerful as before--or more powerful, maybe.

The cards are great for inserting into your own custom block!  On its own, games using this block tend to feel the same each time.

RATING: 8
As with any deck-building game, repetition happens.  Therefore, solid synergistic expansions are a necessity at a certain point.  "Return of the Fallen" is a good expansion that enhances the base set in every way I would want.  More players, more combos, more synergies, more strategies, more fun!

My most played iOS game, including all the expansions. Interesting take on the deck-building genre with some (indirect) interaction and a randomly generated purchasing pool, in form of the 6 cards in the center. 1v1 is where it's at, as the randomness creeps in much more in 3 or 4 player free-for-all games.

This expansion does much to fill in some of the gaps from the basegame. Multiplayer is now more engaging as the Honour totals are increased and this allows for more combos to be developed within a player's deck before the game wraps up.The greater potential for combos is really what drives this expansion home for me. The new Fate mechanic is nice without being a real game changer.

Ascension is still doing it for me thanks to this expansion.

Return of the Fallen is a must-buy or those who like the core game.  Return adds a few new twists: Fate are actions that can be taken when a new card with Fate is added to the center row and new cards allow for more strategies to be pursued.  It also comes with rules for a simple solitaire game that is actually pretty good.  In my first solo game, I tied Samuel with 63 points each.

I wavered on whether to buy this expansion for over two months before finally deciding to do so. While I do think the price is a little high when taken as an expansion, this is mitigated by the fact that it is also a standalone two player version of the game. I also found the include 1 player rules to be quite challenging. A better value than I'd initially thought.

So far I'm really enjoying the expansion.  More intricate card mechanics have lead to crazier decks.  And it's packaged really nicely as a standalone two player game.  A bit more complicated than the base game, which might be a problem with super casual players (which the base game works well for), but won't be a problem for gamers.

Played a demo game at GAMA 2011, rating based on that single two-player game.  Really nice deck-building game without the setup time of Dominion.  However, there are more cards to learn in each game due to the combo center deck that appears in a six-card face-up tableaux.

Update:  I've since played base Ascension two-player, also quite good.  Expansion adds a nice fate mechanic that causes an event when something hits the center row.

RATING: 8
Adds more cards, and some variation. Doesn't really make that much of a difference but variation. Variation is good though, I enjoy the "live" games with everything more than the iPhone play with only the base game. 

The fate mechanism is neat, but damn hard to remember to execute!

The major new addition here is the "fate" mechanic, which means that some cards will have global effects when they arrive in the center row.  This doesn't really add much to the game, but it doesn't detract either.  What you're really getting here is more card variety, which is certainly welcome in a game like this.

Expansion for the first Ascension Core Set. It adds pleasing variety and synergy for the core set and enhances the game overall.

Ascension was a 9.5 for me before I played the expansion.  Now the expansion is a 9.5 and the base game has fallen to a 9.  I really like the changes here with the fate mechanic.  Playing with only two players seems a lot more streamlined and even than with the base game.  I've not tried mixing the two yet, but am sure I will do so soon.  Either way, a very fun version and expansion alike since it can also be stand alone.

I can't play it with the base game because the cards are not the same. The group I play with would always know when an expansion card was at the top of the deck, and with this expansion some of the card combos are killers. It only gets a 3 because it can stand on its own.

Played with this for the first time last night.  It adds some cool cards, but nothing earth-shaking.  The Fate mechanic is a pretty nice addition as it has broad game-altering effects.  Overall, it doesn't add a whole lot and it really would have been nice to see a couple more design elements added to the core game rather than a third of the box being filled with mystics and heavy infantry.  Also, the card quality is atrocious by comparison to the original edition of the game.  Is it worth $30?  No, but it freshens up a game that had gotten a little stale for me.

RATING: 8.1
Note - I know this technically can be played solo, I have not done that and I envision I will never do that. The following is my rating based on the game as an expansion to the Original Ascension: Deckbuilding Game (Chronicles of the Godslayer)

Components - 1/1 More of the same. No board, but box is compact and components fit nicely into the core box. Cards are of fine stock and the rules are just fine.

Fun - 1/1 This adds a bunch of new cards, with the primary new rule being fate. Fate is something on a bunch of cards that allows all players an action when the card enters the center row. This adds a nice dynamic that generally allows players a little pick me up when not on their turn. This honestly just provides more of the original and nothing comes across as unfun.

Replayability - .8/1 More of the same from the original. This gives a more rounded out feeling in my mind, thus allowing for more plays before becoming bored.

Strategic - .5/1 As an expansion, some cards provide more options for strategies, but since it is more of the same, and the biggest difference (Fate, mentioned above) is really just a luck item, it doesn't add a whole lot to the strategic nature of the game. Hence it gets a meh rating.

Theme - .3/1 In my opinion the exact same thing I said about the original applies to this: "I just don't feel much of [the theme] when playing..."

Personal Review - 4.5/5 This is about as good as an expansion for any game could be. It gives you more of the same, with a few minor differences, thus the original feels more flushed out, and feels a little more complete. It's worth noting that the first few times I played Ascension was with a friend who had both the original and this expansion. When I bought the original, my wife and I played quite a lot, and I always had a feeling that something missing. When we later got this expansion, it felt whole again. It really does have just that needed little more variety.

RATING: 6
From when I started playing Ascension I've played with this expansion so my comments for the base game pretty much apply here.  From what I can garner comparing the base set to Return of the Fallen the two chief differences are a.  the Fate mechanic which has a global effect for all players when it enters the center row and b.  a few expensive fatties that give huge advantages if you can afford them.

I don't have any major issues with either of these additions.  I like new mechanics in games like this, it keeps the game fresh and I've always liked fatties with powerful sweeping abilities (in Magic: The Gathering they would call me a "Timmy").  The only downside to both of these changes are downsides that exist in the base game as well.  Because of the high amount of luck and no control over what or when things flip in the center row someone can stumble ass backwards into first advantage with a Fate card that gives them a huge turn or turning over a fatty just when they have enough to purchase/defeat it and take the game like that.

Nice addition and improvement to the base game. The key change is the addition of a mechanism where some cards instantly trigger an event when they appear in the centre row. I'm not sure it's a great feature but it does make off turns a little more lively.

Ascension: Return of the Fallen doesn't stray too far from the Ascension formula, and the results are positive.  In fact, much of the card art is improved and the expansion can be played as a standalone 2-player game. There's a playfulness to some of the cards that was missing in the core.  If you sleeve your cards to conceal variations between the original and expansion card specs, there's no downside.

Great deck-building game. It has pure rules and can be played very fast but the theme and illustrations are making this a very interesting piece to have. Rules are the same in all Ascensions games and small things are adding a differtent flavour to every one. Here you can find Fate system that newly drawn cards can affect the gameplay in a little way. Nothing that would totaly ruin your plans but still you have to be prepared to deal with consequences.

Return of the Fallen seems to be a little overpowered; when playing with the expansion I find that there are a few cards where the first player to get it simply wins, no questions asked.  Most of the "Rare" cards are so broken that the game might as well just end as soon as someone buys one and the game heavily favors the Mechna strategy thanks to some really powerful support cards (like Battery Monk)

[thing=95064][/thing] is a fine expansion - it adds way less than [thing=108784][/thing], but it still does its job, specially because it can simply be added to the deck of cards without issue.

Yet, although [thing=95064]Return of the Fallen[/thing] has some nice cards (such as the Black Watch Elite), it truly isn't necessary or required - just more variety. The Fate mechanic is good enough, but adds more luck in the draw.

Overall, a skippable expansion, and as an stand-alone it carries less value (though in a smaller package; and is for 2 players) than other expansions or even the base game.

I've never really played Chronicle of the Godslayer w/o this expansion, so the opinion above should be qualified as properly an opinion of the first base set plus expansion.

I really enjoy playing of this deck-building.
Fast and easy to learn. Less waiting time, even with new players (2nd match).
I also really like the new meachanics with each add-on.
My personally max of players is 4, maybe 5.

While I'm not hot on some of the demon//monster/sipirt card graphics, I found this game to be a fun twist on card based games like Dominion.

Adding "Fate" effects does a good job of shaking up the game (and the additional card variety is nice), but not really a requirement for expanding your Ascension set.

This was a low cost expansion for the core/base game that I purchased a few months after getting the original.  One thing lacking from the core game is variety in mechanics (such as those added by the event cards in Legendary).  Return of the Fallen adds fate cards to the deck that affect game play, as well as adding some new heroes and monsters.

Adds some very nice cards and some nice balance/features.  Also makes the game playable for 1-6 players as compared to 1-2 alone or the base Ascension 2-4 players.  Worth grabbing for those who really like the game.

Expansion pack that's also it's own game.  What's not to like?

The base game and Return of the Fallen can be combined, but be aware that the card stock has changed between printings.  The cards are less glossy and feel different - Sleeving is required if this bothers you.

Base game, Return of the fallen, and a few errant promos. All sleeved in great condition with the full-art cardbox sold at shows, and a small box we stickered up for the stuff that won't fit in that.

Have only played this as an expansion, and rating reflects this.  If you're looking for the full game, I'd suggest [gameid=69789] or [gameid=108784] for their ability to go up to four players.  

As an expansion, this just adds more cards.  I'm not really sure that Ascension needed more cards, though it does freshen the game up a bit.  The fate mechanic is mostly fluff.  I do like the game, and that remains unchanged with this expansion, but there's not that much to recommend this one specifically.

So, take the original idea of Ascension and add a few minor little tweaks to it.  It sounds like a good idea for an expansion, and in some ways, it works.  I like the way that the banishment/recovery actions are more stated, and that it can be a valid tactic to start banishing cards in the hopes of reacquiring them through cards that allow you to reclaim them.  It adds a bit more chaos to things, though, as now when some cards come out into the row, they can remove other cards that you were hoping to get.  It's not terrible, and is actually pretty much in line with what you would expect out of the game, but if anyone feels like the chaos in the base game is bordering on too much, this expansion will probably push that over the edge for you.

Great addition to Chronicle of the Godslayer.

One of the best deck building games out there. Extremely fast setup and play time. Very little downtime and super simple rules. You can teach new players to play in under two minutes. Great with any number of players, but I personally prefer it as a two player game. Art is fantastic!

UPDATE: Got killed by iOS.

As Ascension grows, so does the fun and intricacy of game play!  I love how each expansion brings more cards and elements along with it.  It is an enjoyable game, to say the least!

A good set, especially to play with just two players (my preferred way). The card set is interesting without being convoluted. The combos are neat but straightforward. I also like the cards that do something as soon as they show up. This is the only set I currently have, and have kept.

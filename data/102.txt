The Lookout Games version I have is the ugliest game in my collection by a huge margin - simply astonishingly ugly.

The major problem with this game is that it is so hard to get onto the table since it is impossible to introduce. "Hey guys, I've got this great game you'll love playing. We all play jewelery shop owners buying and trading fancy goods..... Guys? Where are you all going?"

Has a clever feel to it like Bohnanza. It's a seemingly simple game with tough decisions, basic card counting, and player interaction.
-Differs from Bohnanza because it eliminates the crazy trading. (Though I agree that the trading in Bohnanza is great fun, it can become potentially tense and some feelings can get hurt). Klunker rewards more the strategic decision maker rather than the sweet talker/ bargain maker. 
I consider them both equal in greatness, though I do with some games of Klunker would last a little longer.

(3-5 players, 30 min) Trading in tacky jewelry is a fickle business - it's tough to know what's hot and what's not. Good thing that success is defined by how refined your tastes are and not your customers'. Attempt to collect sets of 4 but avoid taking on just anything - people will think you don't know good from bad!

Okay game, but the jewelry theme is a turn-off.  The most interesting part for me is trying to figure out how you can take your own window.  I'm not fond of the rule that allows a person with an empty window (during the Shopping Phase) to take the startplayer card and end the Shopping round early.  This game has dual-use cards; here they serve as money, much like Bohnanza, where scoring a set makes fewer of that type of card available.

Much better than Bohnanza in my book -- not as simple as it appears at first.  Our favorite filler in one of my gaming groups, but fell flat with the other group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very confusing at first, as the rules are not very intuitive and this game doesn't really resemble other games.  It also suffers from severe luck elements, whereby it's possible to draw entire sets of scoring cards all on your own.   Draw poorly, and you might spend the entire game trying to create a set that can score well.

There's certainly a reasonably fulfilling game here, but I'm not sure I have the patience or the desire to try to work out how to play around the random elements to remove the frustration that I felt playing it.

Initial rating a 6.

Based on 1 play with 3 players: What a disappointment. It's like Bohnanza but lacking the core trading/negotiation mechanic that makes Bohnanza such an enjoyable experience. Trying to screw people over by selling them things they don't want is a little reminiscent of Coloretto, but the consequences don't feel as dire. As a result it feels like a dry, bad blend of two good games.

There are older games (pre year 2000) that are quite good. However, I’m afraid this is not one of them… It really feels like a set collection game that has been designed many years ago, like it is (it’s from 1995). Game designs have come a long way since then!

Now, I admit that there are some subtle strategies and ways you can manipulate the cards. You need to think about which gems to show in your window, which gems you buy afterwards (or if you’re not going to buy any at all – that way the next players to buy won’t be allowed to do so, so you can mess with some players’ plans).

But all in all it seems a little rough and not particularly balanced. Well, perhaps it’s balanced, but because of the huge swings concerning the luck of the draw I was severely underwhelmed and unimpressed – I would dare to say that this game is one of my biggest letdowns in the last couple of months, simply because it’s from THE man himself, Uwe Rosenberg! Also I’ve heard that it remind some people of Bohnanza. Well, it’s not even close to being a game like Bohnanza in my book! It’s very boring and has problems with the luck factor. I won’t claim that there isn’t any strategy, but in my games it felt like the winner was decided purely by luck as, for instance in the first game, he got great cards that matched and he could put like 3 or 4 of a kind in the safe, while I, again in the first game, had two couple of 3 in my safe, drew up to 6 cards, and then had 4 different colors and none of them suiting my cards in the safe… That’s just crappy! So I needed to get rid of the cards, but that meant that I sort of had to put a card in the safe, which meant that I wouldn’t get as much money for selling my cards eventually… And the game really just went downhill from there and I felt like it was sort of a negative snowball effect due to horrible card draws. I wasn’t the only player who experienced this, while the winning player got awesome cards in our first play and crushed us. Our next game went a bit like the same; the winner simply just got more suited cards – but not overwhelmingly good cards, which the scores in turn reflected.

I’ve only tried it with 3, and I suspect it’s better with 4 and maybe 5. At least there will be more to think about and which window you want to buy (as, if you don’t buy anything, nobody after you will get the opportunity to buy, so there is room for clever play).

Components: Simple but functional cards, though some suits look similar from a distance, and the backs could have been different for the turn order and shop window cards, to help with sorting.

Experience: Very simple decisions to be made, and the game goes quickly, even with five players. Not terribly interesting. Doesn't hold my attention with various numbers of players. There is overlap with Bohnanza, but Bohnanza is the clear winner.

This game has some things in common with Bohnanza but is not nearly as straightforward.  I'm still not sure what the best strategy in this game but I enjoy playing it.  I do think the $1 window selling fee is overlooked - in the beginning you get the fee just about every time but as the game progresses it can become much harder to get that dollar.  I also think it is key to watch that you don't hand money over to your opponents too freely with the shop window.  You can offer the 4th of a set for an opponent but throw in one other card so it's still worth it for them but they'll only get $3 instead of 4 (plus you'll take 1).  A good little demented game.

This game is deceptively simple but it packs a punch.  I enjoy playing it with a group that is very familiar with it (they've played it hundreds of times) but I would never want to teach it to a new group of people (especially non-gamers) because the rules are VERY unintuitive.  There is basically no sensible theme, but the game play is interesting, interactive, and fun.

OK, stop comparing this to Bohnanza.  It has cards, you arrange them in sets, and then the similarities end.  No bargaining, no limit to the number of sets displayed, and YOU CAN REARRANGE THE CARDS IN YOUR HAND.  I do like Bohnanza, and I like this one, too.  Maybe more, depending on the crowd.  Each decision you make in this is painful... Do I make my window attractive so someone pays me a buck?  But then someone gets good stuff.  Do I buy THAT window even though it has one thing in it that will reduce the value of my stuff?  If not, someone else might get it.  Do I bow out now to get a prime spot on the next turn?  Hmmm.  I really enjoy this game -- it has mechanics, flow, and decisions that are quite unique.

This game is based on an ultra-weird mechanics, and you will have trouble understanding it and explaining it. Still, after a couple of rounds you begin to understand what is going on. It's not devoid of strategy, but luck of the draw is a little bit too important. Update: played with 3 and the game works impressively well. You can really control the draw and it is real fun to figure out how best to use your current hand.

This has taken over both Bohnanza and Agricola as my favorite Uwe game. I prefer the WTS variant that includes 2-extra bucks to start per player. 

2016
====

Klunker is one of my favorite implicit negotiation games. What I mean by that is that while some players try to sell their wares, the best negotiations in Klunker occur implicitly via the contents of the players' shop window offers. While players attempt to sell their goods to benefit themselves, rarely will players do well by playing in a wholly selfish manner. Instead, each shop window should be populated with enough to entice your opponents without helping them too much. The games is a delicate balance of conflicting and complimentary interests.

[2014.03.30]
The first game that I played where I had to manage more than one hand.  This is my first Uwe game and still my favorite of every other game that he's created (so far).

Fun,light game that we wanted to play again as soon as we finished playing. Deciding whether you'll take someones shop and risk losing money when turning in what's in the safe, or just looking at others windows to see if they have what you want. What added the fun into the game was asking someone if they'd put something in their window you want and you promise to buy from them, or putting something in your window someone may want if they'll do the same for you. Just make sure you get the #1 card so you get it before someone else, who had there eye on that same jewelry to complete their run of 4 of a kind. Good fun and easy to learn.

I played two games of this in a row, and I clearly didn't learn anything because I scored badly both times.  I tried a "put out exactly one category and try to get 4 points from it" strategy, combined with a "keep pairs of cards in my hand to get to 4 points in a stealthy way" strategy, but it didn't work.  I think that if you don't show much in your safe, then players don't know what you want, and the combinations of jewels in their shop windows don't match you very well.  People *want* to sell to you, because it gives them money, plus it gives them a chance to *not* buy stuff that they don't want (when it comes to their turn to buy).

So, a game with subtleties that I haven't quite grasped yet.  Need further plays to judge, but I think it's a good short game.

This was almost great. The version we used was on the verge of unplayability because of the color choices (Lookout edition). Red and pink were nearly undistinguishable, and the rest of the artwork was also thoroughly uninspired. The game design is quite clever, though, but it didn't really speak to us. Part of the problem was that one player was well ahead early on in the game and we didn't see any chance to catch up with him.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (March 2016)

I like most Uwe Rosenberg´s games so I bought Klunker only for the designer. 

The rules are fairly simple, you can explain them under 7 minutes. Playtime is around 45 minutes.

The game components are ok. I know there are two versions of the game with different art and one of them is very superior, art wise, to the other.

Klunker is a light hand management card game. The real interesting decision is to choose how many jewels you will offer in your window, anything else is (mostly) obvious, or so it seems. That doesn’t mean the game is obvious. Also, I feel the game has a lot of uncontrollable luck of the draw (a huge negative for me).

Bottom line, it seems luck of the draw can decide the winner most often than not. The game explainer had some doubts, so I need to read the rules and give it another try before deciding if I should keep it. Right now I’m leaning toward selling it. For me, it is at the same level of Bohnanza (a game I no longer enjoy). Perhaps it is a great family and/or casual game. For now I’m rating it a borderline 6.0

RATING: 6
This one came two years after Bohnanza and has a similar objective of turning sets into cash by flipping cards. Turns have a fairly clean structure - draw back up to 6 cards, put any number of cards from your hand into your "shop window", take turns adding cards to your "safe" (which is where your sets are built), and then take turns purchasing from each other's shop windows to immediately add those cards to your safe. Any time a set of four is created, turn it into cash and remove those cards from the game. Repeat until you cannot replenish everyone's hands back to 6. Most cash wins.

The trick that makes the game interesting is that for every different type of card in your safe when you trade in a set, your set is worth one less. This requires holding more cards in hand until you have a set or can complete one through buying from the shop windows. Shop windows, though, often have things you want and things you don't and it all has to go direct to your safe. That said, no strategy seemed as powerful as an advantageous draw. The game plays super-quick, almost too quick for anything meaningful to develop. It wasn't terrible, but I'm not sure why I'd play this over Bohnanza.

RATING: 7
A nice little game. I can see why people lose heart with it a little, some thought into strategy may help most. A decent filler, though may be too long. Ensure you buy Rio Grande version with the less ugly cards. The game plays a little better with fewer players (I've played with 3 and 5, maybe the sweet spot is 4?).

A game is generally better when played by the rules...:-)  We messed this one up badly on my first try.  Its an interesting sell jewelry type game and collect jewelry to score dollars.  However, you only score up to $4 for a set of jewels which is lessened by one dollar for each different type of jewelry in your vault (except for panther head necklace which breaks those rules).

RATING: 9
100+ plays. I rate this highly because it developed into our regular late night closer. There's a heap of luck, but it's fun to tempt people into purchases, it's fun when you're spurned and have to suck it up, its fun when you get great cards, and groaning fun when you get one of everything. The sell/take feature makes this game significantly different from others, and once you're past the initial weirdness, it's highly attractive.

There tend to be two workable strategies: 

1) Get most if not all your hand out each turn, happy to score 1's, get the 5 or 6 card re-draws, plus the occasional gold if someone takes your window. If cards work well, you may eventually transmute into strategy 2, being ...

2) Target scores of 4, 3 and 2, playing carefully, happy to donate gold to others to keep your scores clean. But you've got to know your other players. If they're going to play dirty and not offer good stuff, you'll eventually be forced into strategy 1 when the redraws don't go your way.

There's definitely an art to the offer. We've found:

a) If two people are building the same jewel, you can contemplate placing 1 of that jewel, but you only want to do this if they're getting close, they're keen to build, they won't be drawing many cards and there's something else out there you can take. Otherwise, 1 card is a dangerous offer. It's usually more advantageous to force someone to eat their own dog food to screw up their future scoring potential, especially if you're drawing lots of cards. 

b) targeting 1 player, say offering 1 of each when they're on 2 of each, is seen but again only if there's something else out there you can afford to take and opponent is not drawing many.

c) offering a pair is the most popular and safest, especially when there's little you want on offer from the others. You can safely keep and play it yourself.

d) offering a mix of junk that you'll be happy to take yourself because you're playing the cleanout strategy.

We've found the charm of Klunker to partly be the reading of other players - how prepared will they be to not take your decent offer and head down strategy 1 instead. So the game is more about the player interplay than the cards themselves.

Klunker is an interesting game. Although the rules aren't really difficult, they're not very intuitive, and a good strategy is not immediately apparent. The mechanics have some similarity to those of Bohnanza, but the free-flowing negotiation in the latter game gives it something extra that Klunker lacks. It's still a game that I would like to play some time.

Underrated game having some familiar elements from the designer's Bohnanza (i.e. goods collected are flipped into vps/cash) but for me is used here more effectively and there is no trading involved (which can become a long winded affair).

RATING: 6
Klunker is an early Rosenberg card game and I've had great success with those in the past. It turns out to be an interesting one if you like hand-management, because you effectively have three to manage. There are some echoes of Meuterer (balancing playing more cards with the benefits of dropping out earlier) and Bohnanza (but with implied not overt trading). I only realised what I was doing about half-way through and would like to play again soon.

As usual, Uwe Rosenberg creates an interesting blend of mechanics for a non-intuitive affair, but one that makes total sense once it clicks.  You have to be careful in the early game when you have no money to get you out of a jam.  Also, the luck of the draw plays quite a bit of an effect.  Regardless, the game is short (< 30 minutes) and fun to play - both good marks in my book.

Jesus. You know what? This game is great. It seems simple, unintuitive, and bizarre. But it ends up feeling more like some sort of intensely fought boardgame than like a light card-game. Much more about getting a little extra screwage into your opponent, but not getting so into screwage that you don't sell your goods.I really like this.It's kind of Bohnanza with balls and a small but very sharp knife.

Kind of duller with 3 people though. You need a full gang to make it a tense game, and not an automatic one.

Great filler from Uwe Rosenberg of Bohnanza fame. Seems to be best with three.

I suspect Klunker's ratings have suffered unfairly from comparison to Bohnanza. For what it is (a light filler), I find Klunker better than the ratings suggest.

Mechanically it's similar to Bohnanza, with the main difference being that you buy cards rather than trading them. As the cards are sold in mixed batches, your main decision is whether to screw your opponents by including bad cards with your good ones, or make some money (without letting your opponents get too far ahead) by selling a steady trickle of good (but not great) cards.

Looney Labs publishes a randomness-reducing  expansion for this, believe it or not.

Update: Still going strong for me, and seems to appeal to lots of different groups.

Heard this was cleverly weird and it did not disappoint. Put things up for sale that people want if you want to earn a $1, but not so much that they get a lot of money (shades of Modern Art here), and at the same time beware of the possibility of eating your own wares. Collect unique sets in a punishing Coloretto manner. Pass early for favorable turn order. Balance getting rid of cards to cycle them with undesirable outcomes of selling too much or losing initiative since you pass last.

There's something about gem-themed games that brings out the creative juices in designers and makes them weird out. Basari, Queen's Necklace etc.

Tried it with 3 which was plain weird in a bad way (not many options for buying). Would try again with more.

I appreciate these short, creative 'proofs of concept' more than the designer's overwrought long games.

First impressions of this game weren't overwhelming, but I feel it'll take a few plays before I can fix a real opinion and rating. IT did have Bohanza style elements, as per its creator, but I think it comes out behind the bean game in terms of playability. It was of course difficult to get a handle on good tactics in game 1, but certain impressions prevailed. It seemed as though Player order is difficult to change. In order to become first player, one would have to sacrifice a buying phase, which isn't an attractive proposition. We had a runaway leader which made things difficult for the other players. The other factor is that a lot of your points can really be gained by playing cards inside your own area. This gave me the feeling that interacting with the other players was really a kind of aside to getting your own points. Perhaps further plays will see a shift, but underwhelmed was the general feeling I was left with.

Holy Crap!  Why everyone loves Bohnanza and disregards Klunker is beyond me.  If you are into hand management games this is the one, as you are basically balancing three different hands and using what you make off of them to bleed into the other hands.  There is a lot going on here that I can see being a little too much for the nongamer, but I think that the decision making process is superior to most set collecting card games I've played.  All of the mechanics are beautifully intertwined like a cat's cradle.  Highly recommended.  I'm not seeing how this game is broken.

The only thing I'm pretty sure of so far is to try and get to a point where you are drawing at least three or four cards at the end of each round and putting the good ones in your safe.  Also, putting cards you need into your shop window isn't a bad idea because you can take those cards yourself and save a dollar.    
My rating could very well increase upon future sessions, but I don't see it falling below a six.

No one other than a genius could have dreamed this up!  What a heady mix of great but off beat mechanics and possibility for player interaction.  You've got second guessing peoples intentions and almost giving people what they want, whilst getting exactly what you want.  it's great and everybody should have a copy.

[Hans im Glück 99 edition] {Merchant; set collection, hand management, trading; optimal 4p} Klunker is a funny set collection game. It's similar to Bohnanza (from the same designer) but it is more tactical. It is different from other set collection games that players have to make some of their jewelries available to other players, which makes decision agonizing: if you are too generous, your opponents can get high score; if you are too mean, you may be forced to buy something you don't need. It is a kind of indirect trading.

The game play is fast-paced and smooth. The rule is easy to understand and to pick up though not very intuitive (how come other will know what jewelry you put into your safe! and players have to remember Necklace is different from others). Despite these shortcomings, the theme is quite strong. Actually, I think Klunker is nicely designed - elegant and simple. I also like the rule that players are penalized if they collect irrelevant jewelry. This scoring rule is sometimes quite important because it discourages player from hoarding cards. Recommended for players who like set collection games!

I don't quite like the artwork of the cards. It's dull and the color tune is not clear enough. Besides, I would like a real rulebook rather than cards.

Seemed like an interesting mechanism at first, but very quickly moved into a fairly random repetitive flow. The balance just seems a bit off in that once you have four or more sets on the table, it's very difficult to get back to less than that, and it becomes just a race to collect sets of four and trade them in for the bargain basement prices. Or maybe I just wasn't very good at it.

Feels familar to Money! and Oasis, but is lighter. Have not played Money to say which one feels better, but would probably guess its definitely lighter. More family game than a thinking game. Nevertheless, its a card game well constructed.

Interesting game with some novel mechanics, but I'm not sure I've got my head around the strategies properly yet. It's odd, but the first time we played it everything seemed quite clear in my head, whereas subsequent plays have just left me rather confused.

This set-collection game seems to have plenty of fans, so even though it didn't thrill me the first few plays, I gave this one several more ties to try to discern what I may have been missing. What I'm missing is the time I invested in playing this aptly named game ...

Klunker ("jewelry") is not intuitive.  It is vaguely related to Bohnanza, which is far more elegant and entertaining. And the opportunity for sparkling artwork is oddly ignored. I'll take beans instead of gems, please.

Had lots of fun learning and playing this game. 
Its a set collection game; where you put jewels into your store window to encourage other players to buy them from you. Then put some into your vault; and finally buy jewels from other players to put in your vault. 
Get points for collecting sets of 4. 

Quick and easy and a solid filler game.

This is the best hand-management game I know, mostly because you’re simultaneously trying to manage three hands. If you like Bohnanza but crave more meat, this is your game. If you dislike Bohnanza because of the trading, it’s been replaced by sniping each other’s cards away from each other. Mean little piece of genius from Uwe Rosenberg.

Very unremarkable cardgame with some bad artwork (Hans Im Glück version) that is much too short to offer any sense of control with five players. It is hard to believe that it is from the same author as the brilliant Agricola. Coloretto offers a somewhat similar gaming experience, but is much more enjoyable.

Really this game should be rated much higher, but it isn't because it has a few flaws. However, I have a dozen friends that have played this game for 15 years, some of them game designers, and they have tweaked the rules a little, making it a wonderful game: the two main tweaks are that you add two starting dollars for everyone, but not from the deck (make them or use money from another game), and that you shuffle discarded cards back into the draw deck before each round, making for a slightly longer but much more satisfying game. 

The author did come out with a 2nd version, which is horrible and much worse (too bad he didn't know about and adapt the improvements we play with) and this means the first version won't be re-released, so eBay is the best shot at finding a copy. The designer, Uwe Rosenberg, has designed other, award-winning games, such as Bohnanza and Agricola, But I think Klunker is his masterpiece by far.

Not as bad as all the negative press makes it out to be. I liked the mechanics just fine. I can see how rabid Bohnanza fan could be disappointed. It's just not as interactive. And to top it off, I just don't like the art work. It goes for whimsy and comes off painfully amatuerish. Maybe, with better art and a better name, people would be kinder to this game.

A great card game.  You try to collect sets of 4 of various items of jewelry.  You do this by placing cards from your hand into your safe or buying cards from a store front.  You also place cards in your store front you hope someone will buy from you. It's a fun game and fairly quick.  This is especially true with 5 players.

First play  - 3 players - Another card card from the guy who brought us Bohnanza. I don't care for Bohnanza and it played very much LIKE Bohnanza. In this one you try to create sets of precious items like necklaces and earrings. You have a window where you can display goods for others to purchase and then a safe where you keep the items you are trying to store. Too much in the safe and you score less but if you keep the safe to 1 or two items at a time (score on sets of four) you'll score more. There is a display round, purchase round and then a safe round. It was okay and I would try it again with more players the next time.

Fine game where the same elements are used as points, currency and actual goods you're trying to buy. This mechanic makes for a twisted and intriguing gameplay, a little like Das Kollier and Money (except those two are even more twisted than Klunker... in a good way).

I am sorry to say this is one of the worse game i played recently and i am disappointed that this game is by a very good author.
First, less important things: the art in this game was really bad. But as usual, i don't care much about it.
Then, the game: it is terribly boring, uninspired and uninspiring. You make the same thing over and over and over again and it drags on forever, waiting for a deck to come to an end, a deck that gets refilled at every step. It's an agony. You don't improve as a player, there's no change, no long term strategy, only some attempts to a very short term strategy, let's call it "tactics" ??
The theme is pasted on, per se this is not a problem at all with me, but in this case the game is so dry that also a fitting theme would have helped. It is just a boring working uninteresting mechanism.

Klunker is a fairly engaging, light card game with some tough strategic decisions. The game play mechanics and strategy elements can take a few games to get the feel for, as it introduces some mechanics that players may be unfamiliar with. It's an enjoyable way to spend a half hour, although it may lack enough "meat" for serious gamers to play more than once or twice at any given sitting.

A slightly odd card game (like most of the designer's other games) that plays very well with 5 and moves along at a good pace.Can be a little tricky to teach but is reliable in its ability to provide a fun time.

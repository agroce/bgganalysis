Played the demo game at GenCon, which was roughly half a game.  I think that with the variability in what you decide to unlock each game, as well as the included expansion The Ohio, there is plenty of replay value.

I thought it was OK. It seems like there are a lot of paths to go down, but it feels like you need to get to the other half of the board and open up the first region as the first order of business no matter what. That's fine, as the game opens up a little more after that. But the game can have a massive runaway leader problem if players don't go that route. There are a lot of ways to score, so it can lead to less competition for things than I would like. And the game does not feel fun to me, and I am the kind of person that loves these kinds of themes.

2018-01-18 : First play. Tactical play to work towards a strategic goal. This is normally the kind of game I like very much, but this one left a nagging feeling that the tech tree is both not very diverse - all 2nd tier techs are basically worth 3 money - and that it's too much on rails, that there are techs you really can't do without, that you can't do something entirely different than what all the other players are doing. So then it becomes a race to see who gets those techs first, inc combination with the limitation on the number of players who can get the later ones. That leads to a tight and tense game, but also limits the player's options. Twice during the game a combination of the current event + what other players had done before me led to me literally having no choice what to do in my turn. That's nearly 20% of the game.
Need to play this again to see whether this initial appreciation holds or not. Might go up to 8.

Logistics game, where timing is important because the player furthest upriver has the initiative. You have to plan your deliveries to develop your tech tree.

It takes some time to work through the rules for the first play, but after that everything quickly makes sense.  Really a good game.
[It is worth sorting the components between the Ruhr and Ohio versions prior to the first play. Using one of the online guides in files or images can be helpful.]
Glad to have The Ohio included!!!

-Many paths to victory.
-Interesting decisions.
-Denial-type player interaction.
-Slight bit of randomness but helps keep the game fresh.
-Didn't play Ohio but I like having two-games-in-one!

I'm not completely sure how I feel about this game.  I like how players unlock different upgrades on their personal boards, but you need to access the Graftschaftmark area as soon as possible, which means the game feels somewhat scripted.  Gameplay is interesting and turn order is crucial.

Super excited to play this. I missed out on actually buying the original version years ago as I had no idea who Spielworxx was and I wasn't quite into the heavy niche games at that time. Capstone has won me over on literally every game they've put out. This was an instant buy the second it became available.

Hopefully it plays well with 2, but of course like any heavy (economic) game, I'd rather play with the higher player counts.

So far I've only played on the Ruhr map, and not the new map that comes on the front side of the board for this edition. 

In this game you are trying to get points by placing houses and unlocking technology tiles. This is fueled by getting money from shipping coal down the river, represented by dice. The value of the coal fluctuates as the die face changes up or down through player actions. The locations you deliver to determine which technology tiles unlock at the end of the round. The technology tiles are what allow you to place your houses and amass endgame scoring criteria. Money is very tight in this game, and the game in general is fairly low scoring so getting 1vp per dollar is actually a pretty ideal ratio.

The map itself is laid out in a somewhat confusing manner, but it's manageable. One or two of the icons could have been a lot better, but I've forgiven other games for worse. The board was printed with a fairly uniform lack of vibrancy and contrast, which leads to the colors looking dull and blending visually with the map features. This is unfortunate, since Khole and Kolonie by the same designer has a similar looking map, but looks so so much nicer.

The game gives you a few interesting decisions here or there and is generally an ok game, but it fails to have any mechanisms that get me really excited. You sail your boat up and down the river, back and forth, trying to keep your money level high enough to improve your position, but it feels samey throughout. The game is very low scoring which also pushes it to feel a little bland. There are some places you can put a house that do a +1vp majority scoring at the end, which is pretty meh, but then a tie in those boxes means nobody gets the bonus, which is pretty unexciting. The technology tiles you plan your strategies around run one fewer than the number of players, so you might set yourself up for a tile, and lose it to turn order.

I'm interested to play this more to see if it grows on me. In particular I'm curious about the new side of the board, which seems to have some substantial variation from the version I played.

:) Interesting player interaction: turn order changes frequently and lots of actions cause coal to spawn into the game - which can influence your opponents game.

:) Rather original mechanics: via combinations of deliviers you unlock different abilities which really alter your game. There is a race aspect going on in order to get certain things done (building warehouses first is cheaper of offers better benifits for example). You need lots of money to build warehouses and to gain access to more powerful actions allowing you to get more done or increasing your flexibility. Turn order is key, and lots of dicisions influence turn order.

:) The Capstone Games edition features an other game option on the other side of the game board: you get 2 games in one! I only played the standard version though...

:soblue: The mechanics don't play out very thematically, it feels a little abstract. The iconography (or the lack thereoff) also doesn't help in this regard, at times it gets a little fiddly.

:soblue: Turn order manipulation is key in this game, which is a great asset, but due to its importance, the gameflow might feel a little chaotic at times. However, overall for me the balance shifts towards the good side of this story: the shifting turn order and its importance intrigues me more than it annoys me (but it does, at times ;) ).

:soblue: Near the end, the game can be prone to some kingmaker issues.

(Thus far, comments are based on two-and-a-half plays on the Ruhr side of the board) 

(+) Interestingly enough, there are numerous thematic connections made by the mechanisms present: the decay of coal weight, the historical round-events, the limitations of coal deliveries as the industry deviated from river transport to rail. It is rare to see this done so well in a heavy euro.  
(+) Stringent action selection, tight income system, and an inspired turn order changing mechanism adds intangible player interaction and tension to the game and incentivizes strategic planning.  
(+) Innovative upgrade system that is tied to the actions you accomplish.  

(-) The opening is somewhat scripted, and you can feel extremely constrained if you are late in turn order due to limited options as the game progresses.  
(-) The random bag-drawn elements can really stagnate the flow of the game, more so with the water-level-rising tile. Thematic, I suppose.  
(-) Does not feel very interactive at lower player count due to less competition of action spaces, without variants.

On the second play, the rules explanation went MUCH faster this time, at maybe 20 minutes or so? Game length was right at 2 hours. I still enjoyed it but I'm not sure this would have very much replayability (you HAVE to get to Graftschaftmark area ASAP, which dictates a series of moves). It's a good thing, then, that the game includes an all-new map (and new rules) on the back! I'd like to try the base game one more time, with experienced players. I do wish, though, that the graphics were easier to see and that they'd just used cards (with maps showing affected regions) instead of those damn event tiles (with their teeny tiny icons which you have to match with a region of the board)!

[b]--- Game Summary ---[/b]
The board shows several regions, each with coal sources, cities, and factories, and a river running through it all ending at Port. Players will be running their boats down the river, picking up and dropping off coal, periodically hauling your boat back upriver so you can float down again. Delivering earns you money and helps you unlock advances (based on the combination of types of deliveries you've made). Advances give you more options: open up a new area of the board, build warehouses in various areas, earn VP, build locks to facilitate movement, etc. Boat positioning is key: turn order goes from upriver downwards, and turn order is vital for most of the things you can do. 

You earn VP during the game (mostly for building locks and warehouses), and some more at the end based on board presence. Most VP wins!

This version is a reprint of the German Ruhrschiffahrt game, with a new board of the Ohio River on the flip side.  One play only impression is very positive, although I think the criticism of very narrow options leading to very similar strategies might be valid, but will need further plays to test the waters.  This is a tight pick up and deliver game where every point taken or missed matters.  Though there are dice in the game, don't worry about luck dominating the game; it's a very low factor.

After playing with two: 7.5
Each movement has layers of strategy associated because each phase of a round is determined by position on the river. Kind of engine building, but gaining money is crucial to keep that engine going. The theme bleeds through much of what happens through the game, which always helps to make sense of actions. Great game.

I found this hard to grok during my first play for some reason, even though gameplay sounds relatively straightforward. I'd like to try it again but, for now, Haspelknect is the better game in the coal trilogy.

RATING: 7
An unusual game (good thing, that), with a strange feel to it. It feels much less strange once you grant yourself access to the upper half of the river: Then, it feels much more like picking up coal and delivering it downstream.

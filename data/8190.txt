Great balance between action and reaction. The theme is so daft (yeti whisperers anyone?) I cannot bring myself to complain. In fact, in a perverse way I think it benefits the game, as opposed to tacked-on 'serious' themes which bear little resemblance to gameplay.

{1 play • 4 players} Not being a big fan of Colovini or abstracts, I was surprised by how much I liked this one, mostly because it seemed to move along at a good clip.  Yes, you need to stop and think every once in a while, but you never seem to have *too* many good moves to choose between.  Of course, all of us were new to the game, so I'm sure that helped.  Also my expectations were low.  Still, I'd be surprised if my rating dropped that much after more plays... though it probably won't go up, either.

Somewhat clever, somewhat fiddly; setup is a little tedious due to the nature of sorting the tiles. Rules are simple and easy to explain. A bit of an interesting ontology game. Fixed player order makes it really pretty deterministic though; a little too prone to binding to the player order once a decision has been made. Still, emergent cooperative gameplay and parasitic travel rules make it a bit interesting. Would probably play again, but not particularly interested in it. Adding a variable turn auction mechanic (discard tiles permanently to bid) would make it pretty interesting.

A very good abstract game from Colovini.  Game uses an area influence mechanic that is slowly tighten as the game progresses .  This gives the game a sense of urgency as the game progresses.  Game play is very clean.  Highly enjoyable. [GTI Code: AGSD]

RATING: 7
In an odd way there is some cool 'ride the other players intent', similar to the auction/share train games.  But here it is distilled down to a purer form, although some depth is distilled away too.

What is added back in, relative to something like Chicago Express, is some puzzle solving aspect.

Quite a good blend in a short playing package.

A very Colovini game, and a very good one.  It's abstract, and it may not be easy to get at first, but it is clear that offers a lot to think, clever movements, and tension.  Box is just too big, and tiles used to represent masters and students are not really nice, and the way they are used does not really help to visualize the game easily.  But the game is good, really good.

VERY good game. I have not played enough or at a high enough level to tell whether this is great, but it is definitely very good.

Incentive manipulation, leeching, implied negotiation, it's all there. Games are tense, and often close, but without artificial closeness of many a resource converters. Here, the closeness comes from the subtle 3-player dance on the board. When one player looks to be getting ahead, the other players are incentivized to tip the balance back the other way.

An 8 after one play. I had to try it after hearing the guys on Into the Gamescape rave about it. I see why they like it. It is my kind of game. You need to plan 2-3 turns in advance and hope no one visits your city before you can move out and take over your target. Both strategic and tactical. Great fun!

Boy, I made the huge mistake of role-playing to inject some fun when I played it with other people.  Now everyone thinks I love it and keeps bringing up my "journey of the student".  I love a good abstract, and I remember enjoying this at first, but now this just annoys the heck out of me.  There is something about the interplay between movement and piece playing that just does not appeal to me.

I'm not a fan of abstracts, but just paint a few dragons on the pieces, call it a theme, and I'm there. This game is really, really interesting. There are so many choices, and it seems like different strategies work. I won my third game by one point (22-21). I almost completely conquered just a few villages, whereas the second-place player was thinly spread over many (which would have won him a tie breaker, had we needed one). The biggest key to this game is properly timing the students' journeys. It's often better to move from a weaker to a stronger village and lose all your students but destroy the bridge before the stronger village moves into the weaker and wipes out all your masters.

This light filler seems like a fairly standard area majority exercise, but actually is more of a war game. In a turn you either add forces to a city, or charge a neighbouring city accross a bridge. Each bridge apparently crumbles under the attacking stampede, disconnecting cities one by one during the game until no movement is possible anymore.

The nifty mechanic is that cities have designated spots for each type of 'warrior' (or actually student) and each spot can be occupied by your warrior or one of your opponents. When attacking another city not only your 'warriors' attack, but the warriors on all spots, even your opponents. This creates some interesting tactics where you can instigate an attack that doesn't deliver you direct profit but can move the threat of an opponent away by setting him up against another opponent.

I like that the game has no luck based elements but the players' decisions. Everyone has the same number of warriors of each type, so in theory it's completely balanced. Solid, albeit somewhat bland game.

7/12 - first play in almost 10 years. Wonderful fun and very heavy & deep with lots of look-ahead. I especially love the 'temporary emergent alliances', particularly if played without discussion of them. Just make your move, and it telegraphs volumes to your opponents/temporary allies. Want to play this lots more.

Typical Colovini abstract fun, but a lot more of a brain-burner than his usual stuff. It's odd and unique, but it definitely works well.  The theme was interesting enough to provide a mental hook for the game and did not detract. Probably the best multiplayer abstract out there, really. The last couple turns can bog down as everything is calculable.

Try to get the most masters on the board at the end by training students and then migrating to a neighbouring village. Each migration breaks a bridge and when the last bridge is gone the game is over. Simple rules but plenty of depth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Colovini creates yet another burning and engaging game that plays quickly and intelligently. Much like many of his games the theme is curious, but the mechanics fascinating. This is almost like a very quick impulse movement wargame, with players stocking up on ‘Students’ and then moving into and taking over provinces. The way the bridges are destroyed as the game progresses makes for a very interesting game, with many varied ‘focal points’ changing and evolving over the course of game. Turns move quickly, yet this is a game that involves plenty of thought.

I am reaching a point where I will happily buy any Colovini game on the name of the designer alone, each of his games I have played has seemed to be a great little addition to our hobby, always packed with thought, but always lean on game time – perfect for those times when you want a deeper game, but don’t have the time to commit to something overly long.

RATING: 7
I actually quite liked this one.  It's certainly very dry and an abstract at heart, but I found myself constantly thinking throughout the game, both during my turn and other players turns.  Any game that does that is at least a partial winner in my opinion.

It certainly does appear to be a game like chess where a bit of experience could totally dominate other players.  I doubt this is one that I'll play very often or convince others to play very often, but I think this would be good for occasional play.

Initial rating a 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A very interesting multi-player abstract game. I don't think I've played quite anything like it (I guess the closest would be Five Tribes?): everything is deterministic, but there are so many options on your turn, and the actions of your opponents are so unpredictable early in the game, that it doesn't really feel like an abstract game. 

Until the end, that is. The last several rounds become very scripted because there are fewer options. Unfortunately, AP begins to set in as players make sure they are making the optimal move, tracing out how their actions will trigger the actions of others. This means the game slows to a crawl about 3/4 of the way through. If you like that sort of thing, you might love this. I didn't, but can see the appeal.

Another clever game from one of my favorite designers!  Very interesting mechanisms, as is the case with many Colovini games.

A rarity for me in that the game is very abstract, which I typically am not a fan of.  However, the fact that you're trying to fight multiple fronts creates a lot of great tension.

May be a little dry for some, but I like it.

Extraordinarily stressful, this game makes you feel like you are just making the least worst move. There are so many ways to be attacked and so few ways to defend. Managing the incentives of your opponents such that they have better deltas elsewhere seems to be the way to go. I knew I liked this game when, in my first game, one of my opponents said, I feel like anything I do helps you. Very oddly, this reminds me of Chicago Express in the very tetchy control of incentives, but the alliances seem more parasitic. I hear that the two-player works, but I can imagine it is just a very different game - less about incentives, more tactical. I can imagine that the four player gets a bit chaotic. i wonder if there is a possibility for a partners four player variant...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Intriguing perfect information game.  Can seem dry until you notice the power of defending a city by moving students from it in a direction that you know will fail, just to break the bridge.  Very tense in this regard.  Tends to reward a driving aggressive play-style that keeps everyone scrambling for balance and opportunity.  In fact much of the game can be described as a fight for initiative, which mostly means that the game is a continuous rolling fight to keep the other players slightly more off-balance and thus more out-of-control then you are. Careful monitoring what tile-types are still available to each player and which are exhausted can be valuable.  

Rating likely to rise on further plays.  Much better with three players than four.  Probably worth a rating of an 8.5 for 3P.

Rating updated to 8.5.  It is very nearly with a 9.

Great game of shifting power and initiative with very strong zero sum patterns.  The information is all there on the table, waiting for you to work through the possibilities.  This is really a game about maximizing your own position while minimizing the openings that are provided to your opponents.  This is surprisingly difficult to achieve in person, and you will find opponents sneaking through the back door you left cracked open.  The game really has a strong ebb and flow between groups, as you are trying to balance getting more pieces on the board, expanding pieces, and keeping a diversified base of masters so your expansion does not stall out.

A very interesting and quite deep multiplayer abstract. What sets it apart is the way it implements incentives manipulation, and the fluidity and fragility of the game state in the early and mid game. Setting up for preemptive attacks is really cool, and calculating game state is very easy. I like it quite a lot, and I respect it as a design even more. I am not sure it will get out often though, as it requires 3 roughly equally skilled players.

+ Exceptional capturing mechanism
+ Incentives manipulation done right
+ Easy to teach

= Requires players of equal skill
= Requires many plays
= Is an abstract

Sure, Leo Colovini's games feel on the drier side and the abstract game mechanics underneath are more easily visible than some other contemporary Euros. But I still dig the whimsical theme to Bridges of Shangri-La, and it works for me. This game has beautiful components and a great tension in the game clock (the consumption of bridges) that is very pleasant. It plays quickly. 

A knock on this game is the lack of any hidden information. For me, that's no big deal. However, one can sit and calculate everyone's scores and possible plays....which can tend to bog down a bit in the endgame. 

I wouldn't mind getting a copy of this game some time, but I don't think I'm prepared to pay my own money to buy it. Maybe if a great deal came along. On the other hand, if a buddy pulled it out sometime I'd be very happy to play...and I might request it from time to time...not sure. The similarity to Clans is certainly obvious, but this one has a feel all its own.

Why all the hubub over the latest Knizia retheme/recycle or whatever the new fluffy Alan Moon game is?  Don't you folks want something different and maybe even a little experimental?    This is a tense, brain-crashing game that features really easy rules that are a framework for deep strategy, allowing different and sometimes complex tactical approaches.  Bridges is one of his best, on the same tier (for me) with Carolus Magnus, Magna Grecia, and Alexandros.  Wish the tile art didn't look so...er...1980 though.

When I first opened it up and read the rules this game seemed awesome. Quick to learn, simple but elegant with tons of possiblities. Some games just grab you that way. I thought this might be a 9 or 10. However after playing it I still think its very good but not everyone agreed with me. I can't seem to put my foot on what it is that's missing. But I still think it has some great mechanics and tactics. I'm sure its not really missing anything its just my current perception after being a little disappointed. The rest of the group didn't want to play it again, so we moved on to Hansa.

In my original comment I wrote something about not really liking this game because of a bad experience at a fair in 2003, and that I didn't like the high price so that the game would probably only end up in my collection once the publisher liquidated his stock. Well, the publisher [i]did[/i] liquidate part of his stock the other day, so I was able to get this game at a discount of a whopping 75%. At that price, it is a simple and compelling abstract, easily one of Colovini's better designs and far better than the simple crap he is cranking out nowadays. Small chits in various denominations travel around a map; the objective is to get as many of your own kind on the map at the end of the game. You can augment their number by simple 'growth', or by travelling around, which can cause other people to lose their chits. The problem is that travel is a one-way street: once you travelled across one bridge, it is removed.

The rules have an appealing simplicity to them which despite my initial reservations lead to a good game. My rating has therefore improved considerably, especially because the 2P-variant listed on this site works just fine. However, I'm not yet so sure about the 3P game. I had the misfortune of getting caught in the crossfire of the other two players with the result that I was squeezed out of every town I gained a foothold in. And in another game, my fellow players by chance cooperated so well that I didn't stand a chance. According to 'JC' there is a way out of this death pit: go where the other players are not, and make use of the fact that players who use up a lot of tokens that way cannot easily defend themselves until they get those tokens back, i.e., are run off. I've tried very hard to put these ideas into practice, but it's not as easy as it looks. The experimentation continues...

RATING: 7.5
An abstract at heart, it is saved by amazing artwork and a theme inspired rulebook. No luck, yet full of conflict and variability. It can be great fun to either build your own influence or infiltrate another player's city with a well timed migrated student. From there, you can thwart their plans if you trigger a journey of the students before they do.

Still wrapping my head around this one. Felt uninteresting and arbitrary for the first third of the game, then things started clicking into place in my head; by endgame, I was starting to see how my actions influenced my opponents, and vice versa. Hoping the rabbit-hole keeps going down, though I suspect that if so it will only be satisfying playing vs. folks of similar experience level.

RATING: 7
Components: Great board, bridges, and tiles, with clever tile illustrations that are complex yet easy to identify.

Experience: A player's options are fairly simple and straight-forward, and the immediate consequences of a move are readily apparent, creating for a rather quick-moving game of area control. As I become more experienced and therefore strategic at the game, I can imagine that the game time will actually lengthen, and become a brain-burner, as many have called it. But for now, it's tense, and flows very smoothly as players build up power in certain villages, and watch as students spill over to other villages. There are opportunities for clever sacrifices, and tense attempts to dominate and lock certain villages.

This seems like a type of game I would like with all of the little manipulations that you can do but I think these games kind of turn me off when playing with more than 2.  This is probably due to the amount of change of position in between turns and the potential imbalance between the targets of players' aggression (why do I always get hurt more than everyone else?:*)  All that being said, I'd like to try this again before I etch that "6" in stone and I'd like to try even more the proposed two player variant - that might solve everything!

It took a little but of time to fully understand how expeditions work but by the first time it had happened, I felt I fully understood the game and was able to enjoy working out strategies. 

As the game goes on, decisions become simpler with fewer villages that may invade and fewer possible future moves to consider.

I was happy to be foiled by Ian making a futile attack against my village - purely to stop me attacking his. Though it was 'bad' for me, it showed a little more of the possible strategy.

The relatively simple rules and toys give birth to a large number of potential strategies - just like all the best games. I really want to replay this over and over, trying out different tactics to experience the different outcomes.

With 3 players, this becomes a more sedate game - less chaotic and easier to plan ahead with - since not as much happens outside your own turns.

I enjoy both, though they are very different in feel.

I think the greater potential for planning ahead in the 3-player game seems more appealing.

Either way, it still seems like a beautiful game. Multiple potential strategies. Like Go...

There's more to this game than I'm perceiving at the moment.  The first half has so many options that moves don't feel meaningful.  The second half feels so constrained that there doesn't seem to be much choice in the matter.  I think I'm missing something in the middle.  More later.

At first I thought this game wasn't very interesting.  Then I played it.  Boy was I wrong.  A very strategic game and a bit of a brain burner.  Plenty of opportunity to really burn your opponents (or get burned) so I don't expect to play this one with sensitive players (i.e. my wife ;) ).  I prefer 4-player for a nice mix of strategy & chaos.

There seems to be a good abstract game hidden somewhere in here, but the game did not hold my interest for as long as I thought it might.  Perhaps the turnoff was a tacky theme.  And the real question here does not seem to be why did they bother to try and give it a theme at all, but how on earth did nobody notice that the theme is completely daft and it doesn't fit.  Also, the graphic designer ought to have his eyes poked out with a stick.

This is an excellent strategic game. Have to set some ground rules prior to game start to head off analysis paralysis as there are many, many options that heavily depend upon the reaction of your opponents to your moves. Reminds me of chess with multiple players. Each turn, each player chooses one of three possible actions. That's it. But the depths of strategy are very, very deep.

A good mental challenge...and that's the only reason it gets a 6.  Is it really fun to play though?  I don't think I'd ever seek out a game of this.  I wouldn't mind playing it if my brain needed some excercise.  I could see dropping it to a 5 after a few plays as it doesn't capture my interest in any way.

The Bridges of Shangri-La is another poorly regarded game (with less than a 7.0 rating) that I played this month and found to be quite enjoyable. Like Clippers it is rather inexpensive to purchase right now. I got copies of both games for around $10, and consider them both to be very worth the price paid.

The Bridges of Shangri-La falls into the "theme is so pasted on it may as well be an abstract" category, which does not bother me but could potentially bother quite a few of you out there. You have been warned. Because of theme’s irrelevance I am not going to discuss it beyond saying that the general goal of the game is to get as many of your "masters" into as many villages as possible. To accomplish this you have one of three potential actions on your turn. The first one is to place a master in an empty spot on a board in a village where you already have a master. The second one is to play two tiles ("students") on top of already existing master tiles, no more than one on any given master. The third is to start a journey of the students, which is essentially having one village attack another village. Determining if the attack is successful is based on the relative quantity of tiles in each. If the attacker is successful, then defending tiles are displaced to make way for attacking student tiles of the same symbol. If it fails then nothing happens to the target village. Regardless of the results of the attack, the connection between the two villages is removed and any empty spots in the target village are filled with student tiles from the attacking village. This continues until no further attacks are possible and then the most master tiles on the board wins. 

The Bridges of Shangri-La encourages a series of alliances between the players, as it is difficult to launch an attack against another village unless another player helps you, as it is usually fairly easy to block another player by simply matching that player’s moves. This becomes doubly true when the third player also does not want this particular attack to happen. So in order to easily accomplish something you need support from another player. So the game essentially becomes a series of moves and counter-moves as individual players build up positions in the various villages in order to both establish their ability to start a journey of the students and to convince a second player that it is worthwhile to support their journey so that it will succeed. 

When we first played the game, we placed our pieces in an almost random way. It was not that we did not understand how the game worked, as it really is quite simple, it was simply difficult to visualize what results our moves would lead to. As we played, it became more and more apparent that the cascade of shifting majorities and new vulnerabilities caused by starting a journey of the students would open a great deal of strategic options for future play. 

I liked Bridges of Shangri La quite a bit, unfortunately it seems to be a particularly fragile game, and I suspect that, like Chicago Express, it will end up being particularly vulnerable to chaos caused by different skill levels. 

After the first play, I never felt a need to bring this to the table again. I sold it.

RATING: 5
Fast playing game of tile placement into various cities on the board.  Tiles come in seven flavours and players are trying to have the most tiles surviving at the end of the game.  Tiles can move between cities, setting up power struggles with the loser coming off the board.  Quite thoughtful and not bad at all.  Feels very pacey to play - a good thing.

Nice abstract game with good board positional movement and lots of different options as to whether to play a master or student tile or where to send your students on a journey to break a bridge and/or move your tiles to.

1 and 1/2 games played.

Bridges of Shangri-La is somewhat interesting. I liked better my second game played more than the first game played. The second time around, I knew the rules so that helped.

I find Bridges of Shangri-La a little abstract, dry. Kinda weird how the game works. Quite different than other games. Not into abstract games that much. Bits and board are nice. Not sure what is best to do in this game. I don't fully understand the strategies involved.

Another game might change the game's rating.

2015-07-28 : Well-designed fast-playing game with some fine tactical decision-making. The clear graphics and smooth gameplay elevate this from a mere "meh" game.

RATING: 7
A game of area majority and temporary alliances.  There are  only one of 3 actions you can take on your turn.  That sounds easy but there are a lot of decision that come from 3 choices.  So how does allies work and why are they only temporary?  Each area will usually house tiles belonging to multiple players.  When you're looking at majority you're not looking at it from any one players perspective you are looking at one area's number of tiles versus another area's tiles.  So, if you're looking to invade one area to another it helps when someone else has objectives that match your own so they can build up the area you plan on attacking with.  It's hard to read what people are going to do and that's what makes it interesting.  It's a relatively quick game with little downtime and it's also quite cheap to acquire at the moment.  Sadly it's a bit too abstract for my tastes. Give it a try.

Played 5+ times. This game is very dry, very ugly, and too strange for me to really enjoy on my first playing. With more playings under my belt, I find this game to be fascinating, but am unsure how much replayability it will have. It is a very clever game, and the rating could go up. It feels like a Knizia game to me almost. I expect dry and dull from Knizia, and dry and fun from Colovini, but this time I seem to have run across a Colovini design I simply don't enjoy much. Further playings required...ooooh! It's getting better! Very deep game. ((Copy from F; traded away.))

This game is very different from other games I own.

I particularly like the mechanic Of the Student's Journeys, where all students, even those of your opponents, travel in a group to the new village. 

Lots of opportunity for strategy and easy to overlook a problem brewing near one of your villages.  

Rules are easy and few.  Game lasts an hour or less.  Tiles look a little crude but I like the game board and the bridges.

RATING: 8
Nice bits, intriguing strategies and lots of turnarounds.  Not much missing from this abstract gem.  Students need to be coaxed into going where there the least damaging for your own colors.  If you can manage to get a few masters in early, you're set.  Oh and don't be afraid to sacrifice a few students to blow up the bridges that would let otherwise unwelcomed visitors use it.  Sacrifice is part of learning...

Great game.

A dry, no-luck abstract, pretty much what you'd expect from Colovini. It is mostly about creating positional advantages and encouraging other players to make the dirty work for you while at the same time protecting your assets. Shangri-La is a vicious game, and mistakes can cost you dearly.

Colovini often creates games based on a single mechanism. Often times they seem like nice enough ideas but barely sufficient to support an entire game on their own. What sets this game apart is that here, the single mechanic actually makes for a worthwhile game.

Yet to be seriously played (7/9/09). UPDATE: Finally get to play it, and as a four play abstract, I was very impressed.  The game was well worth the wait, and should be in the BGG Top 100. Look forward to playing it again (rating 8)(18/6/12). UPDATE: A memory review almost, components were of their time, but still something I want to keep (Rating 7.714, Jan 17)

I enjoyed this though I found the game quite obtuse.  It felt as new players you really just can't gauge the effects of your movement for the most part and you can really only hope for the best. It has an interesting abstract feel which I enjoy and it isn't like any other game I've played.  Points for being different and straightforward enough for anybody!  It was interesting to think about while playing even if I couldn't rely on thought alone to make the best moves. Overall, a decent first play but I wasn't really inspired to play it again anytime soon.

Fun abstract puzzle game. Easy to learn, hard to master - exactly like what a good abstract puzzle game should be. I also like the fact that it takes only 50-60 minutes to play but packs a good amount of excitement in that short time frame (watching bridges fall away one by one is awesome).

RATING: 7
I seem to be a Colovinist, as I have a hard time not liking anything this designer puts out.  Yes his games are very abstract, but they are clever, unique and for me feel much more fresh than dry.  In a sense Bridges is little more than another area control title, but the way in which territories are fought over, and the limitations applied to ones own advancement and recruitment make this game a wonderful strategic and tactical offering.  Finding balance in "defence" and "offence" are key, as it is the total value of control on the board not the value in each area that spawns victory.

After a 2nd two player game the allure of Bridges of Shangri-la has wained. It builds slowly with no apparent strategy except to distribute your tiles throughout the villages until an imbalance occurs that will likely trigger the students, like young Mormons, going on a mission to the (usually) weaker village. It isn't all that interesting or fun so I deem it unworthy of space on my crowded shelves.

An excellent 3 player Colovini, perhaps his best alongside Clans and Carolus Magnus. Temporary alliances with various players to maximize board position while the board continues to shrink. A constant balance between maintaining flexibility in the number of student types you have available and expending them to spread to new territories. Add on that a significant timing issue and it makes for a really elegant design.

First play was two players, removing the top three villages so these thoughts are very tentative.

PROS
-Beautiful artwork that enhances a pretty dry abstract. Likewise, the theme is unnecessary but so weird and cool. 
-Components are simple but quality, especially the wooden bridges. It would have been nice if the tiles had been ceramic instead of cardboard but they're still functional. 
-Simple rule set that gets you up and going quickly.
-Engaging and quick.

CONS
-Sometimes be a bit difficult to pick up tiles and move them without knocking over or displacing other tiles. Not a big deal, though, as the icons make it easy to put everything back.
-Need to try a four-player game but maybe there is too much chaos from turn to turn?

Very original game with no luck factor. It has the simplicity of design and the kind of tension found in Knizia's "Through the Desert": a lot to do and so little allowed per turn - and you are affected a lot by other players' moves. Isolating villages reminded me a bit of "Clans", another simple and good game by Colovini. Good artwork on the board, but the spots for the tiles do a lot to spoil it, with their unnecessary white backgrounds that really get in the way.

Colovini always has a knack to make rich games out of tying players together with rubber bands and telling them to run in different directions. Maybe the analogy is bad, but I feel that that's the intent -- in this luckless Euro-abstract, players are in constantly shifting collusive and competitive relationships in a multi-node space that is always shrinking (not so dissimilar to Clans).

The art is qwirky and fun, it's quick to explain and play. While I still prefer Carolus Magnus (due to its small infusion of luck into an otherwise luckless game) or Clans, due to its hidden goals, this delivers something that is nonetheless charming in its own way.

A pretty good multiplayer abstract, and a serious brain burner. I really enjoy the emergent diplomacy/cooperation/coercion aspect, wherein simply by placing guys you send messages of intent to other players. Also nice is the shrinking board, which ramps up the intensity at the end as everyone fights tooth-and-claw over the last dwindling scraps of space. I do think this is better than it gets credit for. After years of ignoring it, Bridges of Shangri-La is really starting to rise in my esteem.

The strategy decisions are not very different from T&E, but the different scoring system changes the way tha game feels. It's very,very political, as 2 schools can easily gang up on one.

About the theme: The theme is not as outlandish as some people think. It reminds me of the conflicts between Brahmin masters, going through ordeals in different holy sites. Read Buddah by Osamu Tezuka for a good exaple of this.
 Sure, the game would work with other themes, but at least the mechanics can work with the theme, unlike something like Cartagena

Fast playing game of tile placement into various cities on the board. Tiles come in seven flavours and players are trying to have the most tiles surviving at the end of the game.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (January 2012)

The game was very cheap so I bought it. I didn’t expect much from the game but it has some meaningful and hard decisions in it, a little of a brain burner (which is a plus for me). The game components are ok, the bridges are pretty nice although the sage tiles can be hard to handle sometimes. 

The theme is paper thin, only supported by the art. This is more an area control abstract game and I want to play it again soon. 

The rules are very easy to teach but the game has a lot of hard decisions. Another plus, the game plays quickly enough AND it has no luck. :D

I want to play it again, but I’m not in a hurry. When I played the game, I felt it was somewhat dull and boring and its theme (also boring) doesn’t help it a lot.

Theme? Not really. But in the abstract, this is a pretty good majority game. You spread your tokens mostly by running them along the road to neighboring villages. The catch is that after you do it, the road collapses, so timing your moves just right is key.

RATING: 7
A parasitic game very much in the Reiner vein of abstracts yet without the annoying bits of luck so often found therein. There is a nice pull between holding out in a village for the BIG move or moving quickly to seal off villages and block others. Yes the theme is pasted on but the bits/board are quite lovely.

In Bridges of Shangri-La Colovini succeeds in putting a working theme on a multiplayer abstract with no luck. If you don't like Colovini games, you won't like this one either. It's a game of positional play and capturing other players' counters. The game can get imbalanced if one player gets targeted repeatedly. Players need the skill to evaluate the board for a fully satisfying experience. To give a comparison: Bridges is for players that like Blokus with 4 players, it's not for the Eurogamer worker placement crowd.

I have to admit that I'm not the target audience for this sort of game.  I find most Colovini games a little abstract, and I almost get annoyed when asked to consider an often ludicrous theme.  The theme for this one really is one of the most awful pasted-on theme jobs ever that makes no sense.

That said, the game is interesting to play and definitely favors the more skilled player, as this is truly just an abstract.  With three players there may be some problems with balance, but I'm not sure of that, not having played with 4.  I wouldn't mind playing this game a little more, though if there was anyone with AP I would definitely avoid.  Fun for 45 minutes, but would be drudgery if it took longer.

Just a couple plays, but enough to tell me that this is a clever game.  There is no random element, but plenty of chaos from the other opponents.  Ultimately this isn't really my kind of game, but I could be talked into an ocassional play.

Obviously, this is really an abstract with a pasted-on theme, but who cares? The graphics are fresh and fun, the board is very pretty, and the wooden bridge tokens are great.  The very clever elevation of the game Dots into something non-trivial, for four players.  An excellent way to spend an hour or so.

This game definitely has a complex set of interactions, but the action-limited pace makes the game a bit more like Through the Desert (always wanting to do a bit more) than Tongiaki (so many possible interactions that it feels more chaotic and unpredictable).  Like TtD, larger numbers of players can definitely squeeze out a given player through coordination or unfortunate coincidence.  The game is definitely an analytical experience.

very dry and dull for me (and I'm an abstract fan).  didn't really see the point of it?  it just wasn't very fun to play or to solve it.  it seems all about trying to kick other players off each village while everyone just tries to do the same dull thing, so if that's the case, I'd prefer El Grande, Mammoth Hunters, etc...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Another area majority game which has some interesting concepts, but I still prefer other area majority games (ie El Grande) to this one.  On your turn you choose between 3 options:  place one master in a city where you have presence and there is an empty slot, place 2 students on top of 2 of your masters, or move all students from one city into another city where they may become masters if moving into a weaker city or eliminated if moving into a stronger city.  As well, when a move occurs, a bridge is destroyed.  Once all bridges are destroyed, the person with the most masters on the board wins the game.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting, highly abstract game of placement, spawning and hopefully well-timed movement.  There is a definite tension to each decision and determining one's opponents' most likely moves is critical.  Of course, as with most perfect information multiplayer games I could see the possibility of there being kingmaker and bash-the-leader problems.  The end game can also become a rather dry exercise in number crunching

Somewhat interesting abstract. Yes, abstract as I think the theme gets in the way. In fact I joked that a military theme would work much better. Placing masters would be generals parachuting into a city. Recruiting students would be recruiting troop. Sending students to the next town would be attacking with your troops. The bridges then collapse as the generals burn the bridges to prevent retreat.There, isn't that much better?

The dynamic of this game is different from any other in our collection; I can't figure out whether I love it for that reason or for its own merits - probably a combination. I have a great time with this game; I consistently win or place highly, though I don't feel I'm getting all there is to get about it, which makes it intriguing. There's plenty to watch and examine while waiting for other players to take their turns. I like the abstraction involved, as well as the forced interplay among players. I often choose to piggyback on other players' upcoming moves and strategies - maybe opportunists have an edge in this game? ;)

RATING: 5
The definitive proof that abstract multiplayer games without any element of chance are just not my cup of tea. What makes it definitive is that the cleverness of the puzzle that Shangri-La sets up makes we want to like it very, very much, but a third and probably final failed attempt to enjoy playing it showed that we’re not made for each other.

My complaint is this: in a game with a serious, no-luck strategic challenge, it should not be so ridiculously easy for the other players to interfere with (read: cripple) your plans as is here. A lot of the wipe-out moves we witnessed in our last game were not even conscious attacks, they were completely incidental. Maybe this is a personal peeve, but while I can and do enjoy game sessions where the dice or even a devious opponent destroy me, it really irks me when careful planning gets pulverized by moves from other players that were not even aimed against me.

Long story short: I’d very much appreciate an adaption of Shangri-La’s design to a two-player game.

Okay, this is a good game, but not a great game.  After my first play, I finished the game under-enthused.  It just didn't wow me the way other games have, but I will admit that the board and bits are exceptional.  Subsequent games have me feeling better about buying it, but it still falls flat with most of the group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Has a little bit of a boxing problem and it reminds me of ko threats in Go.  It's all about establishing a position just a little bit stronger than the players in the villages around you.  I would really like to play it again before making a final judgement, though.

01/11/11 Played a three-player game. 
I liked The Bridges of Shangri-La, once I got the hang of what I should be doing. To me it was pretty much an abstract wargame, so the tactics were familiar. The graphics and components I'll charitably call "serviceable"; they'll never win any awards, but they get the job done. I found it to be a challenging game considering the simple mechanics (there's only three things you can do), but a bit dry. I look forward to seeing how it plays with four players.

RATING: 7
I like this game! Very original and such astonishingly simple rules for a game with depth. Hard to win though. Like in other Colovini's (Clans or Cartagena) you need to take advantage of the actions of your opponents to win, preferably without them realizing that ;-).

Very good game.  Multiple interactions possible.  One must choose wisely in order not to block oneself in a later turn.  The game is surprisingly tight.  I really loved the game lenght, which is ideal (40 minutes) for this type of game.

I've heard a number of complaints related to the abstract nature of this game, but I thought the strategic and thought-provoking aspects of it really made it enjoyable for me and everyone I played with. It really involved a lot of tricky decisions, and we constantly felt like we were learning new strategies and intricacies of the game. I worry that it wouldn't play very well when the players had different levels of experience, which is a big problem in my typical game group, but it was a very enjoyable experience that we looked forward to having again.

Well you can tell it's a Leo Colovini game.  I feel Clans and Carlos Magnus are better.  This is a very, very abstract game.  Amusing to play, and adds variety to my collection.  Plus I own the uberplay edition, which I know Uberplay no longer is around.  So, I'll keep it even if it won't see much action.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simple but clever game mechanisms. Place and spread your markers while destroying the bridges behind you. When all villages are "closed", the game ends. Perhaps a bit difficult to catch up but perhaps experienced players will learn to bash the leader. Once again, Colovini shows that he's an underrated designer who continuously delivers new and inventive mechanisms.

Une seule partie de jouée (à 3 joueurs, avec notre fille). J'ai vraiment hâte de pouvoir y rejouer, à trois ou quatre joueurs. Notre fille a pris plusieurs décisions assez douteuses, ce qui l'a rapidement écarté d'une possibilité de gain. 

Ce jeu semble exiger que les joueurs observent minutieusement les possibilités adverses (et non pas seulement sess propres possibilités) pour fonctionner optimalement. Ce feeling rejoint un peu celui que j'ai pour [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25420/ur][u]Ur[/u][/url]...

This game has a 'sideways' feel to it that I'm still trying to figure out.  I like the game well enough, but it is just a bit too odd to bring to the table very often. Perhaps it is the fact that it is a bit taxing (mentally) but in a repetative fashion that grows a little tiresome as the game goes on.
For taxing I prefer something that has more variety in the choices one must make. Perhaps I would be much more excited if the board were smaller and the game more brief.
Bottom line: Shangri-La is fun and will be added to 'the rotation', but certainly won't be making the table very often.

Powerful stuff - another wonderful example of the tension that can be achieved with a shrinking board. As in Clans, the game it obviously draws from, the movement of all players at once contributes a lot to the depth of the game. While in Clans the stones are distributed at random, here the setup is up to the players - a very careful distribution of the tiles is needed. Furthermore, (not) placing the right tile at the right moment during the game becomes more and more dire until the end. 

Two players can enjoy this game as well, either playing with two colours each or ignoring the three top villages for quicker play.

RATING: 7.5
Gioco abbastanza veloce ma che richiede massima concentrazione e valutazione. Secondo me la tattica migliore, come in Medina o Risiko, è quella dell'attesa potenziando i propri territori. Il gioco è strategico, ma al tempo stesso semplicissimo da imparare e giocare. A seconda dei partecipandi o delle strategie adottate la partita può avere andamenti differenti. Da provare.

Leo Colovini doesn't get a lot of love around here and it's hard to understand why. Everytime I play one of his games I'm impressed with his ability to create ingenious but simple mechanics that make for truly unique games. And, he's able to keep them quick and simple to explain! 

Bridges of Shangri-La is one of Leo's best games! It has very few rules, it's simple to explain but it's very hard to play well. And it plays fast! What's not to like? 

Players have to set themselves up in a way that forces other players' moves to help them. In a way, it's similar to games like Wabbash Cannonball.

1st playing with 4. I'm not fond of games with all the information visible; I like secrets and surprises, not chess like gaming experiences. So this did little for me: experiencing initial confusion as to the consequences of my actions and what plans my opponents were forging; I'd admit there was tension when I was concerned my plan of stopping a mass exodus would be thwarted. With so many options open to me I was lost, and I relied on intuition. Only when there was only about the left side of the board to resolve that actions became limited and clearer. Sadly the theme was too dull to draw me in, and scoring status too fractured and too scattered to evaluate, so not a game I'd to wanting to play again.

Dry - yes. Silly theme - yes.  This is Colovini's best game to date.  The depth is greater than most other Euro's.  The game has the feel of Go and in many ways, plays like Go. There is even a touch of AH's Titan in the generation of units. The best way to play is one-on-one. Repeated plays are required to obtain any proficiency.  This should have been an Alea game.

[b]Comment:[/b] This is an interesting abstract game where you have a number of different towns where you place tokens. On your turn you either add one new type of token, duplicate 2 tokens or send all the duplicated tokens of you and your opponents to attack the city next door. When you do, the bridge breaks behind you so the city of origin can't be attacked back from the same direction. What this amounts to is having players work together to reinforce certain places or expand other places, but in the end whoever has the most token spots wins.

I like abstract games, but I love the tension in this game. I also love the 2 player varient that someone posted here. Someone complained that the game was too chaotic, but I would have to disagree. Plays like a simple wargame that would have you jump from bunker to bunker. In fact I think that theme would have worked better because it would attract the crowd that would actually enjoy this game. Or maybe an ancient civilization game. The gameplay matches that theme a lot better than Tigris and Euphrates.

RATING: 9
An abstract strategy game for 3-4 players. Keeping in line with the theme of a Shangri-la, the game is non-confrontational. Each player represents the leader of a separate tribe. Each tribe has 7 kinds of masters and students. The goal of the game is to have each master train a student, who in turn goes to a different village and becomes a master there. The player who has most masters at the end of the game wins.

It takes even veteran gamers at least one full game to fully appreciate this elegant game's depth.

An interesting area control type game. Fairly abstract, but the simple rules belie a depth of strategy you can follow. 
The mechanics allow for several paths, grow vertically with students and overtake your neighbors at the risk that your pieces may not score, grow horizontally add new masters at the risk of being replaced. Couple with the mechanic that a connections can only be used once, illustrates the options available,

No luck or hidden information involved, strong player interaction, huge number of options, it seems just the sort of game I would like, but for some reason I haven't put into words yet, it lacks the 'fun factor' for me.  I have a strong hunch it would play better with 2 or 4 players than 3, but I may be wrong about that.  I'd play it again, if there were no other new games to try, and I might like it better after more plays.

Players take on the roles of leaders of a specific tribe. There is a battle raging over the empty villages of the land and players must quickly fill those villages with their tribal leaders. As players migrate tribal leaders from one village to the next, they must not become too weak or they risk losing leaders to opposing tribes. The ultimate object of the game is to have the most leaders on the board at the end of the game.
It is an abstract game with many options and tense until the end.

Plays great with 4; don't know about 3.  It's simple enough kids can play with adults, yet deep enough to keep you coming back.  Recommended.

Actually very abstract area majority game, but somehow I still get drawn by the theme, since it is  my most favourite (secluded Himalaya). It has some nice decisions, especially "attacking" another village just to destroy the link (bridge) is a neat aspect of the game.

Have not played  this in some time. I am interested to see how this holds up today.

Update: This is still quite fun, better than I remembered. This rather abstract strategy game is really something different to all the Euros and thematic games I usually play currently. Even though I have already played it a few times, I still do not know how to play this well. Take this as a good or a bad sign...

A very simple rule set (takes only about 15 minutes to learn) but has tremendous depth in strategy. That being said, players won't "get" the strategy until after their first game (as is often the case with most games but seems to be more apparent here). Not a bad thing, however, and if a seasoned player is present, he can explain some of the tactics a newcomer may wish to employ to give them a more secured foothold. Still, slightly cumbersome at first. Stick with it - you'll find a very challenging game here.

Terribly dry abstract strategy colovini game. The theme is daft and the graphic design is absolutely horrendous (looks almost like an advanced prototype).

Players place masters on the board and use them to spawn students who them move across bridges in order to gain further control in another city. Bridges are broken in their wake and the game ends when there are two bridges left.

Gameplay seems to favour good opening moves as players are fairly balanced at startup. Poor play can lead to kingmaking.

Players prone to AP should avoid this one.

A lot of "thinkyness" involved in this abstract/area control game but it is a welcomed challenge. I think if the (blah) cardboard chits had somehow been wood/plastic or even a 3D marker, that bit of "eye-candy" would push this to into the upper echelon of the top abstract games.

There seems to be a very wide variety of different tactics one could use playing this game.  Also, the potential for diplomacy is high depending on who you play with.  There's also more conflict than your everyday Euro game.  Very simple and elegant but still a bit of a brain burner:  there are tons of potential moves each turn, especially at the beginning of the game.  UPDATE:  I'm liking this game more and more, especially with three people.  It has proven quite a hit at my weekly game group, although there have been a couple of detractors.

This game is a crazy mix between a deterministic system and the free will to buck it.  It is a nice brain burner, but as cool as it is, it can be a bummer as it doesn't take much to assess everyone's positions and ultimately who isn't going to win.  Still, though there is a charm to it.  Perhaps it is that there is a wonderful  back and forth between alliances as you spread across the board. I'm want to describe the game experience as both miserable and fascinating.  I wanted to play this again immediately after my first game.

UPDATE: But I've never wanted to play it again afterward.

Nice abstract game, but there is a nice little bit of theme thrown in.  I do really like how the bridges go away, especially in playing defense by moving an inadequate number of apprentices just to have the bridge gone.

Colovini has designed a number of games that scale well.  The Bridges of Shangri-La is one of them, as is clear from the votes for best player count on the game's page.  It's a great 3p or 4p game of simple rules and complex decisions.  Paying attention to the changing map and positioning yourself well is important.  Key to this is setting up others to help you and hurt your opponents.  With more plays, this game might be my favourite Colovini design.  It cements his place as one of my favourite designers in the old euro school.

I give this rating after 1 playing, which I managed to win somehow.  I'm sure with the wrong people this game is going to cause serious Analysis Paralysis, but we didn't have a problem as we all understood that there is no *right* move and you can't really plan too far ahead as the board can change too quickly.  This has an interesting, unique mechanic which will either drive you nuts if you let it, or you can just go with the flow and enjoy the ride.

Very clever yet simple mechanics, and seems like you need to communicate with the other players non-verbally to build alliances without the others catching on.  Very fun and finished in less than an hour.  But what ruined the game for me were the board & bits: I was constantly having to check if a stack had 1 or 2 counters -- couldn't these be Icehouse pyramids instead, or something obvious?  Also the bridges get lost in the board artwork in low light.  Knocked my rating down for the cheap counters and board which both distract from focusing on the strategy of this otherwise fascinating game.

Abstract and simple yet thematic and strategic Eurogame. The main mechanisms are tile placement and movement in order to gain area influence. The board is divided up in to a number of villages, each with the same set of seven symbols. Players have to move their tiles matching the symbols onto and across the board in order to gain victory points. There's a surprising amount of conflict here, especially for a Euro, as players attempt to move their tiles into a village at the expense of their opponents'. This is a far deeper game than it is generally given credit for.

This is a neat game of attack and defense. I usually explain it with a monk university theme.  The students going off to become teachers at the monk universities of the next town.

CONCEPT. Not a totally bad, monks leave temples on journies. OK so far that is ok, but then he will marry another major theme/mechanic onto this [DANGER HERE]. 
MECHANICS/THEME. You cross a bridge: it closes permanently. This is very interesting and worthy of study, but it's like the game doesnt know if it wants to be abstract or something related to monks. It has too many mechanics viz: the whole school/control/master/color thing is too much. EIther just work on making something out of bridge that close. Or work on something about a school of monks. It's just frustrating...

ERGONOMICS. I found it hard to track stuf on the board. There were several rules issues, but probably forgiveable given how much stuff there is here. And it takes too long for this sort of thing e.g. 2 hrs???
STRATEGY. Maybe there is. Havent playe enuf.
NARRATIVE. Some for sure with the Bridges. but surely nothing in the way of history or monks or religion.
DRAMA. dont recall much but will have to play again. 
BRAIN ENGAGEMENT. A little bit in a wasteful fashion;  two hours or so of this is too much as the abstract thinking is quite repetitive and didnt tap into anything like psychological or social other types of thinking.

This game is an excellent brain burner.  As with many of my favourite games it does not take long to explain, but may take forever to master.  It plays differently with different opponents because all the information is know, it is only what the people do that make the difference.  Usually, I prefer a little luck in a game, but the way pieces move around in this game certainly feels like luck (or more often, bad luck) by the time it gets back to your go again.

Le visuel de ce jeu est affreux, pour ne pas dire pénible. Mais il se joue rapidement et offre une gestion de majorité assez différente. Pas mauvais, mais pas wow non plus.
Aux amateurs de Colovini, ça ne lui ressemble pas comme jeu: le thème est plus présent qu'habituellement et les mécanismes sont assez différents de ce qu'il fait habituellement.

Typical Colovini design. The mechanics work fine, but this is deathly dry and abstract. This is the kind of game that, despite a pretty solid design, blends into the pack and tends to stay on the shelf. Just nothing exciting here ...

RATING: 5
The first thing one notices about Bridges of Shangri-La is its gorgeous board painting.  But a different art director must have commissioned the ugly, ugly tokens that smother the board.  It's the Zen-like movement of these pieces that becomes tidal and hypnotic, but the ruleset that acheives this flow is an arbitrary morass. The Bridges of Shangri-La is soothing to watch and play, but ramping up on it before every game makes it barely worth the experience.

This is an interesting area control game, but feels very abstract and also seems very difficult to catch up with the leader if you fall behind.  It does create some nice tension though as the board effectively shrinks over the course of the game.

My third Colovini (after Europa and Carolus Magnus). Not sure what I think. Is it [i]opaque[/i]? I don't really think so but maybe it's a matter of degree. I'm not content with my understanding of the strategy. Seems quite tactical though I see that you should try to diversify your master types (there are seven) lest you run out of counters.

It seems like final scores are close and relative position changes a lot. You can conspire against a leader but he won't then be leader for long. That is kind of annoying because it means targeting a specific player can't be a matter of even medium-term strategy.

The game also makes me question how thin the line is between leader-bashing and shared incentives slash emergent alliances.

To summarize Shangri-La I'd compare it to Tigris & Euphrates, in that there are several "suits" involved in complicated battle resolution, and there can be good reason to start a battle that will seem to "lose." You're trying to maximize your distinct count of city+suit combinations which is thankfully easy to count up. A given "battle" between two cities can only be executed once, and the game clock is based on this fact.

Players take on the roles of leaders of a specific tribe. There is a battle raging over the empty villages of the land and players must quickly fill those villages with their tribal leaders. As players migrate tribal leaders from one village to the next, they must not become too weak or they risk losing leaders to opposing tribes. The ultimate object of the game is to have the most leaders on the board at the end of the game.
It is an abstract game with many options and tense until the end.

Based on 1 play (3P) Game can be explained in one minute,but requires some nice tactical/strategic thinking. A lot of fun for planners. The Game could suffer a bit from AP, repetitive gameplay and luck (between players of equal strength).

Tentative rating after one play. This one might go up. A true multiplayer abstract that works really well. There's a lot of nuance in timing, specifically trying to set up incentives for others to do the move you want, but would rather add students or masters elsewhere to further your cause.

My only disappointment is how long it took to table this game.

RATING: 4
In our first (and only) game, we played aggressively, and forced the creation of lots of villages with very few masters.  Halfway through the game, we discovered the need to build up more masters before travelling, but it seemed to be too late to make much of a difference.  It's primarily a boxing game, where you're trying to keep everything in balance, but there's so much on the board that it's difficult to figure out where to play, and when.  Not my thing, but I can see other people enjoying it.

A nice little area influence game where your moves often involve helping others. You move groups of students from city to city trying to overtake the next city, meanwhile burning bridges. It is important to pay attention what the other players may do as their choices can affect your future tremendously.

Very abstract, very dry (is that redundant?). Not a family game, IMHO, as the decision tree is way too broad. It is also unpleasantly counterintuitive, characteristic of many Colovini games (for me). None of these are faults, but together they make up a game I'm just not altogether inclined to play.

This isn't exactly a [i]pretty[/i] game, but it's a very interesting zero-luck abstract.  Dare I say it, "elegant".  There's lots of direct, cutthroat player interaction so having a good strategy is very important.

It's best with four players but is still good with three.   Even though it doesn't say it on the box or in the rules, this also works well with two players if you simply block off the three cities at the top of the board to tighten things up a bit.

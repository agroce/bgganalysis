My wife was very "meh" on the theme, but she gave it a shot at Dice Tower Con 2014 and I was surprised to see she bought it for me! First impression after a 5 player game was that it was a smart decision. I was always intrigued by the theme. The worker placement mechanic is unique and offers lots of interaction for a Euro. Fun times.

UPDATED 10-10-14: Bumped it to a 10.

UPDATED 7-13-16: Dropped back to a 9. I'm not sure I love it as much as I once did, but I still really, really like it.

RATING: 5.5
Generally thematic worker placement game about building uranium and/or plutonium bombs.

It's a typical worker placement game, with the following 2 exceptions: 1) as an action, you need to recall back your workers (similar to Tournay, you don't get them back automatically, so this creates some occasional interesting decisions), and 2) you get additional extra placements on your own personal board where you will have built buildings, allowing for potential sequential multiple placements.  You have options such as acquiring more workers (there are some with minor special abilities such as engineers and scientists), acquiring money (needed to build bombs, buy buildings, acquire resources such as yellowcake/uranium/plutonium), acquiring plutonium, uranium, yellowcake, acquiring bomb plans, building up your military strength, attacking other players, spying on them (using their buildings), and constructing bombs.  All of the points in the game are through the construction of bombs.

The buildings are typically upgrades of all of the available actions on the board.  Money is very tight and essential.  Workers seem plentiful, but more is always better and you can also acquire more than your allotment by hiring temporary contract workers.  You can play an arms race and be aggressive or not (games play very differently depending on the style of players involved or the synergy of the buildings that a player has).  The game ends "sudden death" with the first player to meet the point scoring requirement (points are ONLY scored through bomb building, which is multi-step process).  Nice artwork and very clear rulebook.  A very solid first design.

This is a really good worker placement game.
The Theme is well integrated. plays in about 2 hours unless you have people prone to AP. i that case i have seen games draw out to 3 hours+ (one of my games went well over 4 hours)  but this isn't the norm.

It can be confrontational, with airstrikes and espionage in addition to the regular taking spots other people wanted.

love it

Juego muy fácil de reglas y entretenido de colocación trabajadores, pero con unos toques de interacción directa que le quedan fenomenal, además de la indirecta de estos casos. Quizá la forma de puntuar no guste a algunos. Azar muy poco, de las cartas de edificios y bombas que salgan. Un señor juegazo. Las pequeñas expansiones, le dan un toque diferenciador interesante, aunque bastante asimétrico y hay algunas naciones y personajes mucho más poderosos que otros y pueden romper bastante el equilibrio del juego, a falta de probarlas más. Y lo de las fabricas de misiles es hacer el mal x el mal jaja
Juego diferente, original y encima escala bien! Probado a diferente número de jugadores y es distinto pero no desmerece!

I quite like many of the worker placement mechanics and the theme of the game. It looks nice, too. The only thing I didn't like was the sudden ending. First you have just a few of points and then all of sudden you pull off a move to take an enormous leap for an instant victory. Thematically it makes sense but for the dramatic arc if the game it would have been better if victory points were awarded in smaller steps.

Didn't seem like there were enough actions to take. Also, some pairs of bombs can win while other combinations require 3 or more. Just seems to be who gets lucky with the bombs.

I Kickstarted this game, and received it recently. I'm in love with it! The mechanics in it are simple enough to teach, and in a way it reminds me of Power Grid. The gameplay is fast though, and it's the first game that actually went UNDER the recommended time during the first play through with a full house.

The unique worker placement mechanism makes this game quite interesting.  Air strikes seem a bit... overpowered in a 2p game, but they're simple enough to leave out.

I probably shouldn't like this as much as I do.  There's nothing really new here: bunches and bunches of worker placement.  But the game has a lot going for it: incredible production values, amazing art, a good feeling of progression, meaningful escalation, and it has a lot shoved in a smallish box.  I really dig this game!

RATING: 7.5
+ Excellent use of theme; The tension of racing to build your bombs adds to the excitement of the game.
- The bombing and subsequent negotiating can get to be a bit much for me at times.


Why it's previously-owned:
The loose-ness with which players could gang up on a single player, whether for legitimate reasons or not, really soured me on this one.  Definitely had very cool mechanics outside of that, but it was enough to make me let this one go.
This got traded for Saint Malo.

I have mixed thoughts about this one. I think I did well, but I don't think I "earned" it. I got lucky with a couple of buildings. Interactivity was pretty low (Once we got espionage right), and it just felt like a race game.

I thought the theme was fun, although there were some parts that didn't really fit with the Race-to-build-bombs theme. I mostly ignored the whole bomber/airstrike track, because I felt like if i fought somone, I'd weaken them while making it so people not involved in the battle were pulling ahead.

The biggest thing, is that apart from a unique theme, I'm not sure this game wins the "table-time-death match". If I'm at the game shelf, and deciding what to play, and I'm looking at this game, Troyes, and Age of Empire, this game doesn't ever win.

A very intuitive medium weight worker placement game.

I like the mechanics used with the worker placement in this game. I'm not very experienced in the genre, but I'm aware of the new things introduced here and appreciate them.

I like the play time for this at 2 hours. It doesn't overstay and I don't feel like it ended too quickly. It starts to wrap just as the engine is cranked up. The rate of escalation in the gameplay is a rewarding feeling. Very well designed. We've only played it at 2 player, and I imagine it will require some different strategies with a higher player count given the plutonium vs uranium bomb cards as well as reduced bomb end game target.

Another game with 'take that' actions, which I am a fan of. It keeps me engaged in what the other player(s) are doing and keeps me on guard. I've been the victim more often than not, but I enjoy it. There is a risk/reward for it, and it feels warranted in this game both strategically and thematically.

I've yet to win this game, and I still love it.

It's certainly a very good game; but there's nothing at all innovative about it. If you've played any worker placement/engine building game, then you've already played The Manhattan Project with a different theme. Yes, people talk about how vicious and cutthroat it can be with the airstrikes and espionage elements; but it is so easy to either avoid such things or quickly recover from them, that the game ain't anywhere near as cutthroat as you might believe. Carson City has a far better version of "take that" in a worker-placement game. (Incidentally, if you dislike cutthroat games, The Manhattan Project shouldn't bother you too much.)

I have two significant complaints: one, it's the most fiddly game I have ever played; and two, it was cheaply produced. Too much material was crammed into a small space. The best example of this is the uranium and plutonium tracks: it would have made a LOT more sense to have uranium and plutonium cubes.

As a disclaimer, I've only played this once.  But from that one play, I don't see the appeal.  The game mechanics are pretty much terrible across the board - while they are interesting enough, the whole pick-up-and-return worker mechanic means that in the early game you have good decisions but in the late game you are just dropping everything on your player board, taking some vaguely useful action on the main board, and then waiting for two more go-rounds so you can act again.  There's player interaction, sure, but it's pretty much "hope you don't get attacked first, and hope you don't attack someone first because if you do your fighter level is down and now you get blown up too".  And combat is the only way the game even pretends to let you slow down a leader.

Bleh.

Just played our second full game, and this time we used all the game mechanics.   We bombed others, spied on others and built both types of bombs.   Everyone used a different strategy, partially forced by circumstance.  It did take three hours for four players, but the time just flew by.    Can't wait for the next one.

Manhattan Project might be yet another worker placement game, but at least it scores for an original theme: building nuclear bombs.  It has reasonable fidelity to that theme as well.  There are no mechanics that leave you wondering what on earth they represent.  It is also  state of the worker placement art, with three varieties of worker, a whole turn spent retrieving placed workers, and even a common supply of contractors (one use workers in each of the three varieties).

Manhattan Project is yet another engine-building game.  Yet it throws spanners in the works of your perfect plan by introducing espionage (someone else may be using that facility that you carefully saved up for) and bombing raids that can put your engine out of action. While I'm generally in favour of any form of player interaction, I do wonder about the air war in this game. In the two games I have played we have all been wary of it.  However, I suspect the potential for setting off a chain of air attacks that bombs everywhere flat and significantly lengthens a game that's already long enough.

Another concern relates to strategic variation.  You always want a large workforce, a source of yellow cake (raw nuclear material) and the capacity to convert that into uranium and plutonium. You always want to reach the vp target by building as few bombs as possible.

The fifties cartoony artwork is a delight and production quality is also really good.  The rules were an easy read and left us with no questions.

Nice light-medium weight worker placement game with a well-implemented, cool theme about making nuclear bombs. The rules are clear and easy enough to learn. I also like the retro artwork.

Well, it wasn't quite as good as I had hoped or expected.  It is not clear unilateral air strikes ever makes sense, and while the theme seems very compelling in the abstract, I'm not sure how well everything hangs together.  I definitely should try it a few more times.  I thought for sure I'd like it more than Lords of the Waterdeep, but at this point that is not the case.

An interesting exercise in purchasing people and and building an engine, with the ultimate goal of developing nuclear weapons.  As a euro, I was impressed at how thematic it was, but the game just never really spoke my language.  Loads of options but many opportunities to seriously disadvantage one player - who is never able to recover.  Slightly too long to be enjoyable.

I'm starting to think worker placement just isn't my style  of game.

This has grown on me.  I like the theme and I like the way they implemented direct confrontation in a thematic way.  I also like having to decide when to take a turn to retrieve workers.

RATING: 6
This is an interesting case of a worker placement game having too many workers for my tastes.  And I never thought I would feel that way about a worker placement game since I do LOVE getting extra workers in all worker placement games. 

The idea here seems to be to enjoy powering up long combos on your turn, with your unlimited placements on your buildings, such that essentially, each player trusts that the other players are using their 25 workers properly on all their buildings.  Way too many workers to have to watch for my tastes!  I trust you, go ahead and do all that.  Then, at some point, somebody gets jealous of all the combos that another player is reeling off with their buildings and bombs them or takes them over via espionage.  

From a game design point of view, perhaps bombing and espionage were incorporated to allow unlucky players to catch up to a player who, through the luck of the card draw, happened to be able to purchase an extremely powerful building early in game.  Does bombing and espionage, however, feel like a fun game mechanic to play with?  Not so much for me, but then again, I am not a war gamer.

Bottom line, I have no desire to play this game again, though I do respect the design and all the thematic work that went into the game, so gotta give it a 6 at best.

RATING: 9
The best worker placement game so far. 
The three best features in this game are:
1) No 1st player space (that seems to be mandatory in most other worker placement games). Always a problem if you happened to sit to the right of the player that is very keen on being 1st. That it should matter in what order you sit around a table is ludicrous.
2) Damage other players building if their engine is going at full speed and yours is still starting up
3) Use spies to use other players building instead of buying your own.

Highly recommended!

I'm not going to rate this one yet, as I've only played it once, but that one play through was really fun. The theme is fantastic, and every action available on the board I felt really ties into that theme. The contractor mechanic was nice (I hadn't encountered it before), the air strikes were a neat way to disable an opponents building, and the race to build your bombs before you yourself were bombed to oblivion by your opponents was really fun. I'm looking forward to playing this one again and to try out the Nations expansion as well.

Manhattan Project combines worker-placement and engine-building mechanics to produce a unique euro where players race to obtain victory points. But it's also a euro that is quite interactive as players can use and bomb your own facilities. And because of this interactive nature, this is a game where you don't necessarily want the best cards (other players may bomb them) and one where you must carefully time when you return your own workers (other players may use your cards and disrupt your engine). 

Overall, this is one of those games that I find fascinating but not necessary one I crave to play. At higher player counts the game suffers from meta-gaming and king-making; and if you find yourself a victim to this popularity contest, it can be very difficult to recover. With two-players, king-making/meta-gaming isn't a concern but the game can be absolutely devastating if a player makes a mistake and it often develops in a wonky way. Truth be told, the devastating possibilities don't bother me since the game has few random elements and they can be mitigated. But the two-player experience simply doesn't flow in a satisfactory way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The components are nice (even if the cards are bit too small), the artwork is nice and the theme is certainly unique. The game is easy to understand and flows very well. It does suffer from a dominate strategy - because it is a worker placement (i.e. action selection) with easily obtained worker with no subsequent upkeep costs, the key to the game to always get more workers. Always. Get a university ASAP and always first play a guy on the worker portion of the board. Anybody who falls behind here will surely loose the game.

A játék első felében csupa pozitív élményem volt, viccesek az emberkék meg a pogácsák, ötletes a kémkedés és a bábuk menedzselése, a játék nagyon tematikus, nem az a "tucat-worker placement", öröm vele játszani!... de a közepétől kezdett kicsit mechanikus lenni, és van két dolog, ami megöli szerintem: az egyik a győzelem bekövetkezésének módja, ami bár történelem hű, de... mégse tudom tolerálni. Fél órás játéknál elmenne, de 2 órásnál nem. Ugyanis bármelyik pillanatban bekövetkezhet, és kiegyenlített partinál szinte lehetetlen megjósolni, hogy épp ki csinálja meg a győztes robbantást, hacsak nincs nagyon jó memóriája valakinek, bár még akkor se tudhatja tutira, kinél milyen értékű és típusú bombák vannak... Egy partijátékban ez elmenne, de ez nem az! A végső pontszám így persze mit sem mond, mert lehet, hogy 0 pontja lesz olyannak is, akinek már készen állt az 50+ pontja és csak a bejelentésre várt. (Emiatt nincs is sok értelme a pontszámoknak, csak az a lényeg, ki nyert...)
A másik ami nem tetszik, az a bombázás: bármikor nullára lehet bombázni egy gyengébb arzenálú játékost (ráadásul még konzultálni is lehet egymással ez ügyben, ami nem illik ehhez a műfajhoz szerintem). Ez is tematikus, mégsem tetszik, mert ez is egyik pillanatról a másikra történik.
Kár érte, mert csomó jó ötlet van benne, de ezektől kicsit komolytalan szerintem.
Dicsértem az elején a bábuk kezelését (mindenki egyénileg dönt, hogy mikor szedi vissza őket, nincsenek rögzített körök): ennek is van azonban egy hátránya: szélsőséges esetben előfordulhat, hogy egy közös mezőt sosem használhat valaki.
Fontos még megemlíteni, hogy a Kártyagyár kivitelezésében nagyon szépre sikerült a játék!

Absolutely love the theme..A worker-placement game with relatively a lot things happening in parallel that can screw with you if you just focus on just one thing, but with a clear definition of victory that is open to anyone  at any given time, so that you now how close or far away you are relatively to the other players. Truly a very solid game where even loosing might be enjoyable (which is hard to say for games of this category)

Initial rating -- Single play. Based on one three player game, there are interesting ideas here, but I didn't feel particularly immersed while playing this, and the espionage and air raid systems felt out of whack.

Update -- After reading the rules, the person who explained them got some items wrong, so I'd like to try again.

This is the definition of a euro-trash game. There is worker placement and specialization - which I very much liked, and there is also the ability to bombard your opponents, thus impeding their buildings.
I saw many good mechanics but none great. I do not know why I didn't like the game more. I certainly did not like the end condition. Perhaps if it was a bit tighter - harder - it could limit my options and thus become more strategic. Anyhow, it's not a bad game.

Manhattan Project is a "tempo" worker placement game: on your turn, you can place as many workers as you want/can (one on the main board, the others on your onuccupied buildings or, with the espionage action, in other players' unoccupied buildins).
This is a cool concept, that has been used a few months later also by Tzol'kin (together with the awesome gears) in a much better and more developed way. I suppose there is a difference after all between a kickstarter game from a debutant, and a game tested and developed by CGE and Vlaada Chvatil...

Anyway, Manhattan Project is quite cool and is packed with interesting choices, has an awesome graphic presentation and production value (even if the workers of different colors are somewhat difficult to tell apart... and I am not colorblind!) and is full of interesting concepts.

There's a couple of things keeping it short of being great, however: some main board actions are definitely better than others (espionage!), and the cool (on paper) attack mechanic is both a welcome addition to the genre and a dangerous and not very fitting addition to the genre (in the way it is implemented). I have also some reserves on the points for the bombs: a couple of plutonium bombs after testing one are usually enough to win.

In conclusion, this is a game I would like to play again because I quite liked it and I want to refine my judgment. I had high expectations, but while many were met, something felt a little wrong and less-than-ideally developed...

Initial Impression: The artwork in this game lends to the thematic element. This is a worker placement game with a number of interesting mechanisms and lots of direct player interaction. It's a race to accumulate a set number of VP, which can only be accumulated through building bombs. The game plays very quickly, generally clocking in under an hour.

This game feels very formulaic to me. After the first few turns, every turn's the same. I suspect part of the low rating is due to the fact that I played with 2, which this game probably should not allow. You should not be allowed to play an arbitrary number of workers on your board.

Edit: Upped my rating even further. This game is just such a gem. So well thought out and balanced. Can certainly see why some heavy strategy Euro games may be turned off by the Bomb/Spy actions, but really causes you to adjust on the fly, be adaptable, and take advantage of opportunities.

A fun worker placement game.  It can get pretty deep, especially when playing with players new to the genre.  The tough thing to remember the first couple of times you play the game is that you control when the game ends.  You could play for an hour and never get close to ending.  The players have to steer the game or it will end up taking a very long time to play.

Pro's:

1) Great theme and aesthetic design. The worker chits are incredibly satisfying to play with due to the thickness of the cardboard.
2) Art style is perfect.
3) The ramp up quality of your nuclear bomb production machine is really well done. It feels like everything is slowly moving forward, in small increments, and then suddenly every player is one turn away from winning and it's a race to make sure you get there first. There's always that moment of Aaargh! I almost won.
4) The basic mechanic is relatively simple, and as such I have had great success teaching it to newer gamers despite the game not really being light.

Con's:

1) Espionage can sometimes feel somewhat game breaking. Though it is an excellent way to counteract some players tendency to over value bombers.
2) It can feel really mean sometimes.
3) There is a decent amount of choice presented to a player throughout the game, can cause some pretty serious AP in some players.

RATING: 8
This game seemed at first to me like it had too much going on, but it only took a couple plays for me to realize that while there's a good number of options for players, the game is pretty simple and different strategies can lead to victory. In this game, you take on the roll of a world power racing to develop atomic bombs, not to use them, but to show your prowess. You do this with worker placement, by using one spot on the main board, and then as many spots in your own personal tableau as you want to use. When you run out of workers, you can instead take your turn to simply return all your workers. Some of the options you have on the main board include getting new workers, buying new buildings to add to your tableau, gaining money or yellow cake, making radioactive material (either plutonium or uranium depending on what bomb it's for), and you can even send your planes to other players boards to try to bomb their buildings to slow their progress.

There is an interesting decision to be made in this game to decide which kind of bomb (uranium and plutonium, denoted by the color red or blue) you want to make. Red bombs are a bit easier to make, but have only one score possible, where as the blue bombs can be researched in order to give more points.

This game is great for 2 or 3, and slows down and bogs down a bit too much with 4 for my taste. My only dislike for this game is the bombing other players mechanism. It can easily change the dynamic of the game to make players pick on one player, and in general I don't like this type of mechanic in engine building games, as it seems to just slow the game down unnecessarily. That being said, still a great game, and also has a good ios app version to boot.

Surprisingly good for the genre it belongs to, The Manhattan Project even throws in a smattering of theme: it’s far from overwhelming but still more than one would expect in an eurogame.

It's not bad... the problem I have with the attacking mechanism that defines the game.  It's... spiteful.  In a "I'm going down and I'm taking you with me" sort of way.  I'm OK with backstabbing, when there's a good reason to do it and it benefits the stabber.  Feelings get hurt in this game because there's no reason to stab someone since it puts you in as bad a situation.

Maybe that's some sort of meta commentary on nuclear arms.  I don't care, it's not fun.

Enjoyable worker placement game.  Love the "area control" aspect of keeping your workers out on locations, filling up important spots that your opponents require.

The game can get a bit samey after a wile.   Nations expansions help with that too.   Also bombing can happen in one of two ways...heavy, to the point that all players realize its pointless to bomb, or no bombing (which usually is the result of the first one).

But bombing is fun and very useful when used in critical situations.   

The engine you can get going in this game is really fun.

RATING: 6
Initially I didn't like this, but after about 5 plays I think it's okay.  It seems like a worker placement game, and for the first couple rounds it is, but you quickly get a bunch of cards and a ton of workers so turns are basically- run your engine, remove your workers, run your engine etc.  There's rarely much tension of someone taking a spot where you wanted to place a worker which is usually where the player interaction takes place in most worker placement games.  But the game does have more overt attacking mechanisms to provide player interaction and they seem neat until you actually start to use them.  They are clumsy and their only real purpose is to slow down a clear leader.  But if you attack you are also slowing yourself down.  In one game I hammered espionage and picked on one player over and over, since I perceived (correctly) that she was ahead and she still won the game.  The most interesting part of the game is a sort of tempo/timing element created by taking a turn to remove your workers.  Also, the game ends very abruptly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After 2 plays... not a bad game.  simple mechanics: on your turn, either (1) place 1 worker on the main board and/or 1 or more workers on your buildings or (2) retrieve all of your workers from everywhere, return all neutral workers on your buildings and on the main board and all other players' workers on your buildings.  The goal is to build bombs by converting uranium or plutonium that come from yellow cakes, scientists (workers) and money.  There's also a mechanic where you can bomb other people's buildings, damaging them and "spy" to place your workers on other people's buildings.  

It's not a decent resource conversion worker placement game that plays well with 2 (and I suspect a little better with more).  It's got 3 types of workers, the ability to get more of your own and temporary neutral workers.  I'd happily play it but it lacks the depth that holds my interest.  I'll play it again if Amanda wants to but probably won't ask to play it again.  I also may bring it to a Game-Day night since it's relatively quick (1 - 2 hours).

Juego de desarrollar y lanzar bombas nucleares. Se trata de una carrera.. el juego termina y es ganado por el primer jugador que alcance una puntuación. La mecánica es de colocación de trabajadores.. y en tu turno lo único que puedes hacer es colocar un trabajador en el tablero central (y opcionalmente en tus edificios) o recoger todos tus trabajadores. Tiene bastante puteo e interacción con otros jugadores...
Está bastante bien. Lo suyo es crear un buen motor que te permita luego lanzar las bombas en los momentos adecuados para asegurarte ser el primero en llegar a la puntuación (que depende del número de jugadores).Hayque estar atento a lo que van haciendo el resto, y cuando van a tener que recoger a sus trabajadores.
Las reglas son sencillas. Es apto para no jugones.

Engaging theme and excellent production values. Took maybe a tad too long with five and had too much downtime between the turns.

A fantastic worker placement game with a flavorful theme - I just love to build the bomb with those cute little workers XD

There is a lot of indirect interaction over occupying the spots on the main board and buying buildings from the shared market. The direct interaction of bombing each others buildings usually doesn't play a big role in the game as it comes with a high cost (a worker on the main board plus fighters and bombers). This often results in a cold war situation where all players build fighters and bombers to avoid being an easy target, but rarely anybody actually attacks. This fits the theme very well and drives up the tension.

A rather nifty worker-placement game. Use your workers, engineers and scientists wisely and be the first kind on your block to develop the Bomb! The 40/50's feel to the artwork gives this game the ideal period flavour. The mechanics are solid although some elements (bombing your opponents) feel a bit tacked on. Really enjoying this game so far, it will be interesting to see if it's got longevity.

Nice light-medium worker-placement game with some fun "attack-each-other" mechanics to make things more competitive. I like the fact that you can "hog" a space your opponent needs for a few turns while you build up your own side. I've not yet figured out how to effectively use the spy spaces, and need to be a little more ruthless with the bombing.

Worker placement / economic engine type game, of which there are many. I like that players get to pace themselves with their workers regarding returns.

My rating may improve if I get to play it more.

UPDATE: I see Kickstarter funding was successful and this is being made; I have the same mixed feelings about this as I did Eminent Domain. Manhattan Project isn't very good, but maybe it could have been with some professional development work. By making producing the game a lot less risky via Kickstarter, the designer and publisher didn't have to go the extra mile to really turn something out they had to have a high degree of confidence in, both as a quality game and as something they could sell. And so we end up with something relatively mediocre that just dilutes the marketplace of ideas.
---
Version played at BGG.con '11. Basically what you'd expect from a first-time designer looking for Kickstarter funding: clever and distinct mechanically, but definitely amateur. The gameplay is too constrained; often you have no way to make progress on your objectives because everything you need to do is blocked, and all you can do is wait for things to become unblocked. Pacing becomes very uneven and early buildings really key. Also an AP problem and limited strategic variability. Thematically odd - yes, you're mining uranium and then processing it into bombs, but it bears no relationship whatever to the historical Manhattan Project, it's really just a worker placement game in which the end result happens to be a couple nukes instead of a Church/Cathedral/Castle.

Anyway, unless it's significantly tuned over what I played, I can't recommend backing it.

Very well done game.  The one thing I really don't like, especially if you play with more that 3 players, is that the point amount from a 1 bomb lead is pretty insurmountable.  It is very hard to make any kind of a come back in this game.  With more people, the end game score gets lower and lower, to the point where you only need 2 bombs (or more if they are the little ones).  Anyway, I love the game play and how the whole game looks (especially the funny little scientists), and the thick pieces are wonderful.  I just don't like how it ends.

After 4 plays now, this is made my very short list of favorite worker placement games.  Many options, diverse strategy, good interaction and tough decisions.  Very fun experience and it really ties into its theme well.

Still like the game but Sons of Anarchy is my new favorite Thematic Worker Placement game.  No reason to own this any more as Sons of Anarchy is phenomenal.

BRILLIANT GAME. Loved it. I owned this one, and had someone at SaltCON teach me it (and the consequence of that was I HAD to play Tammany Hall and Colonial - TRIPLE WIN!) It plays so fast, and there is so much to do. build up your factories and do so much each turn with all your workers, scientists, and Engineers. I am salivating thinking about it and wanting to get it back out. I am kicking myself for not pushing for this more. I have way too many great games in my collection that want to get played more. This MUST happen soon!

Manhattan Project Recipe

Workers
Buildings
Yellow cubes
Red disks
Grey disks
Money

1. Acquire as many workers as possible.

2. Acquire buildings that produce workers, money or yellow cubes.

3. Transform yellow cubes into red or grey disks.

4. Transform disks and money into victory points.

5. Pour into glass and drink.

If I didn't point out that this was the Manahattan Project, would you have been able to differentiate it from so many other worker placement efficiency engine games out there?

I certainly couldn't when I played it.

Oh wait, no it included a thing where you could hurt yourself and the leader in order to let the other players fly past you. Yeah, for some reason most games don't have that.

The theme is fun, and integrated well into the game. The game itself presents some interesting decisions in the timing of when to deploy men or retrieve them. What you actually do with the actions is very cookie-cutter and boring though. Acquire cards to use as private actions, gather resources and trade them in for other resources. Use resources to build bombs. And the attack mechanism just seems to create kingmaking. Overall, OK.

Decent worker placement game where you try to get yellow cake to make uranium/plutonium to make bombs to score points.  The gray contract workers are neat as are the forced 'recall' turns.  The spy is so good that you need to take it every chance, which sort of feels like that Twilight card (that I hate) as the spot revolves around the table forcing your hand on certain turns.  The spy does have neat implications with the recall turn (and contract workers) and trying to time your position to maximize on that space.  Overall, I enjoyed the theme and the game works, so I'm willing to play again.

One play. I enjoyed this. It was a worker placement enginey type of game. I liked the way you chose to place or take workers off the board. It added an extra dimension over the usual way worker placement works. Not sure about the bombing as it just looks like it would get used to bash the leader. Worried that the choices about placement are a bit too easy to make and that after a few games it could get stale. This may just be me personally having played to many worker placement games. This is likely to be a six or a seven for me.

Likes: Funny theme, a nice refreshing take on the worker placement mechanic. Each bomb has its own name.

Dislikes: The fighter mechanic seems a bit weak. The scoring chunks from the bombs themselves seem a bit large for suggested point goals. Biggest problem is that a player managing his workers well can completely control the early game and have almost an insurmountable lead, since there is no way to kick workers off the main board.

Worker placement game with the Manhattan arms race theme. I had fun bombing the other players cities, however this was at the expense of my own game. Like all games of this genre you need to play a balanced strategy to win. You need defence/attack to not be vulnerable, mines to produce raw materials, factories to make the nuclear material for your bombs and universities to train your workforce. The really interesting part of the game is the use of the espionage element of the game where you can make use of other players infrastructure if you time the placement correctly.

Overall this is a solid worker placement game.

Atombombát építeni cool.
Le(nematom)bombázni valaki más atombomba építő kapacitását, hogy te hamarabb megépítsd a sajátodat cool. Már ha nem veled csinálják épp. De abból is vissza lehet jönni.
A worker lehelyezős/visszavevős mechanizmus egyedi és jól működik.
Lényegében workerekből csinálunk sárga kockát (uránérc) amit újabb workerrel finomítunk plutóniummá vagy uránná, amiből csinálhatunk Pl vagy U235 bombát, utóbbik több pontot érnek de pénz is kell hozzájuk, illetve Pl bombáink is többet érhetnek ha egyet közülünk beáldozunk (tesztrobbantunk). Pénzt szintén worker-ek gyártanak, illetve repülőket csinálni (a bombázáshoz meg a légi védekezéshez) és építkezni is workerekkel (és/plusz pénzzel) tudunk. Van még kémkedés is a játékban amivel a másik játékos tábláján lévő felépített épületeket tudjuk saját színű workereinkkel befoglalni - ez nagyon hasznos lépés tud lenni, persze ez is pénzbe kerül (és egy james bond workerbe). Ha ügyes vagy a fenti akciók mindegyikét meglépted egy körben is akár, mert bár a főtáblára körönként csak 1 workert tehetsz le, a saját felépített épületeid minden üres helyét feltöltheted. A játék fix pontszámig megy, pontokat csak az atombombák és a tesztrobbantások adnak. Összetett, több működő stratégiát lehetővé tevő rendszer, közepesen nehéz euro, tökéletesen működő tematikával.

Most of the games I really enjoy and get involved with are worker placement, and TMP is definitely one of them. I like to play games that have small twists on the basic WP mechanics (i.e. Tzolkin), and I found a nice example here, where you have 3 different kinds of workers, and also can get contractor as one-action workers. I want to play this more.

RATING: 7
Pleasantly surprised. Interesting worker placement where you get buildings (cards) that you can also put workers on (like Le Havre), but on your turn you can place as many workers (three varieties) as you want, but only one on the main board. Temporary "contract" workers is also kinda nifty. But there are a couple things I'm not so sure how I feel about:
1) Air Strikes. It seems like you need to buy bombers as a deterrent, but in a multiplayer game it's not in anyone's best interest to actually bomb anyone else. It's the typically thing about you hurt someone, but don't get anything for it, so the guy who was completely out of it comes out best of all.
2) You don't get anything when people use your buildings. Yes, they have to pay to do so, but it goes to the bank. Seems like the player who owns it should get something.
Very nice presentation. My kids would like this.

In The Manhattan Project the players are going to build an abstract infrastructure to gather sufficient resources and manpower to produce atomic bombs. The player who obtains a certain number of bomb points the quickest, wins the game. Right off the bat, the author flips the bird to softie subjects and turns [i]really[/i] serious WMDs into an abstracted worker placement game—a race, no less! I like how he thinks.

There are, at first sight, a few good aspects to this title which make it stand out a little from the average slew of worker placement games. For one thing there is no separate phase of taking back placed workers: it is an action you can take. That opens up a number of novel interactions. Now in fairness to other designers the idea wasn't unique at Spiel 2011: I’ve seen it used in two other titles at least. The second good idea is spying: using the buildings of other people before they can. Insidious, effective, and introducing a number of new strategies. Again, this too was present in other games, in similar or slightly different forms. Third good idea: destroying other player's buildings by means of a simple combat mechanism. (No, not with the nukes. That would be a little over the top.) The victim can repair his buildings, but it will cost time and money, and money may not be that engine’s strong point. Dastardly effective at times. So, all in all, a more fluid and interactive game than usual for this genre.

[b]Update[/b] So, a few plays under my belt, usually at the extreme ends of the supported player numbers. I'm not sure the game is meant to be played at these ends. With 5, it simply takes too long, especially when players become agressive and bomb quick players out of the game. It's a valid way to proceed, but if done too early the effect is basically semi-permanent player elimination. Also, it doesn't feel very nice to be spending all that effort just for one to two bombs. With 2, the interaction is simple and too direct: you only have the other player to contend with, so if one starts to bomb, the other starts to spy. The rating for at these numbers is decidedly lower than the ideal 7 I gave. I hope that a compromise is reached at 3 or 4. (I'm guessing 3.)

[b]Update 2[/b] The more I play this game, the less I'm beginning to like it. The strong points I alluded to above are basically [i]all[/i] you can do to hinder other players, and what they boil down to is artificially lengthening the game. The game does not reward agression on its own: it is only the fear of losing that drives a player to become agressive because there is simply no other way available to him to reel in an efficient engine. It is leader bashing in optima forma, taking three steps forward and then two steps back. Or even two and a half. And once all the engines have been reduced to a patchwork quilt matters become so dependent on chaotic-tactical timing of placement and withdrawal of workers that you can't really tell anymore if a win was deserved or not. While The Manhattan Project is probably good fare for those who like these swings of fortune until, finally, someone beats the rest by a noselength, it is not the kind of game I prefer. This is most unfortunate as I really dig the mature subject matter (yielding the game a bonus point). But it is not my game, and never will be, either.

I probably ought to move it to the trade pile.

Who knew a game about doing physics could be so boring!  It made me physic-ally ill to play this game. Ha-HA! Also, the burger I had while playing the game was suspect.

Now credit where credit is due, they managed to make a bunch of hairy, unwashed scientists look adorable.  Building a mass-murdering bomb is so cute!  But there's no fun.  None.  Put out a pile of workers.  Fun, I got some stuff.  Take them all back and that's all I can do for a turn.  Less fun!  It's like, a non-turn.  It's like a turn in Smallworld where you put your race into decline.  Strategically important?  Sure.  Means the other player(s) get to have two fun turns while you sit around doing nothing?  Also sure!

And the decisions you make just aren't thrilling.  Collect some yellowcake and some different workers, so I can move this little marker up a little, and hey, I got a little closer to making a bomb.  Hooray!  It's a fourth quarter results report playing out before my very eyes.  Thin theme, no fun, and dead turns make this the least of all worker placement games outside of an actual college counselor's office.

Components: Super cute little workers, engineers, and scientists. Overall the graphic design belies the grisly theme.

Experience: In other games, I've enjoyed chaining together a sequence of events on my turn, basically using action points to accomplish several tasks in one turn. Here, it's just too busy. My opponents' turns are a flurry of activity, with pieces moving all over the place; way too much activity for me to keep track of. And by the time it's my turn again, the state of the board has changed; so it doesn't make too much sense to plan ahead.

Played 3x.
This is maybe the quintessential worker placement game for me. It's light enough to be a gateway and, I think, interesting enough to play over and over again. 

There is a LOT of player interaction for a worker placement game. Not only are you competing for spots, you're also competing for buildings because they can give you unblockable spots in the future. Your strategy has to change based on what buildings are available during your turn and you can be really mean by buying a building that someone else desperately needs.

Plus there are the bombing and espionage spots. I haven't explored the bombing strategy much but the espionage strategy, when executed at key moments, can really turn a game around. Timing is everything in this game--when to buy a building, when to take back your workers, when to run your engine and build a bomb. Despite all of this, the game tends to be quick. Maybe too quick--but it's easy enough to extend the VP score that will end the game.

RATING: 7.75
The Manhattan Project has a lot of positives.  The worker placement and engine building is well themed.  It also allows for friendly or confrontational play.  The learning curve is pretty easy, and it only takes a few turns to start building momentum.  We didn't use the spy or combat much in our first play, but there was still plenty to keep us busy.  The replay value looks strong, and I would recommend at least one play.  The only two downsides for me were the lack of hidden scoring & a little downtime between turns.  Even with these minor complaints it still scores high for me.

A race to build nuclear bombs. Sort of worker-placement with a direct conflict mechanic--you can bomb the other players' buildings. 

Winner can sneak up on you. Many of the bombs are significant VPs, so two bombs is sometimes enough to win the game. And there's no VP track, so it's difficult to keep tabs on other players' progress to know when to do an Air Strike.

Direct conflict/player interaction can occur but seems to serve as a game extender for players who are trying to take down the leader.

I just wanted to write a quick review for the art work prior to my ever playing the game. At first the weird art for the workers really threw me off, but after watching Rahdo Run through of this, my mind was instantly changed. The rules seem really easy but the implementation is deep.

I did end up finally playing this and I have to say this is a very fun, light worker placement game. There is tension in this game, but nothing AP inducing which is good. I like to bust this out when i want a euro with a smallish footprint that wont take more than hour. Plays well with just 2 and scales very well up to the max of 5. 

My only complaint with this is that this game seems to end really abruptly. With no end game scoring the end is a bit unsatisfactory. Other than that, its a very solid game.

Oh, that is a great worker placement game! I love the fact, that you need to be very careful - if you grow too quickly other players will notice it and will start spying on your or even bombing your buildings! The game mechanics are very simple - put workers or retrieve them - but there are plenty choices and ways to develop your strategy.

Eh, a typical worker placement game. Spots on the board are tight, workers are limited, need to do everything but can't. It was a fun game but nothing really memorable to make me want to bring it back out on the table. Maybe it gets more interesting with additional players since you can attack them. Also need to try with the Nations expansion and see if that makes the game more interesting. 

[24 Feb 2017]
Traded out of my collection. It was a solid worker placement game with different types of workers, a unique refresh setup and the ability to use your opponent's private buildings but still felt like a lot of other worker placement games. It didn't seem to scale down to two players well it feels too open. I'd rather keep MP: Energy Empire.

I think this is a great game, and an interesting spin on the worker placement genre. I like that you can attack opponents' buildings, and you need to know seize opportunities at the right time in order to block opponents. The only thing keeping me from getting this into my collection is the game length. At 2 hours, I'm afraid it would almost never get played.

A little bit different mix on the worker placement idea... both with the decision of when to bring all your workers back home and also with the usage of a limited pool of neutral workers that all players compete for.

Some might not consider this a "true" Euro, since there is a military option where one player can amass planes and then choose the airstrike action damage other players' planes and buildings. It works well, but some might not like it.

NOTE: Does not play well with just two players. No real tension or competition at all (except maybe for the Espionage space... but one player can monopolize that if he wants.)

Unbalanced. Basically it's a player-elimination game where you can get "bombed" out early and have no chance to recover, but you still have to sit-out the game. Furthermore: the building-tiles should be seperated in 2/3 "ages" to get a better spread of types that become available. I did not like it.

Interesting variation on the worker placement mechanic. You actually get to [i]attack[/i] people. And I don't mean in some abstract eurogamey way, either. You build planes and bombers, then go blow the crap out of other nations if you can. The nation cards are a nice touch, too. I suspect a bit of influence from [i]High Frontier[/i].

The good news (for eurogamers anyway) is that the military aspect is largely meant as a way to foil game leaders. By itself it's not a path to victory and if you focus too heavily on the military you're almost certainly going to lose. You're probably better off building a spy and just stealing their buildings. Another problem is that it's not always easy to tell just who the leader is.

While I really enjoyed the ability to directly affect your opponents through attacks and spying, I think the chaos of the buildings (both in terms of arrival timing and ability) can be a downer. I think it's crucial to get at least one University and if you can't get one, and you can't get a spy, you're in deep trouble. The game does sort of abrubtly end, too.

On a side note, this is definitely more interesting than [i]Lords of Waterdeep[/i] which many people are comparing this game to at the time I write this comment. There is no comparison. They are nothing alike, and this game is far more interesting and innovative in my opinion.

After some more plays of the Manhattan Project, I feel like I have to lower my rating to a 7. Don't get me wrong, I still think this is a fine and very clever game but it is just too mean for me. I do hugely enjoy building my engine and racing to the finish line. What I don't like is the possibility to throw a stick into the spokes of someone else riding at full speed. That's just not my idea of fun.

[2013-02-04 Rating: n.a. -> 8.5]

Note that I've only played the game twice. So I might adjust might rating after some more plays since there are some things within this game that might kill the fun for me. But first, let's get to what I like about [i]The Manhattan Project (TMP)[/i]:

Basically, this is another worker placement/resource conversion/engine building game. But, true to it's theme, it has a nice race feeling to it and I do really like the aspect of the different workers. Preferable, you would like to use the specialists only for the tasks in which they give you the "biggest bang for the buck". But sometimes it's better to simply use them in a "suboptimal" to block someone else from using a specific action. Another thing I like about the workers is the fact that you won't get them back at the end of your turn automatically. Instead, you have a skip a whole turn to retrieve them from where you used them. This crucial aspect of the game reminds me a little bit of the card management aspect you have in games like "Illiad". It introduces a great timing component into the game. So, a big thumbs up for the worker management part of the game.

Yet another thing I found interesting is the fact, that the buildings enter the game randomly. So it is possible, that a very strong building is placed in the starting setup and, based on your seating position, there's nothing you can do to hinder your opponents from grabbing it. This is a little bit offset by the fact that you can directly attack your opponents buildings with Airstrikes or the use of the Espionage action which let's you use their buildings (think Ora et Labora). 

These two mechanics (Airstrike and Espionage) allow for a good dose of (negative) direct player interaction. As always, I'm normally not a great fan of this mechanics. But I haven't made up my mind about them in TMP. While I had one game where I played quite good and was in the lead when my buildings got bombed, I had the feeling that this wasn't really the end of the world since I had still access to the Espionage action and made good use of it. While I couldn't fully regain speed and the game was won by someone who didn't get bombed, I have the feeling that you might still overcome the results of a bombing raid as long as you can still use the Espionage action or have enough money to repair the damage. But I will have to see if this is true in future games.

All in all, I did really enjoy my two plays of TMP and I'm looking forward to my next game. So, give this game a shot if you're more on the euro side of games.

This is one of my favorite worker placement games.  It has some fresh new ideas (or at least a new take on some tried and true ideas) and is integrated excellently. It is one of the most thematic Euro games available.

The last few rounds can sometimes degenerate into long AP turns due to the amount of options, and especially when a player might be able to end the game but they just can't figure out how.  It also has a conflict element which some people might not appreciate (though I think it is implemented perfectly).  Overall, this is a very solid game.

Very interesting worker placement game with a lot of player interaction. It can be a quick game. It also can be quite nasty. You can bomb other people's buildings and also take other peoples actions. But it is a very well put together game. One of my favorite things about this game is different worker placement areas can only be activated by certain types of workers. Works really well.

Players are major powers, trying to develop the first atomic bombs.  By the numbers worker placement game... with a few wrinkles.  Workers come in three flavours, worker, engineer and scientist, which restrict where they can be placed.  You build buildings, which get the economy of cash, yellow cake, and more workers up and running.  Buildings earn more resources, and turn cake into uranium and plutonium, which go into the bombs...  the victory points.  Nice theming for a game, although lightly applied here - it really could be anything.  Fun to explore a few times, but this one is a bit long, and quite nasty.  Played three times now, and this one has a short half life.  Get the engine up, mince your sausage machine, and hope you win.  Go and play Tribune: Primus Inter Pares, and see what a master game designer can do with worker placement.

A game so nice we played it twice in a row!
Very welcome addition to the worker placement family, with great interaction between the players. Short play time with fast turns means you won't even notice the game is almost over before it's too late.
Love the innovation of the Spies (allow you to use a number of an opponent's buildings) and the Plane/Bombers (disable another player's building), which makes for more interaction.
Easy to explain too!
Only fault would be an overly long rulebook and no player aid.

Once you are concerned about having the right buildings and resources and income and blueprints and defense to do everything you want to do you begin to feel this game come to life :)

RATING: 5
A very solid entry into the worker placement genre.  The art goes a long way - it looks like a cross between Fallout and Legos.   The main twist (I hesitate to call it an innovation) is that there is no "return home" phase for your workers.  You have to forfeit a turn to get all your workers back, so some turns you may not wish to place all of them and save them for the next round.   The downside of all this is that the board remains very crowded (with 5 players, anyway) and you have to know when other players are going to "return home" and open things up for you. The theme is really strongly implemented and that helps the game succeed where otherwise it might just be a jumble of borrowed mechanisms.

For the unique theme alone, this is one of my more favorite worker placement games. I'm also intrigued by the style of worker placement, which I haven't seen too often: where you can place a worker for an action, or reclaim all your workers - rather than everyone reclaiming at the same moment.

The only negative I could put against is the aerial combat. While interesting in theory, it devolves quickly: either you both ignore it, one person ignores it at their peril, or both engage with it and the game becomes a representation of M.A.D.

Con: Awful (air strikes) conflict mechanism, which I have no idea why and how got into the game design as there is nothing more anti-climatic in a engine builder than a mechanism that disrupts all your engire gears (it is table turning infuriating).

I've enjoyed this worker placement more than any other. It has just enough going on to feel diverse and in depth with out being an effort to learn or play.

This is one of the best worker placement games I have ever played and to be honest, I am not a fan of them in general.  However, what's really interesting about TMP is that the mechanics and the theme integrate so well with each other.  Unlike your run-of-the-mill point-salady placement game, most of the game will be about engine-building (nobody will have points on the board for quite some time), and each worker available to you has a specific role.  While this has generally been handled in newer games using dice, TMP's workers aren't so abstract - you have laborers, engineers, and scientists, and they each contribute to thematically-sound things; your laborers do mundane, but necessary work; your engineers build and design; your scientists churn out chemicals and compounds.  The key to this one is managing exactly when to take all your workers back as they don't come back to you of their own volition; you either put one down or you take -all- of them back, freeing up the spaces they occupied for some other dastardly player to snatch.

Moreover, there is quite a bit of interaction between players in the form of espionage and bombing runs, which is rare in a typical WP game.  While it can feel a little unfair to get your stuff bombed to smithereens, the game still remains tight in the points race and there are always ways to use the main board to get what you want.

The only concern that I have is that it can drag on, especially if the aforementioned player interaction is exploited.  A game of peace could end quickly, but it's much more likely that there will be some scrapping, and for each bout amongst players, tack on another 20 minutes to the game, give or take.

The Manhattan Project is a decent worker placement game. Each player owns 12 workers in 3 types but at the start of the game players only have access to 4 workers of the basic type (unless you are playing a high player count and are low in the player order). The resources are: money (used for various things), yellowcake (used for money, plutonium, and uranium), uranium (used for VP and sometimes plutonium), plutonium (used for VP), Bombers (damage buildings and can net VP), and Fighters (destroys other fighters/bombers and protects your buildings from being damaged). I guess you could consider workers as another type of resource since your basic worker is limited in what he can do and the other two types have different functions and need to be acquired. On your turn you have the option of placing workers or retrieving them and understanding this ebb and flow seems to be quite important. The game ends when one player completes an action that pushes him to or above a set number of VP based on players which is quite different than a lot of other games.

I don't like the end game. Why? In one turn a player can play a bomb card from his hand and load it in the same turn and get almost 4/5's of the VP needed to win the game... I'm thinking of the Pluonium Bomb that's worth 34 points after an implosion test and can then be loaded on the same turn for an additional 5 points. In a 4-player game you only need 50 VP to win the game. It does well in ramping up the tension a bit because the game can end quite suddenly. This could be a good or bad thing depending on your preferences. 

Even though people will mostly start with the same number of workers, I'm reminded of Agricola in that there will be an asymmetric number of workers as the game is unfolds. At this point, I don't know if or how much of a snowball effect this would have but I'm reminded of Agricola. In Agricola, I felt this worker issue bridged a threshold to the point where I thought it was a balance issue and made the game less enjoyable. I'm not saying it is an issue in TMP but it's definitely something I would be paying attention to in further games.

I will note this game has more direct interaction than in many other worker placement games which, again, could be a good or bad thing based on your preferences. Our game never saw many uses Airstrikes and I think this had to do with the way the buildings came out. We never saw many factories and the good factories didn't show up until near the of the end game. I think this is actually a good thing because the way the buildings come out can have a dramatic effect on how the game is played, adding replay value to TMP.

If you like worker placement you must try this game. The dynamic placement and retrieval phases keeps the game moving forward constantly. There is no "feed your people" mechanism, and no limit of rounds or turns. So instead it feels like a race to be the most efficient.

Very enjoyable worker placement game. This game does not evolve around the concept of rounds but rather the players decide when to widraw their workers and start again. Hence the action board is almost never completely empty and action can be blocked until certain players decide to widraw. This is the concept what makes the game for me. 
It playes very well with 5 players with little or no downtime!

Ruben: I'm a little disconcerted with the pacing of the game (plod, plod, plod ... then in one or two turns everyone is within a couple points of winning ... done) but otherwise enjoyable game.

RATING: 7
A worker placement game that's predicated on tempo and not leaving yourself vulnerable to attack. In a counter-intuitive stroke, the game is more about letting other payers build great buildings – and using them so they can’t – and building only so-so ones yourself (so they’re left unused). 

The uniqueness on the w-p stuff here is that you either place dudes or recall dudes, and managing that tempo relative to your opponents is quite fun. The espionage tech allows you to use other players' buildings but only one player can use the tech track at a time so you want to be placing soon as another player recalls his piece from it.

If you want an interactive worker placement game, here it is, because you can build up fighters and bombers to attack other players and destroy their stuff. And I could probably do without that element as I generally like my euros to be indirectly confrontational. We did have a case of a player getting attacked by multiple players and feeling pretty sour about things. Consequently, it never got traction with my group and I moved it on.

- that recalling workers is its own action--no defined rounds when gameplay just has to stop until everyone has passed
- that you can use another player's buildings!
- the air strikes to slow down a leader
- the solid engine-building

I dislike:
- that air strikes can almost drag the game to a crawl
- that some of the worker spots don't make sense thematically
- not knowing how the Bribe pile makes thematic sense??
- the rather abrupt style of game end

Final verdict: A game that has a lot of mechanisms that I really enjoy with worker placement and have fortunately spilled over into other great games. Theme is cute, components are just right, and engine-building is just perfection.

Classic worker placement game that features a few interesting elements, such as: 1. Having three different types of workers, 2. Being able to play on more than one space, as long as the additional plays are on your own board, and 3. The workers remaining in play until you spend an action to retrieve them all.

Also one of the better worker placements. The bombing area is not the best part of the game, you might not even want to use it, because it doesn't lead to the win, but the rest of the game is excellent. Points lost because of the bombing though.

Two plays.  Played with Nations expansion both times.  Game of planning and resource management.  Needs more plays to really understand some of the resource relationships and when to go to war.  Luck element in order in which buildings come out mean no advance planning on route to Victory. At a subjective level, I enjoy playing this game - resource management, combat if I want it, and all in a reasonable time frame.

Decent enough worker placement game, but I don't think the espionage aspect has any place in the game and can really through a spanner in the works or make you waste a turn trying to stop it.  Art is good but the and I like the theme but it just didn't resonate with me.

RATING: 7
Interesting twist on the worker placement mechanic.  The "retrieve workers" action adds a subset of choices of when to get your people back (as well as opponents off your player board).  The direct conflict with military strikes and saboteurs stealing benefits from opponents buildings is also pretty neat.

Despite the innovative design, the gameplay itself felt surprisingly lackluster.  The pacing leisurely moves along without any significant tension.  We unanimously felt this was an "okay" game to "pretty good game", but also one that didn't create that hook of excitement to keep us wanting to play again and again.

Without the ability to bomb actions, this is a solid worker placement which is well designed and with a great look. With it you've got some interesting interactivity though it may get ugly if someone gets bombed in to the stone age because they're doing well.

My second edition card size don't match the expansion, the yellow player discs are brown (a note informed me this was to avoid confusion between the yellow cubes which seemed odd and given that the 3rd edition included yellow discs, suspicious this was a mistake) and I had to e-mail the publishers to get all of my Kickstarter products. I suspect Minion games have learnt a lot since then but sadly I am still a little jaded by the experience and with what is otherwise a very good game.

You need to forget about the bombing theme and accept this game as just bits of cardboard you're placing on a board.  I liked the fact you could carry out multiple actions on each turn and progress seemed quite quick - the game took less time than I'd expected.  As a quick player who takes the view that a game's only a game, I would avoid playing this with analytical types as they could spend ten minutes thinking about their moves.  Or introduce a sand timer.

Solid worker placement game about building (not so much about actually detonating) atomic bombs.  It is very interactive, not just as players vie for spots on the board, but as they use spies to occupy each other's buildings and develop enough air power to damage opponents' buildings.  I'll knock it a half a point in my ratings for the wonky way the military actions work, but overall this is a great game that can play very different each time, especially with the expansion modules.

Feb. 2012: If you like the humor, the theme is great and very will implemented. I also like worker placement games (some of them are among my most favorite games). However, in this one you will eventually be able to place around a dozen workers every other turn. While some could argue that this is positive since it  gives tons of opions, for me it was just too much. Thanks god I didn't play with a analysis paralysis player.
However, I wouldn't mind to play again.

First off, the graphic design of The Manhattan Project is simply gorgeous. The thematic connection to the real Manhattan Project seems a little weak, though.

The gameplay itself cannot quite keep up with the graphical representation. It's a solid worker placement game with a couple of twists and a few caveats. The most obvious, of course, is the direct confrontation and possible leader bashing through air strikes which is something that is sure to polarise. A more serious detractor, however, seems to be that there is very little strategic variance: Since the only way to score points is by building bombs and there are only two different bomb types, manoeuverability is often fairly low and with that in mind, the game runs a bit longer than it should.

If you can live with the theme there is nothing wrong with the game. But it doesn't impress me very much. It is a solid workerplacement game with some ways to interact. What I miss is some incentive to play it again. There is nothing like 'next time I will try X' or 'I wonder how it plays if Y happens'. 
I will play it if asked but propably never suggest it.

I can see a great game there but something doesn't feel quite right.

At the outset this is a worker placement game, however during gameplay the worker placing takes a back seat to engine building which is much more important so you never really feel like you're battling for spots on the board.

On the other hand the engine building part doesn't have enough weird and powerful combo opportunities to really captivate me.

Wanted to like this, but struggled.

Espionage and bombers very confrontational and frustrating, without many ways to avoid it. Having to time your actions can be used to avoid massive espionage against you but it's not satisfying to do so.

Scoring very bursty, leading to me scoring zero points when the game ended, which was frustrating. I like a number to accompany my efforts, even when I lose...

Rest of the game was a fairly fun worker placement though.

An extremely decent worker placement game. I really enjoy the theme and the artwork especially.

Great theme, art and components enhance this great worker placement game.  Each player builds buildings which will help them, but other people can visit their buildings blocking the builder from accessing them until they remove their meeples.  This is pretty mean so people I play with just stick to their own board.  The engine building in this game is outstanding and there are always interesting moves to take. Definitely recommend this to anyone who likes worker placement games.

RATING: 8
A slightly above average worker placement game that separates itself mainly by it's theme.  

Manhattan Project offers some novel elements largely  through the espionage and bombing tracks which add a unique interaction between players by allowing sabotage and outright disabling of others' buildings.  

All in all, a game on the lighter end of the spectrum but not without decisions.  I would play again but not sure how long I will maintain ownership.

Maybe the nations add something?

INITIAL IMPRESSION

A thematic, worker placement game with some nice twists.

I like the tablo building element and building up your worker count. The racing to the VP objective is an interesting endgame mechanism that puts a nice clock on this game. That coupled with the fact that there are two bomb types that each require a different strategy makes it a unquie game.

The bombing element is cool as a way of directly interacting with opponents and stopping a run away leader but it can get a little Metagamey. Some good and some bad elements

One of the best worker placement games with a real theme wherein you can also attack/affect other players. The game seamlessly integrates theme & game mechanics, and does it well. Speaking of theme, it's nice to finally have a worker placement theme that's somewhat fresh & different from all of the samey-same games featuring collect A to get B to get C. It's easy to teach & play while remaining interesting for the average gamer. The theme is a huge plus if one is into cold war/bomb building material. The artwork is nice enough, and puts you there.

Great theme, and I'm a big fan of the art direction on this title.  The "place OR pick up" mechanism works well here.

On the downside, it feels like the outcomes have quite a bit of randomness. Not all players will have equal opportunity to buy the best buildings, and the unpredictability of one's hand of bomb cards can make long-term planning difficult. Some players will simply get luckier than others in any given game.

Game looks great, and well produced.  Did not really enjoy my first play, but will likely give it another go at some point.

The game is fairly tactical, chaotic, and brief.  Card draws make a significant difference, and players can interact easily to king-make.  The pick on the leader aspect is not well-tuned for a strategy title IMO, at least based on the first play.  When commenting on this, however, the other players echoed the lack of control.  Some examples: building plutonium became virtually worthless when an all uranium bomb draw came out, and was tied up for a long time by a player blocking the bomb design action to target a specific player.  If anyone gets to a lead, it's very easy to target them.  It does not appear to break the game, as there are enough work-arounds.  It does however, make you wonder why bother working your engine up when there's no point if others are behind you.  Building protection is of little use as air combat is one for one, and there's no amount of protection that is going to help you with 4 players targeting you.  I'm ok with catch-up mechansisms, as long as they are more opaque, leading to calculated sacrifice.  In this game, it's really lacking, as air power is so easily built, it's just a matter of pointing your finger at the leader and getting a quick agreement.

That said, there are plenty of players who like Munchkin like chaos, and lots of take-that leading to a surprise outcome.

May revisit these comments if I give it another try.

A lighter worker placement game.  Everyone works on their own engine to build a certain number of points of bombs.  The game can end very quickly once players have built a number of buildings and have started their "engine" running.  It does add interactiveness via an espionage and air strike action, both of which can be annoying if you're the target:).  It also adds a twist in that recalling your workers takes a turn, so it adds consideration of timing and just how you want to space out using your workers - do you use them all and then recall them the following turn?  Or do you keep a few in reserve and hope that the player across the table with the valuable university (or other building) recalls his workers so you can sneak into his building and use it for yourself?  Or do you spread your workers out and try to block actions on the board?

A medium weight worker placement game. Thematically it shines and other players can attack you AND use your buildings with a spy action which is great! That said, sometimes depending on who is playing, one person may be continually attacked and fall behind which is frustrating. (There is always a shot at retaliation though! ;))
Fairly simple to teach, although the bomb-making aspect and delivery (and ultimately scoring) is a bit strange.

Just picked this up in early 2016. I love it. It's worker placement but not as "get in each others' way" as Agricola/Brew Crafters, has a clearer path to victory that is easy to understand, and the rules and game flow COMPLETELY reflect the theme of the arms race. "YOU have a huge air force? *I* had better have a huge air force! Strictly for protection, you understand." "I think that guy has designed a very powerful bomb... *I* better design a very powerful bomb, and build it before he does!" Basically, the scarier you are, and the more likely you seem to be willing to push The Button, the more victory points you get. It's good. Morbid, but good.

Weight: medium
Players: 4
Length: around 90 mins
Mechanics: workers placement
Decisions: a lot, where to place my worker, should I recover them or go for another one, build, bomb...
Opinion: I loved the game, with quite easy rules you have a game with lot of interaction and some kind of cold war with the bombers.
You are fighting with your rivals to build the best bombs (ok, the theme is quite, hmm, inappropriate is not the word but could be), so you have your man force and have to use them to... build buildings, improve your air force, get uranium, do some espionage, and.. build bombs!!! yea, in the end you will get point for building bombs
Your workers can be improved to scientists or engineers, and you can block other player buildings with some espionage, and... your can bomb their buildings if they don't have enough force to defend...
The interaction is what I have liked most, yes, it could have some kingmaking, so be careful with who you play it, but the way you can be mean is delicious (bombing or blocking). And this is the only flaw I could say at this moment, be aware with who you play, otherwise you have a great game here

I am in love with this game, It has great depth in streamlined package . There is a lot about this game that separates it from the other worker placement games. It is a race to a set amount of points with opportunity for players to really together and slow down the leader with out the game dragging at the same time. Though it is a worker placement game it brakes a lot of the standard WP rules, and is more about building a sand box area on your player board. Once you have built a good player board the main board is just second to the game and is no longer the focus for you. This is a aspect that i love about the game and for anyone who loves engine building games even if they don't care for worker placement i would recommend this game.

RATING: 7.9
It's really hard to rate this because we played it wrong. The person who taught us the game taught us the Fighter/Bomber track incorrectly and therefore nobody really used it much throughout the game. Plus, we played with the Leaders expansion which gave everyone a ton of fighting/bombing points which seemed unnecessary as nobody took those actions. That really tightened up the board because nobody went to two of the factory spaces or the Air Strike spaces. Still, the components are excellent, the theme is great and there is a lot of tension at the end as everyone is racing to build, which I loved and thought fit the theme quite well. The game overstayed it's welcome a bit and took a while before you really started to build your engine, otherwise I would have liked it more. Still, I'm definitely willing to play it again as I had a really good time with it. The mechanic that allows you to keep workers on the board to block your opponents is really interesting to me.

This game has espionage and bombing of other players which makes is super interesting. I also like that you don't have to recall your workers at the end of the round if you have some left. This blocks others from getting spaces they may need. It's fun to see what others need and stop them!

Played once with 5. Found the design interesting and I like the theme. Unfortunately I don’t think the game works in some fundamental ways. Attacking weakens the attacker, hurts the attacked and benefits only those not involved - why attack. There is nothing to think about when it is not your go – too much downtime. Attacking is a free for all – players are going to spend the game whining about why they are not the leaders. September 2012

Played it twice, still not sure what to make of this game. The idea and theme are solid, the components feel good and the gameplay is well thought out for the most part.

I have two main concerns. First concern is the fighter/bomber planes aspect. It really feels bad if you don't build them and somebody then comes along and damages one of your buildings. It's immediately rendered useless but paying 5 + a worker is often too much of an investment to repair 1 point of damage. In a 4 player game, if you can get away without building planes, it gives you a big edge if your opponents are fighting and damaging each other. So you kinda want to take a risk and just focus on your engine instead. Often what happened was that 1 person went for an early attack before being forced to focus on his own engine. This left 1 player crippled while the 2 remaining players profited. 

My second concern is regarding the bomb-design drafting. It feels a bit weird that 1 person makes the investment and everyone else benefits from this. Especially because the benefits can depend greatly your position at the table. The second person has a big edge in a 4 player game compared to the last person to choose. Sometimes you're also in the position where you need a new bomb-design but going for that action will lead to a win for your opponent. So you just kind of have to fiddle around a bit? Wait until you can immediately finish the game when you grab a new design? 

Both issues might solve themselves by getting better at the game. But at the moment I'm neither hot nor cold about The Manhattan Project.

Manhattan Project is a racing efficiency euro as players vye to build the largest atomic bombs. Along with the theme, Manhattan Project is unique is its worker usage. On a turn players either place and return their workers. When choosing return, all players lose any temporary extra workers from certain parts of the board. This gives players some control of opening up and closing spaces for use. Additionally, the efficiency race is not only in gaining materials to fill contracts (bombs), but also building an engine to get the most workers in the best way. This is a rewarding race with a novel theme and some interesting twists on worker placement.

Worker placement of the future.  Lords of Waterdeep, you have been replaced by a younger, hotter model.  I like getting rid of the rounds so start player doesn't matter and I like the race better than counting points.  Also, great use of art for the theme and gameplay.  I think I am getting worse, but that only makes me want to play more.

Just when you think that worker placement is passé, there comes a game which takes this seemingly overused mechanic and modifies it so cleverly that it feels all fresh & new. 

The Manhattan Project adds: asynchronous worker retrieval, private worker spaces and the ability to occupy other players space by using the "espionage" action.  This mixes to a very dynamic gameplay where the timing of your actions becomes crucial.  A second thing I really like about this game is the reaaally slow start which, after about 70-90 minutes suddenly and dramatically accelates when evybody rushes to finish his bombs. By now I've seen several games where the victory of one player was literally hanging by a thread (i.e. only half a turn)

Finally, I like the story of the game. Granted: building atomic bombs is not what you call the most family friendly theme but personally I'm just sick of all those pasted-on medivial merchants/priests/kings/whatever themes which we find in far too many Eurogames.  TMP tells a story and it tells this story well.  Getting the materials, designing the bombs, commanding air strikes to cripple enemies plants and enrichment centers: this all just fits just perfectly together.

From my current gaming experience I'd give this game a solid 9. However, I'm not sure how well it is balanced.  Uranium bombs *seem* to be a little overpower in contrast to their Plutonium counterparts.  It'll take a few more plays to deeper analyze this.  But all in all, this a really great game which was very well received by my different gaming groups.

Edit:
After 6 plays I stick to a rating of 8 (with a tendency towards 9).  I've played the game with 2, 3 and 4 players and would strongly recommend it with 3 and 4.  2 player works as well but is a little bit more predictable and with less interesting dynamics.

RATING: 4
Below-average worker placement game where you build bombs for victory points, with some good ideas but poor development. Your workers come in three types: laborers, scientists and engineers, with some actions requiring or benefiting from specific ones. The game is unique in that you may place them all at once if you have enough buildings (just one worker in the central board), and you must spend a turn to get them back.

This causes the early game to be a building race. Once your engine is running, the only thing that may stop it is an opponent using your buildings (and thus preventing you to use them yourself) via the espionage action. It didn't happen much in my two games, but I can see how this may rapidly become very annoying. The blocking may go on indefinitely, especially with neutral workers, which are only removed when the owner of the building chooses to retrieve his own workers. Then the same opponent or another may have an opportunity to occupy those buildings again before the owner takes another turn, and so on. Bombing a building is also possible, but I haven't seen it happen, because it harms both players involved. And it would just slow the game down.

If all goes well, the players may get all their workers from the general supply too quickly and even take some one-use neutral workers every turn. Depending on the buildings a player has, he can deplete almost the entire supply of neutral workers in one turn, leaving nothing to the other players. This, along with the blocking of buildings, makes the timing of worker retrieval perhaps too important.

However, what sometimes (apparently too often) breaks the game is the completely random order in which the buildings appear - a problem that would have been easily solved by a competent designer by simply splitting the deck into three or four stacks. My second game had a strain of mines in the beginning, leading to a surplus of yellow cakes for everyone and no efficient way to convert them into uranium or plutonium.

Yet another negative point is that the game ends abruptly. It's a race to 50 points, but as most bombs are worth a lot of points, the victory condition might as well be to make three bombs first.

The board is ugly and the art style does not appeal to me. The production quality is good, but wooden or plastic pieces would have worked better than the cardboard tokens for workers. I find the theme dull, but it works reasonably well and is somewhat novel, even though it serves the old and tired efficiency exercise of resource conversion.

Really enjoyed my first game of Manhattan Project. Unlike many "build your empire more efficiently than your opponent" games there's real player interaction, both in terms of blocking players, directly bombing them, or using espionage to temporarily use their buildings.

In fact I'd have given it a 10 except for the rule that the first person past the points target immediately wins, even if the round isn't finished.

It's always nice to find a worker placement game with a difference and Manhattan Project certainly ticks that box. The theme is great and perfectly implemented, while the worker placement is ingenious and strategic. On top of this you have some great screw you mechanisms, while the lack of knowledge about who really has what score towards the end does a great job of building tension.

Brilliant game, everything about this is very clever but you really must pick the right balance of buildings in front of you

the only reason I can't quite say this is a 10 is because a) you play to a set vps limit and this feels as though the end game conditions could have been done in a neater way and b) I think the buildings would have been better if they came out in a more staggered way (for example like in powergrid or with three shuffled decks like many other games)

Edit* the two player game is awful. If one player takes both early factories then they dominate. Essentially as soon as one person has a factory advantage they are able to take a monetary advantage and also planes... Then they can bomb the other and also buy more factories before they get cheap enough to offer the weaker player a way in

i really wanted to like this game.    I guess what I don't like is that for a worker placement game, you aren't really competing for the same spots.  This game is more about building up your tableau and going to it.   There are less shared spaces to go to, seems like player interaction isn't that great.   And it feels like whoever gets the best buildings into their tableau is going to win.   I've only played a few times, so maybe I'm just not getting the strategy.   But to me, this feels more like playing solitaire than I'd like.

A fairly typical Kickstarter funded game: attractively presented, but fundamentally a simple worker placer with some direct conflict elements in the air strikes mechanism. There's some light fun here, but you can't take it too seriously. Air strikes are presumably intended to rein in leaders, but can be used quite arbitrarily, it just jars in a game about action efficiency. Comparing this with the much better Russian Railroads clearly illustrates the difference between well meaning amateur and professional production.

Brisk mid-weight worker placement that provides a good bang for the buck.

The Manhattan project is a light worker placement game similar in game weight to Stone Age. I like how adding cards to my tableau creates new places my workers can work as well as the cards I choose are building a resource production engine. The espionage action is neat how it allows a player to work on an opponent's building which clogs the building so they can't use it. I only played it once, mind you. Nobody bombed anyone else. I imagined that if I chose to bomb someone else, it would hurt not only the bombee, but that it would slow me down too because I did not choose a productive work area on the main board--so that maybe the other players not involved would be the greatest beneficiaries of a bombing action. Overall, I didn't find the game compelling. I do appreciate how the theme is original and executed well in the game, but it isn't a theme I like. I will play it again, but I am not in a rush to do so and I don't feel the need to get a copy of the Manhattan Project.

This is not a multi-player solitaire euro. You will be directly interfering with the other players. If you are behind, you must collude with other players to pull back the leader. It is a race to the finish, and there is no second place! Have fun!

On the surface it's a great worker placer, but there are a few problems with it.  It has a great theme and lovely artwork, particularly on the building and bomb cards (the bombs even have their own names), the workers are also very 'pickup-able'.  The idea of the game is to create raw radioactive material to convert into Plutonium/Uranium with which to build bombs.  The supply line is fairly long and complex and offers lots of ways to get to your goal, some people will concentrate on cashflow, whereas some may concentrate on raw materials and it isn't clear to me after a few plays what is the best strategy, so that's good.

My main problem with this one is the attacking mechanic - the players can invest money and workers in creating bombers and fighter planes to attack the other players, but it's a very arbitrary system with little actual mechanic to it - if you have more bombers, you get to blow up the other players' stuff - which is poor and sort of ruins the flow and rhythm of the game.  Still, it's a nice game and well worth a play, maybe try to ignore the attacking mechanics to see if it improves things.

The controversial leader-bashing air stike mechanics is not a problem here.  _Formalized_ pacts are included in the rules not without a reason...  And you can prepare yourself against air strikes.

The real problem is that the game is very bland.  Standard worker placement mechanics works ok, but you always have so many possible good options that you don't feel tension or 'tightness' of the design.  On the contrary - every player shuffles - almost on mass scale - his workers and resources back and forth, always busy with exercising many options at hand.  To the point of the game becoming a race.  And I clearly dislike racing element in economic/optimization games.

With 5 players downtime is annoying.  If you want to try the game, give it a shot with max. 4 players.

The theme is strong mostly on paper.  You don't feel it so well during the play.

Pretty classic worker placement game, but with the twist of being able to screw with other players pretty heavily. The bombing aspect didn't seem so bad compared to the spying. Things can just work out in such a way that you basically never have access to certain very important things. And the only way to stop this is to play less efficiently and slow yourself down, which will absolutely lose you the game, since it's a race. And it's a weird race, the first person to hit the required number of victory points wins, there's no chance of equal turns. This is especially a problem since being the first player got you an advantage in options at the beginning and gives you a turn advantage in ending the game. The small amount of extra money you start with does little to make up for this. Overall just a game where things can come together in a way to make it seem like you can't do anything, which to me was no fun.

The Manhattan Project is my favorite worker placement game.

I love the engine building in this one: all players are trying to do the same thing, but the game provides multiple paths do so. And unlike many worker placement games, there's always something to do - even if it is just pulling workers to get ready for a monster turn next time up.

It's also an underrated two-player game as the timing of worker placements and pulls become extremely important.

The only criticism is that the attacking mechanism (Air Strikes) can be abused by players who want to see a certain player lose. I recommend not playing this game with players like that.

I see this game being a long-time if not permanent part of my collection.

I surprisingly to me won a 5 player game (we were all 1st timers)... however as my other geek buds bgg comments indicate this game has problems

one I didn't see mentioned though that I don't like is that the game ends immediately once one play reaches the goal amount of VPs... no equal number of turns or something like all other players get one more turn

I also partly won because one player attacked another player near game end and that may have determined who won (though if neither of us had been attacked I probably still would have won).

I also won w/a very boring strategy... I only bought 3 boring buildings (all for free using the scientist I started with as I was in the 4th player seat)... one to produce yellow cake, one to turn yellow cake into uranium, and one to produce aircraft which I used to produce fighters as defense.  I never spied, I had fewer workers than most players, and least number of buildings.  Player w/the most buildings was furthest turns behind from winning... and also got spied on a lot because he had good buildings

Great worker-placement game with a fun theme. The big drawback is that the game feels like it ends too early. Fixable by house-ruling the point cap for game end, but still there is something amiss with the bombs and how many points they give. 

Other than that, fun game with a real cold war feel in the player interaction (you build bombers, I will respond with fighters etc.) and just a lot of build up and tension.

RATING: 5
Not a bad game, but the attacking kills this one for me. Players can bomb each others' buildings which sucks after you've worked to build it. That's fine- I can take some interaction, but it just makes the game take longer. The person whose building has been attacked now has to rebuild and the player who built the bombs now has to switch back to the win condition. It just makes it drag. Bleh

Need the Nations expansions for more Manhattan goodness! The Second Stage adds a few more elements that opens up choices. One seeming flaw in the game is the building market where because of the randomness in the card shuffle, sometimes particular groups of buildings don't come out initially forcing players to pursue alternative avenues to gain resources. But this mechanic works in the game's favour only because of the starting bonuses accorded to the second player onwards.

Initial Rating: 1.5 (March 2013)

What a disappointment, I had huge hopes for this one but the game is total crap as it is. It feels underdeveloped and the way it handles the worker placement mechanic is clearly broken. The first player has an unbelievable advantage and will always win the game as he can play all his workers without giving the other players time to react. The last player never had any interesting things to do and never had the chance to spy. 

The theme is interesting (and was what called me to the game) but it feels pasted on, the game components are very sturdy and nice to touch (and that’s why it receive a 1.5 rating). I feel there can be a good game in here but for now it is a compilation of good ideas.  

I cannot believe the game is, as of today, ranked here in BGG at the 269 spot, which leads me to think that perhaps the player that read and explained the rules made a mistake somewhere. I will read the rules today and see for myself. I really hope that there is a BIG rules mistake or else I did a BIG mistake buying this game. As it is, The Manhattan Project is the worst worker placement game out there.

Yesterday I read the rules and (fortunately) I found a big rules mistake. The way we played it, a player could use all is workers in the central board, blocking all other players.

I will give it a new try soon, for now I`m deleting the rating until I can give it a fair one.

At last I got to play this with 4 players and the correct set of rules. The verdict? I like the game :D. As I love worker placement games, it is natural that I like The Manhattan Project. I really like that there are no rounds in the game, instead a player can play one worker in the central board and all he wants in his buildings or retire all his workers. This adds another level of complexity to consider and I really dig it. It that sense this game is (somewhat) similar to Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar but (for me) this game is deeper and superior so I like it more.  Also The Manhattan Project offers 3 different kinds of workers, this is the first time I have seen this in a worker placement game. :thumbsup:

I´m a little worried about the attacks, they are necessary but it seems that if you attack, you let yourself open to an attack. What I’m saying is that attacking cost too much. Also, usually, the attack mechanism serves to stop the current leader and (nowadays) I don’t particularly enjoy the “bash the leader” situation. I also feel the game ends too abruptly.

In conclusion, a good worker placement game, not my favorite (Agricola, Caylus, Dungeon Lords and Pret a Porter are superior) but still good. I would play it from time to time and I plan to keep my copy.

Interesting worker placement mechanic where it takes a turn to retrieve your peeps.  My first game, a 3er, didn't see a single airstrike so that entire part of the game went unused even though Sean had max planes and bombers.  Even with that portion unexplored, the game didn't grab me.  I'm willing to give it another go, but I don't think I'll request it.

Great worker placement game, love the historical theme. The worker placement mechanic has a nice twist and works really well.

Manhattan Project is a very enjoyable worker placement game with some unique twists in the mechanics (e.g., being able to leave your workers out for several turns). The variety of cards and ability to play peacefully or aggressively make for tons of repeat playability. This is fairly accessible for a game with such depth and strategy.

Light-hearted game of atom bomb building in the 1940s. Kind of a hybrid euro/ameritrash; I've played other such hybrids, like Fire & Axe and Bootleggers, but this is really the first hybrid worker-placement game I've tried. It's got the euro worker-placement strategy influences but with a strong dose of theme-mechanism connections (bombers that can destroy buildings, nations with appropriate special powers, espionage, etc) and of course (appropriate given the theme) much more confrontational than most euros.

What stuck out for me is the unusual game rhythm (no rounds, rather, you keep putting workers out until you're out and have to recall all of them) and different categories of workers (laborers, engineers, scientists).

Art design is awesome in a 1940s retro/propoganda style, reminds me of the art from Fallout minus the sci-fi parts. Overall production is very high quality and sturdy, the worker chits are seriously practically bricks, I've never seen such thick chits.

For some reason I wasn't supper excited about the theme. On my first game, the initial motivation and choices to make were not very clear. I felt unsure what I should do.

Also, the hidden scoring and suddenness of game end left a bad taste in my mouth. I had no idea how close we were to the end and no idea who was even really in the running. 

The take-that element was interested and I can see why you would want to hide scoring to prevent king bashing, but without knowing who was leading, I couldn't do much other than to maximize my own goals.

In our 5 player game, there wasn't many scoring opportunities. The end was sudden and unexpected. There was no alert to who was going to possibly end the game and no way to prepare or switch strategies.

Ordinarily I am not a big fan of the worker placement genre, but TMP hits just the right mix of cute graphics, a smart theme and brutal take that game play.  The typical blocking of opportunities with your own workers is augmented by the ability to bomb another player's economic engine into ruins or to infest it with spies.  The end result is the rare Euro which delivers a strong narrative to go with its gameplay.

Always start feedback with the positive: Manhattan Project features great artwork. Ok, so much for that. 
Too bad, that the gameplay is only feasible for Ameritrash lovers. Manhattan Project is one of the worst cases of crossover games that nullify 80% of euro-mechanism based gameplay by adding one core element of direct player targeting that severely punishes successful players. Better don't stand out, don't build anything too obviously efficient. Otherwise, you are guaranteed to be the first loser as you have a large target cross on your forehead. Alien Frontiers suffered from the same design decision.
The single remarkable element of the Euro core is the decision when to take back workers although most of the time players just do it when they have none left. This mechanism was implemented in a far superior way in Tzolkin a year later.

I like the take on worker placement here. There's an element of waiting to block people as well as tableau building. The espionage also adds a lot. Definitely on the light side of worker placement, but has some interesting interaction that sets it apart, as well as a very well executed theme.

Hands down my favorite worker placement game. The innovative mechanic to take back workers or push your workforce just a bit further leads to so many gut-wrenching decisions.

Not a fan of the bombing other players mechanic.  In a 4 person game, I was the third person and, due to the way the cards came out, I was shut out of special workers (scientists and construction guys) for many turns... didn't feel like a balanced start.   

Update:  Looking at the forums, it looks like I was burned by an incorrect set-up since the 2 university buildings didn't have the correct back colors, so they weren't part of the starting (random) six buildings in our game!

It's complex enough to be rich, but so serious to be dry. A very good worker placement game/engine building game that has really good timing aspects to it. There's less blocking than normal worker placement games, but it sometimes leaves actions you want to take, less desirable because of the benefits it provides to other players.

It has intensity, tactics, and strategy. It will keep you thinking.

Update: I've come to the conclusion that 5 players is too slow. I like that the game goes up to 5, but it really should be limited to 4 for the best experience. I lowered my score for this game due to this.

Both the race aspect of the end game and the timing of putting and retrieving your workers makes for a cool puzzle.

Interesting worker placement. Second game I've seen with the whole "place or retreive workers" gimmick. This one's a lot more forgiving/less tight than Tzolk'in though. Mostly due to the abundance of worker pawns you can get.
Next time I'm playing, loads more personal buildings to fully take advantage of this :p

Two playres can be rather mean. Mostly due to the air strike mechanic. Blocking buildings unless they spend a lot of money on repairing and denying bomb load points. Rough.

Being an avid worker placement game player (just look at my list of games) I have to say that Manhattan Project delivered on all fronts.  The game plays so smoothly, and after about 3ish plays, I think I had the game down pat, but it still comes to surprise me how far I felt I was mid game from winning only to turn out we're neck and neck by the end.  Even with AP prone players, the game felt fast.  I think partially that is due to the fact that the game encourages you to build "machines" to further your agenda.  So AP players still have a ton of choices, but the good ones are generally laid out for them and unless someone is contesting the same exact strategy, there is little conflict and they can finish their turns fast enough to not bother the rest of the group.  The game also allows a bit of plan B where if your main strat fails, you can still rely on some clever moves to either slow your opponents down, or catch up with some lucky card draws, or just out right get lucky and pick the route less traveled and win the game through no contest.  The vast array of ways to win in the game makes it a very fun game to try your luck / wit.  The next game usually boils down to, "will they play the same way I'm thinking?  Or maybe I'll try something new and hope the bomb cards flip as I expect them?  Or will the other players fight so much I can sneak in this not so popular strategy and actually still win?"  That kind of meta gaming is what keeps me coming back.  I play only with the expansion, and I highly recommend everyone have this game in their collection along with the expansion.

Eh.  This is okay but other worker placement type games do it better and are more enjoyable.

The game play is good and there are a lot of options for how to use your workers.  Also, it's possible to have quite a few workers available for selecting among the available options which allows for some good choices.  The feature whereby players choose either to place workers or remove workers during a game turn is nice and allows some flexibility in how one develops their game plan.  This also allows for interesting opportunities as players can try to align the flow of their game to alternate with that of other players (i.e. when he/she is removing workers, I'm ready to start placing workers or, just as their ready to start placing workers, I go in and block the prime options).

The espionage option allows a player to use other players buildings thus locking that player out from his own buildings.  Being locked out of your own buildings can really limit your options and depending on how long your locked out (not always your decision) it can certainly have an impact on your game plan.  Only one player at a time can occupy and and use the espionage space.  It's very likely that this could be dominated by one or two players and if you happen to be out of sync with when this spot is available then you can really be screwed and this game won't be any fun.

The scoring seems odd.  Rather than a smooth, steady climb up a point scale, players earn points in large chunks at a time.  For example (and I believe this to be accurate), points are earned by building bombs which can net a player anywhere from 10 to 30 points at a time.  Note that the first player to accumulate 45 points wins the game.

It seems that the artwork is a big draw for the game and it IS very nice; quite good in fact.  However the style doesn't "wow" me, especially compared to how others have marveled over it.

The theme doesn't really work for me.  This has nothing to do with morality or whether or not it's offensive (believe me), it's just odd.  Yes, it's definitely different but that's not a driving factor for me.

The quality of the components is good.  The quality of the individual worker tiles, being of very thick cardboard, is very impressive. 

Writing these comments has made me think more about the game.  Perhaps more experience with the game would increase my rating but I'm not going to actively seek out that experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Has some good ideas, but really feels like it needed some more development. The place/take back workers mechanism could've been interesting, but seems to just come down to gaming when to let someone else into espionage. I suspect it could be a lot more interesting if the espionage mechanic was more involved than a single space on the board, which would also solve the problem that it becomes a case of taking the same few moves to run your engine later in the game (it reminds me of Cuba a bit in this regard).

There are other more minor issues with the buildings - some seem to exist only to fill up the building track - and the planes; the few times I've played that aspect of the game has just come down to who gets the biggest fighter factory.

So some nice ideas, but pretty flawed execution, and this is definitely one I tend to avoid.

A very rewarding and strategical game. Player interactivity is at an all time here with the ability to sabotage your opponent's buildings as well as the ability to use their own buildings to your benefit while simultaneously denying them from using their buildings. Other interesting facets of the game include the ability to recall workers at any time. The theme is excellent and works very well in the setting. My only gripe is with the balancing of the nations' powers. Get the yellow cake. Blow stuff up.

Just felt like so many other euro-worker placement games.

Get more workers.
Get yellow cubes.
Get coins.

Convert cubes, coins and workers into points...

A few years back this would have been okay but there seem so many other games that do this as well as, or better than, this one it's hard to get excited about.

Nice theme idea but it is paper thin.

08-07-2014 - WORKER PLACEMENT (bar code)  I didn't do too well in this one I don't think, I don't remember.  So what do I like in games?  Well, I like an interesting mix of mechanics that offer me cool and different choices, and it's a huge plus if I'm building something or making something better.  This game had a bit of the latter I suppose, but mostly it was just a worker placement mechanic.  And for me, there are other games for that.  6

I liked my first play a lot.
I am wondering now of some of the bombs are either overpowered or that luck of the draw can be deciding.

This could be dealt with but I have to play this again.
The game takes too long if luck plays a part in this.

I have played the card game recently and remember that the amount of lick in that one despite it short playing time robbed all my excitement and joy from it.

I like the interaction of the game. It certainly doesn't feel like playing a typical worker-placement game. I did think it dragged a little towards the end as you get quite a bit of workers to place all at once, so people sit there tinkering on their display for a while.

RATING: N/A
The Manhattan Project is a low-luck, mostly open information efficiency game in which players compete to build and operate the most effective atomic bomb program. Players do not "nuke" each other, but conventional air strikes are allowed against facilities.

The game features worker placement with a twist: there are no rounds and no end-of-round administration. Players retrieve their workers when they choose to or are forced to (by running out).

An espionage action allows a player to activate and block an opponent's building, representing technology theft and sabotage.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
One of my favorite games. 
Love the little worker designs.
The only problem with this game, though, is that bombing doesn't really do much to hold another player back - it's pretty easy for them to just buy a new building instead of repairing!

Very fun game nonetheless.

Very thematic worker placement with brutal attrition through direct attacks and a generally sudden ending.

I'd probably play it again but I won't bother acquiring this one.

I wouldn't mind playing again now that I better understand how everything works.  Three different types of workers of which each are needed/required to do different types of things.  The card deck and how it comes out leaves a bit to be desired in some ways as I'd prefer a gradual deck of improved factories/mines instead of randomness in how they come out.  It works, just not my preference.  Still pondering the bombing concept and how to use it well.  Can see how that might annoy a number of people as well though.

BOMBE!
In diesem Arbeiter-Einsetz-Spiel haben die Spieler 3 verschieden artige Arbeiter (die erst im laufe des Spiels verfügbar werden). Mit Ingenieuren kann man billig Häuser bauen, mit Wissenschaftlern Uran und Plutonium herstellen. Um schlussendlich eine Bombe zu bauen, die Siegpunkte bringt brauche ich sowohl Ingenieure, als auch Wissenschaftler.
Im Spiel muss man durch die Arbeiterfelder Yellow-Cake und Geld sammeln. Aus diesen beiden Ressourcen macht man mit einem anderen Feld dann Uran oder Plutonium und daraus dann mit weiteren Aktionsfeldern Bomben, die die Siegpunkte darstellen (je mehr Ressourcen die kosten, desto mehr SP!).
Durch Bau von Gebäuden kann man die Ressourcenausbeute weiter erhöhen, vor allem, da das einsetzen von Arbeitern auf eigenen Gebäuden keine Aktion kostet. So konnte ich gegen Ende des Spiels innerhalb eines Zuges einen Arbeiter aufs Brett stellen und alle anderen 11 auf eigene Gebäude und das war toll!
Leider finde ich das Spiel nicht so toll. Zum einen gibt es hier und da thematische Lücken. Zum anderen zieht sich der Start sehr, da man ohne Gebäude auf die schwachen Aktionen auf dem Brett angewiesen ist. Gefühlt muss man erst seine Arbeiter in die Universität schicken um an Ingenieure und Wissenschaftler zu kommen, dann baut man massenweise Gebäude und Flugzeuge (man kann damit Gegner angreifen oder Angriffe abwehren) um dann die Ressourcenmaschiene zu starten und Bomben (Siegpunkte) zu bauen.
Nein, leider durchgefallen!

Finally got to play recently and while I love the theme, the gameplay just left me wanting a bit more.  The expansion to add a country's identity to the game is a must.  I wanted to love this game but it didn't happen.  It's a worker placement game of course but with so many worker placement games out there, and with all of that style sharing similar mechanics, there are much better ones out there to play (like Lords of Waterdeep or Tzolkin).

I wish the worker placement on the main board for this game was a bit more claustrophobic. Most of the time even if someone goes to a spot I wanted to go to there is a second spot that is only marginally worse for me (one exception being the espionage space).

While I initially thought the espionage and air strikes spaces felt superfluous, I think they really help to bring down the leader down to size (you may have to go all out if you plan to make bombing effective though, as otherwise you'll waste too many actions performing air strikes), although since you only need to make about 3 bombs to win the game that can sometimes be hard to figure out. Also, espionage makes timing when you pull off your workers actually matter rather than being able to alternate between using all your buildings in a round followed by pulling everyone back.

Therefore, I think this game while having a very Euro engine works best with players that like high interaction, as otherwise the alternation of putting all your workers on the board followed by pulling everyone off next turn makes this game feel pretty formulaic.

Overall, I think the design of this 90-minuteish game could have been a lot cleaner (there are a lot of steps you have to perform before your actions materialize as points, and some spots on the board feel almost unnecessary), but the unique theme and a good amount of interaction without being overboard (barring someone dedicating all their time to increasing fighters/bombers and focus firing someone out of spite) makes this a pretty good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A solid 8.0 after 1 play.  I really like the way you use workers in this game and can use them all on one turn as long as you have the right buildings available. 

The one downside of the game which may end up lowering my rating is the amount of action paralysis this game can cause on some players. My wife is often prone to AP and towards the end of this game her turns take a long time because you have so many options.

Probably my favorite worker placement game. I like the mix of personal-board engine building and main-board key action fights. The theme is exceptionally well integrated, and good graphic design (particularly on the main board) helps explain the flow of the game from mining raw materials to assembling bombs for VPs. "Multiple paths to victory" is something of a stretch, as VPs only come via bombs, but there are lots of ways to tailor your engine to pursue that goal in various ways.

There are some direct-conflict mechanisms (espionage, air raids) that may be off-putting to pure-Euro worker placement fans.

I think there's one significant shortcoming in the graphic design, in that player board "any worker is acceptable" is indicated by a "?" worker face while the main board indicates the same by showing no face. The main board should use the same iconography as the player boards. Once you know the game, it's a non-issue, but it's been a hurdle nearly every time I've taught the game.

Wanted to like this, but struggled.

Espionage and bombers very confrontational and frustrating, without many ways to avoid it. Having to time your actions can be used to avoid massive espionage against you but it's not satisfying to do so.

Scoring very bursty, leading to me scoring zero points when the game ended, which was frustrating. I like a number to accompany my efforts, even when I lose...

Rest of the game was a fairly fun worker placement though.

This was better than I expected but I am worried about a situation where a player getting ganged up on by 2 attacks in a row will result in an effectual elimination from the game especially if the player has no money on hand then gets their money making factories bombed to all hell. They will be waiting to pick up some scraps from somewhere and then fated to trail behind the other players the rest of the game without any real hope of catching up, or posing any kind of threat to the other players.

For me, this game is better than Agricola.  The blocking mechanism is better, yet the mechanics are intuitive and the games are tight.  Some might complain that if you've played this a lot, a new player can still give you a run for your money and not like that.  Well, I'd disagree with that.  As an experienced player, you have definite advantages over a new player.  But they can still pick it up and do well.  And to me, that speaks of a well-made game.  You don't need to be a veteran gamer to enjoy this, but if you are, there is plenty of depth and difficult decision-making to be had.  Best of all, it's all about playing the other people less than the system itself.

This is among the first modern board games I got into. I got stuck trying to think up a username for BGG (well I thought about it for 5 sec and got stuck) and saw this on the shelf and voila! I hadn't played it for quite a while and because of this was even thinking of trading it away. Those thoughts have been banished from my mind after these two plays. Still a great game. Very take that at two player and sometimes the game length can be a bit long two player if you constantly bomb each other (which we did ). Really enjoyed the game and will keep it for now. 

The Nations expansion for me is a must have, playing asymmetric nations (albeit with only one individual attribute/action) gives it that little bit of extra flavour. I haven't looked at the second stage expansion as other than the extra nations there didn't seem to be much in it that would improve the game. Anyone played it and can recommend otherwise?

For an extra bit of thematic themeness I would recommend listening to N-plants by Biosphere and Atomic by Mogwai.

Fun, streamlined euro with a great theme!  Just what I like in a euro game. :D

Played a few times with 2 now.  It's good, but not as good as with 3 or 4 (and I bet 5 is also great): There's just more room for negotiating and not as much one-vs-one conflict in games with more than 2p.  Still, it's a quality game, and it's always exciting to find a new fun euro!

The only downside is that I say "yellowcake" so often during the game that I always want to go eat cake afterward!  :laugh:

Had this been completely up to me, I would have kept this game, but my husband disliked it to the point where I could never get him to play. He can't articulate why. I suspect it's a combination of this being a race game (which we don't generally like) and the mean factor. We never used the espionage and air strike spaces because they were too attacky, which made us feel like we were missing a large part of the game.

I don't mind a little bit of take that, but not in a game where it spoils the fun.  The fun of Manhattan Project (and it is fun) is in building your engine.  Not only can your opponents slow you down from building your engine (which I do not mind), but they can bring it to a grinding halt, resulting in runaway leaders and the functional equivalent of missing turns.  Even this would be acceptable is there were a way to keep opponents from doing this, but is not always possible.

The first play was fun, but after 3 plays I'm unlikely to play again, the reasons being:

1) There aren't many paths you can take; I won my first game by doing the 'obvious' things in order, and couldn't find a significantly different path to victory in my next two plays.

2) I like the idea of interaction via espionage and air strikes, and these played a big role in my 3rd game (which I also won). But really these bogged down the game and slowed it so much (e.g. my opponent and I would espionage on each other escalating to level 6 and blocking the other's options since they only had one move on main board and few left on their own, and likewise with bombing and causing damage to money supply, slowing down repairs). So by the end we just wanted it over even though it was a very close game (I won, but opponent could win on their next turn).

Still, I did have fun on the first game, so I'd say worth trying out.

Cool game, and very different feeling considering the amount of worker placement games I play. I definitely like it. The directions are great, if somewhat repetitive. The components are nice, the gameplay is relatively simple and the theme is the best part. I've only played with 2, and I think it worked out pretty well with that number. Although the interaction would be much better with more players, I'd be concerned about the downtime. Even with 2, there's a pretty good deal of downtime between many turns, especially if you have players prone to AP. Speaking of interaction, the game felt a lot like multiplayer solitaire at times, which isn't bad, but sort of unexpected considering the theme. I can see how they've tried to implement interaction (air strikes, sharing resources, negotiation, espionage, etc.), but those things aren't happening every turn. Don't get me wrong--it's not a Feld, but it's not Ameritrashy either, if that's your bag. Since I'm a eurogamer, I'm not particularly bothered by the lack of interaction, but it's something that should be pointed out, since I think the interaction level is somewhat oversold. It might not sound like it, but I really like this game. My wife likes it more than me, but I'd be happy to get it back to the table sometime soon.

Good theme, I saw the theme ahead of the mechanics.
The game plays well except in two cases:
You get a bad shuffle on the resource cards which can starve everyone of resources.  The deck probably needs an A deck / B deck approach.  It has mini A deck of starter cards.  
Like power grid, you can end up with a lot of cards no one benefits from buying so they just sit there.
However, minor starving can be compensated for and there are different strategies for winning.  We had 3 approaches going in our game and almost all of us were one card from winning at the end.
I wanted to play it more but there was only one copy at BGG with the publisher.
I didn't like the nation cards as much.  I also thought the spy action caused the game to come to a stop for a few minutes every time it came available.
The game has a very clever mechanism for simultaneous play most the time but it freezes up while someone is picking who to use their spies on.
I enjoyed it and will play it again.  It was one of three games at BGG which felt "new" and not a mashup of elements of other games.

A really interesting take on worker placement games.  Like the theme, the actions, workers blocking spaces, the espionage action.  For gameplay, I'd happy rate this an 8, but the graphic design really holds it back.  The art style is okay (not a huge fan), but the poor colour choices means that it is very difficult for those with red-green colour blindness to play with more than 2 players.  Can't rate it higher than a 7 as a result.

I love the unique theme, and the production quality is amazing. Its a clever worker placement, but after more plays it isn't as smooth as I first thought. There is more player interaction, but it can lead to what is basically player elimination. It is long with a full compliment of players. And with less players, the duties of bombing back the leader can let another sneak away with the win who doesn't contribute tight resources to the bashing.

The concept of this game is fantastic, but it doesn't feel well balanced.  The early leader seems to pull away to victory with no way for other players to fight back.  This could be mitigated by allowing battle winners to deplete uranium/plutonium and/or apportion damage to multiple cards/buildings.  Affecting only a single card just isn't powerful enough for battles to be useful.

03/27/12 Played a three-player game in 91 minutes. 
The Manhattan Project is noteworthy for its unique theme and worker placement twist (the "call back"). Unfortunately the theme doesn't really interest me. Pity, for its *very* well thought out. As to the twist of call back. I can't fathom what real world item the publisher is trying to mimic. Why would any country send people to school, do research, build aircraft, mine ore, etc. then one day say, hey guys, why don't you all go on vacation until we need you again. Huh?!  Now maybe there's something in the rulebook about this I wasn't told. Like maybe labor relation troubles, a recession, shifting national politics, or some other concoction. But as is its just a gimmick. Overall I enjoyed the game, and I'd be willing to play it again. Though for the reasons I've stated I can't bring myself to rate it more than "6". 

Side note, with five players and at least two of them constantly sending air strikes against others I could see the game going on for quite a long time. For everyone's research would grind to a halt and you'd spend all your time doing repair.

Solid worker placer, but nothing really special or outstanding in the genre. It seemed to me clear from the start that uranium bombs are much more efficient to produce than plutonium. At least, it gave me an easy win. Try again some time.

Amazing game, untill the point is the only game Ill consider to rate it as a 10. Great theme and it feels all over the game, awesome strategy, variety, great compontents. And what is important: it feels the tension of the nuclear race, and it is SO much fun. Nothing bad this far: amazing game.

Great artwork and theme but the game itself feels unfinished. There are interaction but only as a bash the leader mechanic. Unlike games such as Trough the Ages you have nothing to gain when spending resourses attacking someone. This discourages military actions. The draft also feels lacking due to the rightmost cards costing to much to take.

After one play it got on my wishlist. I usually don't like worker placement games that much. But this one I really like. Lots of interaction, not so much scripted play. It beats Caylus, Pillars of the Earth way behind in the dust.

The lack of "gaeturns" is great. Place your guys or get 'em back. And you have to watch the other players. The 'spionage' action keep you on your toes. Oh, and I really like the artwork. If you like worker placement games you have to check this one.

RATING: 7
This is a really solid worker-placement game.  However, in an abundant field of really solid worker-placement games, it fails for me to really stand out as being especially spectacular.  Probably my favorite thing about it is that the art is incredibly well done both in terms of visual appeal and functionality.  The iconography on the board and cards is very simple to understand and makes learning/teaching the game so much easier.  I also like that for each available action on the board, there are multiple spaces available with varying costs/payout - very clever.  I like the Espionage action, but I'm not overly fond of the bombing/repair aspect.  It's often more profitable to follow the repair action than take it directly, so I feel like using my one board action to repair is often wasteful and in many cases it can be cheaper to just build a new building.  The separate turns for placing and picking up is interesting in theory.  However, while it does provide for some timing and blocking planning, it's just doesn't feel as well executed in play as other games which use this such as Tzolk'in.  During much of the game I have enough buildings to use most or all of my workers, so spending one turn placing all of them, then the next turn picking up just feels a bit awkward.  Using my different worker types and buildings to chain cool combos together is very enjoyable, but if I'm able to efficiently use all of my workers in one turn, then I spend half the game just picking them up again.  The building costs are also inconsistent in that two buildings which provide the same output can have higher/lower input costs -- seeing an identical "cheaper" building come out just after you bought one is frustrating.  The deck should be staged so better buildings come out later in the game.  I do really appreciate the play length.  The play time on the box is often wildly optimistic but my few plays of this, even with a full 4 or 5 players, I've been able to teach and play in about 90 minutes, which is great.  Unfortunately, the game end often feels a bit sudden and unfulfilling.  One player finally builds a big bomb that gets them over the limit and that's it - game over.  Overall, it's a good game and I can see the appeal, but after a few plays I feel mostly done with it.  I can't imagine each game-to-game play feeling much different from this point.

A cool worker placement game about building and testing bombs. I really enjoy the way you educate workers into becoming engineers and scientists, and how you can also temporarily gain neutral workers of all three types.

Another interesting aspect is how you only have one action on the main board, however you can place workers on as many buildings as you own, making this all about being the most efficient and getting the most out of your turn as well as choosing the optimal time to take back your workers.

Very enjoyable.

Easy to get stuck in a bad flow, sometimes through no fault of our own, and impossible to pull yourself out from it. Quite bad runaway leader problem, and bombing facilities doesn't help if the leader too has invested in military. Also, with 4 or 5 players, there should definitely be an extra spot for espionage. A pity - I really wanted to like this game.

I probably shouldn't rate this after 1 play, but it made a real impression.  Probably the best worker placement game I've tried.  It balances a nice economy building mechanism, individual abilities in the form of cards, a unique worker recall mechanism, and excellent player interaction.  You know a game is good when you go into it expecting to dislike it and come away with your opinion reversed.

Pretty good Euro.  Like the different worker types and the 'only get them back when you choose to' and blocking others.  Attacking others underused because it kills your turn and makes you vulnerable, taking away the usefulness.  A pity.  Seems to miss a bit of a 'spark' to put it over the edge: maybe a 'global tension' track, where the leading player could lose by triggering nuclear war?

Just when I thought I had all the worker placement games I could want along comes this gem. Mechanically, there's not a lot that's innovative and game-play will feel familiar. BGG folk are drawing analogies to Caylus. But I think it's more like Puerto Rico blended some of the worker placement of Caylus. There are also elements that remind me of Flying Buffalo Inc's Nuclear War. That aside, there are some nice differences (like blocking worker actions on the main board and bomber attacks against other players). The theme is well integrated but the mechanics are definitely Euro-esque. Adding the Nations card expansion will appeal to players who are craving something a little less Euro-like. I'm starting to appreciate direct player interaction again so this one gets high marks for venturing into that territory, along with an excellent use of theme. Player boards seem a bit of an afterthought compared to the rest of the components. I'm not a fan of the uranium/plutonium resource track. We've got bits for yellowcake, why not uranium and plutonium? But all in all, a solid release.

After one play (5 players):

I really like this game. I feel it's incredibly well balanced. The reason I rate it so (relatively) low is because of the anticlimactic ending. There is little luck, almost everything is openly available to all players. It's a battle of balance and highly strategic. I've never played the revered Caylus but my search for WP games is sated for now!

*edit* I think changing it so that even in 4/5 player games the score is 60, this may make the game that much more enjoyable as it doesn't take one or two cards to all of a sudden declare a winner. The guy who won had tested a plutonium bomb (and got 6 pts), then flipped over and built a plutonium bomb that was 34 pts (now at 40), then loaded it (45). Game over. Noone saw that coming. Playing to 60 would have ramped up the tension. With this variant, may up the score.

*July 2012* Playing it more, there are various strategies available and multiple approaches. Not an easy game to win. Amazing design, I can't imagine why anyone would want to play another worker placement game again after playing this (Though Glenn Drover's Age of Empires intrigues me)

*Aug 2013* First play in a very long time. Used Nations expansion and the role cards from Second Stage. Even though the 4p game wrapped up in 2 hours, it felt like it goes on a bit too long. Despite this, a tight and well designed game.

Only played once, and wrong. :) Still, I liked what I saw and want to give it another shot! The two types of workers, temporary workers, and limited ability to both secure your own placement locations and steal that of others makes it unique in the WP genre.

Played a second time and found it rather solid. Bombing wrecked the competition at the end because people had been neglecting their fighters, proving that there are a lot of variables in this game and they are all important. It lacks the punch that makes me want to play it frequently (or again, even), but it's a neat, innovative game.

This is a tricky worker placement game with a delightfully different theme.  Variable workers are a nice touch and espionage is great fun (if slightly fiddly by needing to see other player boards).  Might end slightly too soon and the conflict might turn people off (Though, really, it's not a big deal if your stuff gets wrecked most of the time since it means they were invested in that instead of winning the game and it's easy to rebuild.)

I went to CarnageCon 2014 and played this as my second choice on that first Friday. I wasnt sure what to expect but I found myself in a game that I fell in love with. I'm quite glad I didnt get my first choice because this board game snared me in its clutches. I was lucky enough to get into another game that Saturday completely skipping another game that was my first choice and winning a copy. From Friday night to Sunday I played not one, not two, but FIVE games. Three games I played with five players and the last two I've gone head to head with my fiancee who has managed to beat me. I highly recommend this game and I will be looking at the expansions in the near future.

RATING: 9
For me, a worker placement with a fabulous theme and flavor.  A nuclear arms-race where you need to build your "engine" and plan ahead, but also where tactics play a big part.  Timing of your placement/withdrawal of workers is critical, as your opponents can use you to their advantage if you're not careful.  
Speaking of opponent-interaction, I think this game does a great job of balancing the amount and necessity of interaction.  Some people are afraid of this game because Oh noes! you can get blowed up!  But in my experience, I've had people attack me several times, and first of all, the attacker is wasting some resources and time to do so, and second, there are ways to work around the damage they caused.  so much so, that sometimes I don't even bother to repair; I just find a different way to do the things I want to, and can still end up winning.  So overall, it turns out to be well done, I think.  The only time I could see it being an issue is if people are really picking on someone because they're actually jerks, rather than because they're playing strategically in the game; then it could probably ruin the experience for people.
Otherwise, usually a very tight race with second place being a turn or two behind, LOVE the artwork and the workers especially.  One of my favorites.

By the mid-point of the game, you find yourself playing 12+ workers every other turn in a hectic race to turn yellow cake into a fissionables and fissionables into bombs!  This is the perfect blending of euro-style worker-placement and American-style screw-your-neighbor.  Highly interactive, thinky, strategic, tactical and all around fun.

After one play I am not convinced by this game. It should be a lot of fun but in our game it was just laborious.
After 2 plays I have yet to be convinced by this game. The buildings selection can get blocked by unwanted buildings which just slows the game down. In both games that I have played no-one has even come close to wanting to fire an air strike - which I had assumed was one of the more fun aspects to the game - as it is far more profitable to spy on someone eles's building and block it.

A solid worker placement game, but not one I want to play all the time. The only real variety is in the buildings that come out, and I suppose the number of players you play with. I also don't like that the air strikes feel completely tacked on, and in most games won't be used at all. Along with the sabatoge stuff, there seems to be a lot of extra chrome thrown into this game that just doesn't need to be there.

This might be a new favorite.  Reminds me so much of Caylus, and minimal luck too.  It is so competitive and the depth is amazing.  Cool theme, neat components.  Espionage is one of my favorite spaces in all boardgames.

Good worker placement game that is different from others such as Agricola. There isn't as much tension about being blocked by other players or having one action too little.

It's more of an engine builder and getting the production going.

Not so heavy either and around 1 hour playtime.

RATING: 7.5
I like the Manhattan Project a lot.  It is an innovative worker placement/engine building game for people who like to be able to mess with other people's strategies.

When I am reaching for a worker placement game, it is most often this one.  I like that I have to balance the engine that I am building with the notion that if I have a lynch pin piece in that engine, then another player can steal it or destroy it.  I like that buying the best building isn't always the best option.

RATING: 5
The Manhattan Project has a stylized, colourful art style that is very clear and rather adorable. The font is art deco, the building cards look like WWII recruitment posters, the bomb cards look like the Obama 'Hope' poster, and (best of all,) the workers look like Lego men!

tMP may be difficult introducing to new players as the game goals and paths to achieve them need thorough explanations, also the importance of constructing buildings and performing espionage should specifically be emphasized.

tMP is a flawed game and a few game tweaks may need to be made: Remove the Bribe feature. Instead make discarding the cheapest building of the Construction Track a custodial task done every time someone retrieves their workers. This will prevent the game from grinding to a halt as the Construction Track clogs with uninteresting buildings.

The main flaw with tMP is that players must do too many conversions to score victory points. Its a 6 step process!

1 play: Excellent game, good engine building aspect.  Wish there was some other ways to score VP.  Uranium, can be slower to use as a single viable option.  I think I'd prefer without nations, it would be interesting if you could buy which option you want (options nations offers).  I do like how its streamlined, but the above not going to far I think would improve the base game.  I like the option to slow down a player by bombing or holding temp workers.  It is interesting that all this can be fairly easily mitigated - which I like.

I like the theme of this game and it is a game I'd play again, however there were a few misses for me. The biggest part is that fact that it is too costly to attack other people. So really everyone just builds their fighters up and is done. A player can't afford to attack one guy, because the next guy will just win, since this seems to be a very close game like Power Grid.

RATING: 6
disappointed that we don't get to blow up the world/Japan. The theme is merely the part about building the bomb, possibly testing it. Which, "Manhattan Project" aptly alludes to, perhaps on a second reading, so used are we (am I) to synonymizing the term with nuclear war. The mechanics end up being rather quotidian: buying plants and deploying workers (generic and specialized) in order to obtain plutonium and uranium, in order to build bombs -- though I did appreciate the continuous play (no rounds). First to X points wins, yet another minus. Overall, a few humdrum twists on worker placement, workmanlike theme, some nice art, not a winner for me.

I'm not a huge fan of engine building games because of their repetitive nature of gameplay. In TMP you build your engine but you don't necesserily run it same the same way every turn which keeps the game interesting. I dislike the confrontational aspect of this game so my preferred player count is 2-3, because that way palyers are not in each others faces all the time. Great, great game, allways a pleasure to play.

Gioco potenzialmente molto bello coperto da un'ambientazione politicamente scorretta ma simpatica. Il gioco è un classico piazzamento lavoratori, molto german, che costruisce tutta la sua meccanica sull'acquisizione di lavoratori, specilizzati e non, e strutture per riuscire a costruire delle bombe atomiche potenti raffinando uranio e plutonio. L'intrazione è presente con il piazzamento che mira a occupare gli ambienti e portarli via agli altri. L'autore ha anche pensato di aumentare l'interazione e lo scontro con una sorta di battaglia tra i giocatori sfruttando la forta aerea di caccia e bombardieri. Questa parte è la delusione del gioco che mi porta a valutarlo non troppo bene. Infatti le azioni militari di fastidio sono molto dispendiose, molto lente e rendono vano qualunque tentativo di attacco. In sostanza quindi trovo The Manhattan Project un buon prodotto ma che necessita di radicali house rules per permettere di utilizzarne tutte le potenzialità (azioni) disponibili altrimenti si rischia che le azioni incremento flotta, battaglia e riparazione non vengano mai utilizzate per tutta la partita.

RATING: 9
I've come to the conclusion that one of the best strategies in this game is to have a lot of mediocre buildings. Pretty much the only board actions I try to take are espionage and construction (for free). Having mediocre buildings means you are rarely the primary target for espionage - which can be deadly - and having a lot of them means it's expensive to try and bomb you; and when they do, it's less effective.
-----
Stylistically, I feel that TMP most closely compares to [thing=18602][/thing], in that it is a low-luck, somewhat vicious worker placement game. TMP arguably has more variability, fresher and tighter theme, and more viciousness. Whereas 2-player Caylus can be very chess-like, TMP is closer to [thing=25613][/thing], in that optimal play will vary based on the available cards.

Mechanically, it shares a lot with [thing=26566][/thing], in that you have a set of buildings that is for your exclusive use, and you have multi-stage conversion workers into resources into victory points. TMP dispenses with the land plot auctions (which is Homesteaders only point of interactivity) and adds in a main board for common actions, with airstrikes and espionage to make it more interactive.

I feel it is superior to [thing=34635][/thing], [thing=39938][/thing], and [thing=24480][/thing] because in those games, a string of bad luck can put you behind. Apart from the variability of the card draft, there is no luck in TMP.
-----
The game is unique in that you spend all game building up this potential energy, which gets suddenly released in a paroxysm of frenzied bomb building. For most of the game scores are at 0. It's only in the last few turns where there is any scoring at all.

I love this game's spin on worker placement and the strategy that goes with it. I really like the cartoon-y nuke crafting theme. I don't like having to spend quite a bit of time explaining to new players why they shouldn't take the military-only route, which several people in my group are naturally inclined to pursue (We're mean, what can I say?). I also don't like not knowing who's about to win near the end or where I stand in comparison, maybe in a shorter board game I would, but not in a 90-120 minute one. Don't get me wrong, I like blind endings where people were getting points throughout the game and I can guess how much they have, but for someone to go from less than 10 visible points to a win in one turn is just irritating.

[b]The Manhattan Project[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I'd never had an opportunity to play Manhattan Project and after playing was completely surprised to find out it is a tableau/engine building game that introduces an interesting twist to the worker placement genre. 

In an nutshell you are using three types of workers to buy/build buildings and then use those buildings to carry out various actions [i](hiring more workers, mining yellow cake, converting yellow cake into Uranium or Plutonium)[/i] which all leads to building atomic bombs which is how you score points and win the game. There is a lot more nuance to the game, but I want to focus on what sets The Manhattan Project apart from other WP games and that is how workers are deployed and returned to your supply. 

On your turn you can take one of two actions. First you can place a worker to the main board and take the associated action. Once you take that action you are free to activate as many of the buildings as you have built in your own tableau. This becomes the crux of the game as you are trying to build the best buildings to help create an efficient engine that you can keep running. The second thing you can do on your turn is recall all of your workers, with from the main board and your tableau of buildings. The decision to recall workers is extremely important because that is all you do on that turn and you have now opened up all of those buildings for other players to use; they can even use your buildings via the espionage action. 

The only other mechanic I want to touch on is the fighter/bomber mechanic. You can attack other players via the air raid action during which you can destroy other fighters with your fighters or use bombers to damage your opponents building(s). The damaged building becomes unusable until they take an action and spend money to repair it. This may sound harsh, but similar to a cold war, the threat of retaliation is always looming over you once you spend your resources in an attack. No one got bombed in our game although it should have happened since this is the only way to slow down someone who has built a superior engine and needs to be brought back to the pack. This will definitely be the most divisive aspect of the game for some players, personally it didn't bother me. 

Your enjoyment of The Manhattan project will largely depend on whether or not you enjoy tableau/engine building games that have an inherent race element to them. I really enjoyed my play and also went out and bought a copy, but then I found out about [thing=176734][/thing] which eliminates the take that part of the game and appears to offer a deeper game play experience. I would still recommend trying out Manhattan Project if you haven't played before; I'm looking forward to playing again.[/i]

Great game -- always fun. My only concern at this time is it seems like the game ends too abruptly. It seems strange that players can win the game regularly with only developing 2 bombs and loading them. It seems like a winner should have to develop more.

Lots of good ideas in the game. Unfortunately, also lots of issues that should have been resolved.

Primary among them is the Espionage action, which is potentially so strong that players essentially have no choice but to jump on it if it's free on their turn. I don't like games that have obviously superior choices since it then feels overly scripted.

The Espionage action is also problematic in that it's a far more annoying negative play experience then most things are in high-interaction games. Not only do you not get to use your stuff - somebody else gets to use it instead. At no penalty. The combination of choking off your own engine while supercharging someone else's leads to dramatically differing momentum trajectories that usually end up being insurmountable (assuming that the leader is competent).

I've played twice and am not particularly interested in playing again until I read commentary from gamers I respect that can prove that comebacks are possible and that the balance issues I see aren't there.

Rated after one play. Medium complexity worker placement game in which the timing of when you remove your workers, taking into account everybody else's available resources, seems very important. Considerable player interaction (for a worker placement game) including a take that element and the ability to gang up on a perceived leader. It's a very good game if you like that sort of thing, particularly if the theme appeals (it doesn't do much for me, which kept the rating down a point).

RATING: 8
A stylish worker placement game with a touch of smack to whack the leader. Which unfortunately does invoke a sense of kingmaking which may cause the rating to drop. But the theme is turned into a fun one which can be easily hammed up in a strangelove type way, helped by the super artwork and a sensational board design. The rules are well presented and the game is easy to teach as well. Essentially you're creating an engine to generate plutonium or enriched uranium in order to build bombs for VPs. To get those you need an engine to build yellowcake and money. To get those, you'll need more workers than what you start with, so acquire engineers and scientists. You can only place one worker to the board each turn, so the key is to build buildings on your own board which drive your engine, because you can place on as many of your own buildings as you want in a turn. There's a spy option to place workers on other people's buildings, but it seemed too expensive and too prone to be non-useful (because the buildings you wanted were already claimed). And of course there's the smack, where you build up fighters and bombers and cause damage to other players' buildings. All that means though is that the non-targeted players get to concentrate on building more stuff instead of wasting actions on repairs (or generating fighters in the first place). So I'm not quite sure those two elements are right, but the rest provide a fast game with quick-enough turns where there are always options to progress. While each game provides the same engine building crux, at least each will provide a bit of difference due to the buildings on offer and which ones you obtain. Whether that's enough difference, not sure. I won't mind finding out though.

Based on one play: A worker placement game with a nice theme and great artwork. You can place one worker on the board per turn and as many as you want on your own board. The engine builds fast and then you just have to produce more efficiently then the others. Just make sure not to forget the goal as you can get caught up in building an engine, since you do not need many tested nukes to win.

One of my favourite worker placement games, although I’m not very good at it. At its heart it is a race game, the first player to build enough nukes that gets them to a set number of points wins. That sounds easy, but you can chain multiple workers together to have big turns so potential combinations are very important, couple that with the opportunity to use spies that will allow you to use other player’s buildings makes for some brain burning decisions.

I love the theme as well and the different kinds of workers (labourers, scientists and engineers) really help to bring the theme alive. This one is definitely a keeper.

This is a worker placement game where you're trying to create a card-based engine to generate and process materials for nuclear weapons.  What's neat about this game is that you draft cards to your personal board, and while you can only use generic actions once per turn, you can use all of your personal actions at the same time.  Definitely an efficiency feel here.  However, the game regulates snowballing with direct conflict, which I'm not a big fan of.  Also, actually finishing the process of completing a bomb is very difficult; some players may not even have one by the time the game is over!  (I'm not sure that plutonium bombs are even worthwhile given the length of the game.)  For lack of a better word, I'd say that the scoring is too "jerky".

The first play of this game was rather solitary. We got so involved in doing our own thing, that we largely ignored each other. This was with 2 players.

After playing the game a bit more and with a full complement of players, I would have to say that I'm enjoying it more. I don't see this replacing any worker placement game but it does have a unique theme and it plays [i]fairly[/i] smoothly. I'd like to try the Nations promo cards as I've heard that adds a bit more depth to the game. Also, I'm not sure how "innovative" this game is, but it does have one interesting mechanic in which you take back workers or place workers on a turn but not both.

I'll be keeping this game just because Jen likes it and it plays 5 smoothly. Slightly worried about a runaway leader problem and how effective the planes actually are.

I enjoyed this worker placement game.  There were many many options to take and had to think long term.  I thought the laborers/engineers/scientists worker differences were interesting.  Espionage was a nice function in the game as well.

I liked how there was a fighter/bomber aspect, however it seemed under-utilized and not necessary.  Money seemed to be very scarse.  The redeploying your workers to your buildings in one action seemed OP and thus placed a high value on getting good buildings.

An okay game with neat graphics and some glaring problems. Bombing others is just stupid, and all it does is guarantee that you're not winning and neither is your target. Buildings just sit in the queue uselessly after the first few turns. Just didn't seem to fit together all that well.

I quite like the theme. It's horrific, but I quite like that. If someone is against the theme, I suppose they never watch movies about war or any kind of violence. That being said, the game is awesome too. You're really building an engine and then at the end it kind of matters less. You just have to get those bombs out. Hopefully netting you exactly the amount to win, cause otherwise you've wasted resources. It's neat, its's tight, it's mean, it's exciting.

This was a fairly straight forward worker placement game, but had a few things going for it. First, the theme of racing to build atomic weapons was quite unique. I enjoyed recruiting scientists and engineers to accomplish my goals. Second, the ability to directly attack another player makes The Manhattan Project different from what would otherwise be a fairly conventional engine-building resource management game. I don't think I need to own this, but I will happily play again. We also played as unique nations - is that a mini-expansion?

RATING: 7
This is a good game. Although you have limited options on the main board, you can really get a sweet engine going on your own tableau. The timing puzzle of when to put workers on spaces and when to pull your workers off the board is really interesting to me. I rarely spend much time working on a fighter/bomber strategy or spying, but they can be useful at times. Unfortunately, my partner doesn't care for the race aspect so it doesn't get as much play time as I would like.

Edit Aug 2015: I still enjoy the engine building, but I'm finding with experienced players luck of the draw with building cards can play a more than minor role in determining the winner. It is pretty quick though, so not too big of a deal.

Great theme, beautiful art, a few slack components (player boards).  And a really strong worker-placement game with lots of interaction.  Nice meshing of different parts, particularly use of air power to mess with the leader.  Not sure if high score will stand up to repeated playing, but as long as theme and mechanics remain so well integrated, it looks possible.

RATING: 7
Love the theme, but cannot get on board with the execution. It's a cool topic, especially for a worker placement game, but this can just go wrong. I mean, the airstrikes can devastate a player -- this might be meant to curb in a runaway leader, but it can also destroy a non-winning player, which means that player won't have any fun. The point value of the bomb projects also seems off...

I have a soft spot for race games like this.  I also like the timing of taking your workers off the board.  Most people don't get it on the first play and struggle, turning them off the game, though, so I have yet to receive a request for a repeat play.

Good game. I love the concept of training/upgrading workers. The game may be a little too confrontational for us. Plus, games can run a little on the long side, and the endgame can be pretty anti-climactic.

Total dud here. This game has a really high downtime between turns and a tragically low number of meaningful decisions, and then waterdeep style swingy scoring plus the ability to leave yourself vulnerable to getting attacked to attack another player. Then there's a stitched on steal other people's built worker spots on their player board mechanism that is either clever or needlessly dick, not sure how I feel about that element of the game.

A very nice engine-building multiplayer solitaire game, boosted by fine theme and art, with a vestigial worker placement shell sat awkwardly on top of it.

Nem méltatom Vice munkáját, mert már sokan megtették, nem érdemtelenül.
Szóval a játék maga: Semmi újdonság, de nekem tetszik az a bizonytalanság, hogy mikor ki tudja megépíteni a bombáit. Ad bele egy kis plusz kellemes feszültséget.  Sajnos kicsit elvesz a játékélményből, hogy nem látom sehol kellő mértékben újítónak a mechanikáját. A játékszabály egyszerűsége ellenére nem könnyű játék, sőt elég sok mindenre kell figyelni. Tetszik továbbá a kis gonoszkodás lehetősége is a bombázókkal és kémkedéssel, ezzel még nyomást is lehet gyakorolni a játékostársra, hogy bizony vigyázzon, mert bármikor támadhatok. 
Összegezve korrekt munka. Mindez csupán első blindre, lehet, ha jobban tervezünk mindannyian akkor a játékélmény is növekedni fog. Reméljük.....

The retrieval mechanic is a nice twist for a worker placement game, but the game as a whole seems to fall short on too many respects. It is a bit too long/slow for its depth, the airstrikes are not that interesting, and the scoring that depends on only a couple of bombs and nothing else is unsatisfying. The game also seems to punish a bit too much for a bad start; one can fall clearly behind others by making some mistakes early on.

This game became a quick hit with our group.

It's a worker placement game, but has some twists that keep it from feeling like a half-dozen other games.  Integration of gameplay and theme is excellent.  It feels like you are doing the things you'd have to in order to build atomic bombs.

Replayability is excellent so far.  There are always tough decisions to make, but not so many options that analysis paralysis is likely.  And we've still barely scratched the surface of the espionage and air strike options.

Random things I like:
- Really nice art direction.  I particularly like the look of the little Worker/Scientist/Engineer dudes (Red Scientist looks like Dr. Zoidberg, and Contractor Scientist looks like Atomic Robo!)  
- Putting the workers on really thick cardboard was an inspired decision.  The worker pieces feel like they have real "heft" to them, but (presumably) aren't all *that* more expensive than more standard counters like the fighter/bomber pieces. 

I do have a few minor quibbles:
- The "play to x points" victory condition works well enough for game balance, but doesn't make a lot of sense thematically.  One would tend to assume the *first* bomb would be of greater importance, (perhaps overwhelming importance, going by history).  The implicit historical background isn't spelled out, btw, but seems to be something like a 1940s Cold War, in a world without Hitler. 
- Anyway, it feels a little weird that being the world's first atomic power isn't necessarily all that big a deal, and that you can't actually *use* your atomic bombs.
- The "Nations" expansion really should be included with the main game.  It's such a tiny expansion, but great for adding flavor and replayability with the different national abilities.
- The cards are well-designed and attractive, but there's really not much reason they have to be so small, IMO.  Something like standard playing card size or a bit smaller would work a bit better.

What fun twist on worker placement! My game group doesn't usually go for the super confrontational games, but we all agree this was delightfully vicious. Bombing other player's facilities is a necessary evil to keep them from sneaking in the win.

Watching your opponent's carefully is key and knowing when to recall all of your workers can be HUGE. Sometimes you want to take less actions on your turn so you can keep certain spots occupied. 

Overall: This was an instant favorite. Finally a worker placement where you can stop the leader dead in their tracks. I could see this game getting really nasty with certain players, but with players who have a method to their madness this will be a...BLAST!

Excellent, smooth and relatively interactive worker placement game - but with one big problem.

The problem is that the bombing/airstrike part of the game is broken. It always seems to result in one player being bombed almost back to zero, never to recover. I need to discover whether the game's expansion pack fixes that problem, but it doesn't look like it will. Some players will argue that buying bombers means being distracted from one's victory conditions (thus 'kingmaking' by allowing a third or fourth player to win), or that various other interactions prevent the problem, but the reality is that the game makes it incredibly easy for certain players to build a big fleet of fighters/bombers (and actually pushes you towards it).

Apart from that problem, it's basically a more 'gotcha!' version of another good game - Viticulture (which seems more balanced).

Glad to play this, but it had a couple things that turned me off. First of all, it is essentially a race game. Although I appreciate that it's not just a game about adding up small advantages, it's really easy to get shut out. Generally someone will win after building 2-3 bombs, and there's not really another way to score points. Secondly, I don't like games where there are attack elements when they are such a minor part of the game. I didn't mind the Espionage but the Bombing mechanic (which, incidentally no one used in our game) still seemed weird. I understand that it's very thematic, but I guess I was expecting something more Euro-ish.

4-player game, preferably with players who know how to play this "correctly". I mean, you can ruin somebody's game if you want to do it, but you'll probably ruin your own game in the process.

I don't like the attacking in this game. It gets personal pretty quickly and feels unnecessary cruel. I also hate the fact that spreading the damage is usually quite hard(you probably don't have enough fighters) and it is better to hit one player with all your power.

Scales badly. Not a single rule change that would block some of the action spaces when playing with three players. Overall I'm not convinced the game is especially deep either, compared to many other WP-games.

8. Initial rating after a 5 player game.  As a euro-gamer at heart, this surprised me with how well it clicked for me.

A few more games in and this just gets better.  It plays quickly, has great player interaction mechanics and enough strategy without causing permanent brain burn.  With the expansions, you can pick and choose, thereby changing the feel of the game.

Having played two, 2 player games, this does play differently.  There's typically less need for espionage, but can suffer with a run-away leader.

RATING: 7
This is a slightly tricky game to describe - basically it's an engine-building type worker placement game, basically Euro-style, although not very Euro-looking! It's not a game I think I would have picked up myself, but I'm  happy to have had a few plays of it. Not sure how much staying power it has, though - and I also don't like the "screw you" elements of bombing and espionage, even though I'm sure these will determine a large part of the strategy when good players play this. Thankfully, they've been mostly ignored in our games so far :) 

I think I would very rarely, if ever, request to play this game, and we haven't actually played it in a long time. I can't say I miss it though - so while it's by no means a bad game (in fact objectively I would class it as a "good" game, although not outstanding), I now feel I can't rate it as more than a 6.

Another worker placement game that has you racing to make nuclear bombs. We played 2 games but did not finish either as game became hopelessly bogged down by calculations and endless permutations of worker placements. Workers come printed on a thick type of cardboard and not wooden meeples, cardboard workers began to scuff even after just one unfinished game. The airpower part/damage repair ability of factories has potential to break game, it should have been left with espionage concept only to deal with other players. 

This game seemed like work, it really bogs down with 4 players and wasnt much fun at all. Down time for non active players can be immense.

RATING: 4
Not enough excitement in this game, the fun factor wasn't that great. Game lasts way too long for what it is. Each round seemed repetitive. I'm not a huge fan of worker placement games, however, I thought the mechanic of striking opponent's air force and bombing buildings would spice this one up a bit, but it didn't. Actually the game took so long that I didn't want to take the extra time to delay my opponent. It's just the usual worker placement game of acquiring manpower, buying resources needed to win the game. Nice theme and very cool graphics, but I am going to have to trade this one away.

This game was a pleasant surprise.  The initial theme didn't sound all that engaging, but once we got into playing we were all enjoying not only the decisions of how to optimize our engines, but also the ability to interfere with other players via two mechanisms (espionage and bombers).  Very much a "euro" worker placement game with a hefty dash of "ameritrash" interaction and aggression.  One of the few games that we played recently that ended with a good discussion exploring the decisions made in the game and how we might have optimized for a quicker path to victory.

Another plus for the game - the icons are very clear and we had no issues understanding them after the rules explanation.

This is one of the first worker placement games I played that features two mechanics I really love:

 - Different worker types:  It works well here, with the Engineers and Scientists having different benefits and also the distinction of contract workers from the workers in each player's owned pool.  

 - Building new worker slots: The game has you building structures often, with each being a new slot for a worker to go.  The fact that you place these on a personal board and play mostly on your own board also introduces the feeling of engine-building to the game.

The theme is very cool.  I would like a little bit more variability in the structures, but this game definitely works well and is enjoyed by most people in my experience.

Thanks to user Shbenton for sending me this game out of the clear blue! Learned and played it immediately and really enjoyed it! It's a quick game that can end at the drop of a hat, so you really have to pay attention to what your opponents are doing. In that way it really reminds me of The Palaces of Carrara. Very cool and thematic worker placement. Thanks again, Stephen!

This game seemed like it could be good but just didn't do it for me.  The airstrikes don't seem worth the cost.  Spying seemed difficult to pull off as it cost you an extra worker and wasn't going to block for very long.  Once we had a good set of building we were all pulling off every other round which means there wasn't any blocking or worker placement interaction.  Will play it one more time to see if I can see more to it but really disappointed.

The Manhattan Project has extremely strong competition in the worker placement category. It does quite well, but is missing some little spark to set it apart from the competition. I don't know exactly what it is, but the end feels a bit vague and anticlimactic. Points are by and large awarded in such big chunks that the winning move feels like it's caught the other players unaware and has just told to them that all their plans and work has been for naught. They might be one round off the win, but the points total might not reflect this. Not that I'd have liked this to be a Feld-like mini points marathon. The five points for loading bombs is a nice touch that seems to indicate thorough play testing.

I like the aggression interaction they've come up with here. From annoying espionage to bombing buildings, for me it's the right level of playful in your face, messing with plans fun. One thing you'll learn in your first game is that it's NOT a good idea to buy the best buildings. They just become targets for espionage. Mediocre is best and I quite like this aspect. In most games you think of mediocre cards as being... well... mediocre, but here they're nice safe boring workhorses. It's quite different to other games.

There's plenty of good choices on your turn. The bombs all feel a bit too similar, and picking the right combination to get to your points goal is quite frankly a bit ho-hum. The placement and removal timing however works very well in terms of blocking and planning ahead with alternative moves. It's perhaps a bit too easy to get up to your full compliment of workers, but having so many to play around with certainly helps keep the pace of the game up.

I'm thinking three is the best number of players for this for my taste. The points total is high enough that a selection of maybe three bombs is needed, and the pace is high and not too chaotic. Four is okay with quicker players. I don't think five is the best experience.

Overall I like it and would suggest it over Caylus and several other of the top contenders in this category. It's got a quick pace, a novel theme and a nice level of player interaction.

Worker placement games are all about to get things or actions to get other things that give players points. This is no different, but it has some new twists. First, players are able to construct buildings that give them abbilities different from their rivals. Second, players are able to attack other players to make damage to their buildings, so they can't be used. Third, players are able to spy on other players to use their buildings. Fourth, the workers are not automatic returned to the players; a has to be spendes to get them back. Fifth, there are workers (enginners and sciencetist) with special abbilities. The game is open until the end and players can feel the tension of a race. One of the best of the genre.

RATING: 8
Top notch example of the worker-placement mechanism done right. Easy to teach due to the intuitive and well-integrated theme with mechanics. At the end of the day this is very much a game about racing towards the finishing line with the most efficiently built engine. Direct player interaction, though potentially severe if players choose to go that route, is in my opinion a tad too opportunistic and hence often absent (but at least players can always feel that they had a choice in the matter).

Struggled with the theme of this game, as I'm not sure bombs are something to be had fun replicating building and using.  However, the mechanics are so solid and simple that they make this a classic.  May replace this with Energy Empire if it is similar enough.

I like so many of the ideas that went into this game. I like the way you draft buildings over time and construct an engine. I like the idea of using espionage to use your opponent's buildings. I like the idea of choosing to either send out your workers or retrieve them. 

I just don't like the overall implementation as much as I hoped that I would. Bombing seems too weak, which is a shame, the abilities on the cards aren't particularly diverse, and the race to building the bombs just isn't quite as satisfying as I wanted it to be. 

It's still a fun worker placement game. There's nothing wrong with it in particular. It's just a little bland and not quite as interesting as I expected. The endgame in particular often feels anticlimactic. Oh, there's no way we can stop him from winning at this point. Let's call it.

This is a nice worker placement game that has a lot of fun elements going on.  The art is excellent and very thematic and the production quality is also quite good with the chunky workers.  I really like the theme and the neutral contract workers are also well-implemented.  The random order that the buildings come out ensures plenty of replayability.  This gets a solid 8 to start with plenty of room to go up.

Received in trade, Dec. 2014.
First play didn't blow me away, but I also think certain aspects of the design are very clever.  Will probably hold on to it and try to get it to the table a couple times a year.

Second play (2-player):  This is a thematic game with some fun elements, but overall I just can't get into it wholeheartedly.  I think the primary issues are:
1)  Too long.  It just feels like it drags and gets repetitive in the latter half, rather than building towards some climactic finale (building bombs is actually not that satisfying).
2)  The primary attack element (airstrikes) are kinda fun, but their effect is to slow the game down further - and emotionally frustrate the targeted player.
3)  I just don't think I like the timing element of the game: spend a turn or two placing workers, spend a turn picking them all up.  It feels different and clever at first, but becomes stale quickly.  I prefer other worker placement games to this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
First impression:

Worker placement with heavy blocking, stealing, a dose of take that, 3 viable roads to victory and an original theme that ties everything together. Prone to groupthink regarding "free for all", so probably needs a couple of plays with same group. 

Not sure if I'm satisfied the way arms race work. I actually expect strategic choices to become narrower with more experience, but probably constant back and forth makes up for it. 

EDIT: played it solo 2 times and not impressed. It seems that all the interaction could be described as "more obstacles in your efficiency puzzle". Maybe WPs just aren't my thing, actually I was sure of it, but Stone Age gave me some hope (maybe it's the hidden VPs in that one which actually add another kind of interaction: doing what others aren't doing). Shame, such good theme and artwork, yet it's essentially a puzzle. Dropped the rating by 2, need another actual play to make a final judgement. 

BTW: super artwork. I love this style.

Very engaging worker placement with a lot of pre-planning. Low amount of downtime due to planning your next move and adjusting if your space is used before you can get to it, or if something opens up that you need. Nations expansion adds a bit of flavor and one unique option per player that adds to the game and does not break it.

RATING: 6
Played once with 3P. The Manhattan Project is a worker placement game with the unconventional theme of racing to build nuclear bombs. Much like in [thing=126163][/thing], taking back workers is an action on its own. This creates an interesting tempo in placing workers and retrieving them, and players generally want to position themselves to take advantage of the freed up slots when their opponents recall their workers. 

The first innovative aspect of The Manhattan Project is the Espionage action, which allows players to use their opponent's buildings and encourages players to take advantage of an opponent's free board. This somehow ties in with the fact that there are plenty of buildings which have 'strictly better' versions (which is a really questionable design choice on its own). Even if your opponent manages to get the better buildings, using Espionage makes those buildings available to you. But I also feel that the incentives to use Espionage are a bit [i]too[/i] strong, to the point where it is a no-brainer choice when the slot is open.

The second innovative feature is the ability to bomb your opponents' key buildings, which not only handicaps your target but also affects other players by shutting those buildings off to further Espionage actions. However, aggression doesn't really serve a purpose in this game. If used to rein in a leader, it has the typical problem of 'belling the cat' as the player who is most aggressive allows the other players a free ride. On the other end, it can quickly devolve into a prolonged war of attrition. Either way, I don't feel targeted conflict fits in a game of managing tempo and it drags the game on longer than needed. 

Speaking of which, the game feels a little long even without the bombing aspect. There are plenty of options on your personal board and often just as many workers, leading to a surprisingly time-consuming affair to chain all those actions together. But while it sounds as if the game is a mess, it does have its redeeming qualities. With the exception of the Espionage action, the decisions in this game are never obvious and the theme is pulled off well. I think this game needs a little more polish in the design (and possibly scrapping the bombing run mechanism) to be a real contender among worker placement games.

There is player interaction, direct confrontation and conflict, and demanding elements of timing throughout. I tried the expansion and didn't care for the extra time and complications. I think the base game is the best economy of fun vs time invested.

Great theme, cool art/components (if a little busy...but I love that the bombs are named), and an semi-interesting worker placement system (folks:  there's nothing wrong with worker placement per se, especially if it serves a theme that depended a lot on worker placement in real life!).  Too bad it's WAY too clunky...too much is dependent on timing and the game ends out of the blue with a "huh?" instead of a bang.  Also, there is very little upside to attacking someone, so when it happens it seems to be more out of spite.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Unique worker placement mechanic where the workers are permanently blocking spots until you decide when you retrieve workers. You need to build a small engine on your personal board to do big turns. It is not uncommon for games to suddenly end as the player with the best engine puts out a huge turn and builds multiple bombs in one turn.

After a dozen plays, with multiple players (2,3,4) I really like this game a lot.  Like many WP games, getting more workers is important - and one thing in this game that I like is that there is no "feeding" mechanic.  The espionage track allows you to block opponents while helping yourself.  I haven't seen the fighter attacks be really valuable in any games I've played though.

Caylus, illetve Agricola trónfosztónak állította be pár véleményező, azért ez jelentős túlzás. Nem rossz játék a Manhattan projekt, de azért közel sincs a nagy elődökhöz. Atombombát építenek a játékosok háromfajta jómunkásemberrel. Alap, tudós és építésszel. Mindegyikből 4-4 sajátunk lehet, de lehet felvenni plusszokat is dolgozni, ez érdekes ötlet. Alapvetően 1 munkáslehelyezésünk van a fő táblára és egy olyan akciónk, amivel saját táblánkon levő megvásárolt épületeinkre bárhogyan elrendezhetjük az embereinket. Ez biztosan az időtakarékosság jegyében született ötlet volt így a játék elég pörgősnek mondható 3-4-en, 5-en talán már azért így is belassul. Fontos is minél több emberünket az épületeinkre ráhelyezni gyorsan, mert egyrészt kémkedéssel más tudja használni a mieinket, illetve bombázással tönkre is tehetik őket. Kétfajta bombát tudunk építeni, amik a győzelmi pontot hozzák. Kritikaként a játék gyors végét szokták hozni és ez jogos is. Három bomba már elég a játék végét kiváltó győzelmipont mennyiséghez, amit akár valaki 2 körön belül meg tud valósítani. A gyönyörű magyar változattal játszhattam, ami ismét vice fantasztikus munkáját dicséri. Megmondom őszintén nekem a külföldi kezek dizájnja nem annyira jött be, túl rajzfilmszerű egy ilyen témához, de abszolút jól átlátható, csak nekem valami komolyabb jobban tetszett volna. Jó játék a Manhattan project, de nekem nem ütött nagyot, a mások épületeinek használata és mások lebombázása nekem mindig fájó pont, de ez lényeges interakciót és változatosságot tud adni a játéknak bizonyosan.

It is a really cool concept.  Unfortunately, this doesn't feel developed, not surprising from a Kickstarter project.  It suffers from a massive run-away leader problem, it effectively eliminates players and leaves them with little to do, it expects players to debilitate their defenses by trying to stop a runaway leader, and the deck large and is shuffled together entirely so outside of the set there is nothing remotely close to a planned dispersion of card types with no way to prevent clumping of essential cards.  

Three players really doesn't work, as the runaway leader can flood the guy to his right, so that they have to clear their board to do anything giving the workers back to the leader again.  This forces the other player to insure that they can get the espionage, which is not always possible, especially with the player to his right always reassembling.  Worse than that is that one player is expected to take the hit in efficiency in order to pound on the leader while the other player can just glide by without having to be responsible for it.  

Plus, pounding the leader games tend to suck, but at least most of them are in fillers that end in 20 minutes.  This takes hours.

On top of all that, it really is yet another worker placement euro, with nothing particularly special about it other than the theme.  If it were the case where the game was tight that might be enough, but everything is so half baked here.

RATING: 8
I'm a sucker for worker placement games, especially ones that do something new.  While this game doesn't do much new it at least feels very new.

The theme is we are all playing nations building bombs and we are trying to put together the largest and most valuable arsenal, and the theme is pretty prevalent throughout the game with art that really evokes the WWII-era time period.  I especially love the newspaper-style rulebook.

The game itself is reasonably simple to teach and play.  It is done in much the same style as Tzolk'in where each turn you can place or retrieve workers.  The spaces are all self-explanatory and there are a lot of options and elements to the game.  You can build your own spaces, accumulate resources, design bombs to build, test, and load onto bombers for more points, and there's even a decent bit of interaction with the air strike and espionage mechanics.

My first game I definitely feel like it should have played faster than it did.  There were 3 of us and we had to cut it short to include some other people in a game but when we ended I feel like we were all on the cusp of ramping up to the end game (and there was a bit of AP going on to get there as it was all of our first game).  Once you accumulate enough buildings and workers you can get bombs out with decent regularity I think and the balance of the actions seems really fine-tuned.

It's also worth noting that the components are of the highest quality.  The worker tokens are so thick that when I took them out of the game box I thought they were two stuck together.

It's a crime that WGN cancelled its surprisingly excellent "Manhattan" after two seasons, but I'll always be grateful for the added flavour it lends to our plays of this game. Instead of bringing dry recollections of facts that happened to other people to the table, we can instead intertextualise* vividly and shout phrases like "The implosion model works!" in our best Frank Winter voices.

I like TMP as a game for its themey little components (scientist meeples!) and for having lots of options which fluctuate based on other people's actions. I'm constantly diverted, and it's one of those cases where always having several possible movies is inspiring, not paralyzing.

I suspect that others wouldn't be too impressed with how my husband and I play, though. We simply have zero interest in bombing each other, preferring to take pride in our race for scientific supremacy, hoping that preparation is enough and violence won't be necessary. Maybe that's WGN's fault. They should give us a season 3 and let us find out.

(*I must bless the Australian Curriculum for deeming television shows and games as suitable texts to be studied in the English classroom, even if we do have to attach poncy words like "intertextualise" to the experience.)

Lovely production job apart from the colour blind unfriendly worker colours.

The first thing that I like about the game is the lack of turn structure - either place 'em or take 'em. This sounds simple but can be the hardest decision to make.

Secondly the theme - like the fact we are not building cathedrals but bombs; yellow cake rather than wood, scientists rather than guildsman..however, the themes tie in to the mechanics is as just as  flimsy as most trading in the med games. 'Now, I am become Meeple, the destroyer of worlds'

Does not shine with 2 players - most def needs more.

I wanted to love this game so much but was greatly disappointed. This is an unfinished game that is lacking in structure. It needs more play testing and many additional and modified rules to become a real game.

There is potential here but the amount of house rules We think are needed would make it into a completely different game. 

This is not a worker placement game where blocking of actions is a major part of the game. You don't even need to place workers on the main board! Instead it is a completely solo free form engine building race to points. The so called player screw-age is tacked on and not effective within the games economy. Although the espionage is possible if you are the only one focused on using it all the time. The points to win are to low and makes for a game that feels like it was shortened just to appeal to the masses that buy shorter games. The random draw of buildings, with no way to cycle, and bombs determine the winner more than the players do.

The most disappointing game experience I have ever had. I have a hard time understanding why this is so liked. Are these people that just enjoy doing an activity that feels like they are playing a game?

Update: It seams the first printing I played had some miss marked buildings that change the starting setup and we had some minor rules wrong. I don't believe these will change my opinion but I would play it again to see.

Medium (erring on the light side) worker placement game with a well-integrated theme.  We've used this successfully with some non-gamers and we played it a bunch ourselves when we were looking for an interesting but not brain-burning game to play.  Replayability is a little limited, however.  Need to see if the expansion helps with that.

This is pretty much your standard "economic engine via worker placement" game, but with a unique and interesting theme that is very well-implemented in the structure of the game.  I also happen to really enjoy the artistic presentation, although for my less-than-perfect eyesight, I wish the main board and most of the components were a little larger.  There's an unusual amount of player interaction for a worker placement game, and I appreciate the "espionage" aspect since it allows players to get things done even if they don't acquire the cards they need, but I could live without the whole "aircraft attack" part of the interaction.  While this is, overall, a very well-designed game, there are others of this genre that I happen to enjoy more, so I don't necessarily think that this game is da bomb.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 6/10

Perhaps the best example I have ever played of a tempo-management game -- the cycle of playing and returning workers, and its timing with regards to other players, requires careful attention. Likewise, interfering with other players is a good way to gain relative advantage.

Not a lot new here, but it flows very well and the three different kinds of worker (or six different kinds, depending on how you view contractors) adds some interesting texture. Great artwork and clear graphic design.

I have still never seen the airstrikes used usefully, despite the novelty of having a binding negotiations phase beforehand.

Great worker placement game which has some unique mechanics in the manner in which these will be placed and recalled. It is an arms race game and def feels like one. Only downside is that turns will take longer as you have more buildings and workers to place them on but to be honest, you are getting close to the game end by then for it to be a major issue. Had to get the Nations expansion pack to give the game much needed flavour.

RATING: 1
Fun game but I feel the progression ends too soon. Like if the point total was a bit higher or there was more interesting build up for certain bombs. Additionally, the attacking others players can really give the game to another person. Definitely has a lot of interesting concepts, but it just feels a bit flat to me.

EDIT: Used to be a 6.5 but now rated a 1 after James Mathe, founder of Minion Games, decided to bash on people who are fighting against social injustices.

Fantastic.  I enjoyed this very much and can't wait to play again having now seen what can happen throughout the game.  We did not have too much interaction as no one bombed anyone else, nor used the espionage track.  I think that will add a fun aspect to the game though.  Excellent.

An intruiging take on worker placement games, with some nice twists - namely in the form of temporary workers (contractors) and the absence of an end of round / housekeeping session - so your actions are either put workers out, or return all your workers. Coupled with a very immersive theme, a subplot of inter-player conflict, and a number of different aspects to work upon (and track about your opponents), it all adds up to an excellent and highly challenging game, which will scale well, and stand up to multiple plays.

An engine building game in which you race to build your bombs. Don't expect to keep your engine going for long. Once you get it going, the end of the game is not far. 

Choose your cards carefully, don't make yourself a target, keep an eye out for what the other players are doing, and try to time retrieving your workers to avoid being the victim of espionnage.

Use the airstrike sparingly if you don't want to leave yourself open to backstabbing, but it can provide a great opportunity to slow down your opponents.

You have lots of option every turn, but the best spots quickly disappear so you will have some tough decisions to make. Might be prone to AP with some players.

The rules are really easy to understand, the icons are clear and intuitive, and most people won't have trouble playing this game.

The game is beautiful to behold, with great art, and really functional. It is easy to see what is going on.

In the French version, all the expansions are included (great!) but there is no insert and no baggies (not great!), which can be problematic since there is a lot a cards and tokens in this game. My solution is a combination of pill bottles and baggies.

I really like the timing decisions and flow of the game determined by the placement/removal of dudes. Alas, I dislike how important espionage can become and how often you can end up getting blocked out of your own spaces. I suspect this is worst with 5 players, as we had.

Most of the rest of the game is fine for me, but I glaze over when someone is about to place all of their people and they shuffle money, cubes and workers around for a few minutes. Doubly so if my next move is simple, especially if it is just to remove workers.

The playtime saves this from being Agricola levels of tedium and as such, is just okay.

Hm!  A worker-placement I could like, perhaps one day love?  The "right-sizing" mechanisms of espionage and bombing are welcome, and balanced for their costs (although watch espionage very closely in 2-player, it can be crippling!).  The spectre of multi-player puzzling/solitaire hangs over the table, we'll see with more plays...

A good game with really nice components and a nice feel to the game. I really like it. The only "problem" I have with the game is the fact that it ends pretty sudden. If not all players around the table know the game well and are well aware of what is going on, some might be surprised that someone suddenly built that second (or third) bomb that made them win. Even if you know the game well it is a little bit hard to keep track of things as one player, with the right buildings, can accomplish A LOT in one turn. Because of this you really need to push for the win as quick as you can.

Interaktion mit Mitspielern ist vorhanden durch Spionage, einfache Luftangriffe und durch das Belegen spezieller Aktionsmöglichkeiten, allerdings ist die Interaktion sehr einfach gehalten und nicht besonders hervorgehoben. Weiterhin Kingmaking-Problem. Angriff schadet nur einem selbst und dem Gegner.
Geniales, wunderschönes Artwork, welches gut auf das Thema passt.

It's been quite a while since I last had the feeling in a game that right from the early beginning to the very end  someone was off to an unrivaled victory where no matter what I or the third player involved did, the outcome was inevitable. Getting workers is way too easy and made the universities redundant still early in the game. Falling behind on the number of buildings on your tableau is crucial, because with enough workers you can alter in between placing all your workers during one round and taking them back on your next turn, making the Rich get richer phenomenon a prominent feature.

Culled - First wave; Gifted to Grim

Why we culled it: This really is a wonderful worker-placement game, and the iconography for the workers is absolutely adorable. The game plays a lot like Agricola - players each have their own play mat that they can develop as well as a common board with actions that can be blocked or exploited until recall. The primary differences are (1) TMP features direct ways to interact with your opponents through the use of fighters/bombers to destroy buildings on opposing player boards and an espionage track to actually exploit their boards with your workers; and (2) the game length is open-ended and victory is instead determined by victory points (with a threshold to trigger the end game). While somewhat controversial with the theme of cold-war-era nuclear arms race - scoring points for building the most threatening arsenal (you don't actually use the nukes) - it wears the flavor well while remaining somewhat light in the presentation. All in all, it is a wonderful game. When it came time to cull our collection, this was one of the harder choices, but due to its overlap with Agricola and the wife-opposed existence of the espionage track, I decided to let it go to a good home that I know will allow me regular access to sessions when we want one.

My first Worker Placement game, being one of the few out there that has a theme that even remotely appealed to me. I love anything and everything to do with nuclear weapons and history, so... I had to have this, no matter what kind of game it was. I collect little yellow cubes of YELLOW CAKE and refine them into plutonium, you say? I'm in.

But it's also a really awesome GAME and excellent (I think) representation of the worker placement genre. Strategic and tactical choices are there and I like the element of blocking and directly messing with other players' strategies (spies can use their private buildings that they paid to build and bombers can attack and destroy said buildings, or you can just use a space you know someone else needs because workers stay in place until someone passes ending a round.... all very cool).

Production and components are top notch and the art, while cartoonish, has a mature-kind-of-cuteness to it. Yeah, I said that. It's a thing. Think: the Android logo cute, not anime cute. Quirky, quaint, a tad silly, but fun. I can get on board (ha ha) with that.

A really clever worker placement engine building game. The variability of the buildings market makes this game a little different every play. Timing retrievals to avoid espionage and to avoid taking "micro turns" is an interesting feature of this game.

I'm still waiting to play this game with a group who knows it well and finds a way to use the airstrike action effectively.

RATING: 6
I don't get why this game is regarded so highly.  With a small player count it is pretty decent, but with four or more it bogs down quite quickly.

The real problem is the airstrikes are way too powerful in relation to the repair action.  Although a smart player can balance this by having load of fighters, you can't really stop people bashing you.

I think this is really a three player game.

Great game -- always fun. The main problem I see is when the building queue gets gummed up with too many reactors and enrichment plants too early.  Hy home rule next time will be to have two parallel queues: one with universities, mines, and factories, and the other with reactors, enrichment plants, and hydrogen plants (if you have the expansion).  This should resolve the gummed up problem quite easily.

[thing=63628][/thing]... well, unimpressed me. The game has an interesting dynamic: you can make [u]one[/u] action on the main board and, afterwards, as many as you can/want on your own board - it is necessary to pay the activation costs. On the main board it is possible to build things, train engineers and scientists or get workers, you can enrich uranium or plutonium, send spies into other players buildings, enhance defenses or prepare more planes to attack, bomb other players buildings, and so forth.

In your own board you can do basically the same things (provide you have the buildings), but usually better - for example: you can get an Univesity, an it can provide you with 3 scientists when activated, as in the main board you could only get one.

All this is for one purpose: to be able to make atomic bombs. They can had a core made of plutonium or uranium, this last type is costier to get, but the bombs are worth usually more points. The player can also test its bombs, and then the next ones can be worth more points (many bombs has two stats: one without tests, other, higher, with a test made by the player). The bomb can be also be made to be carried by airplanes (it cost money, but this adds 5 points to the bomb).

All in all, is works rather well. But the points that the bombs are worth seem... excessive. Two bombs and one test might be all that you need to end game. Ok, make bombs isn't an easy task, but the end game can come almost abruptly: someone has, say, 20 points. The game ends with 50. One might think: hey, he still has to get 60% of the points necessary to end the game, so... Done, bomb, +30 points, end game.

The end seemed abrupt at best, and the points in the end (of my first game) were everything but close: 50, 35, 4 and 0.

I could be persuade to play [thing=63628][/thing], but I won't be asking for it.

Best worker placement game I've played.  I love Lords of Waterdeep but this game has espionage and bombing of other players which makes is super interesting.  I also like that you don't have to recall your workers at the end of the round if you have some left.  This blocks others from getting spaces they may need.  It's fun to see what others need and stop them!  I bought the small expansion pack with the nations cards which makes it for fun as you can be a country!  We require people to speak with an accent to make it more realistic.  "Honorable Japan respectfully drop bombs on United States.  Hope we do not wake a sleeping giant."  I bought 6"X4" flags with little stands for the countries to make it even more fun.  Flags make everything better!  I ordered them from Amazon but for some reason, instead of the United Kingdom flag, they sent me the Iceland flag.  I guess their special nation power is freezing other countries uranium.  We like it best with 3-4 players.  It can get a bit long with more.  It does take time to build up to the bombs but once the game gets to that point, all hell breaks loose!  Watch out for other countries fighters and bombers because if you get bombed, it's tough to repair the damage.

Global Power Struggle Begins
Which nation will take the lead and become world's dominant superpower?

The Manhattan Project makes you the leader of a great nation's atomic weapons program in a deadly race to build bigger and better bombs. You must assign your workers to multiple projects: building your bomb-making infrastructure, expending your military to protect it, or sending your spies to steal your rival's hard work!

You alone control your nation's destiny. You choose when to send out your workers–and when to call them back. Careful managment and superior strategy will determine the winner of this struggle. So take charge and secure your nation's future!

Additional description:
The Manhattan Project is a low-luck, mostly open information efficiency game in which players compete to build and operate the most effective atomic bomb program. Players do not "nuke" each other, but conventional air strikes are allowed against facilities.
The game features worker placement with a twist; There are no rounds and no end-of-round administration. Players retrieve their workers when they choose to or are forced to (by running out).
An espionage action allows a player to activate and block an opponent's building, representing technology theft and sabotage.

What's not to love about the idea of mass producing atomic bombs?  I have just one play through, but loved it.  It is a tough worker placement game, figuring out how to get your production line going, keeping up with the Jones' so you don't lose the arms race, and wondering whether you should be engaged in strategic bombing to keep the other guy down.  My group did not try either airstrikes nor espionage, and the game still went two hours with 3 players.  I enjoyed it and am eager to play again soon.  Just the base game.  Neither expansion looks that good to me right now.

Update: played it with the Nations expansion, and I took France.  France might be overpowered in a two player game. . It gave me access to bomb designs any time I put a scientist on the card, which is a huge advantage.  No draft required.  This can also allow you to decide very early which why you want your nuclear program to go, uranium or plutonium.  If you think money is tight, it's not in a 2 player game.  The opportunities to get cash are manifold, and that can really change the gameplay as well.

The scoring is way too chunky, and also has too much randomness (if the target score is 50, I have two bomb designs worth 50, and you get two bomb designs worth 49, good luck winning).

Excellent production quality, love the artwork. Unfortunately, the game seems utterly unbalanced, with uranium bombs being a far faster route to victory than plutonium bombs (4 players). Have experimented a bit with balancing options, but it doesn't feel "right". Will have to try 5 players and different (45 or 60) end game VP requirements.

Fairly disappointed with this game, and not sure why it's not clicking with me.

Not much variety in play, just seems like who can grab the slightly better buildings first.  Once the game evolves into the resource-engine phase, the turns take really long, and are basically the same thing over and over until someone wins rather abruptly.

I so want to love the game as there are so many things I love about it as a competitive, interactive worker placement game with a fun theme. It just always leaves me disappointed in the end. 

I have quite a few similar games in my collection now.  Tzolk'in is a heavier game requiring more longterm strategy.  Alien Frontiers is more interactive and has a more tense ending.  Manhattan Project feels more like I'm going through the motions.

The game is better with more players.  The artwork, board layout, and overall theme is terrific. The twist on worker placement is really satisfying as well, once you get the hang of it.  

I even like the controversial air strike. Doesn't seem like it's quite as powerful as it's made out to be, but it keeps everyone on their toes and forces you invest in your defenses a little bit.  That creeping feeling of paranoia while you're trying to build your engine is great (and pretty thematic, actually).

Very interesting pacing for a worker placement game, both in the micro and macro sense. Micro: since you need to spend a turn to retrieve your workers, you often alternate between extremely eventful turns and very quick, uneventful ones. Macro: 80% of the game is getting the resources and infrastructure and workforce to make bombs, with your score between 0 and 10. Then at some point you just dump everything and suddenly bombs everywhere and someone hits 50 and wins.

I don't hate this game but I hate the end game condition. You can basically spend 2 hours (in a 5p game) planning your strategy but if someone gets to the finish line first (points) then it doesn't matter what you were doing. If I ever play this for a third time (doubtful) it's important to remember to get 1 of each of the following to win (so much time passes between plays I forget every time): 3+ cake mine, money card, university for engineers and professors, uranium and plutonium plant.

RATING: 5
Not bad- if I were feeling generous I might give this a 7. But really despite the unique theme and great artwork the game doesn't distinguish itself enough from other worker placement games where you gather and convert resources into points. Yes, there is a slight twist on the worker placement mechanism: your workers stay out where you placed them - temporarily blocking those spaces - until you spend a turn to retrieve all your workers. While there's some minor subtleties as a result, it doesn't wow me enough to get my own copy. Will play again if asked.

Fun easy to learn worker placement game. The game moves very fast after a couple of rounds. The theme is great and is felt while playing. The components are okay as is the art. Seems to scale pretty well. The game can be "mean" with the espionage and bombers. Overall this is a very solid game.

RATING: 6
This is a fairly typical worker placement that stands out by the way that players can create their own little efficiency tableau in front of them in addition to picking stuff from the main board.  Players can only visit the main board once per turn, but can do as much as their workers allow on their own boards.  The key seems to be in making a nice efficiency engine in their own tableaus to exploit.  This isn't necessarily new (Belfort does it, too), but it's possible for other players to slow down that engine with bombing runs that can damage their buildings, which is something I haven't seen in the other games.  It's a little frustrating to be on the receiving end of it, but it's understandable, since without it a player could get into an engine loop that would guarantee them an easy win.  It's intriguing and interesting, and one of the better Kickstarter efforts I've played so far.

The Manhattan Project has one of the best riffs I have seen on the worker placement mechanism. Allowing you to place multiple workers per action, as well as chaining those rewards gained from one placement into the next open up a ton of strategies. Also, the bombing rules and espionage actions that let you steal rewards from your opponent's buildings and tie-up their worker spaces add a tremendous amount of direct interaction between players, something games in this genre often lack. The game also delivers a lot more decision making than the rulebook would lead you to believe, as there is a definite ebb and flow to the game that makes the "when" of an action as important as the "what".

The only minor complaint, and we are talking microscopic here, is that the game ends far too abruptly. At some point in the game, someone will just declare that they win...with very little warning. I suppose if you memorize the bomb deck it might be easier to predict, but what fun is that?

My rating for this will probably move. I know it's a strong eight at the very least, probably a nine. If my game group gets very competitive over it, a ten isn't even out of the question. I'll see how it goes...

What I Love-
I like games that rise into a crescendo as the engine you build starts humming! Love it! You really feel like your player board is a Race to be the first to get the bomb, even though it takes 2 or more bombs to win. If someone drafts the card you need for your development, you can always use the main board, espionage, or a bombing run to destroy their factories and slow them down. I love that the workers are of three different classes. Variability depending on the cards drafted. 

What I Dislike-
Some people hate the theme and won't play it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Sorry to say this, but the lack of development of the game significantly detracts from what could be a very good game.

The game is thematic, and has a somewhat novel worker placement mechanic.

However, our game went on forever because the card distribution was bad and we were short on a very important resource.  This caused the game to go on for hours and ultimately devolve into a situation where all the leaders bombed each other and effectively, the fourth place player won.

Why did this occur?  Because the game wasn't fully developed.  A simple fix - splitting the deck into A/B/C decks and then stacking them - could have resolved this problem. 

In today's market for games, I just don't feel like I can highly rate a game that has this type of flaw that could have been fixed but wasn't.

Rating according to the BGG guidelines: I won't play this game ever.

I don't want to build nuclear weapons. I don't want to launch nuclear weapons, not even to test them on thousands of 'volunteers' (army members, south sea natives).
And i don't want to bomb nuclear weapon facilities, not even with conventional weapons, which could result in contaminating large areas, making them uninhabitable, and resulting in slow dead for many people.

A worker placement with interesting gameplay. The development of each players base opens up chaining options which is quite satisfying. However it suffers end game problems, especially with 5 players when 1 or 2 have the capability to build bombs - there is quite a bit of helplessness since a player is able to do a lot in 1 turn so the game can end anti-climatically

Worker placement with a twist.  Each turn you either place workers or retrieve them, unlike other WP games where you place, do the actions, and retrieve in the same turn.  There's the typical contention for action spots, but in addition to placing a worker on the main board, you also play actions on your own personal board.

The theme is heavy - you're building nuclear bombs, and it is integral with the gameplay.  You never forget about the theme while retrieving Yellowcake, producing Uranium and Plutonium, designing and building bombs, and even loading them onto bombers.

The game works great for two players, but is better with 3-5.  It's fun, unpredictable, and can end quickly.

We were taught that players could use their Espionage powers EVERY turn, which turned our game into complete nonsense.

Will rate and review after playing correctly.

[i]Update[/i]:

Hmmm, well. It turns out that I prefer nonsense to sense.

We had a second play of Manhattan Project, with the correct rules, and it wasn't nearly as interesting as our first session.  Our first (incorrect) play was broken, but at least it was enjoyable in its own chaotic and wacky way.

Playing correctly, one thing that can happen is that a player can get bombed into oblivion early in the game - with no real way to recover.  That doesn't fit my category of fun, but it may fit yours.

Also, being able to purchase good buildings cheap (especially in the early game) is REALLY important.  If you can snag a good building - or set of buildings - early on, you'll have a big advantage over the other players.

[-]Do not "get" why this is so popular and highly rated?
It is a random race game to build an "engine" and not really a worker placement game.
Workers help, but after your "engine" is built you don't need to even get all your workers or diverge and build more buildings.

Point in fact, my group seems like the only people to not want to play this game after the random element decided the winner in all games played.
[b]Bold[/b] Denotes worker spaces on the main board.

1 player did not have all his workers, had 4 buildings and every turn could make his bombs or raise in either U or P track.
Got bombed but was able to [b]Repair[/b] AND when someone else used [b]Repair[/b], was able to pay to repair what he could not earlier. 

He won just because the building cards came up randomly in his favor.
Even he said he did not even try to win, it just happened when the cards were there. (he knew he would win when he stumbled upon the "engine" though)

[b]Espionage[/b] (Esp.) was not very useful since he waited till the [b]Esp.[/b] player was forced to return workers and then continued, or use the main board to raise his P & U. No one could "physically" stop him making bombs since his bombs are not actually in a location. (big issue, causes run-away leader)

Why spend your resources building bombers, fighter planes, or doing [b]Esp[/b]. when they can use [b]Repair[/b], AND pay to repair when someone else uses [b]Repair[/b] or concerning [b]Esp.[/b] wait till your forced to return workers?

Any game you are forced to try and stop a player from winning instead of focusing on playing your game, you lose in more than one way.

Only game this year I regret getting (actually trading for.) Wish I would have played before accepting trade... Lol. None of the reviews or vids showed the random run away element very well.[/-]

May have to play it again, with a different mindset...
From rahdo's runthrough we played the U&P track wrong

But that does not negate the absolute futility of attacking or the runaway leader result.
It just shows the game would have been longer... shudder!

It's an interesting game, but I'm not sure how well the fighter/bomber thing works.  It seems like all that does is slow the game down (if people sequentially attack one another around the table) or throw the game to the person not attacked or have no effect (if all adopt a cold war stance).  Other elements of the game were fairly interesting, but not gripping.  The theme works.

We used the Nations expansion with France, Britain, Germany, and Japan.  They seemed fairly well balanced yet different.

I liked this a lot, particularly with the expansion that adds variable player powers. The "1 on main board, any number on your own board" per turn worker placement restriction made the decisions interesting. The combat portion was a dislike for me, but we played with rockets which is apparently an extra-attacky expansion add-on so that could easily be adjusted.

I was really drawn to the art style of the workers: the blank faced stick figures felt like a very interesting representation of the depersonalized nature of your workforce.

Please don't forget the rule where a player can place up to 1 worker on the main board, and any number on his/her personal board (Unlike most worker placement games). I made that mistake once, and that really makes a game really really REALLY slow!

Gameplay wise I like being able to build you own engine from your own buildings in a race to get to the finish the fastest (meeting some point criteria).

And I love the thick chunky cardboard workers. People (including me) are often confused about it at first, thinking it 2 pieces sticking together.

Worker placement with some issues. The most notable aspect of MP is that players can buy buildings that mirror spots on the board, except that the buildings are "free" actions - free in the sense that players can deploy any number of workers to unoccupied buildings per turn whereas they may only deploy to one space on the board. With enough buildings the most efficient structure becomes deploy everyone one turn, recall everyone the next. This is especially relevant because reactors players can build far exceed the enrichment options present on the board. Thus, with this turn structure established, big mines and reactors are superior to small ones - why not throw down as many people as possible on deploy turns, as they all return when you recall workers? By extension then, big bombs are preferable, even before considering how they have more favorable Uranium / Plutonium to VP ratios. Espionage and bombing buildings are dopey methods of keeping the leader in check, and one becomes leader usually when the building row is favorable to him.

I love the round-less, constant play worker placement action system in this game, and am sort of surprised that I haven't come across something similar before. It's also neat that you can use as many workers as you want on your own board in addition to the one action on the main board, and having to use an action to recall your workers leads to a very fast flowing game (at least until the end game where it slows a tad, given the myriad numbers of options).

All the interaction is great, attacks and espionage in particular, but even how some of the actions give each other player a small bonus.

This game may actually rise in rating, and I very much look forward to more opportunities to play.

RATING: 4
A theme is unique but the gameplay is not. Some interesting ideas but fell not developed enough.

Maybe this is a group thinking but I don't understand air strike action. It seams as it's added only to stop the leader. At my table nobody was even considering using their 'board' action just to stop one player without gaining any benefit from it (it's only a bash a leader action). If I'm gonna use this option to stop one player, other players will gain an advantage over me and a player I just air striked (plus we both will be weaker - we'll have less airplanes)

Randomness of order of buildings in the deck can mess a game and make it drag. Overall feel of the game is uneven - for most of the time you build buildings, sending workers etc. Than at one moment you start building bombs which are only way to earn VPs. From some point in the game it start to feel 'scripted' with every player knowing what they will want to do to the end of the game

Maybe with different players where espionage and air strike would be used more often it would be a different game but with eurogamers who think that spending an action just to bash the leader is a waste of an action - the game fall flat.

If you like strategy games, worker placement and interactions... That is the kind of games you want to play! Players are always quite close to win and with the hidden points it is quite stressful. There is several strategy to win, a nice market that can move cards quite fast or really slow if there is an interesting card that everyone want to get or should I say... No body want any opposants to have it... Lot of fun or frustration ;)

This is the first worker placement game I've played that doesn't feel like a standard worker placement game that I really enjoyed.  The limit of one placement on the main board keeps the turns going quickly and deciding when to pull back your guys is interesting.  Despite that it is easy for this one to drag if peopel aren't focused enough on actually building bombs (or I should say are too focused on bombing every building in sight :laugh: ). Regardless this is a solid change of pace worker placement game.

That being said... there was just too much competition with worker placements games that I enjoy more to keep this one around and I traded it away.

Tried it with five player, which was too long, but it has some nice mechanics and a very nice theme. Euro games with theme is a big plus

Played this the other day for the first time, was really a lot of fun.  Going to add this to the wishlist.   Initial rating of 8 for now.

Update 12/02/2014
Finally got to get this in again,  still enjoyed it.  Played it with the Nations expansion and I thought that added a nice twist to the game.  Upped to 8.5.

Hate, hate, hate the way another player can destroy your buildings. I'd play again, but I don't think this game is for me.

Lots of historical theme plus a decent worker placement game make this a good Euro.

Went unplayed. Unmotivated to try it even after finally picking it up. Too much take that made it unappealing to play.

There are some nice mechanisms, and nice iconic art in this game, but the theme is a turnoff for me.  I do enjoy the difficulty of accomplishing your goals, and the "thinkiness" of the game.

Worker placement can be a problematic mechanism in a board game. The term is often used to describe games that have little to do with worker placement and games using it are sometimes too simple, boring or repetitive. The Manhattan Project, however, is probably the most elegant worker placement design I have seen. There are relatively few components and player actions, but gameplay is much deeper than initial impression. The theme and art are lovely, and the rules are simple to remember. With newbies, score differences can be astronomical in the end, but learning from your mistakes makes you desire a rematch. Or ten. All in all, an impressive little game!

This game deserves way more love than it is receiving on BGG.  Compare it with Agricola:  It's not as 'heavy', but neither is it for simpletons, and there is almost no luck involved.  Furthermore, those who are bothered by the 'multi-player solitaire' aspect of Agricola, should really like the Manhattan Project, what with the ability to launch air strikes and spy on other players.

- some people complain that:  you have to spend a turn retrieving your workers, as opposed to retrieval being a part of every turn/round.
- but that's part of the reason this game is so good!  those who make this complaint are like the person who complains that in chess the bishop doesn't move like the queen.

- some people complain that:  there is no way to guard against air strikes or espionage.
- no.  first, to protect against air strikes you can build up your fighters and to protect against espionage, you can retrieve your workers at the right time.  second, you are free to launch your own air strikes or to do your own spying.

- some people complain that:  it's formulaic.
- are you sure that everyone who is playing knows the rules?!

- some people complain that:  newbies are as likely to win as veterans.
- just . . . no.

- some people complain that:  the game is over too quickly, viz., after the winner has built just two bombs.
- I get this one, but you can increase the points required for a win, without adversely affecting gameplay.  

Please play and rate.

As of now, we haven't played this, but I look forward to it. The worker pieces are adorable and feel solid, the board looks amazing and it's so clever, we love the plane tracker being a runway, and the fact that there aren't actually rounds unlike every other worker placement game we've played.
UPDATE: everything about the look and theme of the game is exquisite

That last point is going to be strange to get used to, I think. In something like Lords of Waterdeep, you take turns placing one guy per turn until everyone has placed, then you all retrieve your guys at the end of the round. But here, you play one on the main board, and then as many as you are able to play on your personal board. You could go through a dozen guys in a turn, and run out, so you might have to spend a turn just retrieving all your guys. That isn't the round-end action, that's just your turn, and you immediately open up spaces for your opponents to fill.
UPDATE: the strategy is certainly different

We also like the prospect of things being acquired and usable in the same turn. Using a worker to buy a building that you can immediately put a worker on to gain a scientist that you can immediately put on another building to gain another output. Brilliant.
UPDATE: yup, it's pretty great to chain together

Bomb testing seems interestingly competitive. You design a bomb, do a card draft to get one you want to build, then build it when you have enough workers to assign to it, but then if it's a Plutonium bomb, it's only worth maximum points if you've already tested (wasted) a Plutonium bomb. And the later in the game you do your one and only test, the fewer points you get in return for that wasted bomb.
UPDATE: bomb testing so far irrelevant

Nice and light worker placement family game of building nuclear bombs. 

Easy rules and fast flowing and has a possibility of player interaction. Liked it after first try.

I like this interactive eurogame very much. The possibility to bombard your neighbours buildings is fun and interactive and espionage makes you pay attention to what your neighbour is doing. 
The theme is brilliant and the flavor is all there. I like how each game is very different. Sometimes no buildings of a certain type comes out of the deck and causes a bottleneck that makes you adapt your strategy. 
Some players mentioned the kingmaker issue caused by the possibility to bombard buildings. I experienced it's rather a part of the strategy in which you deliver a precision strike to slow down your opponents. 
I appreciate that the game is very flexible, you can play with two to five players without experiencing problems.

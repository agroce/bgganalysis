A solid, fun trick-taking game.  I like how the snakes push and pull on your desire to win or lose tricks.  The cobra card is a great way to provide the right iota of control.  The only thing I'll change is the end game trigger - we'll use a lower number of points.

Just tried it. It's tricky sometimes to do what you want, if you want to win a trick but you're not the starting player, and if you don't have the color being played, you'll always lose and can't do anything about it (if you already used your king cobra card), so you'll just keep adding cobras and lowering your profit, and if the round ends it's even worse, because you lose 1 point per cobra in the basket.

Also in the first round no one wants to win the trick because you'll only sell 3 cobras at most, so I found it a bit strange gameplay wise.

Love this game!  Easy to learn, quick play with great player interaction.  I had the opportunity to play it at UnPub6 and found it outstanding.  For anyone who likes trick taking games, this is a must buy.

Trick-taking game where when you win the trick, you sell your cobras and when you lose the trick you acquire cobras.  Returns for selling cobras increase for each cobra you selling up to 7 cobras, but returns diminish quickly past 7.  Each round ends when 10 high cards (10-13) have been played and you take a penalty point for each cobra you still have.   Very interesting card play as you want to lose tricks to acquire cobras, but then want to win trick at a precise time.

Excellent trick taking game.  I like how sometimes you want to win a trick and sometimes you want to lose.  The King Cobra card is a clever mechanism for a bail out card.  Cobras has a good level of player interaction as you can load up opponents with snakes for negative points.

I'm a sucker for nifty little card games even though nifty little card games don't get a lot of play. I love Sticheln, Palastgefluster, Sky Tango, and others which too often languish on my shelf. I backed this trick taking game on KS because it seemed like an interesting variant on the genre that wasn't the usual "every card has a special power" that often powers trick taking variants. 

Cobras is easy to pick up and fun to play. The decisions are interesting without being too onerous, and even the oddest part of the game, the King Cobra card, makes sense once you start playing. Cobras are tricky beasts to properly manage, and the game makes that absolutely clear. I'm really pleased with backing this.

What can I say about a trick-taking game that plays great 1-5! Love the 2-player game. And the higher player counts, too. Just a quick fun game that preserves everything great about trick taking without being too convoluted or weird. Great decisions regarding whether and when to take tricks or not. And ouch when your plans go awry! The heart of any good trick taking game. The theme makes sense, too. So fun to play and look at.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I'm always posting about new card games I'm playing and I'm especially found of trick takers. Another BGG'r (Martin) recommended Cobras, which was a game I hadn't even heard of. Once I checked out some reviews of the game I ordered a copy thinking it'd be perfect to play with my dad and son. 

After only one play, I just got it at the end of the month, Cobras was meet with mixed reviews. My son and I really enjoyed it and as of now my dad wasn't a fan. To be fair, it usually takes my dad a couple of plays before he really picks up on the rules and nuances of a game. And since my son and I enjoyed it I know he'll play again. 

As far as the game play goes, Cobras is a relatively straight forward trick taking game with an added set collection mechanic. The scoring in Cobras is what really drives game play. The best you can do is score 21 points for selling 7 snakes; however if you sell 10+ you only get 3 points. The only way to sell snakes is to win a trick, if not you are collecting more snakes from the pool along with the other losers of the trick. Therefore Cobras is just as much a game of managing your own snakes as it is paying attention to what your opponents are doing and trying to screw them over. This introduces a push you r luck mechanic because the closer you get to 7 snakes the more of a target you will become. This is mitigated somewhat by the king cobra card which when played allows you to choose between sharing the victory [i](selling)[/i] or sharing the defeat [i](collecting snakes)[/i]. You only have one king cobra, so once you play it you won't see it until the next round. 

I found Cobras to be a very accessible trick taking game that would be easily taught to folks familiar with traditional card games. I also think Cobras will appeal to gamers, especially if you enjoy card games with some take that built in. I'm looking forward to some more plays with my dad since I think he'll warm up to Cobras after a few more games. It took him a few plays to figure out Bargain Hunter, which he now enjoys, and Cobras is much more straight forward than that. I'll probably end up introducing Cobras to the rest of my family, I think my wife and older daughter may also enjoy it. Needless to say I am extremely happy with my purchase, thanks Martin![/i]

Initial review is after playing one two-player game. It's not bad but the "dummy" 3rd player, even with the cards face-up, wasn't that great. Still enjoyable but not to the level I was hoping for.
I think the game will play much better with a higher player count. I'll be sure to update my score when I get more players to the table to try.

Really neat trick taking game. Collect some tokens if you don't win the trick or cash in your tokens if you do. It is all about the timing in the game. Very clever and I really like that you might not play all of the cards in your hand before the hand is over and you score. This is a game I would definitely like to play again.

Everyone who knows me knows I love a trick-taker with a twist. This one also has a great thematic premise in the 'cobra effect': to reduce snake numbers, the authorities offer a payment for each dead cobra turned in. But this encourages the locals to breed cobras to claim the payment, which works fine until the authorities find out and cancel the payments. 

In the game, you acquire cobra tokens each time you lose a trick and turn them in when you win one. The scoring schedule gives increasingly good rewards for turning in up to 7 cobras at a time but punishes you hard if you overshoot and even worse if you still have them at the end of a hand. So it's a game of timing when to lose and when to win, with plenty of dickishness too, winning a sequence of tricks to force your opponents over the limit.

The scoring is interesting in this game, but I felt like the only "strategy" to this game was holding on to your king cobra card for as long as possible. If you spend it early, you should probably expect to collect some negative points at the end of the round. A bad hand is just a bad hand. High numbers are better. Not a lot of clever ways to work around that.

As this game is currently on Kickstarter, I just want to say that I'm in no way associated with the project or anyone involved with the game. I just tried the PNP version after hearing about the game.

Speaking as a big fan of trick-taking games, this game is great. It uses a very simple trick-taking engine: you have to follow suit if able, no trump cards, and the highest played card of the lead color wins the trick. Really simple.

The gimmick here is in the scoring. As you lose tricks you gain a certain number of cobra tokens. When you win a trick you have to turn in those tokens and score a number of points. There is an arc to the scoring where you get the most points for having exactly seven cobras, then you start to get fewer points for more than seven. This means that timing is everything. You try to lose a couple of tricks to build up your cobras, then win a trick to get the most points.

This game also does something I tend to like in a game: the players can decide, to an extent, how long each round will last. When you play high-value cards they get set off to the side and the round ends when ten of those have been played. If you have the right cards and think you're in the lead you can throw those cards to speed up the round. Really nice.

This also ties into the game length. Some trick-taking games can overstay their welcome but Cobras gets it pretty much the perfect length. At the end of a round where somebody has at least 100 points the game ends. It's not uncommon for someone to score 30 or more points in a round, so the game will never go more than three or four rounds.

I don't have any real negatives to say about the game so far, but the act of scoring could be better. You have to score after every single trick so you need to use a scoring app or pen and paper. The Kickstarter, however, seems to have addressed this by giving each player their own scoring card and marker.

Also, it's a disappointing that they're printing this with poker sized cards instead of the more narrow bridge sized cards. In games where you have to hold a quarter of the deck (13 cards) smaller cards are always welcomed. When asked, the publisher didn't seem to know what bridge sized cards were, which is a little worrying.

Overall this is a great trick-taking game. Simple enough for someone new to the genre, but enough depth and enough of a twist for trick-taking lovers.

Really great and fun Trick-taking game with a fun twist! They way you score is all about timing. Sometimes you want to lose the trick and other times you really need to win a trick. The game is based on the expression "The cobra effect" that i really encourage you to look up as it really fits perfect to the theme. The game also looks greally great, good artwork and nice graphic design. The only thing i dont like is that its a bit slow compared to other trick-taking games as you need to count a lot between the tricks, and moving around counters and count up scores on the score table etc. Oh and there is a lot of math and counting between the tricks, a bit annoying as it slows the game down. But other than that a really great game!

Cobras is an interesting little trick taking game. It's played like a fairly straightforward trick taking game, but cards have cobras on them. Losers of the trick split all the cobras on the cards. Winners sell cobras. There's an ideal number of cobras (seven) and if you sell before or after that you don't get as many points. And if the round ends before you sell off your cobras then they're points against you. You have one special card that allows you to share in the win (or loss).

The game is really about timing. You can guarantee that you can sell at least once whenever you want to, so you can maximize your points when you have seven cobras... or you could guarantee that you'll sell cobras at the end of the round, so that you don't get stuck with any of them. But if you try to do one then you're risking not doing the other.

I enjoyed this, despite failing miserably. I'd like to play it again.

It's seems to be a trend in trick takers these days to have a scoring system where your points slowly build up to a point where they quickly lessen afterwards. Cobras is no different. The players that do not win the trick share the cobra tokens on the table. The amount of tokens on the table is determined by the cards played. The player who wins the trick scores his cobra tokens. First player to 75/100 points wins. This leaves room for messing with the other players - make them score when they have no tokens and make sure they get more when they want to score. My only issue with it is that it gets pretty fiddly with the tokens.

Don't bother playing solo, it's horrible. As for competitively, I guess when I'm in an old folks home it'll be preferable to bridge. That said, I sure hope they send me to the same home as my gamer friends so we'll still be playing all the good stuff anyway.

trick taking game with a very interesting twist. You have to time the tricks you take and which not. You get more points for a trick the longer you wait and accumulate snakes on your basket card but if you wait too long, you get less points... this twist makes the game very cool and innovative.
Clear recommendation.

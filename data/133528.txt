Seems like the random element of the big bad bosses can massively influence the winner. For such a tight area control game this just detracts from what could be a good game.

The City of Remnants is a world full of all the remnants of conquered civilizations with a city that serves as a sort of prison/work camp. You play the leader of one of the gangs in this city trying to take things over. You recruit new members through a deck building mechanism, build up districts and buildings with special powers to enhance and grow your territory and fight a tactical battle with other players while it occasionally rains alien cops who try to poop in your corn flakes. All in all it is a good time but you need to play with the right people. The game is aggressive by default so if players are hyper competitive than the game can get kind of hostile. That said, I find it to be a fun, pretty, and thematically interesting game by Isaac Vega, who demoed the game for me at Pax East 2013 when it released. Yay Plaid Hat Games!

There are some really nice mechanisms in CoR. Light deck-building, area control, deck control.
Lots of dice, though which could be mad at you. Lots of luck involved. Anyhow good game with different paths to victory.

RATING: 7
A bit long but very satisfying.
A lot of cool concepts and I like the theme a lot.

I sometimes think the start should be 1 turn in and the end should be 1 turn out.  Feels like it ends right when things are getting interesting.

RATING: 4
Didn't care much for this. A lot of different mechanics which all felt a bit under-developed. I would rather have seen a more stream-lined game than this. Perhaps it was due to the fact that we were only 2 players, but since it was so disadvantageous to attack we just stayed back defending the majority of the game, which wasn't fun. On the other hand losing isn't much fun either so what do you do?

RATING: 5
Sharply downgrading for the moment. The game's problematic combat (you really should not do it) really dimmed the luster, I think. The area control aspect is real second fiddle to the engine building, which I think is less interesting.

Also a bit hampered by the way draftable gang members are very single gang oriented. Ultimately there just isn't that much variety in what each gang can and will do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Mean combination of area control and deck building (sort of). I like the deckbuilding elements, but the board-play and area control felt a bit unbalanced. The beginning of the game it was too easy to crush a player and put them behind for the rest of the game, and by the end of the game noone wanted to attack because of the immediate reprisal.

RATING: 7
So I finally sat down and played this game with 2 players.  This game I thought was going to be a dud.  I received the game in a trade and figured, well, lets do this.  The game at first was a little confusing as not everything is completely addressed in the rules clearly.  Once we got the rules straight, we restarted the game and played.  I think with two players the map is a little too large and the first person to get ahead would probably win.  With that said, I can see the 3 players side of the map and 4 players side (that is also the 2 player side that things could get vicious)  The game played well, once rules were established and flowed.  At first you want to spread out but the AI units will crush you early on if you do.  You want to expand but also recruit new gang members as well as develop tiles but acquire new items.  There is a lot you want to do but time is not on your side because your opponents can cut you off several different way.  The game flowed and 3 hours later felt like 15 minutes.  I was shocked, I thought this was going to be CRY HAVOC, however, everything I thought CRY HAVOC would deliver on and didn't, this one made up in style.  The minis are like zombie game ones but everything else is above adequate and worked well.  I look forward to playing again and see if I enjoy as much the next play as I did the last, maybe the next will be with 3 or 4 players and really test it out.  Not sure if I want to keep long term or not yet... few more plays I will be able to tell

Initial learning curve was steep. Took a while to figure out, but its certainly an interesting game. If playing coop set the renown pool to 100 instead of 200 for a faster game. Combination of a deck builder, soldier placement, develop/produce, and area control. 3 players would make it shine.

I really wanted to love this game after shut up and sit downs review. I do like it. Unfortunately both time I played it, it fell completely flat with my gaming group. They just didnt get into the theme and spent most of the game turtling. A part of me wants to give it another go in hopes that it opens up but no one wants to play with me.

3p Play with a friend's copy. Well thought out game, interesting mechanics. Theme-wise nothing to brag about. It does have a learning curve to it, since all gangs play differently and I would probably only play it with 4p again, since it has the usual problem of 2 players beating each other up while the third is walking through the park smelling the roses. It is somewhat long for what I thought it is (or rather lengthier than what I would prefer). All in all an ok game.

Game is too finicky with all the weird timing issues that can occur.  You also need the right group for this game (one that will not hold a Vendetta, but go after the person who is winning).  Personally I felt like nexus ops scratched the same itch, but plays for sure in 90min, where this game can totally drag on.  

This game does have some really cool mechanics, but it feels like its 80% there, and that the extra effort to polish was not given to it to bring it to the "Great" game level.

There is some risk of the "Death Spiral" but the multiple roads to victory can help there...  As long as you're not getting picked upon too harshly.

I can’t remember the last time I quit a game before it ended. I think it has only happened once or twice ever after more than 1600 plays. However, this was what happened when I played this game… It wasn’t voluntarily, though, but one of the players refused to continue playing after an hour or so, and one of the other players didn’t have time to complete the game, so we quit... We weren’t that far from finishing the game, though (we just needed to award a couple of points and two of us got 20 or so each turn), so I feel I experienced what the game had to offer and therefore am able to voice my opinion. Yes, I know some of you don't care for my opinion as I didn't finish the game, but again I must state that we were rather close to the end and did experience what the game had to offer!

Now, I think all 4 of us had very high expectations about this game. I mean, what’s not to like if you take a look at the mechanics which are listed for the game? To mention a few they include action point allowance system, area control, auction/bidding, deckbuilding, hand management, tile placement and variable player powers! I’m a eurogamer but do like Summoner Wars quite a bit, so I wanted to test this area control game where you could kill your enemies!

However, the game fell completely flat. The amounts of interesting decisions were minimal and the mix of all the cool mechanics didn’t work at all! Especially the “deck building” aspect of the game underwhelmed me – it just didn’t work at all. 

Before playing the game I wasthought the game was a little more “euroish” than what it actual was; to me, as a fan of eurogames, I think the “engine building” and such was insignificant and overall the game was too “Ameritrashy”. The reason is that it was simply too random. The main offenders were the amount of dice you roll and the extremely random pattern of the Yugai Patrol Units. These units (which have a random strength) are put on the table in a completely random way and can destroy your plans! Yes, you can bribe them, but that costs way too much in the beginning of the game. My main complaint about these units is not that they are extremely hard to defeat but the random nature in which they spawn. Still, if you lose, you lose units and cards which hurt you a lot. And even if you do win a battle against them (which you definitely can by clever placement of your army units and some hand management and some luck of the draw from your deck...), you must still roll a die and apply the result; on a 1 you lose 3000 money, on a 4 you get 3000... That’s what I call random! Yes, maybe you don't lose the game because of this, but it certainly doesn't help you either as it will most likely damage your early engine at a critical time. 

When fighting you get to roll a lot of dice. Yes, you can also play some cards from your hand which will add to the value, but it is still very random. In my game, one of the guys had a strength of 15 in his cards and the defender had 5. Then they rolled the dice, and the attacking guy rolled a blank, a blank, a blank and a one… Unreal! Again, there was nothing to do about it, and this is not my . He lost the battle and lost an important building which awarded a nice amount of VP’s each turn.

Furthermore, the game took way too long to play. I first thought our game with 4 players took too long, but as I can understand from the consensus here on BGG, the game really does take 2-3 hours. I think that’s too long for what the game offers in terms of interesting decisions and depth. Granted, though, we were all new players so we needed to read every single card which was put up for auction; with experience, the game will probably only take 90-120 minutes.
As I’ve only played it once, I cannot be sure about this, but I have a feeling that the variable player powers perhaps are TOO different and force the players of the different factions to go for a specific strategy (as in Red needs to attack, green needs to focus on building his infrastructure etc.). I think it’s a sad that you cannot successfully play a different strategy than what the decks encourage you to do – that’s basically “variable player powers done wrong”! This also applies to the bidding for gang members; some of the cards are really strong for some of the factions and useless for others, so you might not even be interested in the cards and winning them. Sure, you can try to push the bidding higher so the auctioneer doesn’t get the card he wants for free, but you secretly don’t really want the card in your deck yourself.

All in all, this game was a huge disappointment. I wanted to like it, but it just wasn’t a good game so I’m not interested in playing it again. Well I shouldn’t say that I guess, because I am actually willing to play it again with 3 players just to confirm my initial thoughts, but I don’t expect this game will ever be a favorite of mine.

Ugh.

City of Remnants is one of my big disappointments. I loved the idea of dudes on a grid, deckbuilding, combat, and building up an infrastructure. Even reading the rules left me feeling pretty good about this game.

In practice, though, there's some serious concerns after one play. There's a lot of reasons to turtle. At the same time, the primary advantage of entering a combat is that you can be completely vindictive... hurting your opponent but then opening yourself up to a similar attack. The building "powers" seem a bit out of whack, and it's awkward to reference their abilities from a card that off to the side of the board. I don't like the Yugai phase with its dropping of enemies on the board and the random die roll that rewards or punishes based on dumb luck. And lastly, it just takes too long. 

Maybe multiple plays would reveal that these flaws are not as severe as I imagine, but I can't imagine owning this game long term. Off to the trade list it goes!

This game intrigued me: different factions, deck building, bidding, fighting, building, and alien attacks. Unfortunately, it's just too many mechanics to teach a more casual group. It's a game that needs consistent play by other experienced people in order to get a good experience. That wasn't going to happen with my group, so traded away, but I would play again with people who are into it.

RATING: 5
Swingy area control game with a lot of random dice combat and chit draw. Limited actions per turn and a play till all VP chips are won control the length of the game. Turns can be long though since some factions get to use a lot of actions from their hand of cards per turn which are free.

The strategies don't seem to come from the black market or hand of cards so much as what is occurring on the board in terms of VP generating spaces and combat so it feels a bit limited despite the amount of variable setups you can have each round. Starting setup is mostly the same.

I really like many of the mechanics in this game, and the theme works fairly well. What I don't like is the extremely random nature of the Yugai patrols, which has actually completely ruined a couple of play sessions, and the fairly inflexible strategic nature of the separate factions.

Picked this up because I heard it was like "chaos overlords" (old PC game) - as a boardgame. Think it delivers fairly well. I keep it because it hosts a bunch of cool mechanics (deckbuilding, area-control, bidding) in a nice neat package.

mixed views on this game. I wanted to like it more than i did. It is a decent game design and it could be fun with a few comments;

Each of the factions if left uncheck can become very powerful, there is a fair amount of strong get stronger snowballing

Losing a couple of fights can put you way back behind the power curve

Turtling is a legit strategy

These problems can easily be overcome if you have a group that play the game often and the players learn to self balance. The game does its theme well and has mint components. The rules are easy to digest but the limitations on the useage of some cards are not clear.

What on earth were they smoking when they clocked this game at 90 minutes?  This is at least 3 hours every time.

Other than that, very interesting game mechanics with a lot going on at every corner.  Problem is with so much going on, balance can be a bit of an issue of someone gets buried in the mechanics.

I like the inclusion of asymmetrical play between the different factions. However, the downtime between turns in four player games is quite long, and especially if you are playing a faction that does not have long, complicated actions to go through. Nice mix of Escape From New York and Necromunda. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Really like that each faction has its own power. The mechanincs fit the theme well.

However, I feel that the cost of war is to high, making the players fight less. Nothing wrong woth that, but it makes the game a bit more multiplayer solitare than it needs to be.

RATING: 8.5
Only a couple of plays so far, but this has really hit home with me. I really like the mixture of mechanics that seem to be in perfect sync with each other. The mixture of planning, strategy and luck is just the way I like it. 

If there is one thing I would gripe about it would be that combat is not really encouraged a lot. It's a very risky strategy to go on the offensive, but sometimes can work great. 

This game is a definite keeper.

City of Remnants incorporates every card game mechanic you can think of. Auctions, offers, deck building. Well executed, this one. Lots of fun chance-based “gambling” cards. Great theme on the abilities. The starting decks each have their own feel. I especially like that the number gang member cards in your deck is equal to the number of number of units you have on the board (you must remove a gang member figure and card when losing a combat). Clever touches abound. Everything flows. We barely had to look at the rules after the first round. From a mechanics perspective, City of Remnants does just about everything right.

It’s a great looking game. Fun mini-figs (very mini indeed!), great art, LOVE the combat dice, nice cards. The board is underwhelming at first, but starts to really take shape once the developments come out. I would’ve preferred better differentiation between which cards work in which contexts. It’s a little unclear at first which developments have a “produce » develop” action vs. which provide start of round boosts, etc… It’s all buried in the card text. Same goes for gang member abilities. Just bolding the phase names when they’re in the text would’ve gone a long way to help here. We learned them pretty quick, but missed a few abilities along the way.

In the end, something about City of Remnants left me just shy of ecstatic. Most of the cards (at least in my deck) were so combat-focused that the amount of turns needed to get the economy going – move to a spot, put a development there, produce products on the development, sell those products, then leave units on the development to gain renown during scoring – made the combat feel secondary. For now, I’m willing to chalk this one up to bad strategy on my part. Probably should’ve been more aggressive once I realized I had the bruiser deck. Feels like I’m just scratching the surface after the first plays.

City of Remnants is very good. It’s a nice medium weight game that’s easy to learn, but feels meaty. It doesn’t fall into deterministic resource exchanges, but still has a nice “plow, sow, harvest” style economic system to it in addition to the combat. The way it deals with deck building and management is very fresh and modern.

Play this Game!! City of Remnants is about the most fun you can have with dudes on a map if you ask me. REALLY! It's gonna take you a minute to understand what your path to victory is, but this game just keeps blossoming every time I play. Just reserve your judgements about the factions until you have quite a few plays. The factions really ARE asymmetrical, with very different winning strategies and tactics you will use to dupe your opponents. It's amazing that first time designer Isaac Vega blended so many mechanics so well here.

RATING: N/A
I really enjoyed the beginning of this game, but then I managed to break it without trying very hard by creating an endless card loop using multiple copies of the cheapest card in the deck. Police bingo, which might be advantageous or harmful, with no relation to the difficulty of the encounter, was also fairly annoying. But I broke this game the very first time I played it. Ridiculous.

RATING: 7
Area control-esque game where you buy buildings which gain you victory points from the pool each turn and should generate you an income.

Suppliment your deck of actions with additional gang members and technologies to allow you to do more with your turn.

Each gang has a very different feel and I played the red gang which are very violent and excel at removing problems... unfortunately to 'remove' a problem you need a cash injection which you gain easily once you 'remove a problem' so in order to really get into the game and be competitive you have to spend several actions moving across the board and then cripple one of the other players by destroying what they spend X many turns building up so that you may begin to build.

Overall really enjoyed this and the random distribution of buildings adds a lot of replayability as does the differing gangs.

RATING: 4
First play tanked hard, as waht I feared could happen did happen - the Yugai land on the first turn and promptly smash one of the players out of the game.  After that everything was a bit procedural, as the player who won pulled ahead early and then it was just a case of going through the motions.

It needs more plays, but I can't help but feel that there is a good game in here; a second edition would probably clear up a lot of the issues I have with it.

The problem with this game is, if you make a mistake it is virtually impossible to get back into the game, you spend (the overly long) play time being bored and just really doing nothing at all to compete and with a playtime of around 4 hours, it can mean a player in that position is left twiddling their thumbs and descending into boredom

CoR is a game that I really wanted to like. It has all the elements of games that I like (card drafting, battles, building, special powers, asymmetry, etc.). After 1 1/2 hours I felt like this was a rather fun game. But then it dragged on for another 2 hours after that for a total of 3 1/2 hours. This game is way too rinse-and-repeat for a length of that degree. Yes, there is development, but not enough to justify the long play time. Perhaps it does get faster as players understand the game better, but that creates a real barrier towards new players. I think that knowing the cards is important too, as a lot of time is spent reading the tiny text on the cards. A shame. Lots of good elements, but play time is way too long (and sort of needs to be, due to asymmetrical "short-term" vs. "long-term" factions.)

Have played it 4 player and 2 player now. I like it better as a 2 player game because that eliminates a couple of issues I had in the 4 player game. The first issue being the "Puerto Rico Effect" where illogical play by a player can give another player an edge they didn't earn. The second being that combat can really leave both participants open to attacks of opportunity from any players not involved in that combat.

Some of the mechanics don't seem to mesh at first, but after I got the hang of it this seemed like a pretty cool game.
In my one game I got into an early death spiral, where I was without cards and easily preyed upon by another opponent. But there are tons of ways to mitigate this once you know the game, so I don't think it's a major knock against it.

I believe this to be a very underrated board game. It's mainly an area control/worker placement with hand management and combat, sprinkled with a little AI policing action. 

Basically, players take turns performing various actions to earn VPs until they're gone. You move meeples around the board, play cards to assist in actions, buy more cards to fill your hand, build districts on the board to gain money, VPs, and/or special abilities, and battle with cards and dice for more profitable positions on the board.

The game is balanced and blends a lot of mechanics nicely, so it's not one "type" of game. Our game ended with some pretty close scoring... there wasn't a runaway and the lead seemed to change hands throughout, without a clear winner until the end. In our first play it did run a little long (4+) hours, which I think is why it gets bad PR on BGG considering the 90 minute play time stated on the box... but I think this can be reduced with experience, probably even on the 2nd play.

We played with 4 (not all pictured) which seemed ideal, but they have a nice 3-player variant in the rules and even a 3p layout on the backside of the board! That could be cool too. I'm probably not interested in playing with 2, but the option is available.

Overall, great game and I'm glad I took a flyer on it.﻿

First and (probably) last play: I'd give it 4 stars because not enough experience to actually rate it a 3, which was my initial rating. The first hour of the game took far too long as we were scraping together whatever we could which amounted to scraps. Meanwhile, everyone was turtling in their own little area. Obviously, a more aggressive group might play it differently. But, for the premise of the game, it doesn't really push you to be aggressive. And there's so much to do to even get the simplest economy/engine going.

Honestly, I'd rather play Kemet.

The graphic design is also a bit off; the cards are good to great, but everything about the board is ugly and/or very difficult to use (the buildings are the prime culprits here). Such a shame.

I really wanted to like it, but I didn't. In many ways it comes close to being a decent game though. I wish it had been developed for another year or so, and some of the more superfluous randomness taken out. The D6 roll after defeating a robot is particularly lame, giving a 50% chance of a good or bad event. That's just a step too far, after the pure random hoseage the robot invasion already presents. 

Though I normally enjoy auctions, I do think this game would have benefitted from just letting the player purchase unit cards outright. That would shave some significant play time without losing much. 

Balance is definitely an issue. Certain tiles, like the fortification tile that kills attacking units 2/3 of the time before they can even battle, are just obviously too good. Units are far too expensive and scarce to experiment with... aggression will be punished harshly. Also, in our game the unit deck was quickly exhausted, making the earlier, bloody battles even more costly. Seems like a rule on what to do when that deck runs out should have been included.

Thematically neat, and with a nice presentation. Could've been good. Alas.

This game is quite thematic, I like the deck-building part, the areal fighting for control of strategic or high-VP squares, the asymetrical factions, the bidding for gang-members, the combined card-&-dice-fighting & generally the tons of options you have on your turn.

There really are all the "modern" game mechanics, and although one might think there are too many.. they actually fit together quite seamlessly..

Lots of fighting & thinking about what & how many cards to play either from your hand or draw-pile & using special abbilities on them can stretch the game-lenght considerably.

With 4 player (wich seems the best) it can feel a bit long though..

this game looks cool and the gameplay isnt that bad. It has some major flaws though.

Not bad, very dependent on the group you play it with as the game is pretty much in your face confrontation - and some groups don't gel well with that. There are some power creep and exploit issues in the game,blatant ones are fixed, can be tough though.

This is the game that screams to be Judge Dredd themed. It basically is Mega City One and competing gangs within it - just without licence for the official IP.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game has some interesting mechanics which are unfortunately ruined by a lack of catch-up mechanics and a playtime which far too long. My 4p game took 3 hours!

Play is asymmetric with each faction having their own deck. This gives them each a very distinct play style. Players can build their decks by starting auctions for communal cards. Each card has an ability and a combat strength for each of the factions, so each player potentially values the cards differently. There are building to build which give VP each round if occupied and other special abilities. Opponents can attack you and steal these buildings. 

There is a lot of player interaction. Mostly in the form of combat. The combat is pretty straight forward and uses both cards and dice. I didn't find the luck here to be too much. However, if you loose the battle you loose the figure off the board and a card from your deck. This loss of cards and figures is a serious problem and can lead to a death spiral. There is no way to compensate for this, if you get beat up and suffer too much you likely can't win the game. There is no way to come back. For a game with so much combat built into the rules it is pretty devastating to loose battles.

Given this poor-get-poorer structure the long playtime is particularly painful. The game has some neat mechanics and a pretty fun theme (the flavour text is hilarious if you like shitty flavour text). This game needed quite a bit of further development. As is, it's next to unplayable.

This is a good game; however, it doesn't quite come together as well as the sum of its parts might suggest.  City of Remnants throws all kinds of mechanics at you and it's all fairly easy to pick up after a few turns.  The choices are varied and you can take different paths to victory, though in 3 and 4 player matches it's very hard to avoid conflict.

Let me emphasize: This is not a bad game. I enjoyed the sessions I've played. But there are quite a few things that kill the fun and make me to not want to play this ever again.

I played the game quite a few times and it falls flat more and more often. I admire all the good ideas: The deckbuilding, improving your gang with items, developments etc. But the game crashes and burns by the fact that fighting is superfluous because it is so not worth for the attacker. Not at all. Nada. The buildup part of the game also just does not feel compelling.

In addition, there is just a lot of luck. I'm not talking about taking-risks-and-fail luck, but "haha-you're-f*****-and-there-was-nothing-you-could-have-done-about-it" luck. 

This is one of the few games that got WORSE with each time I've played it.

RATING: 6
This is a solid asynchronous powers game which is actually quite interesting and dynamic.  My main concern is that if people play carefully by making sure to expand slowly making sure each zone is supported, the game becomes less interesting.  To help spur some conflict, there is an interesting alien overlord phase where alien forces drop down out of the sky and if you are in the space they are dropping onto, battle or bribes ensue which can lead to disaster if not well prepared.  

Each player starts off with a deck of different cards and powers and as future actions has the opportunity to add black market goods and gang members to the deck.  Initially, we all wondered why anyone would choose the refresh action but after one or two of us were destroyed due to lack of available cards in our deck/hand, the importance of refresh became crystal clear!  

The game is fairly simple to play, but a learning game will likely take at least 3-4 hours as you explore and learn how the game operates.  Buildings can be built which can also provide special bonuses or just provide goods/money.  Money management is fairly crucial.

My favorite (although potentially the most painful as well) aspect of the game is that if one loses a battle, a gang member is removed from the board and you must trash a gang member card from your deck.  When you buy a new gang member, you add a dude to your available gang member stack and the card to your hand.  This is a clever mechanic to add on to deck building...

Sold as it takes too long to achieve what it does.  As well, I felt like as we got to understand defensive positioning more, there was quite a bit more stagnation on the attacks.

 I read a review of this that sounded good and was able to secure a copy. It’s an odd little beast, with a bit of a kitchen sink approach: area control, auctions, combat, resources, deck-building — kind of surprised you don’t have to place workers or draft opening hands. It all combines to make a sloppy, drunken, slugfest of a game. Even the theme wants to punch you: it starts off talking about the Yugai, galactic conquerors, but then tells you where you fit: you’re refugees who’ve already been conquered, fighting for scraps in Yugai controlled slums. I’m not sure how essential this is compared to, say, Nexus Ops or Neuroshima Hex, both of which are similar in feel and both of which deserve to be played more often. I’d like to give it another shot, but no one else was too crazy about it.

El instructivo es un poco confuso en cuanto al reabastecimiento de cartas en tu deck. El último juego nos pareció un poco largo, pero puede que tuviera que ver con esta mala lectura.

Criticisms:

I'm sorry but hell's bells there are some bloody awful art/aesthetic choices in this game. (PHG came up with the wonder that is Mice and Mystics - how did they end up with this?)

big COPYRIGHT NOTICES on some CARDS!! (What were you thinking!!! Why? Why on earth?!)

Everything is too dark. I know it's supposed to gritty but come on, you can barely make out some of the characters in evening light.

Sickly RGB colour schemes.[/i]

This said... It's really rather good to the degree that while aesthetics should be condemned in the short term I really pleased I picked this up and don't think the aesthetics will truly impact my longterm opinion of the game. Early days but opening gambit (8) can't wait to play again. Rather successful hybrid that offers all sorts of mechanics, tactical and strategic options.

When it comes to two player it's open to a leader but frankly that's the price you pay for letting an opponent get in front. It's not as extreme as you see in the likes of Cyclades however and such a lead will occur over a longer period of time with the weaker player failing to intervene. 

Luck - there is a lot of luck in this game like all Plaid Hat Games but, also like almost all Plaid Hat Games, this luck is always less significant than players decision making. If you hate luck I dare say some simple house rules would limit it's impact - frankly though I like a bit of luck in my games. 

It's also longer than 90mins. Want a shorted game? Use less VPs or start with a more developed/generous set up.

RATING: 6
I'm having a tough time rating this game.  All in all, I think it's a very good game, but just not really the kind of game I love to play.  I'm glad I played it the once and we had a great game.

I'll start with what's good about the game.  I liked the interplay of the various mechanics, the auction style deck-building, the combat system with a variety of supportive cards, the variety of buildings (with variability in each game), the asymmetrical players decks, all good qualities. I liked how you could recruit cards from other races to your gang, with slightly less benefit, but taking them away from your rivals and allowing you to work toward other strategies.  And the building-producing had a Race for the Galaxy/Puerto Rico feel which I liked (even if I didn't employ that strategy to much benefit).

I think I have to knock off about a point for the components and the art style.  It was just not that attractive to me.  The square grid board wasn't very interesting and with some tweaks (and much improved art) the game could visually be much more appealing.  The different figurines are cool, even if they don't mean anything to game play.  The gang members should have been much more diverse in their look, and the buildings look even more indistinguishable.  This really could have improved the feel of the game, even if the game-play is solid.  Frankly, this looks like a prototype.

Second, our game went very long, between 3 and 4 hours, not including teaching. Sure 3 of us were newbies, but I didn't feel like we were slogging through our decisions that much.  I can see this picking up maybe an hour at most, at least with 4 players.  That's too bad, because I think I would enjoy it a lot more if it wasn't such a commitment.  Maybe I owe it one more game, just to see how much the time can be improved, but do I really want to spend another 3 hours on a game that, in the end, just isn't in my wheelhouse?

Lastly, though I enjoyed the combat system, and did pretty well at it, I felt like I had a target on my back just because I was playing well.  And if one opponent weakens your defense of cards with battle, the next guy can attack you again before you can build up.  I actually lost because in defending against one last attack, I left myself with few defensive cards and some unlucky police drops left me having to fight off two police at once.  Even with a strong position, but few cards, I lost one building, and the game, by just 3 or 4 points.  Overall, I don't have much complaint for this.  It is what it.  It can be lucky, for sure.  It's not bad, just not everybody's cup of tea.  It was interesting, it was fun.  Just not what I want to play that often.  

Final thoughts: If it were at or under the 90 minute mark, I would enjoy it a lot more. Since it's not really my style, though, the 2+ hours playing time is not going to make me seek this out again anytime soon.

Of the deck building games that I have played, this is the most thematic and enjoyable - which, for my tastes, is not saying much.  Game includes bidding, area control, and combat mechanics.  Playing it, I get the same bored feeling as with any deck building game: just feels like turning knobs, moving sliders, making motions.  In other words, just stacking one action on top of another and getting something out of it to convert to something else that ultimately hits the pinnacle of... victory points.  Yawn.

Another complaint I had related back to the interrelation of deck management and combat.  Combat is fought via the cards in your hand and those remaining in your draw pile.  So, if you are attacked by one player you tend to burn through the prepared cards in your hand and possibly a good portion of your draw pile.  That public loss of resources makes you the target for other players to attack you immediately after, given that your card supply is low and you may have also lost some territory that fractured your support.  For those not familiar with the rules, the basic complaint is that once you are injured you attract other players like hyenas on the savannah.  And, like an injured animal, you have less available resources to protect yourself with. Not a good game mechanic considering that this can occur even after a player has taken good precautions to have a solid defensive hand and a thick draw pile before the first attack.

One final complaint, the artwork is unattractive and juvenile.  Not pleasing to look at.

A thematic game where the threat of conflict is often just as effective (and far less costly) than actually open aggression, though that has its place, too. In this instance, deck building serves as an attractive abstraction for both recruiting and logistics of organized crime. Looking forward to playing again.

City Of Remnants is a flawed game, but an interesting failure. It's mix of gameplay mechanics is possibly unique among gaming, having warlike Area Control contention, where ones success is powered by choices made deckbuilding, partially through auctions.

This game is clanky for sure, and has some issues - could be tighter, shorter, with more variety and less complexity. In short, it could be streamlined and more elegant. And I don't like the way VPs are tied to triggering the end game (the Warrior Knights mechanic) which makes for very different and volatile games. And the Gods only know if it's even close to balance.

BUT BuT Buttt this game has some absolutely brilliant ideas. It's really a unique and magnificent combination of delicious mechanics. The deck-building-in-service-of running an area control faction is amazing, and though clanky is still among the best of its kind. The way influence governs your hand size, the number of VPs you can buy, your production limit etc. is absolutely beautiful. The high-stakes battles -with you losing gang members that you send into battles, makes for a high tension game (and creates some potential problems). I love this game so much, and it's sad that it's hard to bring to the table (other games are shorter, easier to learn, shinier themes and components). Still, a unique and lovely experience.

I really, really, /really/ like the idea of this game.  It's basically an amalgam of all sorts of interesting ideas.  I enjoy dudes on a map, I enjoy deckbuilding, I enjoy building things and upgrading them, I enjoy figuring out what to do with each turn in a game.  But the game is just too random, with enough lack of control that I feel many times I just don't have any good choices.  And the police phase is utter crap.

I still think there's a really solid redeemable game inside here somewhere.

A really great game with a lot of layers. It was nice to play something where annihilating the enemy was not the primary goal. Intrigue, backstabbing, and careful planning is what wins the game. There's enough variation for multiple plays and the background gives it a fun cyber punk feeling that's also further represented by the artwork and cool figurines. Definitely worth your time.

Incredibly deep game with an infinite amount of possibilities. The theme is amazing, very strategic, incredible minis.

Surprisingly, all the different mechanics in this game bonds extremely well with each other... deck building, auctioning, tile placement, fighting, etc. you name it.

I absolutely love the asymmetrical factions, every decisions are crucial as you really feel the tension in the underground gangster world. It really feels like you're the leader of your faction and that the prosperity of it is in your hands.

Rules are simple, but how hard to master as the depth of the game is his strongest quality. This game is a masterpiece !! Soooo underrated !! Nice job Plaid Hat Games !! :D

Yikes, that IS a lot of mechanics! Got destroyed in the first game (which is unfortunate, since typically I pick up a game quickly and then lose when my opponents figure things) - but I'm looking forward to trying again, maybe with a different faction (and certainly with a new strategy).

Also, the art/flavor is amazing.

Heavy but streamlined military area control game. It's really interesting and takes some time to play, but it has a lot of unique ideas and mechanics that make it special. The limit to 2 figures per spot, and the way adjacent figures support your attack is really interesting. I also like how thematic everything in the game is. The rules are simple out of the book, but the cards themselves are what make things complex.

Your combat ability is heavily reliant on the cards you have in your hand, or available in your deck, which means that getting into combat early in the round can be a disaster, and the last player to take their action in any given round has an advantage.

RATING: 8.8
After the first play through (4 player game), I must say that this is an excellent game.  It's extremely fun and has great strategic depth.  Everyone else at the table felt similarly, and they all immediately said that they would play it again.

This game has elements of deck building and area control, with money management, and lots of interaction.  But just saying those things does not do justice in describing the game play.  Each gang has unique powers and abilities, which gives each gang a different play style.  And there are common elements that everyone has access to.  Even though the game has a good amount of strategic depth, it still remains quite simple to learn and teach.

One thing I appreciate about this game is that even when one gang becomes powerful, they don't become invincible.  So if you're the top gang, you always feel vulnerable.  And if you're in last place, you don't ever feel like you're completely out of the game.

One small negative is that I think the rulebook could be a little clearer and obvious at certain points.  Thankfully, Plaid Hat just recently released a FAQ that clears up a lot of these issues.  I definitely recommend that you download the FAQ and read it after reading the core rulebook.

All in all, I think this game is excellent.  If Plaid Hat comes out with some expansion packs for this game (new gangs, equipment, buildings, maps, etc.), I think my rating might even go higher, and I already rated it quite high (I'm pretty tough with my numerical ratings).

I was really excited about City of Remnants. It's impressive in scope, with amazing artwork and a ruthlessness that's lacking in eurostyle games.

Poorly designed game that is part worker placement/area control, part tactical war game, part economic.  The problem is too many ill conceived parts and too much randomness to make any strategy other than 'turtle and survive' valid'.  This game also has no mechanic to retreat, add to the punishment.  A total and absurd waste of time and money.

It looks like it's put together from parts of about four other games, but City of Remnants is sleek and intuitive, filled with nastiness and tough choices. Probably the best use of deck-building since Mage Knight, where each card is a new member of your gang. The abstraction is in all the right places, and the combat is unforgiving and vicious. I'm especially impressed by how the game handles asymmetry between players. Sure, you have emphases that you can concentrate on, but as the game goes on you'll take on elements of all four factions. You're doing different stuff from your opponents, but it's very flexible and open. You don't have to stay entirely in your lane. A terrific game that is the best that 2013 has offered so far.

*edit* Was eventually traded away. It has a ton of moving parts, and never really felt like it was operating smoothly. There are a lot of things to like, but it's probably too cumbersome for its own good.

Fantastic game - one of the best of the year so far. 

Lots of interesting tactics, fascinating asymmetric sides - probably my favourite next-generation deck-builder. 

Addendum: hit the problem that yellow always seemed to be the faction to beat. Their ability to burn through their deck was just too good, or so the consensus in our group became. Gradually this started getting to the table less and less often, so eventually it got traded.

Was a little disappointed with my first play.  Combat seemed strange, you would have one good battle with your cards in hand then you would have a pretty random battle with cards from the deck, didn't get it.

A lot of neat mechanics that didn't quite work.

See we were re drawing, by the real rules it might be better.

So much better on the second play.  Had all the rules down, flowed very clearly.  Building symbols do ID them just find but the name would not have been a bad idea somewhere on the tile.  This was a 3 player and I think 4 would be better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Its... good and interesting. I appreciate the different mechanics and how they click together, but for some reason I was left unimpressed. Most probably I expected a heavier game, one with more interaction and something requiring more planning. While this is no lightweight, it's mostly tactical - you get what windfalls you can, no need to plan a sequence of your actions and predicting those of the opponnents. While the interaction is on a mid- to high level (depending on the group), it's a game of light skirmishes and shows of force more than battles (as a game about gangs should!) and it's more of 'will he try to go after this building of mine, rather than chess like prediction of whole interactions.

If you like games a bit on the complex side, but that still can be played casually, this might be right up your alley, as it really is an interesting and unique title with very good marriage of theme and mechanics. Myself, I'd rather play either a heavier euro, or a more confrontational title like Forbidden Stars.

RATING: 6
A retread of mechanisms from Puerto Rico/Race for the Galaxy (build vs. produce-consume cycle), plus deckbuilding element (more Blood Bowl Team Manager than Dominion), plus an actual board to directly mess opponents up. Seems like a good idea, but the entire package, like its source inspirations, just seemed to lack its own soul to me. You get to recruit gangsters, build developments, produce illicit goods, sell them, take over stuff with a not-bad combat system, and fend off the police, but I couldn't help thinking this was just resource management, with the theme disguising the Euro Mechanisms 101 skeleton. Dry, contrived bits like the Yugai police force that consistently comes at the same time and in the same number but at unpredictable locations, the consistent D6 roll reward after defeating them, the consistent move-everybody-3-spaces thing, the dull nature of all the products (differentiated by how much it is worth), the boring grid board etc just seem to sterilize the game. I found it hard to care about my dudes.

I switch off nitpicks about theme when I play card games (Race for the Galaxy, Dominion) or obviously-Euro games (Puerto Rico), but find the dryness harder to forgive when the theme is more in-your-face and the tacked-on incongruence is more obvious.

[i]Four Diverse Factions Battling it Out. Fun Game that can Run a Bit Long. Design Has an Amateurish Feel at Times.[/i]

Best with 4 players. (Haven't actually tried it with 4 yet, but this is based on analysis) 

First impressions are positive. This is an ambitious game that strings together several mechanisms which are familiar but used mashed together in a new way (combat, area control, auctions, deck building, hand management...) while remaining streamlined and digestible. The rulebook is under 20 pages!

I've played a few other really unique games over the years, and most of them end up being really novel but end up as flash in the pan that lack real depth -- too much focus on the front-end and just not enough catering to the repeat-player

And while City of Remnants does show some classic signs of amateur design and testing (I see there's already been errata issued to address an infinite loop that should have been exposed with proper tetsing) it also strikes me as a game that has potential for depth. And the unique setting and gameplay make it a charmer with no clear substitute (right now, in my collection, it probably competes with Cyclades, Nexus Ops, Chaos in the Old World, for intangible reasons)

2 player: It makes a decent 2 player game, but it left me with the impression that it really wants more players for more conflict and drama. 2 player will be the least interactive 

3 player: holy shit this is brutal! Just like I expected, there is much more conflict. Feels like it may not really work with 2 now.

4 player: haven't tried yet

One thing of note about player coutns is it seems like additional players shouldn't add much game time (other than analysis time by more players), since the amount of Renown in the pool -- which is what causes the game to end, remains the same regardless of player count. 4 players burn through the Renown faster than 2 players. Think Dominant Species.

[b]I'd Rather Play:[/b] Chaos in the Old World

(2 Design + 4 Enjoyment)

[hr]After third play it's starting to seem like each race actually has a "role" in the game of sorts -- the blue race being present means that there will be more buildings ubilt, the red one means there will be a hell of a lot more combat (he's basically Khorne from Chaos in the Old World). So I'm starting to think this game really wants 4 players. Plus the renown takes too many rounds to deplete in 2-3 player, and the game drags a little cause of tghat.

Shut Up & Sit Down turned me onto this game. Typically, I find games they review positively enjoyable, so I sought this one out. I suppose we can't agree on everything.

"City of Remnants" does a little bit of everything: area control, resource collection, deck building, combat. But it doesn't do any specific thing particularly well. I feel similarly to this as I do "Scythe" but "City of Remnants" doesn't have the stellar artwork to fall back on. In fact it's downright ugly, tacitly that may be thematic. 

"Dominant Species" remains the reining king of games that do it all, and do it all immaculately.

I'm fond of the mechanics in this game.  I loved the varied options and content between the black market, gang recruits, and development market.  There were a lot of decisions to be made and a lot of paths to take.

I did, however, have a problem with the imbalance in some of the starting decks.  One player was able to cycle his whole deck from the start and make huge amounts of money...sorry, ARCs...and the other had a handful of cards that gave him discounts on all the different markets in the game.  I was stuck with a combat-oriented starting deck and early in the game making money and buying stuff is exponentially more powerful/important than combat prowess and I found myself falling behind early.

Good theme play.  Fairly easy to learn and play.  Game reminds me of Urban Sprawl and Suburbia with the combat element of Space Empires.  Seems attacking is very difficult.  Do not care for the random attacks phase and the variable end game.  Components are very good - colorful mounted game board, thick cardboard chits, plastic playing pieces, heavy paper playing mats, and somewhat durable cards.  Artwork is average.  Rulebook seemed well organized.  Our first play was a bit long at 3+ hours but length will drop with more plays.

RATING: 6
This game should take 90 min according to the BGG page but it took 145 minutes for us with four players. You need to know the strengths and weaknesses of each faction a little bit in order to predict a little bit how each will play. There are many different mechanics. There is randomness in the battles which is OK. The random dice roll after you have fought the police is a bit lame, though, because points are randomly rewarded and deducted. The game would need a better player board, particularly the significance of the influence points is not explained fully on the player board, and this is something you need to know.

My only complaint is the rulebook. It explains many things clearly but leaves out quite a few rules and clarifications.

We feel like we broke the game twice in the first 2 rounds. 

There's so little actual information in the rulebook (though there is space for a 2 page 'story' of the world) that every action becomes a series of rules questions and FAQ checking. After 4 or 5 house rules just to keep the game moving, we abandoned it in favour of something else.

Within 1 turn, if I can find an infinite loop with my deck, you've not play tested this enough (or at all). Looking at the rulebook, the group of playtesters looks a lot like it might have been 2 groups, mostly made up of family members. THAT IS NOT ENOUGH PLAYTESTING. We shouldn't have to house rule your games; you should test and fix them prior to release. Plaid Hat Games, we expect better.

This game has serious issues with run-away leader.  If you lose a battle or two, it's difficult to come back.  Also, once you start losing you guys, it's difficult to replenish them, since new characters are gained through auction.  If you are losing battles, you definitely don't have the money to compete in auctions, which drives you further into the ground. There are many times during the game when you feel that there is nothing useful that you can do.  I don't recommend it.

I like the idea of the game, but it seems to have a number of issues and possible balance problems.

Manages to use deck-building without feeling like a deck builder, which is a blessed relief.

RATING: 4
This is my rating after one play, and I genuinely feel that with an additional play it could either go up or down by one.

There is a lot going on in this game. Every major game mechanic from the last twenty years of modern gaming was thrown into the stew that is City of Remnants. Deck-building, auction bidding, tile placement, rotating marketplace, territory control...phew.

There are a lot of different paths to victory, but only one that is assured: hunker down, build up an army that's super intimidating, build and control a lot of developments, and just sit there and let others be too scared to attack you.

That's the main problem with this game. The threat of combat has such a heavy influence on what you do. All your characters have combat values. Many of the items you buy influence combat. Some developments give you attack or defense modifiers.

So why is attacking so heavily penalized? Being forced to mill through your hand to attack is ridiculous. Unless you make attacking your last action, you'll have to waste another turn just to refresh your hand. Ponderous. And losing a battle? Forget it. It's crippling, having to lose a character card permanently.

There's also a serious runaway leader problem. I did well in my first game, taking second place, but the veteran player at the table creamed me by 30 points. And the third place guy was 30 points behind me! Not even close.

There are some nice aspects about the game - theme, graphic design, artwork - but they can't really overcome the inherent flaws of the design.

Just a bit of a tedious mess really, with a ton of different mechanics thrown together and nothing to really 'glue' things into a cohesive whole. Player powers seem extremely unbalanced, with the red player forced into aggression - but losing a fight (thanks to a bad dice-roll) is extremely punishing, whereas other players get to turtle and work on their economic engine.
Goes on a bit too long as well.

I'll start by saying I like this game. I enjoyed the mashup of different mechanics, deck builder, area control, action point and resource management.  I love the theme and it was prevalent throughout the entire game. I thought the components were solid. The game play is a bit much at first but once you get it down, it's pretty easy. The negatives are play time. It says 90 minutes but I'm not sure how that is even possible as our games take much longer. Also I broke the game with the yellow team by getting an infinite loop of drawing cards. Obviously chose not to exploit but it is certainly possible. I like the way all 4 gangs feel unique with different strengths. Also a very mean game.

City of Remnants is somewhat of a mixed bag. There are a lot of great ideas, such as using deck-building mechanisms to represent gang recruitment and to simulate unpredictable turf wars. When you move in on someone's enterprise, whatever cards they are holding at that particular moment determine who was "on duty" when the battle breaks out. Casualties are removed from the game and their card removed from your deck, so there is a real sense of consequences springing from your actions, which is great.

There are a few minor issues that mar the experience. The card text is minuscule and the buildings have no text or effect symbols on them, so having to refer to their randomizer cards is a constant annoyance. Another issue is the asymmetry of the starting gangs. While normally I like asymmetry, in this game the starting decks are overly tuned and the recruitment decks aren't varied enough to take your deck in an oddball direction. It feels almost like you are on rails, with your starting gang dictating the exact path you must take to be competitive.

Overall, this feels like a rough draft of something greater. Maybe someday it will get a reboot or a re-implementation. In the mean time though, I think I am going to stick with Sons of Anarchy for my street gang gaming fix.

Gritty area control with asymetric powers that gear your deck building to your strengths.  If you don't mind that and some luck of the cards thrown in, you get a nice thematic game of punk warefare.  Euro mechanics with Ameritrash conflict.

It seems the game favors inaction over action. Fighting is so draining that it seems better to just let the rest do it while you build up your empire.
If you are not the red side and attacking, you are probably doing a huge mistake.
A little overcomplicated without justification.

I think for similar better experience, Kemet and nexus ops do it better.

Can´t recommend.Though it´s not terrible. And May change my mind with more plays.

A game that feels like it should be better than it is.  A lot of really engaging ideas and chrome in this one, but then it seems to peter out into massive draw random cards and roll huge quantities of dice battles.

Where at the beginning, the aliens are scary, later they become virtually irrelevant.

Overall, fun for the first hour, and then drags after that.

I really need to give this game more plays but my initial impression is very positive. The only aspect that I found a bit fiddly was whenever alien patrols are placed on the board. However, the rest of the game was very interesting. I liked that each player's deck is unique at the start. I loved the direction relation between the size of the player's deck and their number of available units. I liked the ability to buy new gang members and black market cards to customize your faction's deck. And I liked the addition of the buildings and their unique abilities.

Overall, I thought this game was really fun to play and supported its theme extremely well. Looking forward to exploring this one more.

I really enjoy this one. Hard to get to the table due to the subtlety of the theme and the initial complexity of the different interlocking game mechanics.

Excellent mix of multiple engaging mechanics, varying player abilities (built into each of the four player's starting decks), high-quality components, and fun theme. I haven't played a 4 player game yet, and I think this is where it'll be best.

Decent area control and deck building aspects with asymmetric gangs. The iconography and graphic design in the game is its biggest downfall particularly the building tiles - it is not always easy to read and parse what's going on which I feel is a flaw that could have been avoided.

Not played for quite a while, need to get this to the table again.

A shame that this game didn't get a look in. I thought it was good but it just never really seemed to get played so I had to move it along, my games are for playing not gathering dust.

It sounds like something I should like but in play the different mechanics didn't seem to mesh very well. Not enough interesting options.

Interesting game. The theme is dark, but very unique and cool. 

Don't expect this to be the Ameritrash game you are expecting. It actually has a bunch of Euro mechanics that strangely fit with the theme. It is not as confrontational as you would expect.

Still trying to sort through my feelings about this game.  I like the asymmetric factions, but you are a bit stuck playing to their strengths.   Nice mix of game mechanics and several different strategies. Very different from the normal deck building game. 

On the other hand, the game can drag if people are too conservative and turtle.  The random attacks can be too powerful in punishing certain factions.  The artwork is simply ugly and I was a bit underwhelmed with how the theme played out in the actual game.

Note: 3 cards have a visible crease on the back although game is complete and otherwise in very good condition.  Only minor wear and tear.

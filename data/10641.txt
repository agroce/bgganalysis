RATING: 10
Purchased AGS after buying and playing 2 scenerios of Kiev to Rostov.  Liked the EFS so much that I purchased AGS.  Just finished scenerio 3 and decided to just slide right into the campaign game at turn 7.  Love the system.  Love the maps and counters.  Easy to refer back to the rulebook for specific rules.  A classic.  I plan to purchase the whole series as new games are released and the old games are reprinted.  Tough to find used.

Highly recommended especially in conjunction with the other linked modules in the series. Beautiful maps and rules that model the difficulties of both the Germans and Russians in 1941. 

Being reprinted by GMT to included updates the rules, and counters since it's first issue. Now on pre-order on the GMT site.

This game is one of those rare chances to see a Eastern Front wargame that provides a realistic Axis Ally OB in the Romanian Army.  I would like to know what Ty Bomba, and other designers of Russian Front games, feel about what Vance V.B. has done with the Romanians.  They are even given a scenario of their own to try and take Odessa.  Marvelous!  Simply marvelous!

V.V.B.'s Barbarossa Army Group series are perhaps the best divisional level games on the Eastern Front.  Yes, I do have some rule questions; there are either holes in the rules or in my head; I'm not sure which.  

There is a lot to learn, me bucko, so ye who are fearful of "fiddly" rules take notice.  If you do not have the stomach for it, then go play your WWII:BtB and EE games; but that's all you will be doing is "playing a game."  If you want to experience a fantastic historical simulation of the opening weeks of the Barbarossa Campaign, then gird your loins, sharpen your brains and quit your griping.

"You get what you pay for" is true, not only in what you buy, but in what you invest, and if you are willing to invest the mental energy (along with some generous table space!), you will get a great return on your efforts.

As a designer, V.V.B. seems to have found the "right" (there is no perfect) balance between historical accuracy and being able to actually play the silly thing.  All the Army Group games will involve considerable set-up time, as you match units--lots and lots of units--to hexes; this is the Soviet Union, not France.  If you can commit the time and table space, your payback will be a model for "historical simulation."

[After a few solo plays] Early indications are that this monster is based on classical wargame elements. Components are showing their age a little, but the underlying game is absorbing, even in the smaller introductory scenarios.

RATING: 5
Tedious, annoying combat resolution system that sucks the fun out of the combat phase.  Just no fun to actually play.


Also too much chrome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This may be my favorite member of the series.  Here a true coalition of Axis forces, with enough mechanization to keep things interesting, faces the most capable Soviet fronts.  It is difficult for the Axis to recreate historical successes.  Pockets will be formed, and the Soviet player will be able to make local counterattacks.

Personally, I don't care for the siege of Odessa scenario.  The series shines in mobile attacks and counterattacks, in set piece battles it's nothing extraordinary.  But a *good* EFS scenario, like AGS' Rundstedt Attacks ... is like a fantastic French meal in 8 courses, for your brain.

After several years, I have never been disappointed when this title's on the table ... and so it has earned its 10.


My comments on the series in general -------------------

You have played plenty of East Front games. When was the last time you played an EF game and bought a book because of it? When was the last time you played an EF game and said, "I didn't know that happened!" ? When was the last time you felt you gained a real appreciation for what the commanders faced 65 years ago? The risks they took, the creativity, the tenacity they displayed.

When was the last time you learned something from an EF game?

I searched and searched for a game that would satisfy my fascination with this immense struggle, and I found Vance von Burries' East Front Series.

What EFS does very well is present a ruleset that can be used to play 5 games about Barbarossa, each with 5-8 scenarios. Where it out does it's rivals, like OCS, is that the scenarios need not be monsters. At least half are 1 or 2 map affairs with 100-400 counters. I'm going to call these "vignettes".

It is in these vignettes, these snapshots of the historic struggle that EFS shines. True, if you have access to a warehouse and months of free time you could play the whole of Barbarossa, but you don't have to be living that dream to experience the beauty that EFS has to offer.

Have you ever launched an amphibious invasion as the Axis in Barbarossa?  As the Soviets?  In B:AGN you try to take the Moonsund islands in the Baltic Sea. And it's not a die roll, or a rule, or a unit picked up in Gdansk and placed on a hex on the Baltic coast ... it's an 11x17 map dominated by two islands with the scenario specific rules in a side bar.

Have you launched Barbarossa, encircled and eliminated all the Soviets on the map and lost the scenario all because you needed to pull off a very precise attack, run your panzer spearheads cross the map in the first three turns, totally out of supply, without any real hope of getting back into supply, and win a couple battles on the other map edge ... out of supply ... because that's how the Germans managed to capture an incredibly important bridge historically?

Have you experienced the qualitative difference between the Soviets defending in the North and the South, where the integration of armor and mobile infantry into cohesive mechanized divisions had already begun?

Have you tried to take Kiev without help from AGC? Have you tried to take Moscow in September '41? Have you tried to destroy AGC two month later? Have you tried to take Rostov with exhausted panzers and supply entering the map in wagons? Have you struggled to keep supply moving into besieged Leningrad across the frozen lake while managing a supply starved offensive, had the snows turn to mud, the ice thaw, losing a convoy to the lake, while watching your opponent's brilliant but desperate counterstroke sink into that same mud?

Have you seen B:AGC sell for $262 on eBay and understood why?


EFS has obviously touched a cord with me. And I have to believe it would with you as well. I've played a lot of EF games. For my money, the venerable Russian Campaign is difficult to beat as a simple strategic treatment of the war. The new Fury in the East is a great new take on the theater.  But my quest led me to EFS and it would be a crime if you didn't try it for yourself.

Kiev to Rostov is in print, costs a reasonable price, and is a good introduction to the series. Personally, I'd prefer B:AGN as an entry point, but you'll have to preorder the reprint or get lucky on eBay. It is a loss to our hobby that so many titles in this series are out of print.

EFS isn't perfect, but to me the greatest weaknesses are its out of print status and that it has not yet grown to encompass scenarios from later in the struggle. But it's good thing to want more of a good thing right?

--------------------

I have docked the rating of all EFS titles a point due to their cumbersome, "old school" style rules.  I love the series, but the rules make it unnecessarily difficult to take the game off the shelf and convince my usual opponents or introduce newcomers to play.

The system seems to play very well. First I thought it was a little bit too complicated, but it is actually very clean and interesting system with lots of  choises. The mixed turn-order and Soviet dependancy on HQs keep things interesting. Plus this has a great scenario about the early massive battles around Lvov. I would love to play full compaign game sometime.

This is a harsh rating.  EFS is a great achievement on many levels; it is simply too focused and fiddly for me.  Try as I might, and I've really tried, I cannot gain any traction with this game, which would benefit from some rules excision.  It leaves me longing for a simpler, ten mile per hex series with a realistic prospect of covering the war in a playable manner.  It's created an itch I can't scratch.

In-depth operational study on the eastern front. German Army Group South drives towards Russian capital in the south -- Kiev. Kiev is situated in a flat and plain terrain perfectly suitable for the attackers performing blitzkerig tactics. The simulation system is sound, with lots of counters pushing around and huge maps. A plus is the system is designed with a series in mind, saving all those learning costs with a consistent framework. For all those WW2 eastern front fanatics.

Never played a complete game. I've 'tasted' a few of the smaller scenarios though and can say that I'm defenitely looking for more!

Edit: I recently played a few turns of the campaign game of this monster. Surprisingly I found that the rules weren't that complicated after all and that the game was very playable and enjoyable! Best game of Operation Barbarossa I've played (as yet).

RATING: 8
Although the mechanisms seem daunting at first, they become ingrained pretty quickly. The only part I think doesn't work as smoothly is the supply, which can't make up its mind if it's trying to model actual supply or transport capacity. The earlier games in the series look quite dated compared to the most recent ones. Interesting to compare to OCS, which is at exactly the same scale. Very different games, and it's interesting where they place their focus.

This is one of the best operational systems out there, with nice order of battle work and map research. It's playable, but still a lot of work. The system of movement and combat has a lot of subparts, so by the time you've finished a turn, it seems like you've really done something. If you're looking for a detailed operational treatment of the subject, this is for you. Just don't expect it to be effortless. The supply system is a strength, without being overly complex.

EFS is THE system for old school wargaming of the Eastern front. Old school cause its a big monster with a lot of counter pushing, odd calculations and complicated supply rules. But, it is the best you can find out here, because this is a truly playable monster, and if you try one of many little to medium scenarios included it isn't a monster anymore too.
South is the easiest of the system to begin with, it has a lot of axis minors and the south barbarossa campaign is almost manageable in size.

Fun, fast rules, cinematic actions and dense urban terrain (Starter Set plus the ruins from the Contagion expansion) really make for a very enjoyable game.

Would've been 9 but I deducted .5 due to the pain of assembling the Enforcers. It's about as bad as assembling the Sedition Wars Vanguard Troopers!

It is an okay game that has much in common mechanically with the designer's (Jake Thornton) other game Dreadball which is also part of the same setting (Mantic Games' Warpath Universe).  I'm not as big of a fan of of adding/subtracting dice from the main pool and use of cards in Deadzone as I am in Dreadball.  I like the idea of conditions (Enraged, Alert, Pinned, Suppressed) but don't necessarily like the branching of shooting to kill or shooting to suppress.  The types of actions need clean up.  The weapons feel really odd and samey despite the over abundance of special abilities (50+) within the game.
Despite some of the rules Deadzone is a lot of fun.  the exploding nature of the dice create cinematic moments few miniatures war games have.  Because the game takes up far less space, and once the terrain is built and placed, it takes less time to play.  It is easier to get even a game of Deadzone compared to many 6'x4' table or even 4'x'4 table sized miniatures games.  Because players will only have 5 to 12 models is can also be a little easier to teach if you stay away from the keyword power laden units.

Have only tried the Alpha rules so far, but they work quite well and I'm looking forward to the final release!

Deadzone is worth playing once you get over the fiddly rule book layout and references. The missions are great but hard to manage in secret. The play area really needs to be a bit bigger, maybe 12x12 and you must buy lots of terrain to fill it up. The mechanics are sound and fun.

I guess I'm just not into miniature skirmish games. The rules had some odd wrinkles and poor design choices, once we actually sat down to play, like how toughness and armor and AP weapons work. Balance wasn't great between armies either. And I really hate the cards... didn't like them in Dreadball either. Just let me play the board, not my hand of cards.

Kickstarted this because the minis were awesome and the terrain was great.  Ended up selling it off because of the time investment it was going to take to assemble and paint (on top of the OTHER games I have to assemble and paint), the need for storage (we just moved), and the fact that it wasn't going to be easy to find someone to play with.  My wife is into board games, but not into wargaming really.  Even though this one is much more tactical, it didn't really click with her.

I mainly got it for the terrain. I like the rules though. They seem very intuitive and fast.

I got a Kickstarter version (the one with 5 factions) and it was really fun tearing into that huge box. Still waiting on the second half, so I've been waiting to leave more detailed feelings about the game. Although there were a few missing bits (a head and an arm), Mantic sent me a big padded envelope of awesome models, I ended up using spare parts to make the models whole again instead of tearing up the models they sent (because they were, well, better than the guys meant to replace). I mean, I needed a goblin sniper head, so they sent me the tank (with two goblin operators), oh yeah!

Initial Rating: 7.5 (August 2014)

What a surprise tactical game! I really liked it. The rules are very similar to Dread Ball (obviously) but I like the combat setting a lot more. I haven’t seen a game with so many miniatures and components, every one of them very detailed and beautiful, despite all of these components, you can play Deadzone in a (relatively) small table. The game box is HUGE.

The rules aren’t that complicated, but you have lots of them so it can be a bit slow at the beginning. For me Deadzone is exclusively a two player game, with more the downtime and playtime can be more than I’m willing to endure. With two players the playtime can be long too, but I don’t care because I’m very involved in the game. Love the theme!

I also really like that you don’t need to measure the movements of your miniatures (I hate that), here the movement is via cubes (area movement) and you have LOS if the miniature sees the one it is shooting. Easy and intuitive. 

On the bad side, I hate assembling minis. The setup time can be long as you need to create the world from nothing, also putting all of it in the box can be time consuming. I don’t think I will ever build a scenario, but I will play if someone else do fortunetaley I have just the friend who loves to do that).

Bottom line, I really liked Deadzone. I hope to play again. I don’t think I will buy the game because I won’t assemble minis and I also hate the long set up time needed to play. I would love to play some campaigns.

It’s been a long while since I last played Deadzone, however my desire to play the game is low. Since last year, I noticed I’m drifting away from Ameritrash games and this affects my feelings toward Deadzone. Due to this I’m downgrading its rating

Deadzone is no longer among my favorite games of 2013.

I like Deadzone because it provides just enough options to be challenging without the gameplay being so precise as to place the entire game on a single die roll or mistake.  The factions each have their own distinct feel and it can be a lot of fun to rotate among them.  Our games typically clock in at about sixty to ninety minutes, allowing us to play two matches in an evening.

The game definitely has some warts (the interaction of weapons with the Tough ability isn't quite right, melee may be a little too potent and (as always) there are some undercosted units), but it pretty much always shows me a good time and, at the end of the day, that's what counts most.

Old: I thought the Alpha showed great potential and its rapid (public) evolution into the Beta indicated Jake Thornton is good about listening to feedback while not taking every suggestion that comes his way.

RATING: N/A
Necromunda's spiritual successor, and carbon copy clone... Parallel, alternate GW universe setting... But it works...
I think I paid LESS for this, similar game, in actual, non adjusted for inflation and whatnot, money, than I paid for Necromunda 20 years ago!
That's good value to start with...
Does away with some of the more annoying elements of miniature wargaming, like meassurement, and the endless discussions over milimeters and angles of deviation...
All the fun, minus most of the hassles, of miniature skirmish wargaming...
The restic (plastic/resin hybrid) the minis are cast in, IS a bit of a pain to work with, compared to the hard plastic GW models are made of, but if you have a bit of 'live and let live' in your personality, to outweigh the anal retentiveness, you should be fine...

Came with 2 Survivor minis. An unexpected bonus. :-)

Bought extra:
Wave two Cards. (And gummy bears ;-) )

Deadzone is my go to scifi miniatures skirmish game.  It has multiple factions.  It plays quick and games are mission based.  Suppressive fire, use of cover, use of multi-level buildings, and an interactive turn sequence make this game great.

The terrain in the starter box is very good.  The models are nice, and company support is good.  I highly recommend this game.

Great game, but still needs rules improvements (as always with this kind of games and as always with Jake ^^ )

Lovely minis which need some cleaning before painting.

I love the idea of squares where you can put your models without fiddly measuring during the game.

Scenery building is the best idea Mantic ever had, the geek lego really works !

Two years after the 1.0 version came out they release a new edition.  Original rulebook was a mess and the factions were poorly balanced.  Glad I bought it full price at retail.  Feel like our group got to pay to be beta testers.

A fun skirmish level game that has some room for improvement but is not overly fiddly. The models look good when assembled but Mantic needs to improve the design to be easier on assembly. Several models from the core set just don't fit together easily.

 Always enjoy skirmish games with good looking minis and terrain, I am sure Jake will do a fine job on the rules as well. Backed the kickstarter.

So far I really enjoy the system even the exploding dice mechanic although sometimes it can get a bit frustrating if it happens continously which did occur in one of our games so far.

The terrain and mat are great, minis I would say are fairly good standard in comparison to what's out in the industry.

Kickstarted this, and have played twice so far using digital rulebook and proxy figs. Having played Mantic's Dreadball, was already familiar with the dice mechanics used for DZ. New players may have a tough time wrapping their heads around it for a bit.
The terrain tiles are a bear to connect, and I ended up gluing most of the pieces together.
Gameplay is fun and engaging; each side's mission objective is secret to the other side and makes things interesting

Mantic is doing a great job making the type of games that Games Workshop used to. Deadzone is a skirmish game that pits small gangs/squads of different factions against one another, similar to games like Infinity (from Corus Belli) or the Venerable Necromunda (from Games Workshop, based on Warhammer 40K Second Ed.).

The rules are fast, simple and spot-on. Deadzone distills aspects from the tactical games genre and finds simple solutions for mechanics that can be needlessly complex in other systems. The way Deadzone handles movement, cover and line of sight is pitch perfect, in my opinion. The small play area gets units into the frey quick and once you get the rules down, you can easily play a game in an hour time frame.

RATING: 5
Negatives:
This seems to be very heavily 'inspired' by 80s GW games. Down to the Plague even having Genestealer colour schemes (and fighting 'men in battle suits'). 
The art (in the rules) is very infantile.
The 3D aspect adds very little in the grand scheme of things and isn't novel at all (despite the hints that it is revolutionary!)
The rulebook is patchy - jump packs get 3 lines of text but it doesn't really explain and is lacking in detail or clarity.
There's literally one paragraph about building maps despite the potential of this to completely make or break each scenario (would layouts or scenarios have killed you?!)
You don't get a lot of terrain for your money. Almost 2 full sets of terrain (with some other additions) provided a decent amount.
A double sided reference sheet is needed because the game is so heavily dependant on 'thematic' key words rather than ease of use.
I have some real concerns about balance. Possibly Plague>Enforcers>Orx
Seems to encourage story over delivering solid, balanced gameplay
Terrain is not easy to dismantle/easy to break
Initiative, coupled with high command ability (ie the ability to activate 4+ units) seems to be the key to success
Randomised opponent objectives can make deployment perfect or pointless
I don't really care for most of the sculpts
Is shooting underpowered (I killed more with Blaze Away than Shoot)?

Positives:
After 1.5 plays most of the keys works started to make sense (until you add more!)
Gameplay is relatively quick
Many of the above issues are easily fixed (rules, terrain, etc). If they are, there's the basis for a good game here

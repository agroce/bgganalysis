Pretty lousy, really. I've been playing a free android version and there are an annoying number of hands that are one card away from knocking that generate fifty points or more which is unacceptable when paying to 100. This can't be fixed by playing to more points because then you'll play too many of the hands where you get less than 10 points. Like a lot of traditional cardgames the core gameplay is has a nugget of entertainment but it completely fails as a competitive exercise.

My favorite variant of [gameid=15878].  [gameid=15878] with [gameid=1115], [gameid=2181], and [gameid=4583] are the four best card games in my opinion.

This is my favorite two-handed card game.

I record plays of this as an expansion to [gameid=15878], since I just consider this a variant.

RATING: 6
Maybe I should like this game more than I do.  But, while I know there are a lot of important decisions to make about which set to drop and which to chase, etc, for some reason this game doesn't compel me greatly.  The better you can infer your opponent's hand and remember what's been discarded, the clearer the math becomes on which card to discard.  While this kicks the crap out of plain Gin, it's still a little dull.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Fun card game that lasts a very good length of time.  It gets a bit annoying if you play someone who is too good at counting your cards.  Having to bluff and such makes the game a bit more frustrating somehow.

Gin is yet another 2p card game shows gains more depth as I play more hands. In my life I've probably played hundreds of hands of Gin and I still love to get in a quick game as often as I can. I even bought an old leather Gin logbook to record my plays.

[2014.11.26]
Like Hearts I play Gin countless times as a youth.  For many years it was, IMO, the pinnacle of 2-player card gaming.  It still holds a grip on my heart.  I remember playing this with my crazy uncle between Poker games (I was too young to play then) at my grandparents' house.  He was such a jerk about winning, he'd practically break a hole in the table when he knocked.  That would drive me nuts, but it always drove me to try and win.  I don't think I ever beat him.  All told, I've probably played 250 hands of Gin.

Easily one of the better 2-player games with a standard deck of playing cards. Fun.

A very solid card game that plays quickly with two.  Luck of the draw tends to win out, of course, but that does not diminish the fun and inherent tension of waiting and worrying about whether your opponent will grab up the card you just discarded.

RATING: 4
Not bad, but I'd much rather play Mahjong, Canasta, Schotten-Totten, Corsari, Mystery Rummy 1&2, Wyatt Earp, or even regular 500 Rummy. Gin Rummy is more skillful and strategic than 500 Rummy, but I think it's less fun. Gin Rummy's emphasis on card memorization is too taxing for a game of this weight.

RATING: 7
Substantially improves on standard Rummy by becoming a game of subtle psychological pressure, you never know whether to 'knock' now or wait for a better score. Oklahoma Gin is an interesting variant where the amount of 'deadwood' is limited to the value of the first turned up card.

Yea, it's rummy.  Just about as basic as you can go.

A very nice two player cardgame with the traditional 52 card deck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great version of rummy where cards are kept in hand until you have 10 bad points or less in which you can then 'knock'.  If your opponent gets less than you, you are penalized so a great push-your-luck aspect here, knock to go out quicker or try for Gin which is safer and 10 extra points. I like to play that hitting 51 exactly resets your score to 0 also. I still like this but Mystery Rummy really takes this to the next level.

A better version of rummy where your decisions have real consequences. Every decision in this one is painful, especially when you watch a card you need to go out get buried on someone else's turn, and you have to do some mental math to figure out the best alternate win path. Fairly quick and one I'll still play with a deck of 52.

Best 2-player game using a standard deck of fifty-two.  Used to fiddle around with it in restaurants and when waiting in a car with a friend.  There's definitely some strategy here, as when a player discards, he's drawing you a picture of his hand.  It's not clear to me why people buy and play stuff like Lost Cities when Gin Rummy can be played with a deck from a drugstore.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.55
Rating:

Game quality: Classic card game for two players. Super simple in how to teach it and how it plays out, 5.

Would I buy this again if I was starting over: I bought it since it only requires a standard deck, but I wouldn't buy a deck for the game specifically, 5.

Do I want to play this if asked: Pure middle of the road. Not bad once in a while, but I'm not asking for it either. Now that I have a game like Haggis, there feels little need for this although I'm sure I'll add plays for this over time, 5.

Overall: 5.55.

Rating Potential: Likely stuck. There's not much potential for the old classic games. Enjoyable, just not a standout but there's not much to expect from a game over a hundred years old.

Rummy holding all the cards in the hand. There's still quite a luck factor and no existing melds to add cards to, so the game is a bit less predictable than actual rummy. The play benefits from the constant urge to be the first to go gin (to get rid of all cards) or at least knock (to get rid of all your cards excepting those who don't bring more than ten points).

I love swoop rummy, but I find that Gin Rummy is far too random without more information about your opponent's hand or more tempo pressure to commit to melds prior to the round end.

Traditional card game, with some kick. The "take card, give card" -mechanic is fun even on the basic level.

Current favorite "lifestyle" game with wife. Hundreds of hours played. Depth comparable to poker, but preferable to hold 'em when playing two player since more of the skill lies in the gameplay than the betting rounds.

I really like Rummy games.  This is one that I have been playing for a really long time, basically as long as I have been playing Rummy in general.  It is still one of my favorite two-handed standard deck card games.  I don't play as many of these as I used to, but this is still a favorite.  I hope to play more.  [06/28/2009]

Lots of rummy game out there. Most involve melding straights and kinds.

Simple gameplay, very light thinking. I'll often play it if I have nothing better to do.

RATING: 7
Our go-to light card game before bed. 75% or more of the game boils down to luck in what you're dealt, and luck in what you draw. Despite how much luck is involved it is super fun to watch your opponent agonize over drawing a queen that could have completed a set, had they not discarded the Queen of Hearts on their previous turn. The games are almost always close and it is so incredibly satisfying to gin on the round before your opponent can, or to be able to knock early in a round and catch you opponent with a bunch of junk in the hand. The game is too random to rate too highly, but it is good fun and plays super quick, which easily earns it a 7.

Of the common 2-player traditional card games (including cribbage, casino, piquet, pinochle, etc) this is the one I like least. Still, it's the best rummy game, and I like it more than Lost Cities and Ticket to Ride (which aren't similar, but do scratch the same itch for me).

All versions of Rummy are a solid 6 for me. Trying to meld a full hand of books and runs before your opponent is an enjoyable pastime. But there are a few things about Rummy that keep it from reaching the heights of a game such as Mah Jong. First, there is just very little tension in the game. It isn't typically a betting game, and playing Rummy for points just feels like a time killer. It also lacks the interesting scoring of Mah Jong. For me, it feels like a "dumbed down" version of Mah Jong - basically, I'd always choose to play Mah Jong instead of Rummy. And if I only had a deck of cards, I'd play Poker or Hearts or Tichu.

In the stages of my gaming appreciation, the transition between Rummy and Gin Rummy was a big step.  If memory serves me correctly I remember Carey Grant playing Gin and thought I should check out what it was all about.  Suddenly I was enlightened to the superior form of Rummy.  My first thought was that I should try to find other games named after hard alcohol.  

After my first game given the choice I pushed for the upgrade. After time Gin fell away with the other fair public domain card games that became outdated by superior designer games.

Would score higher but scoring is complex, and that that is the only detraction as does not led itself to maximum popularity with mixed gaming crowd... especially some Poker players who enjoy the simplicity element available to poker play.  

Great game!

We know this game as simply Gin.  Also, in the version we play, you only score a bonus of 20 points for Gin, not 25.  The knock is determined by the initial card laid up, with an A meaning that the hand must be played for Gin.

We also use 'Hollywood' scoring, whereby 3 games are played simultaneously.

We've always had fun with this game, playing the Oklahoma version with Hollywood scoring.  It used to be a regular part of our Sundays, but with our fairly large game collection and recent additions, it got lost in the shuffle (no pun).  Yesterday I brought out the Kem cards for some weekend play.  We actually like cribbage more, and have a number of boards, but we still enjoy Gin (and vodka).

I have always loved Gin, from the time way back as a kid when my father taught it to me, where we didn't keep score, just played hand to hand and had to have all the cards in sets/runs without deadwood.  Now that I can play it for real, it's even better.

My second favorite rummy game to Canasta. My wife really enjoys rummy, and I'll play Gin with her from time to time. I find the game more of a distraction than a serious endeavor; however, that may be due to the fact that my wife routinely beats me.

Play a version called Hollywood Gin.  Rules can be found at http://boardgames.about.com/od/rummy/a/hollywood_gin.htm We play 20 point bonus for ginning and backdooring.  Our family usually gambles on this and it has provided years of enjoyment.

I don't like card games that much in the first place, and really don't like [gameid=15878] much.  If I'm struck with the odd compulsion to play Rummy, I'd rather play [gameid=811] or 500 Rummy.  This variant is fine, but nothing to make it stand out from the rest.  I'll pass, thanks.

RATING: 7
I'm told that the best Gin Rummy players are so good that they barely have a losing HOUR. They must be pretty good, because I lose at this pretty much half the time. It seems most of the "skill" in this game is just memorizing which cards have come up, and as a result I am pretty horrible at it (I have a bad short term memory).

Still, there are definitely interesting decisions, even if I get them wrong most of the time! It's another game that has enough variance that I can play it competitively with non-gamers without worrying about always winning.

Fun two-player rummy variant where you don't play meld in front of you, but hold them until someone can go out.  The fact that you [i]can't[/i] meld cards in front of you removes some of the fun tension of other melding games--do I hold these cards until someone discards the one I need, or meld them for the guaranteed points now?--but also adds some strategy and a significant memory element, since you'll want to remember and plan around the cards your opponent has picked up.

While there is place for skill (I never remember the name of the most famous American Gin player though), this game is largely luck-based. Nonetheless, the ease of rules, instant setup and very limited hand time make this a very good card filler. As two-player traditional card games go, it's a great one to know.

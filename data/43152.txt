Fairly decent Euro.  Didn't find anything to dislike about it or rave about either.  The wells seem to be a good tactic but are also quite hard to build.  It's main problem is one of analysis paralysis...easily resolved by use of an egg timer.

At its core, just another euro but it seemed to play quite well, some interesting trade offs for turn order and cards available to select. Not keen to play again but would join in without too much persuasion.

I would have LOVED this game but for the flaw which we happened to run into on our first play.  The board is a little unbalanced in favour of two starting positions with four players, and this small advantage becomes massive if the opening food cards happen to fall in a certain way which, of course, they did.  Consequently two players quickly overran 3/4 of the board and spent the rest of the game with lots of camels and options for turns, while the other two players had very few options or camels for the 2.5 hours it took to play the game.  By the end of year 2, I knew the finishing order of the game.  By the end of year 6, I correctly predicted the margin of victory of the eventual winner, even though others at the table couldn't even see that he was clearly going to win by a large margin.  

I found the game mechanisms interesting enough to want to play it again, but only in the hopes that we don't encounter this flaw again because, with the entirely bogus game length claimed, the game becomes a long painful slog for the players who get shafted by the flaw.

Great tense game. Scales very well 2-4 players. 
Many paths to victory.
Allies very well tactics and strategy.
Easy to learn, and easy to teach.
Main flaw though : the first in turn order tends to stay first, and is privileged at the beginning of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a decent, essentially dressed-up abstract with some potential for messing with other players positions and VP potentials using turn order advantages and strategic placements. Fair enough. 

For my tastes, the theme in this game is simply too weak.  The end result is time spent assessing VP opportunities and opportunity costs within a merely moderately interesting gaming system.

Points now or points later, with uncertainties on how much later things are. ~160 points. Bonus actions powered by camels, which don't seem worth it to save often, and being on both rivers is very important to do every turn.

Another Ystari hit. Slowly spread your huts out, attempt to get points. The different ways of getting points are more balanced than they appear at first glance. Really like this one and am looking forward to playing it more.

RATING: 8.5
This is a very solid game on par with the best in the Ystari line-up.  Game play is surprisingly fast.  Choices are nicely balanced between short-term and long term gains.  Players are given a variety of options on each turn and you can recover from a poor turn.  The rules are actually clear and teaching the game is a breeze.  I'd select this as a great 2nd gateway game - for those players advancing from the gateway games into the deeper games of the hobby.  Definitely recommended.

I quite enjoy Ornella's games, but they are not 'exciting'.  This game feels typical of both Ornella and Ystari.  Lots of choices.  Well structured game.  I particularly liked the way that the huts are place and maintained (or not) - the game board does not get clogged up and static as in many games (although this fluidity would have been greater if there had been a rule that prevented the ziggurat's from being placed next to each other - which interestingly both my opponent and I, in first two player game, had at the start incorrectly assumed to be the situation).  The cover looks nice, but is a bit bland and I do not think will help sales.  Happy to play again.

Kb. 10-szer terveztük már kipróbálni ezt a játékot, most végre sikerült:) Nem érzem egy forradalmi darabnak, de jó játék! A szerencse szerepe a kártyák révén nem kicsi, de a sorrenddel általában kompenzál a játék. Sosincs az a fajta kudarcélmény, hogy semmit se szerez az ember egy körben. Nagyon egyértelműen elválik egymástól a kockázatos, rövid távú pontszerzés taktikája (jobb oldali pontokra gyúrás), és a kockázatmentes hosszú távú befektetéseké (zigguratok). Persze keverni is lehet (sőt néha muszáj) a kettőt. Érdekes volt a partinkban, hogy senki nem épített kutat, holott ez is egy lehetséges módja az érvényesülésnek. Ami nem tetszett, hogy egymást zavartuk az építésekben. Szerintem ez a konfrontációs rész nem kellett volna a játékba...

Played as a final-version-prototype after Ornella's explanation at NoSoloParchís activity during Eutopia09 festival in Cordoba.
Deep game full of different ways of scoring.  "Very Ystari", but in the deep line (not so much as Caylus, I would say).  Interesting theme, well implemented.  Takes nearly 2 hours.  Very good game.
UPDATE: After almost 3 years, played with the real boardgame.  Indeed a very good game, with a nice mechanism, and quite good components.  Unfortunately, box is almost empty...

If I had not read Neuland's rulebook, these would have been the worst rules I have ever seen: everything seems more complicated than it actually is. When you pass beyond the awful rulebook, you discover an elegant and slightly-more-than-midweight euro, with multiple ways to score points and various interwoven mechanics.

After one two player game it seems to be a fine and well working euro. There are definitely lots of ways to score points here and it needs several plays to discover what strategies will turn out to be the most effective. 

+ really solid and balanced game
+ lots of strategic options
- feels like many other games, doesn't have something that would make it more unique
- the borders on the board for two and three players are not really clear
- if you are last in turn order you can nothing about it if others will choose so. If you are first you can be first for the whole game if you choose

I was pleasantly surprised by my first outing with this title. Why this game didn't garner much attention when it first came out is beyond me. Maybe it got lost in the shuffle of the plethora of games out there???

 It is a solid gamer's game with depth of strategy, great dynamics, tense decisions and with what seems abundant replayability. There is a spatial element to it along with interaction with your opponents in regards to negating spaces on the board. The dynamic between getting points or getting money is tense and delicious and how your decisions in the first phase affect your capabilities in the second phase is game worthy.

This underrated gem deserves a better status among the meatier Euro crowd.

A classic Ystari euro, where you trade this for that, then that for this, then eventually end up with some points. The theme is non-existent, but I seem to love the Ystari style. Tight, not too unintuitive, and plays pretty snappy.

Played a Prototype in Nosoloparchis - Eutopia 09.

Awesome!!! This game is incredibly good!!!

Best Ystari game IMO. I like it more than the other I played: Caylus, Yspahan and Amyitis.

*update*

After 3 plays, I downgrade my rating 0.5 points, I don't know why I liked so much the first time I played Assyria that pushed me to purchase a copy, now I only think that it's a very good game but not a great one. 

It's a nice game but maybe too repetitive: 

All (8) turns you make the same thing:

- Determine Turn Order.
- Expand and feed your villages.
- Use Camels for several things.
- Score points.

I don't see too much replayability here... A pity because first time was I played it was: WOW!

*update*

First game that I purchase again after sold it a year ago. This game is very good.

*update*

Traded again, I'm not happy having done that but at this moment of my life I play so rarely that bringing this game to the table is becoming harder.

A AP game.
And also a slow game.
This is much to do with the choices you have when maximizing the number of huts that you can feed.
The mechanics are nice as you need to choose every turn on what is important for you.
First player is important but you will never stay in first position very long as the goodies will move you down.
Need to play more.

RATING: 6
An okay game.  I found parts of it a little frustrating, such as having very little control over feeding your people.   Also, there appears to be a design hole where 2 wild cards are considered to be the best possible hand you can get, which is baloney... afterall, this means you can only feed 2 people.   If you're forced to take these, you not only get shafted that round, but also go last in turn order for the next turn too.   Yuck.

Apart from that, it plays fine... trade offs between permanent settlements and scoring points gradually.

Meh. I wanted to like this, but it really fails as a two-player game. Turn order is so absolutely crucial to success, especially in the choosing (and buying) of the goods cards, yet it can be hard to change the order in a 2-p. game. Even without the scaling problems, it's incredibly frustrating to have your huts continuously wiped out, and you never really generate much of an engine. Wells seem to be more beneficial than ziggaurats, not only because they are virtually free to build, but because they give an instant benefit, as opposed to ziggaurats which require tons of camels as well as several turns to affect your score. I'd like to try this again, but this may have to go on the chopping block. Luckily I got this for five cents (literally!) on Amazon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good tension between the different main scoring methods (ziggurats, wells, influence) and success really hinges on being flexible to adapt to what is happening on the board from your opponents.  It is interesting, but I do not find it that exciting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I rather liked this.  Pretty abstract, rather dry and a tad on the long side perhaps, but it became more engaging as the game went on and kept me interested till the end, without that 'one more churn of the cycle' feel that you (or I at least) sometimes get from the more abstract cube pushers. If only I'd finished building my ziggurats I'd feel more fulfilled too!

RATING: 6
A pretty decent little game which in unlike many other games I have played.  The goal of the game is to score points through placement of huts and ziggurats on the game board.  Huts require you to pay a certain kind of resource to keep on the board, and will either directly score you points, or earn you camels to convert into points depending on the placement of the hut.

Camels are required to convert huts into ziggurats, which require no goods for upkeep and score you flat out points.  Camels may also be placed in a few other places to score points.

Overall, it really is a pretty simple game that I enjoyed well enough.  Nothing spectacular, but a solid game!

Updated 5/19/10. 

In the two months that I've owned this, it has become my most played game.  I've found myself coming back to Assyria again and again, even at the expense of games that I objectively like better and have played less, to more fully explore its subtle strategies. Something about it is simply captivating.  

It was also the first game to ever motivate me to write a review (find it [thread=515622]HERE[/thread]).

Assyria is arguably Emanuelle Ornella's best work. It manages to comfortably accommodate the designer's clean, minimalist aesthetic within Ystari's now-signature thematic world. Although the game initially appears straightforward (almost solvable), the depth of strategy emerges with repeated plays. Similarly, the seemingly low level of player interaction is a mirage; it masks an ephemeral organic strategy space in which players can (and should) be quite ruthless.

I find Assyria most similar to Brass and Hansa Teutonica. The lack of identifiable goals (outside of crushing your opponents in victory points) makes the experience dependant on the skill and attitude of its players. It can be played straightforwardly, mildly, and peacefully. But it can also be a cutthroat, if primarily tactical, gamer's game.  

In many ways, Assyria feels a bit like a throwback. And I'm inclined to think that it might have gained a bit more traction post-Essen had it not been overshadowed by Hansa Teutonica, which does many of the same things better and more obviously (but that lacks a bit of Assyria's charm).

Admittedly, the game lacks a "wow" factor: It is not the most thematic, nor the most elegant, nor the deepest game.  The components and artwork aren't anything to write home about.  It's just a solid, hour-long, highly tactical, middleweight Euro.  But it's one that I really quite enjoy, and for that reason, I've decided to move it up to an 8.  

8/17/10: Still an eight, but I feel like we've explored much of the depth that exists at this point.  Ideally, I would always play this game with 4 players from here out, since that player count provides new challenges and the best overall game experience.

This is an older eurogame which has some cool features, but ultimately feels a little bland (the brown/orange-ish board and tokens don’t help either…) I feel that the replayability is somewhat limited for me personally as there isn’t a whole lot of ways to score points; building ziggurats, huts, wells or contributing to Assur. On the other hand, I also feel that there is a deeper layer to the game and that you can make some very clever moves. Also, the game can be brutally mean if played that way… Or it can be a little solitaire if you’re busy minding your own tribe. But, really, there is quite a bit of interference (concerning the cards you draft each round, where you place your huts on the board, the Assur track etc).

Juggling the number of huts at your disposal is also important; if they’re stuck on the Assur track and you’ve fed your huts on the boards, you might end up not having enough for placing in the next round – so tactical drought (i.e. not feeding your huts) is definitely wise sometimes.
So, while there is stuff to like about Assyria, ultimately I find it a bit “meh” – there are many better eurogames. I will maybe play it a couple of times again, but the only sure thing is that this is going to be sold.

Ya sé que no aporta nada nuevo pero me lo paso bien jugando y lo puedo jugar con cualquier numero de jugadores sin tener que adaptarlo. Las partidas me dejan ganas de revancha. Lo he probado con tres grupos de juego diferente a dos les gustó y solamente a otro no le gustó pero es porque llevábamos dos partidas al Phoenicia, estabamos cansados y teniamos prisa por terminar. Si te gustan los Eurogames, los juegos tipo Stone Age, Yspahan, Endeavor este puede ser una gran elección. No te defraudará. Si esperas un Through the ages o un Brass o Age of Steam este no será tu juego.

What I particularly enjoy about this game is how everything seems to balance for scoring.  There are some serious pros and cons to each tactic during the rein.  You can build outside of the rivers to open up the well building possibilities, but those are single shot scoring and you only get 1 pt. per hut outside of the river.  Or you can try to max out your revenue by building on the river tiles, but those huts do not generate victory points, can limit your options for intrigue in Assur (as you are component limited), and will be lost for sure at the end of the rein during the flood.  Then there is the subtle cost/benefit determinations of building new ziggurat bases (expensive) or building more levels (cheaper, but not as many points from the offering track).

This is a great game for finding a balance in resources usage.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very tight, well balanced, economical area control game, typical Ystari original design. Blocking and screwage, conversion rate optimization, even pattern matching and drafting. Everything though flows extremely well and is easy to grasp after the first few minutes. There are a lot of opportunities for clever tactical play, and several balanced ways to get points. Don't believe the people that say the game is dry. The them oozes through, in an abstracted way, like in Tigris and Euphrates. Lovely little number, with nice artwork. Old school middle weight Euro par excellence. No bloat here, just essence. Very nice.

+ elegant interlockig mechanisms
+ the theme comes out really nicely
+ easy to teach
+ balanced and tactically sound
+ lots of clever nooks and crannies to discover
+ good components and a small footprint
+ lovely graphic design and presentation

= a bit on the long side, but engaging to the end
= needs a bit of mental arithmetic to minmax resource conversion

Early buzz wasn't enough to get me to buy before trying. Heard it was a mishmash of mechanics. I guess you could say that. I thought it worked fine, and probably would enjoy playing again. There are a couple ways of going after points, seemingly reasonably balanced, but with different levels of planning required. I played with 4, which seems like the right number. I get the feeling three woul dbe a little loose on the board. The one comment I've heard that I agree with is that it's pretty abstract. I don't really know why I'm getting points for doing stuff, just that I get them. In fact because of that several times during the game I would forget whether building a hut (or whatever they were) inside the river is worth more, or outside is worth more. It almost feels like an older classic design, sort of along the lines of Tigris & Euphrates.

RATING: 5
I was never very keen on trying (much less purchasing) this title. The reasons: the designer Emanuele Ornella and an interview he gave to Eric Martin as part of the latter's preview for Spiel 2009. In short: Emanuele likes choices in his games, and will try to cram his designs full of them. I've experienced this with Hermagor and with Il Principe; in these two titles the amount of choices is so large that they in my opinion become a little meaningless. It's like standing at a crossroads and seeing that the two forks in the road meet up a little further ahead just the same.

Assyria is, regrettably, no exception to this design philosophy. The players are able to obtain points in two ways: either immediately or in the future. There is nothing wrong with such a design arc: many games use it quite succesfully. But where Assyria lets me down is that the future points—in many ways obtained by obtaining and then spending camels—do not have sufficient time to mature as it were. The game is divided into three epochs, and the future points are awarded at the end of each epoch. Since there are not many meaningful items carried over from epoch to epoch, those future points become more or less 'nearby future' points, turning the game into the crossroads example I mentioned earlier. It doesn't seem to matter what you chose; you'll get there eventually because the design cannot [i]let[/i] you get away with it too much. For me, that means Assyria is one of the worst Ystaris to hit the market in quite some time. 

However, my girlfriend sees things differently. Instead of worrying about a difficult long term-gamble which may or may not pay off (as can occur in Amyitis, for example) she sees the game more like an [i]activity[/i] with lots of little choices along the way. It doesn't matter that these choices in the end amount to not a lot of differences, the important bit is that they are [i]there[/i]. That's a completely different way to view this game, and consequently she likes this title rather a lot. Your opinion of this game will probably follow one of these paths: if you like a risky long term gamble, then you will dislike Assyria. If you like involved and possibly even rich tactical maneuvring, you will like this game.

[b]Update[/b] The game hadn't been played in a while, and when it made its appearance on the table, my fellow players were a bit disappointed about the cards which prevented any serious long-term planning. I've read that the idea is that players learn to 'anticipate' on what is still available so that they can better 'plan' on where to place their huts, but in a game where resources are everything I consider such a gamble to be a rather weak mechanism. And so did my fellow players; including my partner who was once so fond of the tactical richness. She announced that the game could go onto the trade pile. And so it did. With the result that it left our collection.

Ornella. És nagyszerű játék. Kicsit visszafogottan 9-es, elsőre nem akartam 10-est adni: ahhoz még legalább 1 játék kell. Elragadott. Eleve szép. Másrészt jól van összerakva. Sok út a célhoz, de az egyes vmire való rágyúrás önmagában kevés. Legalább 2 dologban kell jónak lenni -ami nem kötelező h ugyanaz maradjon mindhárom korszak alatt. mert külön-külön erős a ziggurat, a kút és a méltóságokért járó pontok is. De egyedül nem elegek. Szóval jó. Ami még tetszik, ah ront az ember, akkor sem kell elszomorodnia: van lehetőség más irányt véve javítani a hibát. Nálam a 2 csúcsjátékom - a Caylus(mint Ystari) és a Hermagor (mint Ornella) szintjén van.
Update: még egy játékon túl: megkapja a 10-et, legfeljebb ha még több játék után változik a véleményem, akkor majd újra módosítom. Szóval nagyon jó! Egyelőre tovább próbálkozom a no ziggurat stratégiával, de a siker még nem teljes: csak második hely, igaz nagy csatában. Több kút egyszerre+falvakért pontok nem tűnik rossznak, kiegészítve még cselszövéses pontokból valamennyivel.

Standard-ish Ystari fair. You'll get a nice game flow (haha what a pun) and probably a pretty tight result in terms of victory points. In my gaming rounds discussion emerged whether the starting positions are unbalanced. That however doesn't spoil the game for me.

I am predisposed towards Ystari games; I just like the way their games require you to spin many plates at once and they all interlock at some level. A fair knock against is that they're more abstract than thematic, but I'm OK with that because the mechanisms are interesting enough. This is one of their better ones.

Here, each turn has you placing a certain amount of huts, determined by cards you choose in current turn order. However, the stack of cards you take determines the turn order for this turn.  The location of the hut placements is critical to short and long-term benefits, so getting the right card(s) vs turn order is the first source of tension. Then, you must feed your tribes, and it's not uncommon that you can't feed all your people which means some huts must go away. The huts that survive each turn gain points according to their location (inside or outside rivers) and earn camels (money in this game is represented by camels). There are bonus tracks outside the playing area (a very Ystari mechanic) which you manage in order to get certain benefits (these remind me of the temples in Amyitis). 

I found it interesting, dynamic, and with plenty of tension. There's a tactical aspect to the game in terms of both denying others spots as well as making little arrangements of your huts such that you can drop a well on the board (these score big points). This one seems under-rated for some reason, but I think it's a solid gamer's game.

Elsőre kicsit bonyolultnak tűnő, de első játék után könnyen megismerhető euro game. A doboz nem túl sok mindent tartalmaz, de minden jó minőségű cserébe. 
A játékban Mezopotámia területén rivalizálő törzseket vezetünk. Területet kell foglalnunk, etetnünk kell a népünket, áldozatot kell bemutatnunk az isteneknek, illetve befolyást kell szereznünk a fontos embereknél. Aztán pár kör után jön az árvíz, és jól elmos mindent. :)
A játék nagyon tematikus, és van pár érdekes mechanizmus benne. Kettő és több fővel is szórakoztató, és viszonylag értelmes időn belül lezavarható (kb. egy óra) Hogy mondjak rosszat is róla, talán egy kicsit túlzottan kiegyensúlyozott (overbalanced).

Like many Ystari games, Assyria has a largish number of knobs and dials crammed into it: There's money, there's influence, there are (of course) victory points, and, in addition to the main board, four different bonus tracks that you need to keep an eye on.

Nevertheless the underlying gameplay is fairly simple: Expand your settlements, feed them to generate points or money, and use the money to generate more points. You will often have a fairly typical choice between "instant gratification" and "delayed scoring," made somewhat harder because real long-term planning is difficult to impossible. You need certain types of food to keep your settlements alive but you never know what kind of food will be available on the next turn, not to mention that, unless you are going first, others may have snatched away the food you need. This makes Assyria a largely tactical game with a slight infusion of gambling.

WOW, this is an amazing game. So much depth, with multiple ways to score. Many options, with only so many available each turn. It may take a few games, to pick up on some of the strategies, but it will come to you and keep you thinking, even after the game is over. Absolutely amazing game.

The components are top notch and look great, while the game is being played. This game has so many different mechanics, though they all flow together well, for a very balanced game. Most games will be tense and close in points. Making for a terrific time. I can't recommend this game enough. It's a total joy. This is a great gamers game.

I liked this one although at the beginning I wasn't understanding all the rules correctly. Very good eurogame with a few strategies of winning. Maybe too few but that requires more plays.

I will play it gladly a few times more and see if the rating stands the test of time.

EDIT: It didn't. Every play seems similar and there only are two valid winning strategies. Besides, the two-player variant is not well-balanced. Luck in the draw of cards determines the winner. Sold.

If you like most of the other Ystari game, I don’t think you will be disappointed with this release. It has a lot of game to it with lots of choices and much going on and both tactics and strategy.

Assyria is a prototypical Ornella design, filled with lots of interesting mechanisms, tough choices, and various strategies and tactics to pursue.  There doesn't seem to be one foolproof strategy, and it appears that one must pursue numerous methods of victory points in order to be successful.  Doggedly pursuing one method of earning victory points to the exclusion of all others seems to be foolhardy.  I've seen several players concentrate almost entire on constructing ziggurats and making offerings to the gods.  While they scored well, they didn’t win.  In two games, I consistently courted the dignitaries to the virtual exclusion of all other actions.  This resulted in victory in one game, but failed in the other -- although I did finish a very close second!  A strategy that involves utilizing multiple actions seems to be wise.

Aside from the fiddly nature of moving the huts back and forth when resupplying the villages, my biggest concern is its duration.  We have found that the estimated time listed on the box -- 45 - 90 minutes -- has been unachievable.  The games I've played have all taken 2 - 3 hours to complete, which is frankly way too long.  There are lots of decisions to be made, and choosing which resource cards to select seems to be the biggest time-consuming culprit.  If I could find a way to get the game to two hours or less, it would become a regular visitor to my gaming table.  If not, I fear it will become a stranger.  That would be a shame, as I do enjoy the game and the challenges it presents.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
So far, the best game from Ornella. It features many choices, as usual, but this time not in a way that players get lost accounting for lots of details. There is an interesting duality in that players must decide to go for immediate points or to take camels to pay for actions that will reward them later. The game is a little on the abstract side and can induce some analysis paralysis, but it's very well designed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Nice game that plays very well with any number of players. Away from the luck that comes with the cards, you can plan ahead and follow different strategies, as everything has it's ups and downs.

RATING: 7
When I read the rules, I thought that it was yet another Ystari game from the same mold. I have had the opportunity to buy the game for a bargain price, and I must say it's a pleasant surprise; it is indeed yet another game where you have different way to score victory points, but the tactical positionning feels  like a knife fight in a phone booth.  And for a change, the aesthetics of the whole, while not extraodinarily inspiring, is fine.

The rules do not make a stellar job in explaining the game and even less at giving a feel about how it plays, but after a mock turn, the game is easy enough to understand, and the booklet is a serviceable reference.

In summary, the theme is thin and forgetable and some mechanisms feel used, but Assyria manages to be a pleasurable and solid experience thanks to the aggressive interactions it fosters.

I'm probably suffering from Euro-fatigue, but this is a meaningless game of point mongering between options that are far from equally attractive. Forget any thoughts of building for the long term, this is strictly about maximising your score, now. The unforgiving food regime means that it's possible to enter a death spiral from the very beginning and that's completely unacceptable in a game of this length. I'm sure some will like it, but I'd rather play Austria in a Diplomacy tournament for psychopaths, than have to face this again.

Gioco di equilibrio, anche ben congegnato, tra espansione territoriale e capacità di mantenere in vita i territori occupati.

Well this was a bit of surprise. 

Assyria almost deserves to be called "straightforward," and that's nearly unprecedented for an Ystari big box game. That's not to say that it's simple or shallow, but that it's easy to learn and understand the various possibilities. Essentially, each turn you gather some food and then expand your civilization a bit on the map. Depending on where you place, you get some points and some camels (the game's currency). You can spend the camels on small range of long-term and short-term scoring options.

It's really not a bad game, and for some reason the bar seems so low with Ystari these days that it's refreshing to see a decent offering from them. Managing your camels isn't the most exciting activity and I'm not sure that each session will have enough character to justify several plays, but it's engaging enough and a nice change of pace. This could be a hit for fans of Hacienda and other games of that genre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This pleasantly surprised me.  It is a game which on the one hand forces you to expand your territory and block or avoid others, while also realizing that many of your placements will have to be temporary.  So you must plan ways to tenaciously take, hold, develop, and retreat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really like this game, and I'm a little surprised just how much I like it. I thought the many different options for scoring points would result in confusion and a lack of understanding of which move is good. Some of this is good in a game, but too much can be frustrating and leave you feeling like you just don't care. I kind of feel this way about Amyitis and so I was worried this game would be similar. 

I don't think the scoring options in this game are as confusing as they first seem. The game mostly feels like optimizing hut placement while suppling them with food. Placing on the river earns camels, and placing off the river earns points. Also taking food sets the player order. For me the game is really about these phases, and questions like: where are my current huts, where will I place my new huts so that I can get camles/points and feed them, where in the turn order do I want to be, and where can I be while suppling the most huts. 

Spending camel points is usually pretty straight forward and the scoring options aren't as wide open as they might seem at first. Considering that temples score every turn and they provide more placement options for huts and they score again during the flood (offerings to the gods), it seems hard to win while completely ignoring them. There are not wildly different strategies in the game, but you do have to optimize your resources and try to get the most out of your camels.

Also the components are superb!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The most interesting part of Assyria is the initial draft of harvest cards that also determine the turn order. In the ensuing expansion phase the decision has to be made between maximizing earnings of camels to spend in the action phase or maximizing points from the board position. As always, the focus shifts later in the game but due to the original ebb and tide of the huts playing at least partly for early points is feasible. The actions are either focused on building zikkurats as constant point suppliers, political influence for big one-time points or additional food supplies for strong following turns.

Assyria is solid, old-fashioned, unremarkable. What the cognoscenti call JASE but not a bad game. The decisions are interesting and different strategic focuses can be successful. Assyria's problem is its dry nature and a complete lack of flavour. The abstract nature is barely concealed by the theme. On repeat play the subtleties of Assyria are to be discovered but no staggering revelations await. Not enough to keep Assyria in gamers' minds eight years after its release.

I can see how this game would have its fans, but it's tough right now for this to distinguish itself from the legions of other similarly-themed euro games of this weight.  Ystari games have been becoming more and more mechanical and this one definitely has that type of feel - very dry, kind of soulless.  

I'm not ready to write this one off yet though - there are definitely different viable strategies to pursue, so I will try to reevaluate after more plays, though it may be hard for me to find opponents.

Almost put me to sleep. The board is pretty; the cards are appealing with the food images. But the gameplay...there's nothing [i]exciting[/i] about it. Normally a sense of being pushed backward / stomped down by the game as a matter of course (as in [thing=123260][/thing] or [thing=126792][/thing]) bothers me. But in Assyria, I didn't really even care that my huts were destroyed in floods every few turns—I wasn't emotionally invested in anything that was going on. A better hut-placing game is [thing=4636][/thing], which has quicker turns, some secret information, and generally has more internal stability when it comes to rules and scoring.

Typical Ornella game with multifaceted scoring in many different ways existing throughout the game.  This game does feel a bit too much Ystari at first feel so I'm not certain this will end up being a keeper as Ystari and I rarely see eye to eye on what makes an enjoyable game...:-)  I did like the harvest phase where the first player organizes the market and then the turn order for actions and map placement of huts is based upon which market stall one selects (better stalls mean later move limiting map choices and action choices).  There is a fine line between camels (money) and points in the hut building phase as well.

Ultimately, this game proved too dry and typical Ystari for me to keep and play despite Ornella being the designer.  Sold in the Lydia charity auction.

Assyria is a game that has quite a bit going for it. There's a bit of area control, there's a building aspect, and some majority play.

The only fuzzy area for me is that of the card display. It's a random element that is awfully rogue. It can often spoil your plans and sour your attitude. It's feast or famine and nary in between.

While the cards can dash your hopes you can often refocus on other avenues to build VP's but ultimately the cards dictate your camel gathering performance, which is a key to victory.

There's obvious strategy here with a splash of tactical play to be had. I think repeated play will allow the cards to be overcome but time will tell.

Ornella+Ystari=powerful combination

One of the best game of the 09 Essen show with the new Friese (tough i need more plays) and Endeavor. More straightforward than previous Ystari releases, but equally deep with a lot of different ways to score and win. Highly recommended !

A gem! Left unplayed in the shelves since years. Always thought it can't be bad, given the author and the publisher. However, did not expect such a highly tactical, very challenging game. Much more to it than the expected good, perhaps slightly better then average Euro game. Finally played it and once more the question is arising if you constantly need new games if many unplayed ones slumber in your shelves ... Easy rules, hard to master, a true wolf in a sheepskin!

for how heavy the theme is put on through the instructions none of it comes through in the game play.
Some good concepts but in the end just seemed boring i guess.  I think games that give you a bunch of limitations with no reason just bother me.  Why do I only have # of huts and everything else.  I like the choices between better cards or going first and getting camels or getting points but the rest of the game and framework just doesn't interest me.
Winning takes deeper thought than what you'd expect from first impressions.  I think its more on making the right choices to maximize points rather than getting a good plan layed out.  
I think I want to like this game because there are so many good design elements.  My ratings probably lower because I somehow feel mad at it because I feel I should like it more, dumb? maybe but thats the way I feel.
I also give credit to this game for coming across as a point salad at first glance but not at all after getting into it.  You will have tough choices to try to balance money/points.  Quick gameplay and short total playtime; simple scaling on player count.

Unless I played it wrong, it just felt to constrictive to me.  I couldn't find a way to keep stuff on the board.  Even when you invest in, say - your site multiplier... it resets every round.  It didn't seem to matter what you "invested" in, it would just go away.  Most of your huts (which give you points and money [camels]) will just go away as you just can't keep them all fed.  I just don't enjoy super tight games like this where you end up "building" so little.  You don't lean back at the end, with yours hands interlocked behind your head admiring your vast empire... you just think "ok, so I have 2 sites instead of one, and of the 20 huts I built, 2 remain..."

Ókori mezopotám törzsek térképes területfoglalós, erőforrás kezelős, set collection-ös, teve fetisiszta pontgyűjtő játéka. Rövidebben: igazi Ornella, kiváló játéka az olasz fenegyereknek.

AP bejátszik, de még kezelhető szinten. Többféle izgalmas mechanizmus és pontozási mód.

Egyelőre csak két játékossal próbálva, de így is "adja" (valószínűleg a szűkített térkép miatt).

Strange game, at the beginning i through theere are a lot of strategy  to win the game but at the end the only goal is to build the ziggurat, with this strategy you easly win the game without any problem but only if you are attentive and don't make other player to gain to much pts due to the well strategy.
Because of the bad re playability and one winning strategy i give Only a 4

You lead around a band of nomads building up huts, ziggurauts, influencing royalty, and trying to not starve.

It is compared to Brass and Hansa Teutonica, but is shorter.

Player interaction is variable, but can be non-confrontational if desired.

RATING: 6
I'm not sure what kind of game Assyria wants to be. There is a struggle for land as you try to expand your huts, but most of them will be removed any way due to lack of supply or floods so there is usually space enough for all player. You can build valuable huts (at or between the rivers), wells and ziggurats, but their only purpose is to earn you victory points. You can influence dignitaries, but again their only purpose is to earn you victory points.

Perhaps I need to play more to understand the strategic considerations but the lack of progression and interaction in the game makes Assyria inferior to my favorite Ystari game Amyitis.

Brain burny and intense, and probably great with four players, but I really dislike the fact that the two-player variant only uses half the board.  Works well as a solo with the right rules.

The scoring in this game is way too convoluted and I think there are some game balance issues with the initial positions of the zigurats. In particular, two of them seem to be in inferior positions compared to the other two. Game also suffers from too much analysis paralysis.

I really like Ornella's previous designs, and liked some of the choices in this game, as well. Unfortunately, the game is completely tactical, since you can't plan for the next round and you are forced to lose much of your previous position. Also, the player that builds the most wells early in the game has a huge advantage for the rest of the game... but being able to build wells is highly luck dependant based on how the cards come up. Finally, the game outstays its welcome. I would be happy to play ahain with a few players that really like the game, but I won't be adding it to our collection.

Assyria felt to me like just another Euro.  Learning the rules was not tough, but the strategy is tough to grasp and prone to Analysis Paralysis.  The board is just large enough to really get crowded and after the first half of the game everyone is in each others areas and it can get interesting.  What ultimately put me off from this game is that the components, artwork, and theme are all boring.  

It's a medium weight Euro with nothing that really grabs me.  The agonizing decisions I remember making while playing would bring me back again, but other than that, it really is just another Euro.

RATING: 8.5
for me, one of if not the best in class of the euro-abstract hybrids from the aughts. One downside is that players 1 & 2 can corner the market on first and second player for the entire game, depriving the others of an extra bonus food card; the theoretical compensation of "better" cards for later turn order is often deceptive, as I would argue 1 wild is not better than 3 (sour) grapes. The process of puzzling through what to do recalls another euro-abstract Ornella that I rated highly: Hermagor -- although that one is much more euro than abstract. But I'm officially an Ornella fan.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
This game offers almost no meaningful decisions. The turn order mechanic is coupled to random card draw and clearly broken, The theme is nonexistent. It is the worst game I have played in a long time, even worse than hermagor was. I am probably finished trying Mr Ornella's games.

A rather dry and sterile conversion of currency-into-points that didn't really grab me after first go. Notable points of interest are the need to specialise (you'll never get anywhere by spreading the workload) and the difficulty in maintaining all your huts through the punishing feeding phase.

心得:
算是取捨的遊戲
基本上每回合小屋不太可能全部保存下來
拿牌時可能就要挑多食物的拿
跟考慮要留什麼
重要地點的小屋抓緊時間升級成底座會讓之後要擴張時方便許多
井的分數則是要不影響擴張為原則
越早擴張每回合分數跟時代結算的乘數分數不斐
相對之下貴族軌的分數太競爭又耗小屋(感覺只有在時代結束前回合才值得投資)
算是比較抽象的遊戲

規則:
*將食物卡與犁耕卡(版圖右下處)洗勻，將擴張卡挑出1張數字4置於圖版右側剩下洗勻，灰色水井使用8/12/16個(2/3/4p)
*每位玩家拿取對應顏色的指示物放於計分處駱駝條獻祭條(都0)順位處(隨機)與金字塔座，依順位選擇自己的起始地點放1個金字塔底座。(2/3人遊戲使用部分版圖)尾家翻等於玩家數的食物卡(蓋著選)並反序1人1張
*遊戲共3個時期8個回合，時期1:2回合，時期2和3各3回合，每回合分為4個階段：
*每個玩家最多1張犁耕卡
1.耕種 起始玩家翻出先翻人數+1數量的食物卡按數字牌在版圖下(百搭最後面)，在重複一次形成第二列，依順位，使用順位處的指示物選取一行(2張)，全部選完更新玩家順位(往上移)
2.擴張  拿取當回合擴張卡數字的小屋，依順位擺放至遊戲版圖上(小屋不夠就不拿)，擺放要在空格且相連自己的小屋或金字塔(放在該格下方) > 依小屋圖版標示，出對應數量的食物卡以維持存在(不強制，多不找零)，犁耕卡(使用後放回圖版)百搭> 沒有供給到的小屋放回供應區 > 可興建水井拿分 > 河流上第一個小屋獲得3駱駝，其餘2駱駝，兩河之間的小屋一個2分，在兩河之外的小屋一個1分，一層金字塔1分
*水井規則  a.三個六角格都是小屋b.不能在兩河之間c.不能在已有水井處，分數為6/5/4分第一/二/三時期
*駱駝條的上限為10
3.行動  依順位花駱駝執行行動，一次做完在換人
a.興建/擴張金字塔 花6隻駱駝升一個小屋成為金字塔底(小屋不能在河流上跟井旁)，或花駱駝金字塔往上蓋，一個一回合只能升一次(3/2駱駝中間/上面)
b.亞述陰謀 玩家花費駱駝，並將供應區的一個小屋放置於對應的區域，放置時會自動放在最上方格，一回合內可放置多個，高/中/低階貴族花費4/3/2隻駱駝
c.進行獻祭 花費1-3隻駱駝，使指示物移動對應的格數。
d.購買食物/犁耕 花費卡片左上角的駱駝數目購買於版圖右下角的犁耕卡與收穫階段剩餘的食物卡，最多只能購買1張食物跟1張犁耕卡。
*當進行完3個階段後，一個回合結束。沒換時期時起始抽一張新的擴張卡擺圖版右側，所有圖版小屋下移露出資源，如果換時期則進入4.
4.洪水  >所有河流上小屋回到供應區 >高/中/低貴族提供3/2/1影響力計算總合，平手時先比小屋總數再比小屋靠上(沒小屋不計分)影響力最高的獲得所有擴張卡數字總合的分數(4人遊戲的第二與第三時期時加入擴張獎勵卡計算)第2/3/4名獲得的分數依次遞減一個當前最高數目的擴張卡 > 根據圖板拿貴族獎勵拿完小屋回供應區  高/中/低階貴族 分數/1張犁耕卡/1小屋1隻駱駝>玩家獲得「金字塔數量(只算底座)x獻祭條指示物所在倍率」的分數，獻祭軌歸0
*洪水結束後換新時期， 放置擴張獎勵卡，起始玩家開新的擴張卡(舊的移除)
*最後記分
● 一層金字塔1分。
● 每一張未使用的犁耕卡1分。
● 每兩隻剩餘的駱駝1分。

RATING: 8
A game of struggling each turn to keep your guys alive, with decisions to make on whether you want your survivors to earn money for spending on various investments for later points (strategic element) or just go for straight up points on the board. There's a nice mechanism where if you want more food (to keep your guys alive) you go later in the turn order. The food phase is horrible in a good way because the exact food you need is never there, so there's always death which brings a nice ebb and flow to the board position. I enjoyed the game, the rules are simple and it plays in a good timeframe. Depending on who you're playing with there may be a strategic need to go earlier in turn order to avoid being denied room to expand on the board, so that's a consideration to keep in mind. But in the main, it seems to be grab as many camels as you can as often as you can (ie get on the rivers) and catalyze those camels into perpetuating points.

Very good looking. Nice mechanics, when you think you have nailed the perfect strategy someone else finds another way to beat you.

I really enjoyed the mechanics of building huts to get currency and not always being able to feed all your huts. you must decide what to keep and what to sacrifice, but getting currency (camels) is key. The board is also partially cleared every few rounds and players fight for space and cards. A constant decision of wheher to get short term points, long term points or money (which also leads to points). One of the better Ystari games in some time.

Played mostly with 2 players.  I like how all the mechanics integrate, but this is probably a little dry for my taste.  This is, however, the first of the Ystari games where I have felt this, as I really enjoy Amyitis, Sylla and Mykerinos, which are also often called too dry by other people.

RATING: 8
In Assyria, you draft food cards and place huts on the map to gain points and camels.  The food cards are arranged in order such that you can draft better cards, but then you go later in the turn order for placing huts and drafting next turn.  As the game goes on, you keep your huts, but unless you can feed them with ephemeral food cards every turn, they go away, making them very fluid.  You can solidify your holdings by converting huts to ziggurats with camels, which will score every turn.  Additionally, you can use camels for other point bonuses, making them very valuable.  I enjoyed the back-and-forth of this tactical game, but turn order can be very important, and you can get railroaded into always going last if people can make do with smaller food cards.

Assyria has a very balanced mechanism between building ziggurats or wells and spending camels to get influence. You can't just concentrate on one aspect and you have to evaluate different options during the game. When to buy cards? Should I go last now and grap some good food cards? Should I buy influence before other players? Many things to take in consideration during the game. Probably the biggest downside is that people tend to think a bit too much and the game tends to drag a bit near to the end. It's still a very good game. 

Edit. 4-player game doesn't seem to be huge improvement over the 3-player gane. Overall the game works quite well with any number of players.

Final edit: Sold after 9 plays. Good game, nothing innoative but enjoyable to play. A bit AP-prone to some people and somehow the playing time was always 1,5-2 hours. Far too many equally good or better games to be played and this didn't have any special staying power.

I've only played this once, and that was way back in 2012 - at a time when I had almost no interest in "Euro-style" games at all. As a consequence, I really didn't enjoy this - but now that I am much more receptive to Euros, I can imagine this being moderately enjoyable if I were to play it again. I'm in absolutely no rush to do so, however - I don't recall any particularly interesting features, and we own so many other games now...

You settle areas based on what sort of food you can produce to score them. Food cards are selected with a trade-off between better cards and turn order. For the areas settled, there is a trade-off between victory points and income. A decent game.

Another Ystari game where you collect your points here and there using the chosen mechanic. The parts of the game fit together well but it's rather uninspiring as a whole. These Ystari games really are just starting to feel all the same to me, which doesn't mean they're independently bad, it just lowers my rating for them because I can pick any one up and I'm practically playing the same game. I can't see myself ever wanting to play two Ystari games in an evening. On the positive side it plays quickly and gives you something to think about. There's the hint of a theme and it looks reasonably pretty.

Assyria -- Played once; three-player.

I [i]want[/i] to say that the game had too many mechanics to achieve the elegance I expect from a euro, but that overabundance of mechanics is typical of an Ornella game.  And I've enjoyed a number of his titles.  I think I'm just tiring of spending so much time in the learning phase, where mechanics take center stage.  I'm missing that zen experience of simply playing — where mechanics fade to the background, where they serve only as an invisible structure to support the experience, whether that experience is thematic or simply fun.  I think I've been spoiled by our recent repeated plays of Hansa Teutonica.  We all know the mechanics well enough that we can simply dive right in and [i]play[/i].

So I'm not sure whether my underwhelming impression of Assyria is fair.  It was certainly good, but the experience of playing it felt the same as any number of other recent first-time plays — good but lacking spark.

Területfoglalós, építős, befolyásszerző játék. A játékosok falukat és zigguratokat építenek, előbbieket élelemmel látják el és ezek által terjeszkednek. Istenségeknek áldoznak tevék felajánlásával. Több fajta módon lehet pontot szerezni ugyan a játékban, de úgy tűnik a zigguratépítés a fő cél, talán emiatt nem adtam elsőre magasabb pontszámot, de ez később még változhat. Pozitívuma a játéknak a gyorsasága, 4 játékossal is megvan tényleg 90 perc alatt, plusz a szabályismertetés. Nagyon tetszett, hogy igazából az építkezéseinkkel tudjuk akadályozni a másikat, de azért nem olyan módon, hogy emiatt igazi konfliktusos játéknak lehessen nevezni. Pont jól eltalált szerintem ez a része.

I thought I would like this game a lot since it seemed to have some area control elements and I love Mykerinos (which is mainly area control).  It fell pretty flat for me and my wife.  The luck of the card draws is a huge factor in the game.  On one hand it seems to want you to block other users from getting too many wells (which are tons of points), but on the other hand you often have only one or two feasible choices for card picks, so the cards lead you where you have to place huts.  From the one game I played and a couple others I witnessed, it seems that one player tends to get in a position where the stars align and he can grab the perfect cards to set himself up for a bunch of wells.  Then he can just coast to victory.

Strange and cool amoebic growth game with very tight economy.  Really unlike any games I've played before.  Many tough little decisions.  It seems that there are significantly different strategies to winning.  Wells seem like the easiest path, but ziggurats give you a presence and a base from which to spread out on the board.  

Fans of Colovini big board games (Magna Grecia) should check this out as you could probably play this with those who are totally allergic to his standard dry overly-thinky quality, yet still get that kind of satisfaction.

So far this is my favorite Ornella game.

It's good and I like about half of the gameplay here.  I enjoy trying to figure out what set of cards to take and how to place your wells to get camels and points.  However, the second part of the game where you spend camels ends up really being such a mitigating factor that everyone gets about the same amount of points such that it nearly always ends in a group hug.  It's lacking that small element of chaos and unpredictability to stimulate interesting decision making and elevate to something I'd like to play all the time.  Nonetheless, it's fun to play.

Preliminary rating after only one play with two players. Pure euro game with an abstract resource collecting feeling. It has the ystari flavor and it seems to work pretty fine.

The major default of this game seems to be the huge time of play (easily over 90 minutes) and some of the Assur influence tracks. Apart from the first influence track both of the remaining don't seem to work very well.

I still like the game but I guess it won't be played very often unless it really works with 2 players only - that's something I have to figure out.

This will probably end up being a 10; it is fantastic.  not a quick game--we're quick players in general, typically at or below the 'playing time' stat, but not on this one--it's a 2 hour game for us.  There are so many branching paths to the win, that there is a significant amount of downstream play that must be analyzed to play competitively.

As an aside, it's somewhat annoying to have games like this with skewed short play-times...sure you could play a game in the listed time, but to do so, you'd have to not take a minute to analyze your relative positioning amongst the other players in order to make the best bid/play.

3 newbies exploring the multitude of little decisions with only a gradual understanding of how these decisions would work out. Oddly(?) ziggurat building was barely attempted - there always seemed something more useful to do with your camels. The one player who tried to build ziggurats came a distance last to the well builders. We ended with a vague feeling we'd got the scoring wrong, but a later check seemed to confirm we got it right. Felt very 'pulse-y' - repeated rounds of expand & decay (maybe ziggurats would lessen the sense of decay).

One of those games where the first play is quite confusing, but by the time you’ve finished you can see more of what you should have been doing, and you'd like to try it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.25
Some strategies seem vastly dominate over others, which in a game with a lot of options doesn't make each of the other options viable. Wells seem vastly overpowered for how little effort it takes to make them and how many VPs they give, while building up a ziggurat past the base seems fairly useless unless rushed in the first two turns or so.

The game was interesting -- kind of reminded me of Amun-Re and Amyitis for some reason -- but something felt missing.

Another issue I had with the game was the randomness of the cards coming up. Sometimes just nothing you pick can help you and others can take a huge lead, which with the way the game works, makes it nearly impossible to catch back up.

Although when we played I was in last place for the entire game until the last turn or two and somehow I managed to shoot up and win (probably because I caved in from my only ziggurat / money making strategy and built some wells).

I would like to try it again, but not right away.

Better production values than Amyitis. Very nice wooden pieces and well done cards. 
The game is good, even though the feel of pasted on theme is a bit too strong and the wells seem to be a too easy way to score too many points. Gotta play some more to see if wells can be countered. 

Update: played it a couple of times after a while and realized I don't like it anymore. Very abstract and a sum of parts that are not very well interconnected.

After one play so far I'm a bit disappointed in this one.
I think there are too many different ways and mechanisms thrown together here.
Another big no-go is the lack of player aids in a game with so many different scoring options and little rule nitpicks (why no wells between the rivers - and why is this not marked on the board for example).

Maybe I'll give it another try, but at the moment I don't think I'd buy this.

Assyria is at least interesting, and I like the card-drafting and turn-order mechanism. However, it seems like building lots of ziggurats trumps any other strategy and it would seem once a player has fallen behind, there's not a lot of opportunity to claw your way back into contention. A solid but not spectacular gmae that came as small disappointment to me, if only because Ystari today is like Alea of old ... almost everything they publish is good enough that it must find its way into my game collecdtion, and a number of Ystari titles (Yspahan, Mykerinos, Caylus) have become absolute favorites. Assyria doesn't rise to those heights and isn't somethign I'll buy, but I wouldn't shy away from playing it again in the future, either.

This game was purchased mainly to be a 2 player game and for me it fell totally flat in that regard. I had high hopes for this one based on the idea that the board scaled to be smaller forcing the players to bump into each other more frequently. I just seems to me that while this happened the rest of the game needed to scale as well and it just didn't. It may be a better game with more players. Rating based solely on 2 player status.

Another nifty title from Ornella. The hut placement and payment mechanics are very divergent from your standard euro points engine, and the blocking and building on the board makes for some really tense play. A hidden gem.

Update: After a few more plays online on BGA, I'm tempted to call this Ornella's best design, in that there's actually some wiggle room in terms of strategic choices. While this has given this design a longevity that his other games have lacked, I wonder by how much.

Fairly typical Ystari, build huts, use those huts to gather points based on where you built such as on the river, in between the rivers, in a triangle, etc. Lots of choices on which way to go, for direct points, or for actions which can be used to earn points. In my play, I was just awful at getting cards to feed my huts, so most of them disappeared off the board before I ever got any use out of them.

We played this game two years ago for the first time, and we liked it very much back then. Then we played this game with three. Now with two. So a nice opportunity to compare the both plays. As we played over 200 different games, since we played it for the first time, we didn’t know anymore how to play this one. Started to read the rules again. Rulebooks made by Ystari aren’t the best written rules there are around. They just don’t make sense. But just as it is most of the times, once finished reading it all is clear, and the mechanism aren’t that hard. With two players, you just use half of the gaming board. It plays fast, we managed to play it in about 45 minutes. It’s fun with two, but with three is it much better. When playing with two, any mistake you make, is punished immediately. Great game, which we will play more often.

After 2+ Plays: Assyria is exemplary of the worst aspects of Ystari games.  There are a bunch of different things you can do, but they all reduce to slightly different ways to score points.  There is no unique twist as in Yspahan or Metropolys, and no central unifying mechanic as in Caylus or Ys.  It's just a hobbled together mess of middling ideas.  Id still probably pick it over Amyitis, but not by much.

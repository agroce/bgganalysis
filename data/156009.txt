Pros:
Simple rules and game play. New gamer/family friendly. All players are involved even when it's not their turn. It's funny when you egg your opponents on and they go bust. Fairly short play time. Fun!

Cons:
The theme is okay, but I think the game might suit a different theme better. You'll need to refer to the player aid fairly often to determine some of the cards' powers.

Push your luck com uma pegada financeira. Despretencioso ao mesmo tempo que estrategicamente não é óbvio. Não é tão curto que chegue a parecer um filler, nem um push your luck tão óbvio quanto Zombidice... mas também não dá pra queimar a mufa jogando.

RATING: 6
We usually only play this as a two player game. As such it is a bit boring, since the only way to win is to complete expeditions. Not enough choices to explore.

As a four player game, it's totally different. There are a lot more strategies to explore.

LIKE: easy to teach. push your luck can be fun. interaction for all players during everyone's turns. small engine building. using cards for currency adds a nice randomization.
DISLIKE: replayability may suffer a bit, once an optimal build path is found... but have not found this to be a problem yet.
OVERALL: Quick, light, fun! We play with the expedition requirement. Playing with four players was great, especially when the win came down to the last card purchase.

RATING: 5
Port Royal features a rather strong push your luck element which can create big swings in the game. This is not a problem for casual events but in a more serious environment it might break the game for some players. Decisions you make are mostly tactical fitting the very moment, but thankfully there are some strategic avenues to follow creating a broader horizon. However, I was left with a feeling that the game is rather one dimensional, i.e., make a lot of coin. Moreover, it seems that certain cards may be change from useless to very potent depending on the player number. In my opinion this is not a good thing since having cards that are very situational is waste of material in my opinion, especially if you cannot affect their usefulness with your own actions.

Despite its shortcomings, Port Royal offers decent past time activity. A bit shallow but entertaining to a point.

Great little game - kind of a long filler in feel and time.  Bohnanza type mechanism with the two card sides. A Kleine Fische type-mechanism for going bust with the push-your-luck thing. Lots of ways of playing for the win.  All of my groups liked it first time.

1st (real) play: A cool "push your luck" card game. It's a lot of fun to watch people get greedy and bust. Turns are fast and quick, interesting decisions about which guys to buy and which to ignore.

2nd play: not a bad filler, the push your luck and engine building aspects are light but entertaining. It's a little complex for non gamers probably and runs a little long.

An enjoyable filler with plenty going on.  There's a push your luck element (with possible mitigation by buying pirates and sailors), a little light engine building, and money management.  Running out of money is a bad thing, so understanding when to take income rather than make a purchase is important. Other players being able to purchase from your selection after you have had your choice adds another interesting element.  Do you flip a load of cards in the hope of enticing opponents to spend and pay you a fee, or do you leave them little or nothing?  All this and laughs too as your good friend flips a duplicate ship to terminate a promising turn.

Port Royal's cards are good quality and the rules are well written. The artwork is nothing special.

A good idea with nice flow, but using the action cards secondarily as money means that many action cards will not appear during game play. This works in some games as a randomizer, but not here because it drastically reduces the chance of getting duplicate ships (bad) or one of each color (good) during your turn. Lots of card-flipping may turn off some players. This game could have been designed with a much higher excitement level.

Slick little card game from Alexander Pfister, who seems to be on fire lately with a lot of games like Isle of Skye and Broom Service. I like the little drafting phase here where the active player takes a certain amount of cards and other players can piggyback with a coin to also take a card. Otherwise it's a push your luck as you strive for Victory Points and use your characters to repel ships and go on expeditions.

Port Royal is a push-your-luck game with engine building, set collection, and an interactive purchasing mechanic where opponents can buy cards during your turn. But while this game looked interesting from a mechanical point of view, in practice it's one dimensional and overstays its welcome. Furthermore, the experience was quite wonky as the game has a high luck element but has a ruleset that's significantly more complicated than your typical filler. Overall, very disappointing.

The best push your luck game out there. The fact that it also includes a quite nice, albeit simple, engine building mechanism increases my enjoyment of this already great game. Plus, it's one of the few pirate themed good games out there.

But perhaps the best part of the game is how all players are involved in each player's turn. There is really not much of a downtime factor in this game, and that elevates it almost to a perfect game for me.

We played a 5 player game of this push your luck/resource management game. It is fairly light, but still really gives tough choices during your turn. You draw cards from a deck trying to get multiple different colored ships (there are 5 different colors) into the row. The more ships, the more cards you can acquire. Each other player can also get a card. Cards are the ships themselves which give money, or characters which give a special ability and VP. But, if you get 2 of the same colored ship while you draw, your turn ends immediately. Everyone at the table went with a different strategy. I went for swords, which allow you to disregard ships the have a sword value equal to or less than the amount of swords you have. Brian went for multiple cheap cards. Peter went for Expeditions (VP cards that you get by discarding characters with the matching symbols). I liked this a lot. It is easy to play and super easy to teach. It also goes at a nice clip, even with the full complement of 5. I think this will work especially well as a 2 player game. Keeper!

My favorite game of all time probably. Simple enough to be explained in 10 minutes and enjoyable enough to be played for hours. Great in that it is a single deck with one type of cards, so it has extremely fast set up.

Very enjoyable and addictive.

A lot of constant probability calculation is needed for optimal game play. Obviously there is a lot of chance involved, but if you constantly make the right decisions when building your port, it pays off in the end.

It however feels a bit imbalanced, with the Admiral being downright overpowered.

A really solid, single deck card game. I really enjoy that since cards fill multiple roles (currency and gameplay) as you go through the deck the variety of cards shines.

It went just under an hour which is a little long. But that probably had to do with being a first game and playing with two seven-year olds.

A good push-your-luck game that is enjoyable despite being mostly tactical (low strategy) and luck heavy.  The fun and charm of this game is in its mechanics and card powers which keep most/all players involved on every turn.  Port Royal may become my new favorite push-your-luck game since it's a bit meatier and less abstract than other games in the category (e.g., Circus Flohcati and Can't Stop).

This is an excellent game. We play with 2-5 people. Every time, there are various methods to win. It keeps everyone involved and doesn't feel either too short or too long. 

It can be as serious or light as you and your group want it to be. 

Several people I've played with have gone on to purchase their own copy for their families.

The cards are very good quality--and yet, with as much as we play, I'm considering purchasing a second copy. It's that good.

Push your luck card game - some interesting decisions, probably overly long with 5.

After being recklessly in love with the game following my first few plays, I bought it and the expansion, and now have slipped to just really really liking it. I don't know if in a year I will still want to own it, this one might be a star that burns out on me, but the experience of this game is super fun, and push-your-luck is a mechanism that I just adore. Very well crafted, there are just some light min-maxing tendencies than emerge over time that I don't enjoy.

Sometimes I don't understand my Monday night group. If you think your not going to enjoy a game and just complain all the way through it making it less enjoyable for everyone else why not speak up and say something? Or here is a novel idea... When I ask what should we play next actually pick a game instead of sitting there.

Anyways, mini rant done. I actually enjoy this game and I'm pretty sure the same goes for the other player that actually focused on the game instead of complaining. Sure this game can be brutal, but sometimes you just gotta suck it up and take a less valuable ship.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
An awesome little filler: setup is instantaneous, the rules can be explained in two minutes, but the game requires some thought, and has a fun push-your-luck element (with mitigation), as well as some clever interactions between types of cards. 

Acquiring swords gives you a huge advantage if you want to avoid going bust (and thus get multiple draws). Of course, more cards also means more cards for your opponents to choose from (but also more income for you!). Certain cards are incredibly powerful (the Governor especially) but others (Jester, Admiral) can be very useful. Knowing when to go for expeditions or to simply take the VPs on Person cards can also be tricky. We always play with the End Game Variant that requires expeditions. As a light, quick filler, you couldn't ask for more.

Fun push-your-luck game. Not a ton going on here, but it's short. The opportunity to buy on other players turns saves it from marginality I think. Nice filler or closer if you have a need for such a thing, although for me not satisfying enough to justify a game night on its own.

Hangs a garden-variety engine building efficiency game onto the back of the circus flochati card flipping mechanic.

Would much rather play circus flochati.

After playing this a couple times online I thought it to be ok. There's a lot of luck in the card draw, and I definitely have had a fair share of turns where I acquired nothing. Most games I've played I end up digging for certain cards trying to fill an expedition, maybe I draw it, and maybe I don't. Even with the luck of the draw I still like the theme/artwork and building a tableau of cards. Good fillery type game for an occasional play.

An enjoyable press your luck card game. Flip cards over, hope you don't bust and try to work your tableau to 12 points by either getting special powers and small VPs or trading in those special powers to earn expeditions which are worth larger VPs. I also like how the card backs also double as the currency for buying the special powers so it naturally removes some of the cards from the game as you play so you are left with a random distribution of cards each game. This worked great with 4 and I'm hoping it's also enjoyable with 2 as I think it's something my wife would play.

Quick and easy to teach push-your-luck game with cool art. The player decisions are mostly tactical and fairly obvious, but there is a strategic element present in regards to which route to take to 12 VPs, given the state of the board and discard pile.  Best played with the discard pile face down to not reveal the hidden coin cards. Not knowing exactly what cards remain adds a nice element of uncertainty.

The expansion adds quite a lot to the game, so yey for that!

+ easy to teach
+ simple mechanism, elegantly implemented 
+ small footprint, economy of components

Very nice little card game, that has more depth than is first apparent. You always need money, which you get from trading with ships, so you want to push your luck and get higher value ships without going bust. The agony of every card turn as the game goes on is fantastic!
You also need to hire people for expeditions, which you can't do without money, or use them to mitigate the bad luck from the ships... People cards also give you useful powers - the Jester, for example, gives you coins when others go bust, so is worth the expensive cost in the long game, as is the Mademoiselle. Really surprisingly good game!

L'or, l'or, il n'y a que cela qui compte. Avec l'or, on peut faire plein de choses. Acheter des boîtes de jeux, par exemple. Dans Port royal, vous prenez l'habit de pirates. Qui dit pirate, dit or. Bon, il vous faudra bien dépenser votre or pour améliorer votre équipage, votre matériel. Et si tout se passe bien, vous devriez avoir encore plus d'or après. Les autres pirates sont, bien sûr, aussi ambitieux que vous. Ne vous laissez pas faire.

Had a first go to explore the game, quite easy to learn and plays fast. Fun part is the push-your-luck factor, as you can draw until you draw a second ship of the same colour and cannot repel it (by lack of swords, or because it is a ship with a skull which cannot be repelled). So it's important to stop in time or your turn is over.

I have to say I find the game a bit frustrating and samey from turn to turn. There isn't enough interesting variety among the cards to differentiate the tableus that the players are building, and it's so easy to be screwed by the card draws that it's easy to spend the game watching others play. I do think that I've played primarily five player games, and I think it's probably better with four due to other player's card draws getting around to you more often. And is it just me or is it a rich get richer game? If I fall behind I have to draw more cards which helps the players after me when I succeed and hurts me when I don't. Bleh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
Fun card game if you are willing to accept the potentially frustrating luck factor (when a second ship of the same colour appears while you are turning the cards your turn is over).You collect money, buy characters with specific abilities and points value, and try to combine these characters in order to gain more points by fulfilling expeditions.

Interesting card game about pushing your luck and determining when to pay big for cards in the market.

I'd play again as a filler if someone brought it out but I wouldn't go out of my way to play it again.

Wonderful filler, that feels like a mash up of Circus Flohcati and San Juan (so how can you go wrong?).  Players take turns flipping up cards from a large deck, until they decide to stop.  The player may then buy a card from the flop with coins (private stack of face down cards) which enhances their tableau, or claim a ship for coins.  If they draw two ships of the same colour, they crap out and lose their turn.  Cards bought are personages who grant powers and victory points.  Very impressed - top shelf stuff.  We will be playing this a lot.

After our first two plays, my wife and I both like this one. It's fun to push your luck. Getting to buy cards on other players' turns is nice too. In our first game, we just accidentally noticed the game was over because we were just enjoying flipping and buying cards. However, I can see this one getting a little stale after a while...

...Well, the game doesn't grab me the same way it did at first. I come away from it wanting a little more, but there is still something intrinsically enjoyable about flipping cards.

Az előkészítés fél perc, mivel megkevered a paklit és mindenkinek osztasz 3 lapot. Ennyi. Aztán a szabályok nem túl bonyolultak, habár, hogy őszinte legyek, az első játék előtt a szabályolvasásból nem állt össze teljesen a kép, ezért megnéztem egy videót is a játékmenetről, ami segített. Azonban az első játék után minden a helyére kerül és úgyis lejátszol még legalább egy partit a játékostársak követelésének eleget téve :), hiszen egy játék simán lemegy egy félóra alatt és máris jöhet a következő. Nálunk nem volt annyira népszerű a felfedezéses stratégia, habár egyszer valaki azzal nyert, inkább a különböző pénzszerzési lehetőségekre ment rá mindenki. A szerencse szerepe nem elhanyagolható, de ez egy ilyen jellegű családi játéknál megbocsájtható. Tetszett, hogy mindenki körében van lehetőség lapszerzésre, még akkor is, ha az egy arannyal többe kerül, így nem kell arra várni mikor kerül Rád a sor. Jópofa a lapok kétféle felhasználási módja, miszerint minden lap hátoldalán található egy arany érem, így nincs szükség külön pénzérme tokenekre, hiszen elegendő a lapok hátoldalát erre a célra használni (annyi lapot húzol vagy kapsz mástól, amennyi aranyat szereztél és azokat lerakod magad elé az arany érmét ábrázoló hátoldalukkal felfelé). Az ikonográfia könnyen érthető, egyedül az Admirális lapon lévő ábrának kellett utánanézni, hogy akkor az 5+-ot hogyan is kell értelmezni. Ezeken kívül a `push your luck`, kockáztató mechanizmus kellő izgalmat hoz egy-egy körben és nem árt a többiek tevékenykedését is árgus szemekkel figyelni. A játék jól működik minden játékosszámnál. Összeségében remek, szórakoztató családi játék, ami nálunk még sokszor elő fog kerülni. (2017.03.18.)

Továbbra is a család nagy kedvence, habár én már egy kicsit elveszítettem a lelkesedésemet. Gyakorlatilag minél hamarabb be kell gyűjteni valamilyen pénztermelő lapot, úgymind félkegyelmű, admirális (ebből minél többet) és ha még egy kormányzót is sikerül szerezni, akkor megállíthatatlan leszel.

A pretty simple and casual game. I like it for what it is. The fact that the game only consist of a deck of cards, makes me like it even more, as I get to bring it during travels.

Your turn consist of two phases. In the first phase, you draw cards until you decide to stop or until you bust. You bust (thus forfeiting  your turn) when you draw two ship cards of the same colour. As you can see, there's a bit of push-your-luck element here, which reminded me of Circus Flohcati and Dead Man's Draw who share the same mechanic. However, Port Royal has a lot more decision and strategy involved in drawing the cards.

The interaction lies in the 2nd phase, where all players in turn order select a card from the line of cards drawn in the first phase. If there's a card left and you choose to pick a card, you have to pay one coin to the current active player.

There are also some cards that affect all players - the tax card and the expedition cards. The expedition is like a side objective that rewards you money and VP. Any player can try to fulfill the requirements on the cards but they require certain cards that you need to acquire beforehand.

I really like the push-your-luck mechanic in the game. It uses the same mechanic in Circus Flohcati and Dead Man's Draw. However, Port Royal has more decision and strategy involved when you draw the cards.

The art is amazing, done by none other than Klemens Franz. I like the double use of cards - all the cards have a coin printed behind it. Whenever you receive money, you draw cards and use the back to represent your money. 

It's a simple game, fun and quick to play.

RATING: 9.5
What a little gem of a game packed into a deck of cards.  There are two types of cards: ships, in 5 colours, and workers, which give you points and benefits.   On your turn you turn cards over until you wish to stop and at that point you can take money from a ship or you can buy a worker card.  But if you turn over a second ship of the same colour your turn is over.   However, you are able to mitigate against this push-your-luck element as certain workers repel ships.  And a final but important rule: your opponents can also buy a card from your turn's cards though they have to pay you a coin to do so.

It is amazing how much is packed into this little game.  Clever things too. Like the cards also being the money, Bohnanza style, so you get a different deck each time you play or shuffle. You can adopt a number of different strategies according to the type of workers you go for. And you can play in a limited way to screw your opponents if you choose to.  In a game that takes 25 minutes or so to play, and is so easy to explain, there is a good deal of good stuff going on.

I'm impressed.

One of the better push-your-luck games I've played. The multi-use cards really make the game interesting as it cuts down on any card counting possibilities. Definitely play with the variant that requires you to complete an expedition to win as it makes the game a bit more challenging and cut-throat.

Port Royal is a push-your-luck card game where you build a tableau of cards. I found the card powers a little dull. I understand that this isn't supposed to be Race for the Galaxy, but for some reason I still found this disappointing. I also found it difficult to estimate when you might bust because of the hidden cards that are used as money. Call it weird, but I'm so against shuffling cards mid-game (see deckbuilding games) that I'm not even that fussy when games require you have to shuffle a deck to go through it again. In the end, if I want to play a push-your-luck game, I'd rather play Ra or Can't Stop.

Port Royal puts a small twist on the typical card-drawing press-your-luck genre. Allowing players to purchase cards on opponent's turns offers interesting decisions throughout the game. Drawing more cards, typically yields additional coins from your opponents, but also grants said opponents more options for growth. Additionally, the dual purpose cards, can inadvertently remove specific cards from circulation which lends to decent Expedition variability from game to game.

The winner is sometimes decided completely randomly based on the luck and there is little players can do to stop somebody from winning, because there is next to no interaction between players.

Turns can take a lot of time and there isn't much to do during another players turn. For this reason, the game often drags on for too long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Port Royal is a fantastic, light, push your luck game which as of yet is unparalleled in my eyes.

There is randomness in Port Royal but you can also mitigate luck and try a variety of different strategies.   Meanwhile you can sit there on your turn going, 'please don't bust, please don't bust,' while on an opponent's turn praying for them to bust or pushing for a tax increase card to decimate your opponent's money.

The game length and targets stop it from becoming a total luckfest, you have to be careful not to feed your opponents and try to get your machine generating the resources you need.

If you liked Port Royal but figured you wanted more strategy, give this one a look.

Has a few imbalances (governor / admirals / low amount of available points for 5 player mode).

A new player would get 40-50 games of great joy from this, a board game veteran would be bored in 15.

House rules for 15 or more vp for 2 player game and/or having to do at least one expedition improves the game a lot.

Removing the governor or limiting him to be used only on active player turn balances the game a bit.

First expansion pushes the game to 9/10 for me and is a must buy for a very low price.

Interesting game but a lot more push your luck than I was expecting and the victory point total required for the win is quite low. It is very difficult to purchase anything outside your turn as money is so tight and the one extra you have to pay to the active player really really hurts.
I think this will shine with the full compliment of 5 players.

RATING: 6
Simple enough game, but outside of your turn, you don't have much control. You need money to do anything, and if you don't have enough money, you can't do anything. It's a progressive game, but you don't need a lot to progress to a win. It was fun enough but not inspiring.

This game is a bit of a hidden gem in my opinion. You can easily teach it to almost everyone(except my cousin that hates all games except golf). Experienced players and those not so familiar with gaming have equal opportunity(almost) of winning due to the perfectly balanced luckfactor. I usually hate luck in games if its not a co-op but I feel this game has just the right amount of luck vs skill. Even my previously mentioned cousin managed to win once although she had no clue as to why. The only reason I don't rate this game higher is because it is a bit short and not that complex but this is due to my personal preferences. It is still a very nicely put together game.

Előre tudtam, hogy push your luck mechanikáról lesz szó, mégis érdekelt. Sajnios az első élmény olyan rosszra sikeredett, hogy nem sok kedvem van neki még egy esélyt adni. Rettenetesen be lehet szívni ezt a működést, még különösebb kockáztatás nélkül is. Ha szinte minden húzásodnál hajó jön már elsőre, akkor nagyon nem fogod élvezni a játékot. Mire először lett volna pénzem venni valami, addigra a többieknek már 3-3 kártyája volt. Nekem meg persze hogy elvitte az adó azt is, ami nagy nehezen egyszer összejött. 
Sokat gondolkodtam rajta, hogy miért volt bántó még úgy is a játék, hogy kb. tudtam hogy mire kell számítanom. Szerintem nem jó ez a másiktól vásárlós mechanika, mert még tovább erősíti a tisztán szerencsés húzásokat. Jobb lenne valami kiegyenlítés a kicsi készletek javára, hogy valamelyest csökkenjen a szerencse szerepe, mert így hatványozottan jobban jár az, akinek szerencsésen jönnek fel a lapok.

The changes from Händler der Karibik are minimal (and in fact, apart from a few added cards, the original rules are still included as a variant) so my comments from that game still apply here as well:

Press your luck a bit when building the card display and then draft those cards in order to gain money or fame. Quick-playing with a few strategic choices and some gambling thrown in.

At first glance Port Royal looks to be a simple, generic card game with a less than inspiring bolted on theme. The cartoony illustrations are nice and colourful, but the whole package hardly sets the heart racing. However, the designer has succeeded in packing in a whole lot of fun into a deck of 120 cards. The push your luck nature of the public draft heightens interaction and ensures that all players remain interested in what is going on even when it is not their turn.
You can grab this game for peanuts, it is extremely portable and set up is instantaneous, making this the perfect game to take on holiday.

Multiple strategies possible; permanent player involvement. An absolute winner!

(04/03/2015) Comment based on 3 plays.

This is well designed, light, entertaining push-your-luck type of card game, with an interesting pirate/buccaneer/merchantman theme.

On their turn, a player can draw and place face up as many cards as they choose, and stop at any time. If they hit a ship of a color that has already been drawn, they lose their turn and get nothing--that's the push-your-luck part. After stopping, they can then grab coins from a ship or buy a person for coins. If they were able to draw four or five different colored ships, they could grab two or three cards respectively. In addition, other players could grab a card for themselves, paying a coin to the active player for the privilege. Those last two features will make a player greedy and pull as many cards as they can.

If players have bought a number of swords, they can repel ships, so they have a better chance of drawing four or five different colored ships. The ships have strength ratings in swords that indicate how many swords you must have to repel. This feature introduces long-term strategy, as players that have built up sword-strength will be able to draw more and more cards without fear of going bust. In addition, the various person cards give a number of advantages to the players. It is up to the players on what persons to buy or ships to plunder, at any given time.

There are also a number of mission cards that give more VP for turning in sets of persons with special symbols on them. Finally, to prevent hoarding of cash, there are tax cards scattered throughout, seizing half of a player's cash if they are over 12 gold, as well as giving a small bonus to those that are in last place in terms of VP, or leading in terms of swords.

All in all, this is a fast paced, enjoyable game that plays quickly in about 20 minutes, with occasionally longer games. There's plenty of luck, but that can be tempered with some skillful play. As an end-of-the-night filler, this is perfect, and I now prefer it much more than Machi Koro. It is a solid "7".

Port Royal is a meaty little game. I knew from the first instructional video that I would like it. Imported from Germany for a very reasonable price and very much enjoy it. There are interesting decisions and lots of player involvement outside of your turn. An excellent travel and gateway friendly game.  The expansion adds co-op, solitaire, and a few new mechanics. This little game has a bit of everything!

+Push your luck mechanic from Incan Gold
+Simple tableau building from Splendor
-A lot of cards can feel useless, especially if they aren't part of your strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun engine-builder mixed with press your luck mechanics. I really dig the simplicity of its design matched to some meaty decision-making on almost every turn. Whether you're pulling the cards from the deck or seeing what your opponents have left, it keeps you engaged. And you can pursue slightly different approaches, whether it's building up on pirates to take on ships, chasing the expeditions or getting a sprawling mix of characters.

Bit underwhelmed after the first play, but definitely want to try it again before rating. Simple game, but still need to do some strategic planning to play optimally. Probably our lack of fully grasping card powers and synergies resulted in lacklustre play. Not the game's fault.

Update: Let's say seven for now, but still get the feel that 'we've been there, done that' with this game. Doesn't mean we don't enjoy it, but...

Still want to get a few more plays in before the final verdict. Could go up or down.

I was excited to try this "gamer-ified" take on Zirkus Flochati, which is my favorite Knizia filler. And I like Port Royal quite a bit. I don't think any of the cards are unbalanced, which people seem quick to assume on first play. I just don't know when I would ever bring it out over Zirkus.

I've played this game online and I like it a lot. But playing it face to face feels very lackluster. The game just ends too fast and players could potentially run away with good card draw. Of course this is a fun push your luck game and the brave might win with pure luck. I just wish there's some way to kinda stop the leaders from running away in this game. Overall an OK game, nothing amazing.

A superb push your luck card game. There's tension and excitement as the cards are revealed but the game engenders tremendous good humour among players - even when their turn goes 'bust'. Strategic optimisation of personnel hires as well as card turn 'luck management' combine to make for a real personal fave. Plenty of table noise and a game that appeals to almost all-comers. A ton of fun.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (January 2017)

I generally don’t like “push your luck” games but Port Royal is among the best game in the genre. It is also from Alexander Pfister, a designer that is on fire right now so I was keen to try it.

The rules are pretty easy to teach, but there are many more that you initially thought for a “simple” card game. You can explain them under 15 minutes. Playtime is around 60 minutes.

The art is ok.

I dislike pirate themed games but you don’t feel it through the game.

The decisions needed to play the game seems very simple, but it after playing it twice, it seems Port Royal has more meat that I initially thought. Still the decisions aren’t very hard and luck plays a prominent role in the game. It can be partially mitigated with your deck, but not enough for my tastes.

I like that in each turn all players are engaged taking decisions, so you don’t feel the downtime, still I prefer to play it with 3 players.

It is a hard game to buy, I could only find it on Europe.

Bottom line Port Royal is a solid and clever game, but not for me. I will be playing it more times in the future to see If I missed something, but this kind of game (push your luck, easy decisions, very light), is not for us.

A really enjoyable, push-your-luck, deck-flippin' swashbucklin' light strategy game. Easy to teach in a few minutes and great with any amount of players, even just two. Quite a few different strategic routes to pursue, which gives more replayability than most games of this size.

Very good card game. Simple, push your luck game that keeps everyone interested as you can benefit from the others' turns. Indeed, part of the thought process in deciding how many cards to draw revolves around what you are prepare to let the others have and whether they can afford it.

We travel with this game. It probably the only push your luck type game I have so far, we love how simple this game plays and how quickly the time passes as we play game after game. The game is quite fast as your only going to 12 points. I have tried to build an engine in the games I've played while my wife goes for the filling of contract. I'm yet to win a game.... it seams that 12 points can be to short of a game for that, or maybe I need to compete for contracts with my wife and the game will drag on enough for engines to make a difference in the outcome. Can't wait to try new strategys and also try it with more than two people. I like this game a lot and I'm glad I have it in my collection.

I've been really getting into these games that have cards that serve multiple purposes.  I really like the whole idea of having the cards serve as both gold and workers.  I know there are games who use it better and use it more, but Port Royal is a great introduction into that world.  I also enjoy how each type of card serves a very different purpose and each one feels really great throughout.  Very enjoyable game.

Port Royal was a pleasant surprise.

Its a very solid 2 - 3 person card game filler with a drafting and tableau building mechanic with a slight push your luck element . (I haven't yet tried it with 4). I had seen this game compared to Splendor, but for me the feel is completely different. My enjoyment for the game grew as I realized, that this is not an economic engine building game like Splendor because the game ended before an engine was built. 

But in Port Royal we are building different tableaus to obtain our victory points and special abilities. As I draw more cards into the harbor on my turn, I may go bust, it may help my tableau, it may help yours. Then when I draft from the harbor, I must decide do I pick a card to help me or to stop yours.  The key is not pushing your luck, but on knowing when to pass on items in the harbor, and being selective on the cards you pursue.

Port Royal is on my Dime list for 2017. I anticipate my rating will go up.

Totally addicted playing at Yucata.de.  It is a great push your luck game.  Even though it has a high luck element, the better players seems to win so there must be some strategic element in there.  Best of all is its short playing time.  

On yucata.de, I prefer the two player version because multiple players slow you down too much.  I'm looking forward to playing multiple players face-to-face.

I was very pleased with this game after only one play and where I came in last.
I love that only 1 deck is needed for all the actions of the game, the play is quick, learning time is very short for anyone who has played any sort of card game before. This is a great filler game between larger ones, or a fun quick party game. I would like to get a copy of this for my friends who like more lightweight games.

Port royal is a clever card game.

The game is probably more easy than you would suspect by having a glance ath the rulebook.

the other new to me game we played today was Istanbul and this was prefered over it. It has the same problem though by again being very well possible that some players reach the same amount number of points and having to go to tiebreak rules. The tiebreak rules in this one are much better though.

I thought of a variation (or I missed it by going through the rules the first time) . In phase 2 all players can scare away ships. This makes it  a little more difficult for the player two get two coins when it is his turn and 5 ships are in the harbour. It adds a little more time to get it played but my impression is that it is also a little bit easier to acquire a different end total that way.

edit : played it a couple of times and it really fell plat. I had no joy in winning or playing the game.

Not as good as the original 'Händler der Karibik' was, because Port Royal is missing the mandatory expidition -rule. Box size is bigger too, which isn't good thing if you own more games; the older one was basic small box. I don't think that including the 5th players cards is a good improvement, because even 'Händler der Karibik' was better with three than four players.

RATING: 6.4
One play of it; was not convincing. I heard the more players the better, but it was definitely too much with 5. And maybe we were just unlucky to keep drawing the ship cards as money, but in the first half (hour) of the game we could not really do more than hoping to collect money – so tose who found the ships with lots of treasure were lucky, but in this first half most of the time what we saw was someone drew a, three ship cards and two were already of the same color or b, ten cards and all of them were person cards – even though the deck was shuffled thoroughly. It felt like there were more person cards or fewer ship cards than needed. But well, these are only first impressions and as I hope we only had bad luck I don’t give up trying; however, this rather weak first impression convinced me the SdJ jury was right to forget Port Royal this year – the game can be boring and is also probably dependent on the players you’re playing with.

It's an old game mechanics that has been undusted and brought to the new era.

The game is simple, flip cards as you want but make sure you do not get twice the same color, if you do, you lose your turn.

Then chose which card to buy, other players can do the same and you pass to the next player.

Game is pretty fast, unless people are thinking too much. It also possibly play well at 2 which is impressive.

The core mechanics as a lot of potential for other kind of games. Could be the next mechanic trend like that was the case for deck building. The main upgrade to the older mechanic is that cards has multiple functions, and that changes the game by adding more depth.

The game allows you to keep flipping cards until you stop and pay for a card, take a card that gives money or bust.  You bust by getting two ships that are the same nation.  Other players can then pay the active player to but more cards.  

Object is to race to 10 points.  The game is a little long for what it is but their are interesting cards that allow you to race for orders.  Also cards that give you special powers.  

It reminds me of Circus Flohcati and I prefer that simpler game to this one.

This is a really neat game with lots of different strategies available to pursue. Players are kept involved since they want to collect from the harbour display.  

Rulebook would be improved with a couple of visual examples because its not clear what hte display and harbour display is at first:

Played this solo and played wrong becasue:
1. I kept the ships in my display  
2. Becasue there were ships in front of me, I thought that the swords on the ships counted against fighting off the ships. Also the money started to dry up !!

When played played with 4 realised the mistake. 

there are a number of strategies - going for the encounters is good but you lose the VPs from the contributions.

In our game the admiral generating money only just lost out to a push your luck strategy which just sneaked in by buying a 3 point character.

Simple but not stupid. Plays fast, but still has enough interesting decisions to make. Don't expect heavy strategies, but in it's sort, it's one of the best. 
Great 'play" value for little money.

Replayability can be an issue if you start to know which cards make the difference. Nevertheless, this game stays a fun way to pass your time (when you embrace the luck factor of what cards show up when).

Minus: 3 (Replayability) - 10

RATING: 8
I like this a lot and play with the expansion. Very fast, good decisions, win-lose conditions (with the contracts) other than beat your own score. You need to be okay with some push your luck but that luck can be mitigated. There are enough characters to recruit that it hasn't gotten same-y at all. Klemens Franz's art is charming as always. Pirate-y theme is fun as well.

Though you have far less control than you do in Race for the Galaxy, Port Royal goes down the same path a bit, which is a huge plus for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A push your luck game with meaningful decisions since it also an engine building game.  You're trying to obtain cards that will help you on future turns.  Sometimes you'll bust on purpose because you'll benefit from it or you'll be keeping an opponent from obtaining a card that will benefit their engine.  Never felt like I've been punished (or lost the game) due to the luck in the game.   

The expansion adds additional strategy options.

This is one of the very few competetive games I can play with my wife that really gives us a good time. Usually one gets miffed over the other's actions; this one has that element that just makes it hilarious when something bad happens to either person and somewhat gratifying when something good happens. You don't really think about winning -- that often happens completely by accident. It's really just a terrifically fun game.

The whole family loves this game. The kids have really enjoyed it and got past the point of turning as may cards over as possible to get what they want. Limiting the choice of your opponents is just as important.

If you like fairly quick (it can run longer with 5 players) card games, with push your luck and a small amount of engine building, this is the game for you.

We have just received the expansion which we tried once and loved. It makes the game more expansive whilst at the same time being quicker. This is music to my ears ... the perfect expansion. Haven't tried the solo game yet but will do soon.

Great game. If you game with your family get it ... it will be fun. If you tried it and found it too long try the expansion hopefully it will tighten and shorten up the game for you.

The desigener Alexander Pfister is on roll with us at the moment. we love Isle of Skye: From Chieftain to King and I have played Mombasa a few times and love that to.

Another of those games that I don't like, but nevertheless won my first play.

[b]Updated for the [gameid=181899] expansion[/b]
I still would prefer not to play the base game, but I really like it with the expansion as a solo game and I do enjoy it as a multi-player game - again, as long as the expansion is included.

I think that part of my problem with the base game when I first played it is that it was poorly explained to me and I really didn't know what I was doing. So when I won that first game I thought "hmmm... a bit crappy if somebody who really doesn't 'get' the game can win their first game against experienced players" a feeling that it was too light for my taste was part of that, though I've become a little more accepting of lighter games in the right context.

I'm a fan of the designer (Mombasa, Isle of Skye) in general, but this one didn't work for me.

Incidentally, I really don't like that sometimes your best move is to intentionally bust.

Terrific "push your luck" tableau building game.  It's always enjoyable.

The first expansion, which adds cards, a contract module, and a cooperative mode is amazing.

Some rule clarifications:

The Jester gives everyone a coin if there is no card available for them, even the Active Player, if they bust.

The Active Player may always choose not to take a card.  This is particularly important to note in the Cooperative game.

Genial filler de cartas, para los ratos muertos entre partidas. Es bastante azaroso, y veo que falta algo de interacción entre jugadores. Aun así, me gusta mucho la mecánica de forzar tu suerte y lo ágil que son las partidas. Perfectamente recomendable.

RATING: 10
The best quick-played fillers, and one of the best games of all time. Currently my only 10-rated game.

This game is so good at any player count. It's so fast-paced with 2 players and even with any player count if everyone knows the game.

The "player limit" can be stretched if needed which is something I really like.

The expansions and promos are fun and neat. I just shuffle everything together even though it's recommended to only add a few of the things but I think it works just fine.

Just an amazing push-your-luck game that has so much to offer!

Fun push your luck card game. It is a little long with four players and you can get hosed by the random card draw. With two it works, but after three plays I was pretty much done with the game. Not bad, but with the game groups I play with it doesn't seem to be a good fit.

My one play of Port Royal was with five players, the maximum possible for this card game. It ended up going well over the recommended thirty minute paying time but was still managed to keep our collective attention and provide a pleasant gaming experience.

The basic idea is that players acquire influence points through the purchase of cards and undertaking various missions about the place, one usually needs to 'build an engine' to support these activities. Once the game end is triggered the round is played out and the player with the most influence points wins the game.

A meh push your luck with pretty much nothing else into it. The victory condition cuts the game too early, so any of the seemingly interesting options to build your little engine doesn't pay off and you should go straight to the VP.

Lots of luck on which characters appear early on (and if you get a 4 coin ship on your first turn!). Also the shuffling can get tiresome if you aren't that way inclined. I prefer it digitally, but it can be good as a simple game to introduce people to.

Edit: My wife actually enjoyed this and with a good card shuffling machine (German hand crank one) and the added expansion elements make this a great game to pick up quick. i even got my Brother-In-Law playing this while waiting on the football to come on.

Decent filler, if a little too long. Reminds me a lot of Abyss, but where that is an outstanding production that goes by really quickly, this is just a deck of cards that tends to drag on. I do like the various strategies, but I guess I just didn't think Port Royal was all that special. Even when Alexander Pfister designs good games, they always seem to have glaring flaws that keep them from *very* good territory.

Looks like a decent little card game, albeit with a pasted on theme. I've revised my opinion after watching this played on Gamenight!

Quatre joueurs: 7.75/10 (Best)
Trois joueurs: 7/10 (Recommended)

Après 2 parties jouées à 4 joueurs puis 2 à 3 joueurs, j'ai l'impression que certaines cartes personnages ne sont pas aussi bien balancées à 3 joueurs. Cela est peut-être dû au fait que plus de cartes sont en circulation, que les cartes d'expédition sortent plus fréquemment et qu'il y a moins de risque qu'un item soit convoité par plusieurs joueurs. Résultat: les expéditions sont peut-être plus facilement réalisables, ce qui tend (du moins, c'est mon constat après deux parties jouées à 3 joueurs) à rendre moins intéressantes certains personnages, comme les "sailor", par exemple.

Very good push your luck game.  I liked Dead Man's Draw, but this game adds more items to think about which increases the strategy piece DMD was missing.  I always enjoy multiple use cards, so using the deck also as your money supply was a win.  The game plays quick enough that it does not outstay its welcome on the table.  Highly recommend this as it may be one of my top card games.

RATING: 7
This card game is a push your luck filler. During their turn, players turn over cards, until they wish to stop, or they are forced to stop when 2 colors of the same ship show up. If they are forced to stop, they lose their turn. Otherwise, they may purchase a card from those revealed, and so can the other players, paying the active player a coin for the privilege.

The cards give you one time income, swords to repel ships, or other persons with different abilities. The first player to 12 VPs wins, so it goes quickly. 

I'm having fun playing this, groaning when I am forced to stop. There is a lot of luck, but it is fun.

I takes 2 minutes to learn how to play this filler, and only 15 to actually play it, but it is really fun. 

It's a very simple "push your luck", but the turns go very fast.

Some hours after the games (now) I'm still wondering how have we enjoyed and liked so much such a simple game... And I think the secret is that you actually play on your rivals' turns, you want him to keep drawing cards (or not), depending on your interests, and that creates a nice tension...

A nice filler and due to the mechanic of cards serving as currency at the same time (which I find a very nice touch) a very good game for traveling, which is probably also the fastest game to setup there is. 
I like the "push your luck" component and the active-inactive player dynamic is nice as it reduces the downtime component because people keep interested in which cards are coming up. 
Played with 2 and 3 so far and both works well.

-----

Became a little repetitive with time as eventually everyone is going for the same strategy that seems stronger than others, so this dropped a little, but I'd still bring it out with some that played it not as much.

------

And up to 7 it is again. With more than 3 players and played quickly it's still a fun filler.

I usually play heavier games, but this one is a guilty pleasure of mine. It has just the right amount of push your luck and strategy for a fun little game.

[b]Port Royal[/b] was sold via BGG marketplace. (10/15/14)
Received in a math trade. (9/14/14)

[COLOR=#FF0000]Three years later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]I originally played Port Royal a couple of times back in October of 2014. Unfortunately, at the time we were playing with a major rules error (we were discarding sailors after we used them to fend off a ship). Over the years folks who's opinions I respect kept talking about Port Royal so I ended up getting another copy with the expansion. Obviously it's been a huge hit with my kids, it has become our go to filler. My daughter and I really enjoy the co-op variant while my son prefers to play head to head. [/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]I traded for this game because I was looking for a light/quick push your luck game and I really liked the art. In a nut shell this game drags on and is quite boring (just ask my kids). You constantly flip cards only to draw two ships of the same color with a high attack value, thus ending your turn. Other times you flip over 10+ cards only to get nothing you need/can get because you don't have enough money. On top of that it is a bit gamery and not suitable to play with family and friends that are not familiar with a lot of games.

I would recommend Incan Gold/Doiamant, which is a quick playing push your luck game that your whole family can enjoy, instead of Port Royal.[/i]

This game us a good fit for people who like Machi Koro or Splendor. It is a light engine building game with a push-your-luck element too. It is harder to pick up than either Splendor or MK because the rules are a little bit more fiddly and the symbology a little but trickier. My wife for example hated it and she likes both Splendor and MK. However the box and footprint are small, the game is cheap and the play-time is short, so it is definitely worth a punt.

A nice variant on the push-your-luck mechanism. The more you put out, the more you can sell off and the more money you can make, but at the risk of crashing and getting nothing. As such, a whole bunch of your fate is wrapped up in the cards you pull. And there's more luck re what appears when you've got the money able to buy cards (and when not). In short, there's a lot of luck, and it might go a tad long for what it is, but it's pleasant enough without being a must-have.

"Clever push-your-luck game with quite a bit of non-attacking player interaction. It seems like it would take several plays to fully understand how to best use all the cards, and pick up subtleties about when to stop and when to push. It has gone over surprisingly well, both as a competitive game and as a co-op."

What I like:
- All players are at least slightly involved during other players' turns
- Push-your-luck is a mechanism I usually enjoy
- A variety of strategies and tactics seem viable
- Small box
- Seems to play in about 40 minutes (after the 60-minute 4p learning game)

What I don't like:
- There were more "do nothing" turns than I would prefer
- Some of the cards seemed underpowered, but they probably aren't really

This is a push your luck game that still gives you some good choices to make during the game play.  Love the theme and artwork.  I like the multi-use cards.  Deciding how many cards to put into the harbor display and which card(s) to take/buy each turn are always fun decisions you must make each time you're the active player.  And it's also fun to also get a chance to buy a card each round even when you're not the active player.  But should you give your opponent that extra coin??  And at a high player count, I love that Jester card! :)  Probably my favorite push your luck game!

Based on one play: You flip cards randomly and then you may buy at least one. But the more cards you flip the more you get, however if two boats of the same color come up, your turn if over and you get nothing. So there is a push your luck aspect as you collect points and powers to get you points faster. Not much thought but nice if you want a simple filler.

Port Royal is a light push-your-luck card game.  On his turn, a player reveals cards until either he wants to take one, or two ships of the same color are flipped.  In the latter case, that player "busts" and loses his turn.  Otherwise, after the player takes a card, the other players can pay that player a coin to take one of the remaining cards.  Cards can either provide a player with coins, grant special abilities like extra coins when taking a certain color or when a certain number of cards have been flipped, or provide icons that can be redeemed for big-point public contracts.  This is a pretty simple game, and like many games of its ilk, card flips tend to trump any sort of strategy.  This one didn't really stand out to me.

I didn't have a great first experience with Port Royal and I think it's easy to be put off by an unlucky first game. Over time you start to see more of a strategic core to it, though, albeit covered in a large dollop of luck.

Excellent filler! Plays slightly differently from original. In original version the expedition cards were a must to win the game, but then again in new version they provide more points, so almost always the game is won by doing at least 1 expedition. Works just as well. Support for 5 players is a welcome change and increases value.

Having now played this face to face with 3 it is interesting to compare this experience with that of playing online (Yucata).

One noticeable difference is that in real life the game seems to lack tension, when online you can feel it. I think this is mainly due to all the computation of tabled vp is done and 'in your face' on Yucata, whereas face to face the scores still feel too fractured even for scores less than 12. Transactions are fiddly in real life too, but nowhere near the issue of tension from pushing your luck. The running score of Yucata coupled with the easy to scan tableaus (i.e orientated same way) made the game interesting, as well as having the greed inducing incentive of trying to draw 4 or 5 different coloured ships.

Obviously the s(c)hared schaudenfreude is what makes it fun face to face, but the deck is so detailed that you can't make sound judgements of when to go on or stop. Online play also seems to give the impression that building up income and getting the 'draft another' person is a killer strategy and hard to not follow in order to stay in the competition or counter effectively.

So in the end, I like the money layer but mechanically too repetitive for the time it takes to play, theme isn't really there and hard pressed to think why I shouldn't be playing Cheeky Monkey instead with its crystallising end game and reveal.

Press-your-luck card draft/set collection. Has a little bit of a Dominion deck building, but just with card drawing. Fairly lightweight filler. Advertised time of up to 50 min; that seems long and the game will probably overstayed its welcome by then.
Not a huge fan of press your luck and bust mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a card flipluck driven push your luck game. The goal is to be the first to get to 12 points. Points mostly come printed on cards. On your turn you take the big pile of cards and start flipping. You choose when to stop, but if you put two boats of the same color on the table, you bust and your turn immediately ends. If you don't bust, then you stop, and can buy a card for it's printed dollars cost and add it to your tableau. Then, each player going clockwise can buy from your array of flipped cards, but they have to pay you an extra card. 

So, yes, it is flip-luck the game, but since that's the premise, it doesn't bother me. I usually play with the expansions because I think they add interesting new cards, although I usually feel like the game ends just as things are getting interesting. Right now I'm into it, but I wish the game had a little more opportunity for back-and-forth. At the moment it seems like one player gets ahead and then wins? It's so hard to say, because it's so player driven. If players buy from the player in the lead, handing them dollars, he accelerates. If players flip cards in such a way as to give the leader extra purchase opportunities, then he accelerates. That being said, the game gives you reason to flip more, as if you flip a series of different colored ships, you get to take more cards from the flipped array.

I've played the game a lot and I'm still not sure about it.

 It's an unusual combination of fairly basic engine-building and push-your-luck card-drafting. The active player can keep turning up cards from the deck unless they reveal two ships of the same colour, which busts their whole turn (similar to the hazards in Incan Gold). Once she chooses to stop, she can buy one card from the row, but then other players get the chance to buy cards too if they pay an additional gold to the active player. It's worth pushing your luck to find the card you want and also because if you reveal four different coloured ships you get an additional buy. The cards include gaining money instantly, tableau cards with special powers, expeditions (big VP cards that need prerequisites to be claimed) and tax increases (which penalise players who are hoarding gold). First to 12VP wins and there seem to be several viable approaches.

I'm not often that excited by engine-building games but the PYL card-drafting is really fun and makes the engine-building more interactive than most. I also really like that it's just a deck of 120 cards - face-down cards are used as money - and the setup is as simple as making a draw pile and giving each player three gold. And since every card comes into play through the public draft, you can pretty much teach as you go, rather than having to give everyone a reference sheet for the iconography.

August 2017: Dropped from 8 to 6.5.

What makes this game charming ultimately makes the game unsatisfying: You can't plan at all. In your typical card drafting, tableau building game, you could try to plan what card to buy on subsequent turns. Not in this game! The selection of cards always changes in every turn! And there's no way to reserve any cards for the future! This makes the game move very quickly, but I think sacrifices too much in terms of strategy.

2014-10-17: Raised from 6.5 to 8. Ultimate Euro filler game. Bonus points for no extra cubes or tokens to lose! Yes, there's dominant strategies like any economic engine game, but the huge luck factor forces you in different directions! By fat, the best part of the game is how fast it plays.

Tentative 6.5 rating for now. It's your typical ultra-light economic engine, tableau building, Euro card game where the game tends to pick your strategy (rather than the other way around). However, the game moves very, very fast, as opposed to many other games in this genre.

É rápido e apela bastante à sorte, valendo bem o preço que custa. Experimentem!

RATING: 8
Fun, light, short game. Very simple to teach and play. 

In fact, normally we are not big fans of "push your luck" games. But in this one, we don't mind it - it's actually quite enjoyable. First, because the chances of being unlucky are typically not too big, and the penalty is not that crushing (sure you lose one turn, but there should be plenty left). And second, because you can control the risk - you know how many differently colored ships you've opened, and furthermore, you can significantly reduce your chances of failure by getting swords. So all in all, this one's good fun :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fine push-your-luck filler with some varying paths of scoring to pursue. Flipping cards until someone busts is amusing, not so much when you do it, but then there are hilariously lucky times when you draw an absurd sequence of cards. All-in-all, a decent entry that stands above most fillers if you are in search of something with more "game" to it.  

(+) Turns flow smoothly and the push-your-luck is seamlessly integrated. 
(+) Minor opportunities for smart combos through careful card selection 
(+) Very accessible, easy to understand rules and gameplay 

(-) Reliant heavily on luck 
(-) May lack variety over time 
(-) Can be somewhat repetitive, but fortunately does not overstay its welcome.

RATING: 7
15-02-2015. Rated after 3 plays. Fun game in which you do sort of tableau-building using a push-your-luck mechanism to 'draft' cards.

Each turn you flip over cards until you either hit two ships of the same color OR you stop. You receive income based on special abilities of previously bought cards and buy 1 (or multiple depending on previously bought cards) new card. The push your luck element of flipping cards can be mitigated by soldiers that 'defeat' pirate ships etc. Your opponent can also buy cards and gain income during your turn.

It's a fun. Quick, light game that I like quite a bit. I do wonder how the game plays with multiple players, as there can be considerable down-time when flipping cards that I may not like..
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I don't really see the point of this game.  There are many other better tableau building games that play just as fast, like San Juan, and many other better push-your-luck games that play just as fast, like Can't Stop.  Dead Man's Draw, while another one I don't love, seems a better choice if you really want a similar feel (2 player only though).  It's just too random and yet not random, in that you potentially could benefit from knowing the deck perfectly and keeping close track of all the visible cards you see.  I prefer my push-your-luck games to be truly random, based on a very clear probability distribution that requires no memory/tracking.  I can get really into watching another player roll the dice just one more time, whereas watching another player (or me) flip the next card is somehow super-boring.  No one in our game got enough swords to be able to confidently draw to 5 boats, very rarely 4 - I guess I can see the game getting more interesting then, but it seems someone will usually get to 12 points before someone can get enough swords to make it interesting.

We love this game, great quirky pirate theme, artwork and so much fun every time we play. It's great because it's inexpensive, matches are always competitive, it travels well, and you can play it anywhere including sitting in bed owing to the unique feature that the cards themselves also serve as game currency. The press your luck mechanic is about the best implementation that we've seen in any game of this kind. The only thing that could make this game better would be additional cards to expand the way to score points.

RATING: 1.5
The game itself is a very interesting take on engine building - basically by adding risk management and some leeching. Certainly one of the more enjoyable indirect interaction games. 

Problem is: it's an engine builder. I'm not sure when did engine building became a sort of gaming staple, but I'm not missing it in my gaming diet. Thinking about it some more I've realised that engine builders I do like (Fleet and Power Grid) have a more pronounced interaction with some psychology (open auction) and both also have an organic engine which grows. In Fleet and in PG you see the thing you're building slowly growing and then faster and faster and it has a certain kind of narrative to it. 

Port Royal just has cards with points with some special abilities - while it is an engine building game it's not exactly an engine which is built (it's just a sum of cards). Another thing that bothers me are illustrations - I like the style in general, but in which point did somebody think that putting tiny brown figures of people on large brown background is a good idea? (Should have been portraits). 

EDIT: after initial interest I've realised I can't even be bothered to remember the strategy of the game. As I've said engine building isn't something I find exciting. 

EDIT 2: An engine building game I've played enough of. 
EDIT 3: see above, but now with rating 2.0
EDIT 4: see above, but now feeling remorse for investing time into this at all.

RATING: 6
Played once with 3P and once with 4P. In Port Royal, players draft cards from a public display. These cards either provide coins or permanent effects which build up a rudimentary engine. For the most part, Port Royal progresses like most engine-building games – players obtain coins and use them to buy cards with effects. 

The gimmick that distinguishes Port Royal is the push-your-luck mechanism used to draw cards for the draft, which is similar to that of [thing=337][/thing]. If two ships have matching colours, the player drawing the cards loses his or her turn. Several tweaks are included to deal with this mechanism directly, such as cards which provide coins whenever a player goes bust or the ability to discard ships. Interestingly enough, ships are a minority in the deck, which may explain why there a number of rules which incentivise players to take additional risks and draw more cards.

All that being said, I find Port Royal a somewhat ordinary filler card game. There is no doubt that it is well-designed, but I feel that the game focuses more on building up the engine and detracts from the tension of pushing your luck. To make up for this, the rules offer elaborate incentives to nudge players into taking risks. There are a few other drawbacks; for example. it can be clear who is no longer in contention for victory towards the last few rounds. Also, luck of the draw may see your opponents revealing the very cards they need to complete the expedition and swing the game in their favour.

Simple push your luck filler. Players are pirates trying to get gold to buy expedition, personnel, and other cards to get to 12 VP.

Each turn, active player flips cards till they decide to stop. Player then takes a galleon card offering gold or buys a card with existing gold. Next player downstream then has a chance to get buy or take a gold card but had to give the active player a card.

If you flip a second of a existing galleon card (by colour), your turn is over. First to 12 VPs win. There are other cards to pull back player hoarding gold (tax!), etc.

A throwback to simpler card games. Works out of the box but lacks excitement.

Egyszerű, gyors, de rendkívül szerencsefüggő játék a Port Royal. A játékos a körében kártyákat fordít fel egy talonból, ahonnan 5 különböző színű vitorlájú hajót vagy különböző tulajdonságokkal rendelkező kártyát találhat. A vitorlások simán pénzt hoznak, a másik kártyákkal különböző előnyök járnak, illetve később beválthatók célkártyákra, amik még több pontot adnak. Van adó kártya is, a túlzott pénzhalmozás visszaszorítására. A szerencse szerepe óriási, nagyon nem mindegy mit fordítunk föl, sőt, miután választottunk sorban mindenki vehet még egy kártyát a felfordítottakból. Cserében a 12 pont fél óra játék után könnyedén elérhető. Így végülis le lehet mellé ülni, mert azért van benne döntési helyzet. Nem egy világmegváltó játék, de el lehet vele játszogatni.

1 play

The game has a Circus Flohcati feel -- you pull cards from the deck in a similar way, going bust when 2 duplicates are drawn -- but with some added complexity: more types of cards, set collection but building towards getting specific VP objective cards, etc. It plays pretty smoothly, although after one play I think I like Sail to India more. However, I would like to try this again.

RATING: N/A
Victory at 12 VP: The original game(Händler der Karibik) ended to 10 points which was too short. The Governor becomes too powerful card if you continue to 20 points.

Variant Recommended: It is suggested to play with the mandatory expedition variant rule. It was mandatory in the original game(Händler der Karibik) to complete an expedition.

Designer Variant:The player that goes bust gets a gold coin. So I suppose he would get 2 if he had the jester?

2017-08: Steve Jackson Games  publishes English edition with different cover art. But the game play and cards inside are largely the same.

Really fast, light push your luck game. Easy to introduce even to non-gamers and for me feels like a filler (it takes slightly longer than your usal filler, but is still close).

You flip cards - you can always flip some more to get a bigger choise and to maybe get the option to take more than 1 card (if there are enough ships of different colors), but if you flip two ships of the same color (and you can't defeat the second one) you bust and get nothing.
If you don't bust all other players alos get the chance to buy 1 single card, but they'll have to pay you an additional coin for it.

First person to 12 victory points wins.

Push-your-luck game where players turn over cards from a deck containing ships (give money), people (cost money, give persistent bonuses and VP) and expeditions (require specific people, give VP). If two ships of the same colour are in the display at the same time, the turn is over. 

There's a lot to like here. It's push-your-luck, but with a strong engine-building component and a variety of tactical options. I particularly like the swords, which both aid players in mitigating bad draws and encourage them to take risks.

A good filler.

[Pegasus Spiele 14 edition] {Private; luck-pressing, set-collection; optimal 3-4p} Port Royal is a good filler: fun, tactical, high replayability and interactive.  A typical game is around 25-30 minute, great!  One's choice of a card can be much influenced by others.

It seems collecting sailor and pirate is quite important.  It allows you to add more cards.  Another important card is Governor.  These cards can let you get cards faster, which is important to win this game.

The card illustration is good and the iconology is helpful.

Clever little filler game that utilises the cards as both money (back) and recruiting crew or fighting off ships on the otherside which means there is a high volume of replayability throughout the game itself.
Like playing the variation with having to complete an expedition but found this dragged out the game longer longer than it should for a 4 player game. Furthermore, the game will drag with a younger audience as they will be more inclined to 'push their luck' by either trying to reveal the card they want ar at least getting 4 or more different coloured ships, which is harder to get than you think!!

A very charming push your luck game, with an element of (very light) engine building thrown in.

It was a good way to pass 25 minutes, though the end game (with 3 players potentially capable of winning) felt oddly anticlimatic.

Update: Other plays have been much closer and though the card draw can be pretty decisive, it's a fun game for what it is.

There are enough decisions to keep the game interesting throughout, but I'm not particularly enamored with the nature of those decisions. The push-your-luck mechanic is fun, and you have to balance your need to develop scoring opportunities against your need for money. Yet the whole thing seems a bit arbitrary. It's another game where, in the end, someone wins, but I'm not really invested in who or why. There's nothing wrong with the game, but, despite the interesting card acquisition system, the whole thing is lackluster.

Port Royal is indeed royalty as far as card fillers are concerned.  This small box of 120 cards is a push your luck game - a genre that is mostly lacking - that hits all the right notes,  as would a precision orchestra.

The push your luck mechanic is finely honed and is an integral part of the game - while not being merely the game itself.  The game plays fast,  scales well and offers delicious decisions on almost every turn.  Down time is not an issue and there is great balance in the many different approaches to victory.

There is much to discover in this simple, yet elegant design - And while the seagull shows little respect for the pirate on the box cover, ( Yes,  his boot has been soiled )  you will find no soiled booty in this near perfect implementation of a quick card filler that also offers wide appeal.

About [thing=156009][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=156009][/thing] is a push your luck game in which players try to accomplish missions, hire crew and plunder ships.

The goal is to have more points, and is easy to get them: ships give money, money is used to hire crew, which in many cases are worth points, and some of the crew can be used to fulfill missions in order to gain some big points and get some more money. There are two tricky parts to do this:

a) You blindly draw cards, one at a time, from  draw deck. Ships are color-coded - and if two ships of the same color show up, your turn ends without you being able to hire or plunder;
b) The other players can get the cards you didn't take. Sure, you get a coin for each they do, but they might be taking more than you in this deal.

[thing=156009][/thing] is an easy game to teach and to play, with a big element of luck, but it [b]isn't all luck[/b], as it allows room for decisions (in continuing drawing, when to stop and what to take, considering what will be left for the others), even to the point of trashing your turn in order to not leave a great card to someone else. There is plenty of indirect interaction - no one can truly harm the other, and the mechanics work well enough to call for repeated plays.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Every player start with 3 coins. In her turn a player draws cards, one at a time, from the draw deck. There is no limit to the amount of cards drawn and she decides when to stop - most of the time. This is because the ships have colors, and if the two ships of the same color are drawn, the turn of the current player ends immediately and all the cards drawn are discarded.

If the turn didn't end because of this, the player can take 1 card - it can be more, depending on the number of ships of different colors drawn, but most of the time will be 1 card. The player can either pay to hire someone, adding the person to her playing area, or plunder a ship, taking money equal to the number of coins shown on the card of the ship. The person have several different effects - some give more coins for certain type of ships, others make hiring cheaper, or allow to take 2 cards instead of just one, or have a symbols, which are used to fulfill missions or fight off ships, and so on.

Then the other players, in order, can take 1 card (usually) and regardless if they plunder or hire, they must pay 1 coin to the current player. After this the current player can fulfill one mission, by discarding the persons with the required symbols of the mission. Then the player takes the mission card, which are worth some big points and some coins for the trouble.

Turns pass this way until a player reaches 12 or more points. Then all the other players will get one more turn. Finally, the player with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
When to stop drawing. Sometimes this will be given, as when you need money and turns over a 4 coins ships - you get the money you need and everyone else gets nothing, a fine deal indeed. Others, this will be trickier - you might be looking for something, and must calculate two risks: of revealing a second ship of a color already revealed, and of leaving one or more excellent cards to the other players (remembering that, at least, you will receive one coin for each card taken by them in your turn). Still, not rocket science.

The second most constant decision is: what to take. Again, this can be pretty given by what is open to you. Other times a little more thought will be required, considering the special abilities of the persons, what will be remain for the others, what are the missions open, how much money the others have, how much you have and how much will be left, and considerations of this sort.

These are basically it - there are others, but minor.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Easy to teach and to play;
- Language independant;
- Small and highly portable - and the cards return to the box sleeved;
- Allows for a good amount of decisions by the player;
- Indirect interaction and most are positive (receiving money from others), making for a fine family game and a good option for those looking for low conflict;
- Light catch-up mechanics.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Some downtime issues;
- Luck, is, indeed, present;
- Not enough seagulls or sea combats.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like most - if not all - push your luck games, one needs to know beforehand if they are fine with, well, luck. Many say, at first, that they are - and many aren't. You can draw two cards, get two ships of the same color, and puff, your turn is over and you get nothing. The next player might reveal a ship worth 4 coins, a mission and exactly the card she needed to complete the mission, which she can also takes because she has the Governor - isn't that lucky?

These sort of things not only can, but most likely will happen eventually - it is the nature of the beast; it is a feature, not a bug. Yet, there are those that know what they are going into, and will complain (during [i]and[/i] after) that there is no purpose to play, that is all chance, no real (and tough) decisions, and the whole experience is hollow and dumb down. But, no. It is simply neat push your luck game, made to entertain while being highly accessible and allowing for constant, yet not difficult, decisions - this is [thing=156009][/thing]. Dock at your own accord.

Preliminary rating after a couple of games with two players. The game takes some getting used to, but in the end it is a fast playing "filler" game which revolves around taking risk for better rewards. Probably better with more players. Great artwork though!
UPDATE: Wow...this game is turning into one of my favorite two player filler games. Did not see that coming. Relaxed to play, yet suspenseful. But then I do like push your luck games in general.

RATING: 6
A card game inspired by Knizia's Cirkus Flohcati, but slightly more complex. The game still revolves around the concept of "playing chicken" with the card flip. So long as no two same-colored ships are flipped, active player can keep on flipping over cards, stopping at any time to pick up a card of choice. Unlike Cirkus Flohcati though, a whole lot more rules and complexity have been added to spice up the game. Overall, the game works but lacks the simplicity of Cirkus Flohcati. While total playing time is significantly longer than Knizia's card game, it does introduce more strategic elements to the game play. One tweak I enjoy is being able to purchase cards from the draw pile of the active player by paying one gold. This is particularly rewarding and also keeps all player actively engaged. Plus, it make the active player ponder about the number of card draws required. These are definite improvements.

I expected much from this game based on the ratings, but I ended up disappointed. Maybe because I played only in two? The game was just slow: acquire gold through several turns, buy a card for almost all your gold, then rinse and repeat until somebody gets lucky and wins. Player interaction is minimal. The expeditions were also too powerful. I don't remember if anyone ever won without using them. All in all, nothing special.

Tableau building with a press-your-luck bent... a very unique game with a clever and spare design. I fear I may have played it out after a dozen plays, though. Time will tell. I feel like it's a better game in theory than in practice.

As far as push your luck games go, I think this one has a surprising bite to it, very  interesting.  Possibly a bit too long for what it is, but very enjoyable.

I will say that usually teaching games, the simple mechanics somehow confuse people their first round through, if people check out when it's not their turn, it's going to be much less enjoyable as well.  My enjoyment of the game increased quite a bit once I realized that some of the less obvious strategies are still viable, and when everyone gets cards that benefit on other people's turns so there's lots of table talk.

A nice little filler although a bit bland. Neither the theme nor the art interest me that much. Even the gameplay gets a bit boring after a while (though I still enjoy the push-your-luck aspect).

Bought after reading a preview in Spielbox and seeing Qwertymartin liked it too.

It's a simple engine-building game with a push-your-luck element. You deal out cards showing crew and ships one-at-a-time. Reveal two ships of the same colour and you lose your turn. Stop before then and you can buy a card from the lineup.

The idea is to collect ships of varying value (for money) and buy crew to get more benefit from ships and expeditions. For example, some crew allow you to chase away same-coloured ships or to get an extra money for blue/yellow/green ships. Your opponents can buy any cards left over for a small fee.

What can I say? It's meh. It's simply too short and simple for there to be interesting decisions. Anyone with an intuitive sense of probability won't push their luck too far. Anyone who has played an engine-building euro can guess which crew members are best to take. Usually, there's one decent card in a sensibly-sized line-up - either a high-value ship or an engine-building crew member. 

Many fillers rely for their interest and replayability on player interaction. Port Royal is too 'euro' for bluffing/push-your-luck/mind-reading/negotiation/take that. The only interaction is buying a card on another player's turn and, although it's possible to deliberately sabotage a line to stop an opponent getting a good card, it's rarely a good idea.

I played it once, figured I was missing something, played it twice more. Nope, still meh.

We played it with two and maybe it would be more exciting with a larger group, but I can't see how. There are so many better fillers out there - 7 Wonders, Love Letter, Lost Legacy, Can't Stop, Court of the Medici, For Sale, Fairy Tale, Coup, Greed, any of the Kosmos two-player series.

Great game that I mildy enjoyed at first and took a while to really grow on me. Enjoy it most at lower player counts. The 8 in 11 solo play variant is great. Seems pretty popular with people I introduce it to as well, hence getting so many plays.

Expansion may have breathed new life into this, will need more plays to tell.

After just one play, I can confirm this is a super elegant little game - perhaps "only" a filler but so very good at what it does. Layers just enough on top of basic press-your-luck to provide interesting decisions and variations in strategy, including awareness and attention during other players' turns without real conflict. The elegance of the deck of cards doubling as currency further lubricates the very smooth gameplay. I think this is going to be a huge gateway hit For friends that I can bring to the table with all kinds of people. Bravo!

This is a nifty little push-your-luck/engine building/card drafting game that takes about 2 minutes to teach, but is engaging enough for multiple plays. I wish I had more to say but there really isn't a whole lot to it. Flip cards until you see one you want, but flip two ships of the same color and you go bust and get nothing. Buy cards to either make extra money, score victory points or protect you from busting. Wash, Rinse, Repeat.

It is fun though, regardless of that terrible elevator pitch I just gave.

This is a great game in a small box. I like the push your luck aspect when trying to build you tableau but the best part is how you play off of other players turns. This game probably gets the most play at our house right now but I think the best games I have had are with higher player counts.

This should be faster than it is, but it's a push-your-luck game where you can keep drawing cards and earning money, but you run the risk of drawing two ships of the same color and "busting". If you can teach this well (I certainly didn't) then I think this would be a nice fast filler game, but it could be a longer game (and not overstay it's welcome) with new players or family. I recommend picking this one up.

Press-your-luck pirate themed card drafting race using multi-use cards to buy set collections while building your tableau.

1/6/'17: Played two 5p games. A lot of fun and laughs as well as a solid game - there seem to be different ways of winning and I enjoy the choices that come up on both your turn and other players' turns. Elegant design.
'18/01/05: Played a number of solo games using the co-op mode from Ein Auftrag Geht Noch!  I have reworked this a bit to make it bit more meaty - I don't think I will play it as a co-op ever but would always want to add the contracts in because they create some short term goals for players and other options for scoring. Really love this design.

A fun, quick, and light, push your luck game. The game is a filler game that plays in about 30 minutes if everyone is paying attention. The push you luck aspect of the game makes it feel a little like blackjack especially if you go bust. The trading phase and the powers on purchased cards keeps all players involved during another player's turn. The powers on the cards add an element of engine building . The cards became the means to acquire more money to buy cards and victory points. The symbols on the cards require some initial rules referencing, but once you learn the game they become quite intuitive.

A single-deck card game, players reveal cards from the deck then choose one to add to their tableau. Different characters give you different abilities to use during the game, and ships give money for you to spend.

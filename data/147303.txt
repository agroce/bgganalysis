Like that you can take back meeples now, the fruits and that you don't need to do VP accounting any more.

Woudl prefer this clearly to basic Carcassoone (with maybe first expansion).

On the other hand it is a less deep than Hunters&gatherers and features less variety compared to standard Carcassonne with several expansions.

So basically this is a little better than the original, but very vanilla as long as there's no expansions to it.

RATING: 8
An alternate but equally slick incarnation of the basic Carcassonne premise. Only the scoring really differs but it opens up a completely different series of strategic and tactical decisions, with no added complexity. Lovely components too. Great stuff.

RATING: 8
played 14+ times, 2,3,4,5 players.

LIKE: Fun, light game. One of my "go-to" games: great for two players, great for five, great for beginners. I like the pace and tactile collecting of wares. Easy to teach. Easy to count scores at the end. 

DISLIKE: Experienced players know which tiles are rarer than others, which gives advantage.

OVERALL: One of my earliest, favorite games that got me into the hobby, and one I've shared with so many people. The colorful tiles beats the drab castle version.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Better than the standard Carcassonne, but not substantially different either. I enjoy the pastel components (although not a fan at all of slightly larger components being used as 3 value), scoring tiles that add to contention, and lovely colorful theming. It feels like more opportunity to position your tiles, but those used to (and fans of) the original will feel right at home. Good game.

RATING: 5
This is a very disappointing take on Carcassonne. Initially I was rather excited about gathering resources instead of scoring landscape but after a few rounds I saw the problems in the game. 

Delivering goods to randomly picked ships just adds a second layer of randomness to the game. While the original has just the right amount of luck in the landscape tile draw, now you have to be doubly lucky to have the right ships waiting at the harbour at the time when you draw the correct landscape. 

The game is not broken and is actually tolerable but in my opinion it felt less competitive and more random that I would have liked. Moreover, removal of the field scoring strips the game of all longer term elements reducing the whole exercise to a rush for instant profit.

Some nice twists on the tried-and-true formula, but not quite enough to make me born-again.  I like the limited meeples, the fishing, and the collection/purchasing mechanics.  But there were many useless turns, probably due to so few meeples giving fewer placement options.

гораздо живее, чем базовый "Каркассон". 
теперь по ходу игры нужно не просто получать очки, а копить ресурсы, которые уже потом можно грузить на корабли за очки. мипла всего четыре, зато их можно при желании снимать с поля (да и вообще, всё рассчитано на куда более быстрый цикл "поставил мипла-сгрёб ресурсы"). решена проблема крестьянских полей (базовый "Каркассон", как известно, очень быстро превращается в изнуряющий fields murderfest): здесь роль полей играют моря, и их можно досрочно закрывать рыбацкими лодками (причём, лодка "съедает" только часть рыбы с моря). 
в общем, по всем фронтам куда более живая и атмосферная игра, разве что аукцион кораблей, на которые нужно грузить ресурсы, бывает, даёт жирный бонус, если следующим приходит правильный корабль. ну, точно так же, как с тайлами. 
в целом, на мой взгляд, "Южные моря" можно уверенно рекомендовать вместо базового "Каркассона" (без дополнений).

RATING: 8.5
A solid winner in the Carcassonne family. This game is a very good example of how to expand a franchise, i.e. make a new game that uses the same mechanics, but somehow feels like a very different game. The addition of wares, boats and especially the fish scoring are both refreshing and interesting, and make South Seas more strategic and thematic than the base game. Also, its art and overall look are a big plus.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Most of my regular gaming group owns the original Carcassonne plus numerous expansions for it so I didn't see the need for me to buy it also.  But I do like the game and so when South Seas was released I decided to pick up a copy of that instead and I'm glad I did.

Carcassonne is a great gateway game and South Seas continues this trend with a different scoring mechanic that is simple to grasp. I like the hidden scoring aspect of it and the art style of the game is really nicely done.

This Carcassonne is a different bird from all the rest as you collect resources in order to load ships to receive points. For us it is just a bit fiddly with the placement of the meeples and the gathering of the resources. Especially the fish where you collect for everything in the water connected to where your meeple is then you place a small token to show that area is exhausted. It is fun but if we could only keep one it would be standard Carcassonne (or at least the Winter Edition we own).

It is a nice change to the basic Carcassonne.  It is really different, but keeping the essece.  Visually atractive.  I think it introduces a bit more luck-factor.  Not sure if it is better or not than the original one, but at least is a refreshing way of playing the classic.

RATING: 8
I've just finished a 4-player game. Be aware: I'm a fan of a regular Carcassonne, because it's a nice family game.

This one is also a family game, meaning that luck of a draw still plays a considerable part, however now you can withdraw meeples from the board (instead of placing one) if you feel that you won't finish a particular region. Anyhow, the board looks gorgeous, jungle islands, seas and connecting bridges are so vivid and colorful that they will definitely appeal to families. Looks better than regular Carcassonne imo. What is more, it has no regular scoring, but a set collection - a set of goods is traded for a ship tile, the more goods it requires the more points it gives you at the end of the game. You gain goods from finishing off "your" bridges, islands and sea regions. This aspect works great, because now roads (bridges) are equally important to castles (islands), as sets you need to collect consist of various goods. 

Overall a very good family game, lasts 30-40 minutes, looks beautiful when laid out on the table, easy to explain even to newbies and provides light-hearted fun.

The scoring system is very unique and pretty fun for us where not only you get the harvest the resources (which are very pretty and not the usual cubes that are dished out in most games), you have to exchange them for points subsequently to score.

If I was introducing new players to Carcassonne, who hadn't played before and were unlikely to pursue it themselves, this is the version I would play with them. Simplified scoring rules, attractive art and components (fish, clam and banana meeples!) and a single place for VPs to come from (ships).

RATING: 6.5
It's Carcassonne, Jim but not as we know it. Takes the basic Carc premise but fiddlies it up with 3 currencies to collect instead of points, which you then buy boats with. And it eases off some of the stricter rules (you only have 4 meeples but you can take them off if they are trapped).

As the points for boats repay getting a mixture of currencies (bananas from islands, shells from roads, fish from sea/farms) you are sometimes hoping to get one specific feature which then doesn't turn up on the tiles you draw.

So, Carc with softer rules and more luck. Way to win my heart, not! Give me normal Carc over this any day of the week.

As a longtime fan of Carcassonne, I initially paid no attention to the variants that were being released. Then I received South Seas as a gift.

I'm so glad I did, I like this better than the original. It has the same Carcassonne tile laying game, building connections of certain types, but this time you generate resources through doing so and can cash them in for points during the game.

Would rather play this than the original any day.

This is decent alternate Carcassonne.  I do like that it includes a Cloister type tile, which is somthing my current Carc faves (Hunters & Gatherers and Castle) do not.
The tiles look great, and collection of the resources as wooden bits is a nice change.  I especially like the fishing mechanism where the seas become depleted.  

However, overall, I don't enjoy it quite as much as H&G.  The filling of ship orders was not an interesting as I had hoped, and more or less just felt like an extra step to get your score.

South Seas is a Carcassonne variant that is pretty close to the original but changes the scoring to create a much more tactical experience. It is possible to retrieve meeples from the board again, and completing features only scores resources which in turn need to be converted to points by delivering to ships. There is a limited selection of ships available at any time so having the right mix of resources at the right time becomes fairly important, and it's also not really feasible to monopolise a single type of feature since each only produces a single type of resource and you typically need more than that for your deliveries.

In short: More tactical, less strategic, yet undeniably Carcassonne, and probably not really necessary if you already have another Carcassonne game.

I haven't played a Carcassonne game in years because I have generally disliked them, and been terrible at them to boot. This one is more enjoyable since it doesn't have the confusing farmers that are hard to figure out how they will play out. The fishermen, which are similar, trigger more often and are easier to understand. Overall, a nice new version and I've enjoyed my plays of it.

Carcassonne: South Seas has much in common with the original Carcassonne, a game that my husband and I enjoy with 2 players. In this new version, we found a lot to like: cheerful, brightly colored components; the rule that allows players to take Islanders (meeples) back into their stock without completing a feature; and an extra layer of strategy in filling orders for ships. 

We played our first game according to the written rules, but the second game with the variant of choosing from a hand of three tiles. I was skeptical of the variant when I first read about it on BGG. We are both prone to AP, and I thought that having more choices would cause us to take longer turns. However, it actually sped up the game, perhaps because we stopped feeling that every tile placement had to be optimal. From now on, we will probably play every Carc version with this variant.

Overall, we think that Carcassonne: South Seas is very good. It might not have all the variety of the original with its myriad expansions, but in a medium sized box, we found much to entertain us.

This is a nice addition. It seems to solve the farmer problem in the base game (the expansions alleviate the farmer problem a little.)

It has a similar feel to Stone Age in the purchase of the tiles for victory points.  Add the tile laying of Carcassonne and it's a win.

A very fun alternate version of Carcassonne which focuses on gaining different resources which can be used to buy points instead of gaining points directly from each type of tile. The need to collect all different types of resources to gain points (and the very different distribution of tiles in comparison to the original) really turns the game the game on its head. Instead of playing long term strategy, the key here is to know exactly when to pull your people off the board and when not to. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The scoring method, based on getting and shipping goods, distinguishes this from other "Carcassonne" games, but it also makes it more random. Having unfinished features or not being able to ship your goods at the end of the game can be very punishing. Also, the artwork is not very functional, with some goods being hard to see at first glance.

RATING: 7
South seas is easily my least favorite base version of Carcassonne.  That being said, the theme is a welcome change from most of these versions.  I almost rated it a 6 because I only want to play it when I am in the mood, but I have to rate it a little higher because the theme is beautiful and playing it feels nice.

Carcassonne a világ körül
Az alapjátékot és egyes kiegészítőit már jól ismerem, azonban ez az első olyan játék, amely az alapokat felhasználva önálló darabként kipróbálásra került általam.
Itt is lapkákat pakolsz le, majd eldöntheted, hogy „meeple”-jeidet (itt „szigetlakók”) hogyan fogod munkára (illetve itt újdonságként lehelyezés helyett fel is veheted egy már korában letett munkásodat, mivel összesen 4 bábuval tudsz gazdálkodni a játék során).
Extraként jelentkezik, hogy itt a klasszikus lovag-rabló-földműves munkásvariációk helyett a szigetlakóiddal árucikkeket gyűjthetsz (halacskát, kagylót és banánt), majd azokat a beérkező „fehér arcoknak” próbálod eladni és így pontokat begyűjteni. Valamint kereskedőddel, akár hajólapkát is meg tudsz szerezni. Ha elment az összes hajó vagy nincs több lapka, amit le tudnál helyezni, a játék véget ért is megszámoljuk pontjainkat.
Az „ős” egyik kedvencünk, alapmű a maga nemében. Talán a nagy elvárások miatt összességében nem ütötte meg nálam az „élmény” színvonalat. Jó-jó, de valahogy ez sem az én világom.
Plusz felmerül bennem a kérdés, hogy meddig lehet még „bőrt nyúzni” a Carcassonne névről. Gondolom ameddig kereslet van rá és az egyelőre van. Ha választanom kellene, akkor én megelégszem az alapjátékommal és kiegészítőivel és legalább nem kell pénzt költenem ezekre az önálló darabokra.

Although this scores very differently than the regular game, we really enjoyed gathering the bananas, shells, and fish in order to score points.  It still has the tile-laying that we love.  I know South Seas doesn't get a lot of love, but we really like it.

Quite nice Carcassonne iteration with different scoring via collecting resources to cash in for ships (points).

Features tend to be completed more quickly. Less emphasis on mega-cities and long, winding roads. Fishing is the only part which might need a bit of explaining.

Looks v. nice. I wouldn't choose this over regular Carcassonne (with an expansion or two) but nice for some variation.

I have to admit that I think the original Carcassonne is a much better game.  The addition of the resources seemed like a nice idea at first, but actually all it serves to do is create a meaningless extra step between removing your meeples and scoring points - there just isn't enough strategy in placing the resources to make it a worthwhile addition to the game mechanic.

Still, at the end of the day the basic mechanics are unchanged so the game is still fun - but I'd go out and buy the original if I were you.

On the surface, this seems simply like Carcassonne with different scoring. However, the more we play it, the more I realize that we don't play it in the same way we do the original. That is, our tile-laying tactics are completely different in this one. For example, we tend not to go for huge structures ever. It feels slightly less obvious how best to play each tile in this one, which I quite like because it's a bit more thought-provoking in that regard.  It's true that the ship tiles add in an extra element of luck but it hasn't really upset any of our games yet.

Personally, I like it at least as much as Hunters and Gatherers.

This is a really nice revamp of the classic carcassonne.

I love the secondary scoring, adding a race and set-collection mechanic, as you struggle to gain the exact ressources needed to send a boat.

I also really like the new fishing rules, that replaces farms. The way you score the fish with a fishing boat, and leaves the fishing area slightly less good, is really cool.

The meeples for bananas, shells and fish add a really nice tactile element to the scoring.

And it's fast. Instead of just complicating, and lenghthening the game with additions, this game is new and fresh and lean.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Gorgeous version of Carcassonne with some pretty interesting rules. I like collecting the pieces, but the extra level of randomness with the boats can throw you. If you just never pull a tile with a boat guy, you're never going to be able to get fish to buy tiles. There are some that need wilds, but eh. 

Probably a shift in the lighter direction for Carcassonne. I prefer other versions, but this one is still plenty of fun.

This is a nice reimplementation of the Carcassonne game. If anything, it simplifies the original concept. Instead of having to track and count scoring, you get resources for your roads (bridges), cities (islands), and farms (seas), and then you trade those resources in for score tiles. Seas/farms are much easier, too, you just count fish. Really straightforward and easy to explain.

Update: I'm lowering my rating of this from a 7 to a 6, just to better reflect how often I want to play it.

Carcassonne: South Seas is another of many games which take the basics of Carcassonne and tweak them ever so much.  The tweak here is collecting resources to be used to gain points.  I enjoy not only the art, but the flow of play.  The only thing that some may not like is that there is more hidden scoring than in other versions of the game.  You're generally not going to have much of an idea of where your opponents are in way of points which may change how players place their tiles.  All things considered, I really like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I like the extra strategy of having to combine certain currencies.  I also like the fish mechanism, and how you eventually "harvest" out all the fish.

I've heard some say South Seas is more intuitive to learn than base Carc.  I'd disagree - I don't think fish are necessarily easier to figure out than farmers (due to the harvesting feature and figuring out how they get periodically resolved), and the points are one level-removed from finishing a structure in South Seas, which is less intuitive than finish-structure-get-points in the base.

However, I do think it's less confrontational than base Carc and H&G.  In South Seas, since you can "take back" any of your meeples at any time, it discourages confrontational "strand-the-meeple" type play.  This aspect makes it better for less cut-throat gamers.

As Carcassonne is such a great game, this one was an easy pick.

At its mechanical heart it's still Carcassonne but the scoring is totally revamped and now a subgame with resources itself. It's less mean due to intermediate sea (i.e. fields) scoring and allows to take back placed meeples if one meeple is hopelessly stuck. Also, incomplete structures are scored at game end. This can be a plus for conflict averse players who complain when they get joined in their castle or fields. The luck factor is quite a bit higher due to the lack of these two important exploits for experienced players (field scoring / blocking meeples) and the random ship draw. A nice diversion worth buying for Carcassonne fans.

RATING: 4
Sadly, the extra step didn't lead to more strategy required.  Instead it made two possibilities for luck to determine the outcome instead of one (drawing the tile you have to place AND the tiles drawn for you to purchase).  The double luck made it significantly less strategic and definitely not better than Carcassonne for us.

As much as I like the original Carcassonne, South Seas just doesn't seem to click for me. The new mechanics introduced to the game made the game clunkier and somewhat less fun than the original.

This is the most different Carcassonne since New World. The collecting of wares and filling ships still takes place around the new tried and tested tile laying mechanics, but it does add a fresh edge.

An updated take on the Carcassonne style games. It's a tile laying game just like it's namesake but I feel it should probably have a name all its own.

It's a nice take on Carcassonne. The introduction of trade goods to the game allows players to consider tile placement differently than the original. However, the learning curve and ease of play is the same as the classic vanilla Carcassonne making South Seas a good new flavour of the game. If you already own Carcassonne this might be a lateral move but it's still fun.

Did we need yet another Carcassonne? I sure didn't, but I must admit, this version is quite attractive. It's simple, adds another layer for scoring points (first collect goods and use them to buy boats that score points) so that it feels like a "real euro", and it's also visually appealing. 

Because, lets be honest about it, the colors of the original [thing=822][/thing], look so depressing (dirty green and shitty brown), that you really need to play South Seas with its [thing=144415][/thing] blue, once in a while, to recover from your depression.

Adds in resource collection with different scoring.  There is also a little more luck than your standard Carcassonne since the boats come up randomly.  An even better intro Carc game than the original or H&G since farming/hunting is simplified by fishing.  May not have longevity without expansions, though.

The kids call the original Carcassonne the river game. We played that without the farmers and have only just started to introduce them. I like the game so got this south seas variant to play with them. We know that shiny and bright and newer is better right?

The fish scoring and collection is much easier to explain to young kids than farmers in the original game. The tactile nature of the banana's and shells are also great. I did notice I would be able to use the banana's in Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island but I had already got the tokens pack from Portal games for that (Even though the banana's here are nicer (if you are into that sort of thing!)).

Overall a good reimplementation of Carcassonne. But kids are beasts from the stubborn plain ... they still insist on playing the river game. It doesn't matter what I thought would be shiny and nice. So now I have got them playing the river game with the goods from traders and builders. All is well again.

This game is a keeper for now but the shadow of the trade pile will soon darken those South Seas and the farmers of the river land will eventually raise their pitchforks in relieved glee.

Fun reworking of a classic, you only get four meeple, but they can be recalled. You score no points for completing things, instead gain resources which are then traded in for ships which in turn give you points. It is a good stand-alone game but feels very short if you are used to playing regular Carcassonne with expansions.

Played with 6p which is definitely unwise. It gave us far too few turns to collect the resources we needed to score any points (my score was, in fact, zero). I'd certainly try it again with fewer players, but I prefer the traditional Carcassonne point scoring over the in-between currency.

It's still Carcassonne, so it's still fun. I just wasn't a fan of the subtle changes here. They ditched the score track in favor of turning in resources for points, which is fine, but I don't like that scores are hidden until the end. I'm not a fan of this in most games, and that is also the case here. I do like that the "farms" are easier to explain, although I found putting out boat tokens a little fiddly for my tastes. Apart from these two issues, this version of Carc is fine. I just don't know that I'd choose it over the original.

Don't believe the reviews which say that this is more random than base Carcassonne because of the scoring via the ships, I think the reviewers haven't played it often enough. Quite the opposite, it is much more strategic. Yes, drawing the ships is random, but you can plan for this. The ships where you need 3 different types of resources have the best goods-point ratio so it pays off to place tiles in a way which give you a variety of goods, not just the most. At the same time the resource tokens make it a much more tactile and thematic version, what's not to like about wooden bananas, shells and fish. Much more fun than just gaining points. The fish are a better design choice than farms, no huge swings because you stole someone's mega-farm by lucky placement, and depleting the fish stocks also makes thematic sense. And the end-game scoring (if everyone hides their scored ships) keeps everyone invested until the end, not like the base game where you can fall behind so far you stop caring. For me, this is hands down the best version, smarter, cleaner, prettier, quicker and less random than the base game.

Quite an innovative approach to the franchise. Instead of giving points for completed structures, gives resourceeples which are then used for filling tickets. This has two interesting consequences: Different structures are of roughly equal value, and "fields" are scored during the game like every other structure.

Tile distribution is different from the original Carcassonne.

[b]Carcassonne: South Seas[/b] was traded away in a math trade 11/10/14. (Received Ra)
Received in a trade 4/30/14.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]South Seas was fun, specifically I liked how you traded goods for ships (which are your points) and the fishing mechanism. However; the theme/art wasn't my cup of tea and really detracted from the experience for me. I also didn't care for the tile distribution, there never seemed to be enough jungle tiles. 

Now that I own Carcassonne: Gold Rush (the 2nd game in the Around the World series) I am content not having South Seas in my collection any longer. I prefer the theme and new game play variations found in Gold Rush more than those found in South Seas.

At this point I am interested in trying Carcassonne: H&G which seems to offer a nice variation in game play from the base game and Gold Rush. I don't miss having South Seas in my collection, but if the theme appeals to you I think it offers solid, new mechanisms to the Carcassonne formula.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Quick playtime (a 2p game takes about 25 minutes).
- Scoring: You are collecting resources [i](seashells, fish and bananas)[/i] which you trade in for ship tiles (which have values from 2 to 6 points). There is no need for a clunky scoring track.
- The artwork is excellent and it includes nice wooden seashells, bananas and fish.

This is the third version of Carcassonne I have owned [i](I have the Winter version and traded away the original with Inns and Cathedrals) [/i] and I would consider it the easiest to teach new players. I find the scoring to be much more clear cut since there are no farmers and the fishermen (which replaced farmers) are easier to score.[/i]

Not just a tropical reskin. Instead of scoring points directly the players collect bananas, shells and fish and use them at the end of each turn to buy one of four ship tile that rewards points. Players have to juggle tasks with only four followers but are allowed to reclaim a follower instead of placing one. Graphically, the tiles are bright and colourful and the game has a silly but fun feel to it as you find yourself fretting over bananas.

Reminiscent of Carc:H&G with all the icons on the tiles, but when you "score" them, you take resource cubes instead. At the end of your turn, if you have resource cubes that match one of the 4 open contracts (eg trade in 2 bananas and a fish to get 2 points), then you can trade them in and score what are the real points in this game. You're only playing with 4 meeples which encourages you to not build mega cities, er, islands. Other than, it's exactly the same game but with scoring one step removed. The lack of big built-up areas and little competition for farms, er seas, lessens the game, making it a less tense, lighter affair; one of scoring when you can and hoping the contracts that are available on your turn match what you've got and give a decent payoff. If not, save 'em up and convert later. Family fare.

Although the game play is obviously quite similar to Carcassonne, I like this one better. The sunny islands are vastly more appealing than castles for me.

I have been on a Carcassonne spree recently and picking up all of the different titles in the math trades. I have enjoyed the different games for sure. This was different in that you do not collect points as you normally would in the game. You are collecting resources in order to complete the common order cards on display. You can only ever complete 1 per round. I actually liked it and found it vibrant. I don't think it necessarily stand out among all of the Carc titles so I have it up for trade. Definitely worth playing and one I would gladly play again.

This game is beautiful, has cute resource meeples and the rules for the game have a number of innovative and clever reforms, such as the way fields can be scored multiple times but for a slightly depleted value and the way you don't score points for completed features, rather you get resources which you spend on delivery tiles.

My one complaint is that there are larger versions of the resource meeples that represent three of that type, but they're not quite large enough to set it apart from the regular size.

My very favorite version of Carcassonne!
 The theme is fun and laid back, the scoring is faster & easier, I like the trading commodities for points (ships) mechanic.
 However, there are a few things that bug me about the game design. I wish the "wooden bridges" were depicted as reefs (collecting shells from reefs makes since). I wish the little fishing boats were dugout outrigger canoes. And I wish the european style ships were double hulled native trading canoes. The idea that you have to make your islanders work to gather commodities to sell to the europeans in order to win is just wrong.

This is Carcassonne with a layered market.  It's exactly the same, but you get resources from regions instead of points and must turn those resources into points.  I like the extra layer.  Most importantly to me, there are no swingy farmers!

However, the rulebook is problematic.  It reads smoothly, but has several very critical ambiguities.  For such a  simple game with an experienced company behind it, this is just sloppy.

My personal favourite version of Carcassonne. The tiles are prettier than in the standard version, and the fact that you get fish, shells and bananas which you trade to ships for points (as opposed to just getting points directly, as in original Carcassonne) makes it feel a little bit more engaging to me. It also does away with the irksome and unwieldy scoring method for fields, replacing it with more intuitive fishing.

Best variant of Carcassonne I have played. You gain resources instead of points when completing bridges(roads), islands(citys), sea zones(fields) and markets(can't remember).You use those resources to buy ships which are worth points.

This was a pleasant enough variant on the basic Carcassonne engine.  It's been a [i]really[/i] long time since I've played base Carcassonne without any expansion rules or tiles.

Got in some South Seas action! This one really has a different feel than standard Carcassonne or even the other stand alones. No scoring track or feature scoring, instead you collect various resources (fish, bananas or seashells) by closing features to supply trade ship orders to earn victory points. My wife won our first match, but we didn't have time to sneak in a second play before my work. She said she was Carc-blocked tonight! Will be sure to get this one to the table again soon.

I mean, really, how many variants of Carc do we need? Apparently one more!

This time, the South Seas version comes tarted up in bright colours and Skittles-coloyred seas-themed wooden bits.

This version gives up the elegance of the original for a more tactical version. Players are trying to score points by triggering banana (castle), fish (farm), village (cloister) and boardwalk (road) scoring. Each icon gives you a corresponding wooden bit.

This is used to buy VP tokens. Game ends when either the tiles or VP tokens run out. Each remaining resource collected can be converted into VPs at a rate of 2 for 1 VP.

Clips along nicely and it's pretty to look at. It's a clever, satisfying variant of a modern classic.

RATING: 6
This is a good twist to the basic "Carcassonne" game.  Rather than directly earning points with meeple placement, players instead collect sets of resources and turn those in for points.  It works, it's interesting, and it's different.  I would probably still recommend basic "Carcassonne" for people new to designer/hobby games.  It's still tile placement, so if visual-spacial play is a problem for somebody, then this game won't do anything to help with that.

Rating in flux here, and will need to play a couple of more times before I can really firm it up, as we didn't play it quite right. I think the theme is nicely done here, as I actually felt like we had fishermen out there collecting the fish. I enjoyed collecting the various types of bits and trading them in for victory point tiles adds a nice something extra. In fact, it can alter your strategy a bit as to where you go, which makes this game interesting and fun to play. We did allow the fishermen to always stay on the board, and that made them a bit too powerful. However, I'd like to house rule the option to always be able to remove a meeple from the board, as I think that means your turns can always be productive.

A standalone game that is a variant of Carcassonne, and quite close to the original game, but not the same.  The setting is South Seas islands joined by bridges rather than cities, farms and roads etc, but the overall gameplay is very like the original.  Difference include gaining bananas, shells and fish as point mechanisms, and trading combinations of them for ships (both of which I like).  On the other hand, I think there are proportionately too many bridges and boats, and not enough fish, on the board tiles, and a few modified game mechanics that don't grab me.  An enjoyable enough game, but to my mind not as enjoyable as the original Carc.

It's still Carcassonne, but with some very nice changes:
- tiles show land, water, and piers; water may have fish icons
- when you play a tile, you may place or remove a meeple
- scoring occurs when you complete some features, or when you remove meeple (1 / fish in sea area; cover a fish icon with a marker)
- some features reward you a market token; you can also buy one of these from the face up display (of 3) by paying the requisite costs in resources
At the end of the game, score VP for all those tiles purchased. Highest sum wins!

Very enjoyable variant where the random market display makes the game less cutthroat and calculational.

This is a family weight area control and tile laying game. I prefer this to regular Carcassonne as the placement of meeples earns you resources, which you can then fulfill contracts with. I find it adds another layer than just straight points like in base Carcassonne. Overall though, I prefer other family weight games more than this one. It just doesn't seem as impressive as Ticket to Ride for a person new to the hobby, in my opinion.

I just love Carcassonne and I was really curious to try this variant, the aspect of collecting goods sounded intriguing. And it does play fresh and different enough to be a real alternative to the original. When you have to collect goods which you then trade for ships which give you the points, it changes the regular Carcassonne strategy up a bit. You are more pushed to finish things quickly and therefor more likely to build smaller islands etc., you have only 4 meeples to place (though you can get them back by not doing anything) which plays into that. Meddling with your opponent I do find less beneficial, too, so it plays less confrontational. Naturally, it still has the nice puzzly feature when laying the tiles but it loses a bit of its charm for me when you try to close things asap to get the goods for trading. So, personally I do prefer the original or Hunters & Gatherers but I do enjoy this one.

Just Ok to play... Gathering resources for the buying of ships a different mechanic for a Carcassonne game, 
but there are other games with a similar mechanic which I would rather play. Or other versions of Carcassonne.

Less strategic and more tactical.
With only 4 meeples, you can forget building big island. Even the market are a think twice.

[HiG 13 Edition] {Sea; tile-laying, set-collection; optimal p} This is another interesting twist of basic Carcassonne.  The scoring of this may be less visible than other Carcassonne games, because scores are quite hidden (unless you remember all) during the game.  And, scores are in average lowest in all Carcassonne games (you don't need the 50/100 markers anymore).

Similar to all other Carcassonne in around the world series, players only have 4 meeples at their disposal.

Now, when one completed a feature, one is not rewarded with scores but wares (banana, shells, and fishes).  Players then use the collected wares to deliver to a ship and got score.

I love the meeples of this game.  Luckily, Carcassonne become so popular; otherwise, manufacturer won't have luxury to produce this kind of meeples.  The component mix may be the most complicated in Carcassonne: ship tokens, fishing boat tokens, ware tokens, and special Islanders (which newly shaped meeples).

+++ Delivery to ship

= Bridge => Road
= Island => Castle

A great Carcassonne standalone game that shifts scoring a bit and adds in some interesting game play.  This gives you the feel of Carcassonne, but other than tile-laying it has its own unfolding of the game.

RATING: 8
I'm starting this as an 8, but it may go up.  Boy does this shake up Carc!  I really liked it and felt it was a very different game.  I do like that you can take back meeples if you want/need to.  I think this game rewards much more short-term scoring so it's a lot more tactical than the base game, but time will tell if that's accurate.

It's definitely different enough to justify owning both this and the base game.  

Not sure I'd use this to teach new players though.  I think the collecting wares is tougher to manage than just getting points.  The fishermen are easier to teach than farmers, but otherwise it's a bit more obtuse.  Still, a great addition to the Carc family.  I'm looking forward to more of these in the series.

RATING: 7.2
In my eyes, the classic status of [thing=822][/thing] is deserved. And most of the variants I've played are worth playing, though most of them are not different enough to warrant owning all of them.
This version is pretty much the same as the original with different art and a detour for the victory points. In stead of scoring for completing anything, you gain resources, which you can exchange for boats, which are worth points of course. This change also changes the way you play the game. For most boats you need a combination of different resources. And you get different types of resources by scoring the different elements of the game. Which means you can't focus on doing just 'fields' or 'cities', you'll have to do a mix.
This is a fine variant and if you don't own any Carcassonne game and want one, this is a good candidate. After only one game though, I can't say if it is better or worse than the original, especially since it's been years since I've played that.

Initial rating: 7.2

I like it when the theme of a game reminds me of beach and palm trees. :)

It's a lighter version of Carcassonne.
It's a bit too simple for my taste, but still enjoyable.

There are too many footbridges for the landscape to look good!?
The artwork is a bit flawed, the footbridges sometimes don't match from one tile to another.

Another Carcassonne clone. Has some interesting new mechanics added on top of the familiar game, and is not a bad game by any means, but this isn't enought to bring it to par with the original, let alone surpassing it.

Still waiting for the definitive Carcassonne remake.

This is a great update to a classic game. I never owned a copy of the original because there was always someone else to play. This game adds a Puero Rico-type aspect where you're collecting resources and don't score until you ship. I think this one games covers the itch for both those games.

RATING: 7
Yes, [thing=147303][/thing] it is mainly [thing=822][/thing] but with a major twist: the scoring. And this changes most of the the game dynamics.

The game works with players trying to complete features of the game using tiles: islands, footbridges and seas, in order to get, respectively, bananas, shells and fishes. Players will then use these resources to fulfil the demands of traders. Each time the player attends a ship, she gets the ship token. Ship tokens are worth from 2 to 6 points, depending in the quantity, diversity and difficulty to fulfil the demand of it.

Make islands and footbridges are mostly like complete a city and a road in [thing=822][/thing], and in both cases the player, once the feature is complete, will receive the amount of resources equal to the icons on the tiles used. To get fish, is a little different, as you don't need to close a body of water in order to claim the fish - no, the player just have to put a meeple in the water (fishing), and, afterwards, once a tile with a fishing icon is put in a connected sea space with the fisherman, it will trigger the fishing, so she will take a number of fishes equal to the fish icons connected with her fisherman, and one of the icons will be covered, as it will be hard to fish there in the future - but, as the sea is open, other players will be able to put a meeple in the same sea space once the meeple of the other is removed.

Finally, the last change isn't a major one: the are market tiles, that work similarly to the abbey, as it will only trigger once it is surrounded by tiles. When this happen, the player owning the market, will take the ship token that is worth the most of those open, without needing to fulfil the demand.

Each turn the player can only sell to one ship. At the end of the game, for every three resources the players have will be worth 1 point. Whoever has the most points in the end, wins.

As I mentioned, changing the way scoring works, makes the whole play of [thing=147303][/thing] feel at the same time, similar and really different. The montage is mostly the same, but there is a much bigger timming issue, as everyone wants to attend to the ships that are worth the most, and the lack of a single shell can prevent a player from doing this. So, though usually is best to take as much as possible, in [thing=147303][/thing] it is possible that a fast action, like completing a small footbridge for 1 shell, can be worth more than put a fisherman in the sea to gather 3 fishes later on.

The [b]now[/b] is much more present in [thing=147303][/thing]. Sure, it is still good to invest in some big islands or huge sea with lots of fishes. But, remember, you can only sell to one ship each turn. Therefore, having loads of resources, won't allow you to sell to several ships in a single turn. Constantly taking resources and fulfilling, can not only work as well, as might be even better, if done properly.

Still, there is a caveat: [thing=147303][/thing] adds more luck to the mix. [thing=822][/thing] isn't a stranger to luck, with the blind draw of tiles - some players will just get better ones to that they are trying to do. In [thing=147303][/thing] not only there is the luck of the draw, it has is twice, with the luck of the draw of the ship tokens. For instance, in my last turn, I had 2 fishes and 3 bananas, usually good to attend at least a weak ship, but there wasn't a single one I could sell my resources to. 

Anyway, [thing=147303][/thing] makes for a interesting twist in the [thing=822][/thing] mechanics without really stripping out the heart of the game or making it unfamiliar. I can't say I liked it more than [thing=822][/thing], but it is up there, as it keeps the easy to play and huge replay value of its forefather.

This is a good version of Carcassonne where fishing replaces farming. Points are earnt by collecting resources and shipping them off by boat, a bit like Puerto Rico. For some reason it's easier to explain this game than the farmer rule in base Carcassonne, so that makes it a better game for me.

Really wanted to love this version.  Love the artwork, colors, and wooden bits.  And loved the resource conversion to points that's completely new in this version of Carc.  The problem is the luck.  This is easily the least strategic version of Carc I've ever played.  The biggest issue is the sequence of ships and how, just by happenstance, you can benefit or be screwed by the order in which they appear.  One of the games I played I had the first access to every single 5 and 6 point tile.  I almost doubled my opponent's score.

I suppose this is a step up from Kids of Carcassonne.  So I'd recommend it for families.  But beyond that, I have to give it a thumbs down.

Perfect length, easy to teach, reasonable amount of tactical consideration. This is one of the better gateway games.

I think the aesthetics and the focus on building complete areas rather than end game scoring make this a more immediate and engaging game than the original.

Like the original game, this one is very heavily relient on luck of the draw, but it also has a nice puzzle game feel to it. First you have to look for where in the board the piece would fit and after that start thinking which of these places is the most beneficial for you.

Gefällt mir inzwischen genau so gut wie das Original. Grafisch auf jeden Fall schöner und mit vielen tollen Holzfrüchten. Das tauschen der Früchte gegen die Schiffe ist ein schöner Aspekt, der es von dem Original abhebt. Es erfolgen auch viel häufiger Wertungen, was positiv haften bleibt. Zu 4 und vor allem 5 Spielern dauert alles zu lang und man kann zu wenig Siegpunkte machen. Da ist das Original im Vorteil.

I don't enjoy this game because I find that I have no good options so I just do something, to get to the end as fast as possible. 
I even played the variant where you draw two pieces and chooses one and the other one is out of the game. I still don't like it. I feel it create problems in the end when a lot of good pieces has gone out of the game and my options is just getting more and more limited all the way through.
I want more options, not just a draw and place pieces.

Much more beautiful than the regular version! I like grabbing ressources better than getting points, because it actually matters to get different resources. I also like how there is a timing aspect to when you buy the ships.

yet another good variation in the Carcassonne theme. this is quite different from the original but very interesting. you don't get points by closing elements but you get objects that you exchange for ships that represent points.

I like this a lot more than regular Carcassonne. The game feels more dynamic thanks to the new scoring method (mostly getting resources rather than points to exchange in various sets for points throughout the game). The way seas (ie fields) get scored and change ownership while dwindling in value (over-fishing) is great. And as an added bonus, collecting bananas is way funnier than just collecting points.

Although the original Carcassonne was always meant to be a light game, I feel like the mechanics in this version hit that lightness target better.

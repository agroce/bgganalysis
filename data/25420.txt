Viewed through spectacles with a thematic tint, Ur is a civ builder in which you trade, spread culture, go to war and, er, shuffle cubes around.  In truth, it is a neo-abstract with some simple, yet pretty unique mechanisms, which packs a lot of tricky decisions into a short playing time.  The use of tiles both as territory and, picked up, to determine your choice of actions is intriguing.  There is a frequent tension between choosing a tile for the best two actions or choosing one that will improve your territorial position or worsen that of an opponent.  

Production quality is decent.  while the artwork is dull but functional.  The rules are an easy read, yet fuzzy on some details.  Do download the FAQ.

August 2012:  An interesting tile and cube effects abstract of sorts wherein agriculture, culture, politics, trade and war tiles are used to enable cube placement and effects.  Better than I expected.

September 2012:  More likely a 7 of 10.

February 2013: Okay, a 6 cause I do not want to play it again.

well, since "clever" seems to be one of the most popular adjectives for this game: our clever group cleavered the fun and interest (for me at least) out of this clever tile-placer. started rules around 7:30, and wrapped up around 9:30. first game, but still. clever can only get you so far, and there's not enough game here to fill two hours. oh, and the player aids suck so badly it's almost funny...but not quite when you have to be clever enough to decipher them for two frakking hours...

i've only played online, and i thought the game was functional but abysmal.  technically competent, but not enough control for multiple players and not much game to go around.  i think it's a rare case where a face to face version might be better, just to fluff out the fact that it begins and ends so quickly.  strange.

This is a game that you need to play several times in succession to get a feel for what's going on.  Have only played with 3, it is supposed to be better with 4.  A mathematical abstract, possibly could be considered a lite version of Tigris and Euphrates.  Enjoyable, but not real memorable. I've come to the conclusion that abstracts are not for me.  Rating may go up with more plays.  Really need to try it with 4.

RATING: 8
First of all forget about the theme as it is unbelievably thin. This is a very intricate abstract game with seemingly limitless possibillities. You are trying to occupy as many tiles as you can. But not just any tiles because you need the right combinations. You also have one tile in your hand which represents two of five possible actions. After you use it you exchange it with a tile on the table thus changing the playing arena itself. Agonizing choises every turn. Beware of the badly translated rulebook and check the errata!

[bought used from someone at Bay Area Games Day]
A good little game. Very interesting. I need to play it a couple more times to get the hang of positioning my pieces correctly and taking advantage of more of the special actions more efficiently. In my first game, I did really well with the purple and managed to get a ton of cubes on the board, but I didn't do very well distributing them to places that could safely expand, and I eventually ran out of cubes and couldn't do anything for two turns. I need to long-term plan a little better. Okay, I lot better. I definitely want to play this one again.

Also, our four-player game took over 1.5 hours. Now that we know what all the actions are, etc., it should be much quicker next time.

Provisional rating - will alter with more playing. I was expecting a 'civilization-lite' game, this isn't it. Instead it is a surprisingly deep abstract, with a significant amount of player interaction once you learn the game. You have to plan at least one move ahead, and there is opportunity to hinder your opponent both by 'war' and also by taking tiles they intend to use. [Note error in rulebook - War is much more viable if you play with the correct rules]

RATING: 5
Only one play but this has more similarities to T&E then I would have believed.  Although T&E is more epic and probably has more of a war game feel, Ur has no luck, full information, and much less fiddliness.  It's also easier to teach and more obviously thematic.  I've only played it with 4, but I think it will scale well if the board size is reduced (6x6 for 4, 5x5 for 3, 4x4 for 2).

Rating based on one three-player game.  Deliciously dry, no-luck little treat of a game!  I wasn't expecting much, and was concerned after reading the rules that keeping track of each tile's powers would be confusing, but after a couple of round it all clicked.  Now that I feel like I have the game mechanics down, I'd like to play it again soon so I can pay attention to the tactics.

A curious game that takes a few games to get used to.

Original mechanism and outstanding artwork; as far as I see, the real flaws are: very steep learning curve - the game can last from 15 min to 2 hours, depending on the strategies adopted by the players - there are no hidden points, so players every turn can count the points of all players; this can bog down the game, especially towards the end

Really suffers from turn order issues and ye olde "weak player" syndrome (like Puerto Rico, etc).  If you allow someone to end the game, that person is usually going to win, because at the end of every one of your turns, it's usually enough to shoot you into the lead.  Aside from all of this, it's just boring to play.

RATING: 2
Ugh!  Just about everything I hate in a game: completely abstract and deterministic without any hidden information or surprises.  Everyone spends the entire game staring at the board in silence trying to work out their optimal move each turn based on what they think everyone else is going to do on their turn (or their next turn, or their next turn...).  Tons of analysis paralysis and second-guessing each other at the beginning of the game which migrates down to very programmed play towards the end as your choices get so limited that your best play becomes obvious.  Took forever to end with three players (though I'm not sure if 4 players would be any better) as players just keep taking and retaking the same ground.  Maybe more analytical gamers might enjoy this, but it was tedious and boring to me.  I enjoy a few abstracts (Zertz, Dvonn) but this was just painful.  Not at all my kind of game.  I need to learn to read the rules to games before I buy them!

[u]May 2009: [/u]
Just bought this on a big order as I needed a little bit more to make the promotion price. It was already on promotion and cost me only 10 euros so after (very) briefly checking what it was I bought it. 10m after, I don't remember and actually have no clue what the game is about nor how it plays, nor how long nor with how many players...

[u]September 2009:[/u] Almost made it to the table for the first time but after half of the rules explanation, we decided to play Meuterer (not good). The biggest problem I think is that the rules don't convey anything of the theme. When most euro-games don't have much theme, the rulebook is basicaly all there is to convey the atmosphere, here it basically falls short with actions like: agriculture, lose 1 cube from every tile not green and add 2 to your green tiles... Yeah, I really feel like I'm planting rice here... Anyway, I'm still waiting to try it out once, but I'm less and less confident. I might get rid of it without having tried it out...

[u]September 2010:[/u] Well, good surprise, I was really scared of this game being very very dry + the fact of it being 3-4p only means that I never really tried to get it to the table with friends.

I saw there was a 2p variant (25 tiles and 4 ziggurats) that worked so I finally decided to try it out.

Well it works, it IS dry but it does work very well. I even wonder why the 2p isn't official... I guess our territories were very soon chosen but I don't know, it surely works. We both enjoyed (not really understanding anything, just going through the motions and watching what happened really).

It seems a pretty good brain-burner (for such a short time) but don't talk to me about theme. I guess you can see your civ expanding but really, it IS dry as hell... I don't know how much I'll like it in the end but I am now a bit excited at trying it out once more.

RATING: 3
Woah this game was awful! Even though it only took about 20 minutes to play, it was extremely boring throughout those minutes. Actually, the two other players wanted to stop playing after 7-8 minutes – something I have literally never seen before as they are usually willing to try out/play every game at least once.

It wasn’t because we played a rule wrong, because the rules are quite simple. It’s just that they are very simple, meaning that I personally don’t think there are any interesting choices to make. It seemed like it was pretty important to get some agriculture tiles early on so you could spread yourself out faster; I don’t like a game which forces you to go in a specific direction from the start of the game in order to succeed (the rules even mention this). The only thing which was remotely interesting was how you select your tiles for the next turn and therefore the two options you get on your next turn (unless you forego one or more of those actions which isn’t uncommon to do). Ur is a very, very bad game which I’m unlikely to play again; I sold it after a single play, which is not usually something I do as I want to try my own games at least twice, preferably with different player counts.

RATING: 7
Highly abstracted civ game that, despite the abstractions, feels very much like the balancing act taht empire building and maintenance might entail, complete with gunboat diplomacy with neighboring nations. Scoring is based on a set collection mechanism that geometrically rewards diversity of one's civ. Action selection is constrained and requires look ahead and commitment in the prior turn. This creates a signalling of threats and highlights the limitations and constraints of your civ for your opponents to respond to. Finally, the balnace between the consumption of resources and constraint on growth versus the protetion of territory and the scoring boost of zigguerats helps to shape the very pleasing arc of this game.

Went from a 7 to an 8 after the second game. Likely to go up further. Very engaging system.

Got in trade with themilkcrate for WoN.

RATING: 5.5
So far my favourite game from 2006's Esson faire.  Clever, rather in the manner of an unfolding origami puzzle, and rather utterly delightful.  Definitely a game which takes a while to get a handle, often a couple plays, and which then sits bubbling in the corner of your mind ocassionally popping out juicy little, "But what if you did THIS and then THAT?" thought nuggets.

The initial tile setup overly determines the game pattern.  As a result the game is slightly more clever than it is actually a good game.  But, I mostly don't mind that.  Sometimes a clever toy, a very clever contrivance that specialises in being particularly clever, is just dandy.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
About 70 plays - an excellent, intriguing game with tension, plots, planning, and aggressive fun. I think there's a beauty to the design. It's quickly become one of my favorite games.

It's a tile placement puzzle plus diceless "Risk" territory clashes plus resource management plus set collection thru Triangle Number values. The way empires grow and shrink is amazing and requires care with the accordion mechanisms. Timing is a factor, as is your opponents' expansion toward you... Keep an eye on your goal, your series collections...

For the most part, the rules are straightforward, easy to absorb once explained. (I needed clarification on War and Scoring, though.) I think the natural order of learning the actions is: agricultural, commerce, politics, war, and finally culture.

As with so many games, having two actions per turn is satisfying, but often tricky to work within the constraints. You always want to do more! From its spare structure I have a feeling *not* that it's cold and abstract but that there's something rich going on here.  Thematically, I do feel a sense of rival kingdoms.

It's fun to try out different strategies. I think you can at least partially overcome the limitations of unequal setup opportunities by making use of the "single drop on any free tile" move, and the ability to try to make the terrain evolve in ways for your advantage and your rival's disadvantage. The game feels so much more crowded with 4p than 3p and may often require more aggression to fight for the right to party. 4p king-of-the-hill circumstances may necessitate more reactive strategy. Be careful - setups can go awry due to other player's responses. 4p games may not be fair and equal as you might have expected from an abstract-looking game, but you can try to make opportunities and sometimes succeed. Naturally, your wars may benefit the players who aren't involved in the conflict. 

I've played the 2-player variant listed here and I think it works very well.

I bought a copy of the game and made a wooden tile version (see pics). As others have mentioned, there's something about this game that feels like a classic. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Based on one play.  Seems like a very good game, but doesn't appeal to me.  In particular, I don't enjoy the thinking that goes into defending against possible War actions.  Also, appears to have kingmaker issues due to uses of War in the endgame.

RATING: 8
Ur is one of these rare abstract games that carry more theme and narrative than many so-called thematic games. It is a set collection, area control spatial puzzle with tiles that give you special abilities. These are sensible and interesting, and their interplay together with the tile placement (and retrieval) works wonderfully well and provides tense moments and gameplay richness beyond what is apparent at first sign. A masterful design, and a very enjoyable game, provided one likes direct conflict.

+ extremely interesting and tight ruleset
+ highly thematic
+ emergent strategies become apparent after a few plays
+ small footprint and good components
+ quick and works equally well with 2 (with a variant) to 4 players

= mostly tactical and full of nuances, although one can always draw a strategic direction via the starting placement
= highly confrontational

- the player aids are too cryptic to be useful to beginners
- the rulebook and FAQ still leave questions unanswered, so a geek dive is necessary
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game is very abstract. The comparisons with Tigris and Euphrates are a dis-service, since the gameplay has nothing in common.

I feel that there is a turn-order advantage that is not compensated for. But mostly I just don't really enjoy the game. I think the design is good enough, just not my thing.

RATING: 5
Inoffensive tile laying game that thematically borrows from E&T, but which has no real similarity in playing terms.

I like the idea of the system more than I like the actual way that it plays. There are 5 tiles types, and each tile is double sided. You always have one tile in hand, and the two sides of that tile dictate what actions you can take on your turn, after taking those actions, you then have to swap it in for another on the board. Learning this game is a bit of a chore because the player aid, while language neutral, is not very informative. The basic idea is to build up efficiencies in certain colours, and then to have a way to invade other tiles (via red war tiles) and redistribution (via the blue tiles).

I thought the game was ok, but it didn't seem to have any spark for me. It ended fairly quickly, so that's a plus, and I can see how it could be very fast for regular players, but I don't really have any desire to play it that much.

RATING: 7
An interesting but far from easy game. After you've mastered the rules and its many corrections and explanations (the English rules are not very good), you end up with a clever little thing which has a bit of E&T and Mykerinos in it. Your aim is set collection with ziggurats acting as a wildcard resource; you grow your influence in a way which reminds me of the landgrab game of Ystari's offspring. What you can do is limited by the tile in your hand, which you have to exchange with another (unoccupied) tile at the end of your turn.

There is certainly much more to this game then meets the eye, and this only becomes apparent after a few games. You want to spread quickly because that nets you a lot of tiles—but then you lose control of when the game will be finished as you lack the numerical power to make a ziggurat. You also have to expand across the proper tiles, otherwise you don't get points. But you may not get the tile you need to make your plans succeed, because only unoccupied tiles are available to be swapped. (This in some vague way reminds me of Reef Encounter too, where a similar thing happens as all coral strength tiles become locked over the course of the game.) Conflicting choices abound, therefore.

I'm not sure about the player number, though. With 3 players it is a little too easy to stay out of the game. People tend to stay well away from each other, but then begin to complain that their civilisations don't grow sufficiently fast. That is easily solved by moving towards each other, but then you run the risk of warfare with the third player, who was wise enough to stay out of the other players' way, walks away with victory. I must try and get this game to the table more often to see whether 'The Lake' variant (to be found in the Variants subforum) is required for me or not. All that said, I can see why some people prefer Ur to E&T. I can also see why some people claim that the game ends when it becomes interesting. But it [i]is[/i] a tight thing in a rather short amount of time. If you like this sort of thing, give it a go, and don't be put off if the game seems weird to you at first.

An interesting abstract game with a strong theme, that one would not normally find with most abstract games. Playing your tiles for the different effects you can feel your nation gaining the benefits of culture or feel the sway of politics before you wage war against your opponent. The game looks and feels very much like Tigris & Euphrates, but with a shorter playtime. In saying that, both are different enough to warrant having both in your collection.

This is essentially an abstract area control game with a set collection mechanic for victory points.  The theme is thin but matches up with the action mechanics in an intuitive way.  This is a great example of a game that holds a surprising amount of depth within a simple ruleset.  It can definitely be a brain burner though, and can sometimes result in some AP.  I like the design a lot, both mechanically and graphically, but it is hard to get to the table because it is fairly deep and not immediately visually appealing to someone unfamiliar with it.

Update: I've been enjoying playing this on mabiweb.  It's easier to find players, and playing it turn based allows more time to contemplate your moves.  
Update 2: Had a fun 3 player face to face session.  There was some AP but it was still quite satisfying.

Played at Essen and bought on the fly. It's an abstract game with good graphics, at first glimpse it seems Tigris & Euphrates lite (even at scoring), but it's indeed quite different and faster (average of 40-60min by my experience).
I'm tempted to give it a 8 for my first three plays, but I think I'll need more to refine (up or down) my vote.
UPDATE: it deserves a sound 8! (read my review for more)

It's basically a set-collection game with tile placement and weird actions. The game is all about extending your territory... but not too much or you wont have enough cubes to fill every space you could take hold of! A small problem with the gameplay is the downtime: the last thing you do on a move is to exchange the tile you have with another tile on the board. This has too many impacts though: Which action do you want to play on the next turn? Where do you want to place your old tile? On which side do you place it? Deciding this can be very long. Another issue is with the game ending. If somebody is able to fill out all the spaces the game ends immediately, potentially giving him a lot of points for his single last move. It makes for a violent endgame and some wont like it.

RATING: 7
UR is an uncommon entry in the genre of civilization games because it is pretty abstract and rather short when compared to the competition. It also is a real brain burner. Expand or secure territories? Wage war or distribute your cultural wealth among your neighbors? Both? And even though the game's abstract nature is pretty obvious the civilization theme makes it appeal even to players who would otherwise pass on it.

The mechanics used in UR are unique. The tiles that make up the board are also used to select the actions you are allowed to take on your next turn. As such it is possible to deny your opponent certain actions by occupying the corresponding tiles. Highly recommended.

The only downside is that the initial board setup has an unusually high impact. Certain tile constellations are simply much more powerful at the beginning, and unattentive cube placement in some cases can easily decide a game before it has even started.

Really good game. The theme is thin but well designed. In fact it seems more an abstract game, but still the way the "action" works reflects very well the theme. The strategy of every move is important because the consequences of a move may be really important. Great potential for variants.

For a hot-second I thought that UR had eliminated my desire to play Tigris and Euphrates, but after a few plays of each I realized that they're quite different. As my readers may know, my feelings on T&E vacillate and at the moment it's on a high note. That said, UR gets more play because it's simpler and shorter and very fun.

Very interesting mixture of mechanics in this game all leading to a strong design.  There is a bit of set collection, area influence, and tile placement.  Ur feels almost like the bastard child of Tigris and Coloretto - a poor description I know, but that is the feeling I got from it.  All decisions are meaningful, and there really is a nice stretch to the brain, balancing both a spatial awareness of the board, and it's metamorphosis, with the allowed actions for your turn, and the possibilities of your opponents.  Thematically it seems weak, but like Tigris it somehow conveys itself and the abstraction slides to the side.  I can see this one climbing in rating with more plays.

Pretty innovative and original tile-laying game. The gameplay is tense, fast and immersive. But remember that this is just an abstract logic game with a theme pasted on.

On one hand, UR is a skillful, multifaceted game that presents players with intriguing challenges, concentrated into a small package and short playing time.  On the other hand, it's a dry and uninviting game that doesn't make a good initial impression.  I like it, but it's the kind of quirky, unintuitive game that doesn't necessarily have broad appeal.  So the question is whether it will ever get played.  Will I have the guts to suggest it when I suspect others might not like it as much as I do?

One play. A very complex game in a small package. At the end of your current turn you're going to be choosing which actions are available to you *next* turn, so you need to do quite a bit of forward thinking. There's really rather a lot you have to think about in general; in fact, it may even be a little over the top in that regard unless you're a fan of brainburners, in which case you should grab a copy A.S.A.P. The only negative is that it's awfully abstract for a game this involved, though the graphics are nice.

RATING: 8
3-player game (for us)

House rules: The off-board tile in the 3-player game will not be used. Although the chances are somewhat slim that the swap rule will end the game, I want it to be stronger than it is currently. Without the second manner of ending this game it becomes rather tough to set those ziggurats for the win; everyone can see the move and will reduce your score enough to wreck your plan.

I may reduce the board by four (or eight) tiles if the alternative ending isn't strong enough, taking them from the corners to preserve the square play area.

Five minutes to teach, and it took an hour to play (3-player, we might shorten this).

Note: the English rules leave an important sentence out; one may attack from a red tile without forfeiting a cube.

Nov07: So, it has a lot of promising characteristics.  It has a civilization building theme and some reasonable mechanics to theme integration.However, in the end, it's just way too dry of an abstract.  The perfect information also just puts it over the top.The comparison to T&E breaks down real quickly.  In T&E you are taking risks when you initiate conflict.  In UR, there's no risks, there's just endless analysis.

Also, not even all of the actions seem balanced.  Agriculture is just way too efficient at getting cubes onto the board compared to the other methods.

Jun08: GAH!  What's wrong with me?  I couldn't stop thinking about this stupid game.  Went out and bought the thing.  We'll see how much better it is F2F with real player aids.Tried it once in person.  It's still pretty much the same game, but it's really growing on me.  It's deep, but simple.  And it plays quick.  Lots of great adjectives.  Unfortunately, it's also a brain burner.  Which may not be what you're aiming for.

I found it interesting the first time I played it and I added it to my want list, but it was tedious the second time I played and I quickly removed it from my want list. It's not a bad little area control game but it's basically a multi-player abstract game and I just don't imagine playing it much.

RATING: 4
Asbtract + tactical + area control game: not a good start for me. There are however some interesting mechanics, such as the different coloured tile abilities, and while it's iritating not being able to take the tile you want for your next turn especially late game when there are fewer tiles left, that's part of the strategy, and there's usually something you can do.

The obvious flaw is that whoever gets the last go gets to expand without fear of leaving themselves open to attack, thus grabbing potentially vital victory points which previous players couldn't go for in fear of over expanding and leaving themselves vulnerable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This one is hitting the ground running for me as an 8 after three plays.  I suspect that its rating will rise with more play.  I have only played it with three players so far and would very much like to try four.  Given the game's young age, it's not clear if a particular strategy dominates yet.  Also, I can see where analysis paralysis will be a real issue with certain players.  You have perfect information on your turn, so you can count and calculate everything.


Reaction from the table after play #1:  "Wow.  Aside from a series of horrendous mistakes, what just happened?  Let's play again."

After play #2: "Hey, we didn't suck quite as much that time.  Let's play again."

After play #3: "Cool game. This is definitely hitting the table again."


Despite what some reviews say, the actions are not at all difficult to remember.  After one game none of us needed the player aid at all.  OWNERS OF THE ENGLISH VERSION: Make sure that you read the FAQ and the Ur rules forum here at BGG.  There are some good clarifications for the English rulebook, and a fix for one game breaking typographical error which I'll briefly describe here.

=== Attacking is supposed to work as follows.
* Red versus anything: remove an equal number of attackers and defenders.
* Non-red versus the same color: remove an equal number of attackers and defenders.
* Non-red versus a different color: remove 1 more attacker than the number of defenders.

The full text from the FAQ is as follows.

---------------------
In the English ruleset, under "War" action description, it should be written: 
  
3. If the attacking tile illustration is different from the one on the attacked tile, *and the 
attacking tile is not a War tile*, remove an additional token from the attacking tile. 
----------------------


As far as the theme is concerned, it's barely there.  It's a multiplayer abstract puzzle, which I happen to enjoy.  I never felt as though I was in command of a budding civilization, but I didn't really care about that either.  (See also: my high rating for Tigris & Euphrates.)

The gameplay is simply fantastic.  I love games that reward skillful play and punish mistakes.    The choices can be agonizing at times.

Agriculture is the fast track to riches early in the game, but it's a fickle beast.  As soon as you try to expand your empire your farms are no longer looking very attractive.  (Using agriculture causes your tiles which are not next to your green tiles / farms to lose tokens.)

Culture is semi-fast and relatively safe, except that you're inviting others to come camp out next to you for some free tokens.  One player was able to claim a culture tile with three agriculture tiles next to it.  That's an absurd number of tokens for such a small area of the board.

Commerce is interesting. It can be faster than agriculture, but you're at the mercy of your opponents to an extent.  A commerce tile in the corner is the same as a farm, but without the downside of losing tokens on distant tiles.  


I don't feel as though I have a good sense of timing in this game yet.  Too often I'd be able to generate 8-12 tokens, but only have 2 left in my hand.  Pretty poor planning on my part, but I was getting better at it by the third game.  The red tiles were underappreciated in our first couple of games.  Aside from being a good staging area for smashing your opponent's face, they're also a great launching pad for rushing to 3-4 different colors on the last turn.


One thing that I noticed, which I really like, is that there's a balance in the game where if you are in the lead on points it's actually harder to trigger the end of the game.  The reason is that if you spread your pieces out to claim more tiles, you aren't consolodating them to build the 4th and/or 5th ziggaraut. This is probably less true in the four player game where spreading out could fill up all of the free tiles.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (November 2010)

One of the first boardgames I ever played. At the time I found it to be very hard to do well on the game (mainly because I didn’t understood the rules very well). Nowadays I still find it very hard and tense but at least I now know the rules.

I like that UR has no luck whatsoever, so (usually) the best player wins. What I like the most is the way the tiles have 2 functions, (actions and board) making for some interesting decisions on your turn. The game is deep and not obvious in any way. 

At first it seems UR is purely an abstract game, but the theme makes a lot of sense and I use it to teach the game. The rules are easy to teach, but the game aids are very regular so if you teach the game the way it is spelled in the rulebook, you will confuse a lot of people. I use some player aids I found here on the geek. The English rulebook is very uninspired and have one mistake with the war action. 

UR can get played quickly but sometimes the game can drag with some slow players. It has many options so the AP people can really stretch the game time. 

For now, I won’t say no to a UR game. I really like the game and I want to explore it further.

Now that I read the rules clarifications, I need to play again.  A "ziggurat" isn't just wild, it's another suit so you can only have one per set.  Also, I didn't know about only move an extra tile during war if it's different AND not a war tile because that's in the errata.  I like it though the end game can go a little long.

This game just isn't for me.  Plays like an abstract, with a lot of moving parts (the various tile powers) that I don't care about much.  Add two cubes to this tile, add a cube to each adjacent tile - whatever.  Add on the final goal, conquering sets of diversely colored tiles, and you have a game that could have been written specifically to irritate me.  There's nothing wrong with UR, but I won't ever play again.

I'm not a fan of abstracts, but Ur has just enough game play to make me want to come back for more.

I like the tile-swapping mechanism, where you choose what actions you want for your next turn, but some combinations are just too powerful.

There are some rules that aren't too clear, otherwise my rating would be slightly higher.  I'll have to get some of my questions answered and play again before I make a final judgement... but for now I'll rate it a '6.'

I really like the way the tiles serve as actions and then, after use, as part of the game board. The way the tiles impact the game is very interesting.

RATING: 6
A territorial control game that plays on tiles that are frequently switched out - by you for your advantage or by others for your disadvantage. You have a tile in hand that allows two actions (or you could ignore those actions to place cubes directly). At the end of your turn you switch your tile for a different tile from the board. You are trying to control full sets of different colors. In an evenly-matched game, you'll likely end up with one full set and a partial set. The size of the partial set determines the winner.

The game is at first a bit of a puzzle, but it becomes less so as you progress. The actions are only valuable if you have specific situations on the board and creating those situations to your advantage is the puzzle. It's a very dry game and the actions are not that exciting, overall. It's a solid little title that I don't mind playing, but feel no need to own or explore deeply.

RATING: 7
An abstract multiplayer conflict Euro game, a game for everybody and no one. I like the topographical play on the 6x6 tiles map. The non-intuitive effects of decisions are intriguing. A player’s two actions and tile selection for the next turn might be about the immediate strengthening of the board position, the preparation of a beneficial next move, the shaping of the board or the hindrance of another player. The state of play is in constant flux until the first ziggurats generate stability. Subtle planning is required to build up a strong position for the end game scoring which is quirkily  dissociated from the proceedings to get this position. I’m not sure what to think about the direct attacks. On the one hand they are costly and players can protect themselves to a degree. With reflected play, they should be limited to the rare cases where the attacker will benefit without  ending in a tit-for-tat battle only helping other players. On the other hand, they can be devastating enough to take you out of the game. On first sight, Ur is unimposing  but what is on offer is unique enough to be explored further. At the same time, the strange mix of elements is likely to contain something to deter most gamers.

The game is not terribly exciting, the square grid layout only contributes to the feeling that the game is essentially an abstract.  You have some interesting choices to make on your turn, and the mechanics are somewhat novel.  But I can't get past the feeling that I've played similar types game that I find much more involving.  I bet that there is much more to the game that reveals itself with repeat plays, but I don't think I will make the effort to get to that point just yet.  A/P can be a problem if played with the wrong people, thus making the PBW format more attractive.

RATING: 5
An overly complicated abstract game. Its made up of a series of actions, all with the purpose of trying to get enough cubes on the tiles. I think my main problem was that there was no standard way to handle each action. Each action was so completely different that it was hard to work out how the system connected.

Also, player elimination is possible on turn zero (i.e. before a player gets to play), something which I really dislike in games.

I'll rate this a 7 for now (1 play), but I see how I could like this a lot the more I got into it.  It reminds me of several Knizia games (which is a good thing), but it is packed into a smaller game with a shorter play time than most of Knizia's similar offerings.

A civilisation game that resembles the Tigirs & Eufrates of Knizia. Yet the elegance of the gameplay, the mechanism makes it quite a bit more challenging to play it good. Yet this elegance of the game has kind of trapped my soul.

Strange but very intriguing set-collection and tile-placement strategy game. The random distribution of the tiles at the start of the game ensures replayability, but otherwise no luck is involved. Original interaction between using the tiles as the gameboard and as possible actions. The number of cubes is limited, so careful cube-management becomes important rather fast. The initial placement of the cubes is crucial and non-trivial. From a strategy point of view, it is rather obvious to try to start with two agriculture tiles, as this will allow to expand quickly. But also other roads, like starting with two culture tiles, are viable and can result in winning the game. These multiple paths to victory are definitely a plus. Excellent brain-burner!

Set collection game involving tile play which grants you two potential actions.  Five different actions are available via the tiles but you can only do the two allowed by your tile and then you replace a tile in the game with your tile you used for the 2 actions.  Fairly dry and abstract and somewhat like a puzzle.

This is a nice game. Not so abstract as could seem reading the rules. I like how the system simulate the earlier evolution of the civilities, first around the "fields" (agricultural) and the centre of culture, than involving also trading and wars.

The rules are quite simple but is not so easy to master what and how to do: when attack, when is time to consolidate and when is the time to build a ziggurat. I'm sure I would like to play again this game

Abstract game (perfect information; the only randomness is in the setup).
Probably deep, yet not very engaging (perhaps due to the dry, analitycal nature of the game). Interaction is low (war damages both involved sides, so it's better to avoid it at all costs).
Beautiful graphic. 
Inexpensive.

02/20/07 Played a two player game, once (and yes, I know its designed for 3-4 players). Strategy elluded me for the most part. I spent 90% of my time just trying to get the mechanics down. The two-sided cardboard player aid in the game leaves much to be desired. I don't mind UR being so dry/abstract. I agree with other comments here that war seemed a waste of time versus other players. It did have its uses versus empty tiles as a means of expansion. It would probably take me about two more games before I felt like I knew what I was doing. The question is, do I want to go through two more games? Doubtful. Poorly designed cardboard box insert, it takes up 75% of the internal space and serves little purpose.

RATING: 5
Extremely abstracted civ-building game where players fight it out on a board grid containing tiles.  Controlled tiles on the board let you use special powers.  Each player has a tile in hand which is double-sided and allows you to trigger two different civ powers.  At the end of your turn you trade that tile with another on the board.  

Generally speaking players carve out a little corner of the board, use civ powers to expand their empires, including war, and then try to build one or more of the 5 ziggurats available which add to the Knizia-inspired scoring.

A bit of a brain-burner.  Overall I was disappointed by how influential the setup phase was especially considering that there seems to be a real turn-order issue. The first player places first, goes first and then probably ends the game with more turns than the last person in the order.

This game is too fickle. Sometimes, it's a tight, interesting affair. Others, it gets bogged down in overly simplistic, repetitive play.

Similarly, my opinion on this has flip-flopped with every play. There's definitely an initial challenge of getting others to warm up to it: the rules seem simple but in practice they somehow are counter-intuitive and hard to remember, making this a difficult one to like the first time out.

After a couple plays, some interesting things start to emerge, but they are largely dependent upon the tile layout and the other players. Each time I come back to the game thinking it was it's "last chance," it's surprised me with some new twist. But then the next game just sucks the wind out of the sails.

The most recent iteration of this has been experimenting with the two-player variant, which I expected to be weak. Of course, it was surprisingly good, and my girlfriend--a tough crowd to please indeed--seemed to enjoy it. But then we tried it again, and it turned into a 90-minute affair of trying to prevent the other player from winning on his/her next turn.

Based on the prior pattern, I'd expect the next game to be decent, as in maybe a 6. But with every other game being a 3, I have to settle on a 4: if you have it, I could be "talked into it on occasion," but I see no reason to own it myself. Traded.

I like the idea of an open tile laying game with many and contradictory options. Agriculture expands small kingdoms but hurts large. Culture benefits your opponents if they are too close but commerce benefits you. War expands your kingdom while Politics consolidates it. Ziggurats make you weaker now but give you VP in the end. All in a very short gameplay.

The opening may be perceived as slow and even scripted as players carve out parts of the board. However, the board soon erupts of conflicts as the players struggle to time and balance their expansions as it is the most balanced set of tiles that wins in the end (and the end may come unexpectedly!).

Edit: Ma note passe de 9 à 8 après avoir réalisé combien il est important que les joueurs s'allient pour contrer le meneur. Une imprécision commise par un joueur X peut changer complètement le cours de la partie. Très dommage. J'aimerais que ce jeu figure parmi mes préférés. Cependant, après ma 5e partie jouée (4 à 4 joueurs, une seule à 3 joueurs), je crois qu'il manque un petit quelque chose au jeu (l'acquisition permanente de quelques points durant le cours de la partie autre que par la construction de ziggurats, peut-être?...). Peut-être le jeu est-il optimal à trois joueurs (avec ou sans une petite modification à la règle de base?). Chose certaine, au moment d'écrire ces lignes, je suis en train de compléter une 6e partie (sur mabiweb.com, à 4 joueurs) et je compte prendre une petite pause d'UR après celle-ci. Je compte éventuellement réessayer une partie à trois joueurs.

I'd give this another try but it was a very silent game as each move we tried to work out what colour did what.  Towards the end of the game we were announcing which colours we had worked out.  I could see some game in here but would not purchase so waiting for the wife or friends to get it.

For an unashamedly abstract affair, UR sure packs a lot of thematic punch. The various actions make perfect sense in the context, and enlarging your realm requires quite a bit of resource management and risk calculation. A solid 8 for the game itself, plus one more for the attractiveness and no-frills compactness of it all.

Now, if I only could squeeze in a win...

RATING: 6
First impression (3 players): The game is pure abstract area control with some twists. You try to gain as many sets of different "areas" as you can but at the same time your actions greatly depend on which areas you control. You can only choose to do 2 (different) actions based on tile you swapped a turn earlier from board. This makes game a little bit more predictable (a good thing as it can get quite chaotic) and offers a chance to swap some areas to others during play (a good thing). There is plenty of player interaction as the only way to enlarge your area is through the "war" action where you can also take it from other players.

The game took a little bit too long with 3 players who hadn't played before/in a long time. One problem was AP (especially me) but also the game area seems to be perhaps a little bit too big for 3 players. I have a feeling that even more chaotic 4 player game is better because it's more crowded and shorter. Usually I'm not too much into this type of games with plenty of opportunities hitting other players, back-and-forth battling of areas and no theme but for some reason in Ur these didn't matter as much as usually.

Opera prima di Paolo Mori con materiali e illustrazioni tristi (rispetto ai più nuovi Vasco De Gama e Libertalia). Gioco che ricorda Knizia per ambientazione (distante) e meccaniche. Il gioco regala una certa longevità grazie alla 'rimodulazione' del tabellone in ogni partita e anche durante la partita stessa. Mentre le dinamiche e le strategie non sono immediate ma servono un paio di partite per prenderne confidenza; un gioco che quindi non consiglio a giocatori occasionali. Il gioco però a me non dispiace e ha una durata contenuta.

A lot of interesting stuff going on here. Taking actual bits of the board to use as action selection is pretty cool, and while it looks pretty abstract, the theme makes a surprising amount of sense. Can potentially lead to some horrible AP, and I don't really understand why there's no 2P option.

A Board Game Geek friend recommended this game after I inquired about his take on "UR", and I can say that he was right: although the game is abstracted, some general theme of civilization expansion and conquering comes through, albeit in what is a relatively heavy gaming experience. It's definitely not for casual gamers.

As for rules, the translation of the rules in English for "UR" is weak in places, plus proofreading was obviously lacking in parts as well. I rewrote the rules into two pages, for easier reference. 

I expect to be playing this quite a bit over time; the challenge would be finding someone else to play it with, as it is, in my judgment a medium-to-heavy game and a true brain-burner. But when I'm in the mood for it, I love it. 

Purchased new, at 30% off, at local game store clearance sale, July 2009. Increased rating from 7 to 7.5 as of June 2011. With repeated plays this rating holds up. The only reason I wouldn't go higher is because it is mostly abstract, and one has to gear up mentally to play it, so I only occasionally get it to the table. But kudos to the designer.

A strange game where the board evolves and determines which actions players may take. At the end of the game you need sets of diverse tiles to win, but at the start of the game you just want to get as much stuff on the board as possible. Between the two end points there's a trade off in what you focus on.

This seems really clever but is probably too abstract for me to get a lot of replay. Once you had a few games under the belt, I bet the AP increases - the time you save because you now know how to use the 5 special actions is outweighed by the time you now spend working how to beat the other players and deny them tiles with special actions they'd seem likely to want next. Having said that, the game is begging to be explored further to see what strategies based on the different coloured powers work well and how best to play them. The game is a bit hitty. After all, it's a territory grab game, with your choice each turn to expand out onto new tiles or to execute the special coloured powers you took last turn, which are generally to beef up your forces in different ways, redistribute forces and/or do an attack. I have a suspicion that underlying it all it's just another hit the leader game where whoever gets hit the least goes on to win, but I'd like to explore further.

In this way-I've been able to bring back several players to this game that had an otherwise bad first experience.  Just like in Chess-you don't learn how to use "fork" and "pin" your first game.

Watch out for the Brain Drain, since this may cause the game to lag on. There are quite a few decisions to make, although it may not appear that way at first. Basically, try and control sets of different color tiles (5 colors) and use the tiles to perform actions. Battles are costly. The rules are not very clear on specific cases such as multiple attacks. I kind of liked it at points, but the second game took way too long and it seems the unclear rules were a pain for most.

UR is a multi-player abstract. A rather tactical game, with some nice twists. The actions that you can do in a turn are determined by the tile you picked up last turn. That means that the board changes depending on what actions you want. The rules are quite complicated for a first game, especially with the very confusing and unhelpful player aids. Not bad.

I think this a remarkable multiplayer abstract.

The rules are simple and very easy to explain, but the game is engaging, interesting and complex. The mechanic in which you choose the actions you'll have available in the next turn is nothing less than brilliant.

There is no luck present, except in the original configuration of the board and turn order. 

Paolo Mori is a name to follow closely in the future.

Be sure to look up the correct rule for the War action (war is free if it comes from a red tile or is between like tiles, otherwise it costs one cube), as we got this wrong.

UPDATE: Assuming the above is correct (that war from a red tile is free), we screwed this up again.  Green tiles seem the most important for getting guys on the board.  Very hard to do well without them.

A little bit dry and hard on new players, the value comes out after 2-3 plays I'd say if you like this kind of game.

I think this is a bit of a sleeper. I can understand the lowish rating because many people - like our group - don't go for abstracts, which is what this is. The theme is gossamer-thin. But the gameplay is really unique; and clever too. I'm trading because it's clear it won't get much play here but it will make someone very happy.

RATING: 5
Finally, a game where cubes fight it out for an all out struggle for survival on action tiles, but you can only win by careful planing and the aid of your friends Red, Yellow, Green and Purple.

The game works, but the abstraction doesn't.  

While I didn't really enjoy playing it, I felt the real problem with the game is that as soon as it starts to get interesting the game is over.  There is an option to fight each other in the game, but by the time everyone expands to set yourself up for any interaction (other than spoiling tiles that are close to your opponents) the ziggurats get built and the game ends.  I can respect it's quick game play and intention, but I am a bit disappointed at the results.  Perhaps if you removed 6 of the tiles to make a tighter game...

FYI, if you like downtime, you'll love this game.

RATING: 8
The concept of the game is definitely unique, and is certainly a great one for those that are looking for something different and don't mind if it's abstract.  However, I found this game to be a lot of work mentally for not much reward - it was too hard to see the connection between what tile you should take (determining your actions) and how that would help you advance your cause.

UPDATE: Growing on me a bit more, and I'd like a couple more plays to see if it can't rise even more in rating.

UPDATE #2:  It's taken me a while to warm up to this, but I really do love this game.  I think it's a hidden gem.

Very cool game, with interesting mechanic of changing the board and planning your actions for next turn.

*Edit* My rating has gone down, I'm less eager to play this and when I do, even online it feels like it drags on and is random. I suppose I should say chaotic, as nothing is random aside from what your opponents will do.

Great simple design.
It's really a 4 player abstract that can induce AP from all the thing you have to consider on your turn.
I'm really intrigued by the design but I'm not sure there is a game here as the decision tree and the metagame are quite overwhelming.

Would like to rate this higher, but in the end I cannot recall a whole lot about this game.  In other words it is not very memorable.  It is a thinker, but when played with 4 players it is diffucult to manage the possible changes. Thus there seems like you don't have a lot of control,  for a game with next to no luck, lacking control seems befuddling.

Can't wait to try this!!!

Update: I tried it. As a by-stander astutely noted, it's certainly not intuitive. This is the kind of game that I could enjoy and really excel at if I had unlimited gaming time. Barring that, it's not exactly screaming to be played. There are too many other games that provide a fun experience for the time investment.

Apparently dry, this abstract game show its best after playing at least 3/4 times. You have to manage carefully your power/tile and your people/bits. Don't esitate to try it several times before making an opinion, probably you will find something of interesting and deeper than aspected...
Note: the startup positioning can influence too much the rest of the game.

RATING: 6
Abstract game that takes AT LEAST one playing to see how things work. I really want to like this game, but there are a couple of issues. Because of the board size, this is really a 4 player game. This is ok as two if you shrink the board size. However, turn order is huge. First player has a distinct advantage. Next is - every player needs to be at the same skill level or the weak player really makes the game unbalanced. That's probably true to some extent in a lot of games, but this game is like a machine gun fight in a clown car - there is no room to maneuver or for error, so having a disadvantaged player throws the whole game off.

Loads of fun tactical play in this one, with a nice 2 player variant on the variants page. With four players it can be a bit chaotic and can lead to some stalemate/kingmaker positions. Lots of player interaction and 'take that' moves but no player elimination. Still a very enjoyable game.

RATING: 6.5
Civ-themed but pretty abstract conquest game on a 6x6 tile grid. I mostly like it; the tiles act as terrain in that they affect which actions you might take to try to get more cubes on your tiles, the cubes being necessary in order to expand or make war. The tile you have in hand specifies the two actions you can take on your turn, which amounts to a small number of plausible actions and makes the game go pretty quickly.

What I don't really like is how you then, once your turn is done, exchange your tile in hand with one on the board, effectively changing the terrain (and committing to a pair of actions for next turn). I like the part where you have to plan a turn ahead, but I don't like that there are (at least until late in the game) a large number of possible tile swaps you could make, and that you can get screwed up by someone else's tile swap choice. If there were fewer options, maybe you could see it coming and be able to blame yourself a bit more.

I have a feeling that the action-restriction mechanism would be better replaced with something that didn't alter the board terrain. On the other hand I wonder if removing the dynamic terrain from the game would arbitrarily cripple some player positions.

(Going in I had the fear that the "politics" action, which allows reallocating all cubes among your tiles, would fall under the "too many options" feeling, but it doesn't. The principles of how you should allocate cubes are easy and don't require much precision.)

Thematically amusing: Cubes can starve from not being adjacent to an agricultural tile. You can stop this from happening by never taking the agriculture action.

...Another play. Dry and lacking big moves. Interesting tension though between wanting to settle tiles that will produce a lot of cubes, and the endgame scoring which favors owning a variety of tiles. Also interesting how one can start pushing the game clock forward pretty early on, though as always I find it annoying to be able to advance the clock if it's unclear that I'll be ahead if the game ends.

It seems like you can develop enough skill to quickly determine which tile you want to swap off the board, and maybe even anticipate what other players will swap, but I think the feeling of "player chaos" will always be there.

RATING: 8
A tricky and yummy little bastard. Much drier than T&E, and too abstract for some, but also carries the tile laying mechanic into a highly interactive & changeable game state that adds a layer of kinetic inebriation to the delicious thought pretzels. 

While it lacks the pure exuberance of T&E's random draw bag & hidden hand of tiles &, well, T&E's perfect suddenness, it does sustain a creative arc & drama that is player driven. The core mechanic is a gem of an idea.

Don't forget you can fly to the other side of the board and pop in for a surprise visit.

Rated after three played games (all with three players). This game has a theme, but it is still quite abstract. There are hints about civilization games, when first you need agriculture and trade before you can flourish in culture, politics and war. I think this needs couple of games to really know, what is the essence of this game. I kind of like the mechanics, even though there are still lots of silly mistakes. After three games this starts to feel like a game, it however might be, that most of the players won't ever play a second game. Or the first.

RATING: 8
UR is a 45-60 minute territorial conquest game that at a highly abstracted level has overtones of the civilization theme. The unique mechanic where you must chose in advance what actions will be available to you NEXT round, and in turn knowing what actions will be available to your opponents on their next go, is an ingenious concept, heightened by the fact that in the process you are altering the geography of the board when you swap your tile with one on the table. After 100 plays this continues to impress as there is great variability from the different tile layouts during setup; it amazes me that for such an abstract game there is really a distinct narrative that emerges each session. 

It is true though that the initial setup round is very influential: players early in turn order need to be mindful of placing where they are not too vulnerable, and players later in the turn order need to be careful about preserving the balance of everyone's starting positions. Although to be fair I have seen excellent players occasionally come back from seemingly dire openings. 

I attribute the game's unpopularity as much to its opacity as anything else- recognizing a good opening as well as general strategy takes a couple games to develop, before which there might be an "is that it?" feeling among impatient players not intrigued by the game's clever mechanics. 

Make sure you don't miss the erratum regarding the war action, i.e. you do not pay a cube when attacking from a like-colored tile OR when attacking from a red tile.

Just like Mesopotamia’s ancient Kings, each player will have to achieve the highest prestige by precisely dosing the development of Agriculture, Trade, Politics, Culture and finally War, so that thanks to these efforts the long desired construction of five Ziggurats is completed.

RATING: 6.365
A fairly abstract game about expanding a civilisation across a tile-based landscape.  Each tile has two possible actions on it, most of which are various ways of gaining more tokens (population) with the exception of the war action that allows you to spread onto new tiles.  Once you've taken your actions, trade your tile for an unoccupied tile (and thus adjust the landscape).  Once there are no unoccupied tiles, you score based on what sets of tiles that you have tokens on.

Interesting game with tricky choices.  Each turn, you need to decide how you want to implement your two previously-chosen actions (or the consolation actions if you can't use or don't like what your options), and then choose an unoccupied tile for which you will switch the current one.  In so doing, you not only speculatively choose your two actions for next turn, you also change the landscape for you and your opponents.  This leads to wonderfully difficult decisions.

It's a Zucker game (in NLB-style) - nothing more to say!

...If you want to get a little further, try Markus Stumptner's refit: a new rule-variant. All for the game (rules, new counters, markers, etc.) at: http://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/user/mst/games/lbn/lbn.html#refits.

Outdated system. Just too random, so that planning becomes redundant. And very dull combat...yawn...system. Very 70's!

RATING: 8
You either like the 'Library' rules or hate then.  I like them so I start a fan of the basic game engine.

Five different scenarios here with different flavours.  Teugen-Hausen, Abensberg and Eckmuhl see badly organised Austrians and outnumbered but better commanded French and allies blundering around wet Bavarian woods and streams.  Oh for a clear line of sight anywhere! Viva III Corps, saviour of the day(s).  Apsern-Essling sees the French as risk of collapsing under the Austrian steamroller, especially if the Danube bridge goes down and no reinforcements arrive. And Wagram, a real stand up fight on a beautiful flat plain in good weather - enough opportunity for cavalry charges and bombardment to keep anyone happy.

Each scenario (except T-H) has an approach to battle and a day of battle so you can try your manovering skill and get your forces in the right place - or not! And then there is Four Days in April - T-H, Abensberg and Eckmuhl on two maps to give you a real mini-campaign.

Production is good, clear counters, lovely maps.  All in all a game that when I have put it away I can hear calling from my wargames cupboard. If you like the Zucker system you will get value for money from this game.

Initial Impression: This is a top-notch production, with clear counters and gorgeous map. Lots of love has been put into the effort of creating this game. Although Austrian troop strengths are almost equal to those of the French, their army is hampered by poor Commanders. The battles are interesting and historical without the feeling of being scripted.

I'm not a huge fan of Napoleonic era warfare, so my comments must be put in perspective. However, this is a design from another era. Classic system with odds based CRT, Igo-Ugo SOP, loaded with chrome and under developed.

This is just too much work, takes way too long to play and frankly, is not as smooth as it should be. Lots of rules are unnecessary (Vedettes, hidden units, even supply...).

I guess one word sums it up well in my mind: TEDIOUS.

I'm not even sure the end result looks anything close to history. We did Wagram and we couldn't find a reason for the protagonists to act as they did in reality. We either missed something or it just doesn't work well.

Despite what the detractors say about the combat system, I have fun when I play this game.  The maneuvering of your forces and timely deployment of your troops give this system a great picture of Napoleonic operational warfare.

This is a solid member of the LNB system with excellent Approach to Battle scenarios featuring plenty of maneuver.

Comments on the LNB system in general.  

This system builds on the success of the classic Napoleon's Last Battles.  In solves the few issues that system had and provides a great value in a Quad format.

Unfortunately, the rule set has experienced, and continues to experience significant creep.  One would think that after all these decades the optimal balance would be reached, but as the designer has said it's like a fold in a rug, you push down and it pops up somewhere else.  

Additions like vedettes, hidden units, cavalry charges, supply trains, cards, and unit initiative have their strengths and weaknesses.  They're overlaid on a rather archaic ZOC/CRT chassis and the argument could be made that many of these updates simply aren't worth the bother.

Bottom line, we play a la carte, deciding which rules to use and which to ignore.  My opponents and I don't play with the cards for example.  If one wants to make a cavalry charge or break off vedettes they can, but the truth is there's rarely an advantage in doing so.

I rate games in this series based upon our way of playing them.  I'll grant that this may be sub-optimal play as over the years we've needed to become comfortable with a series of changes to the system and perhaps not all of those have" gelled". If the system received a significant overhaul that streamlined it a bit while modernizing the ZOC/CRT system; these games would probably rate a point or two higher.

RATING: 7
Most important battles of 1809 Campaign in Austria. Four very different battles, four different situations, four tense scenarios. 
Wagram and Aspern-Essling are slightly unbalanced (first to French, second to Austrians), but two others are very well crafted.
Library of Napoleonic Battles presents this campaign in beautiful way. Highly recommended.

RATING: 10
We've been playing this series for at least a year now, and Last Success is the best of the bunch.  A fascinating selection of battles, ranging from wildly fluid battles of maneuver (Abesnberg/Eckmuhl) to set piece battles (Aspern/Wagram).  I'm a huge Campaigns of Napoleon fan, but I have to admit this series is giving the old chestnut a run for its money.  I find (as I always have with CoN), that I come away from most sessions saying "huh, I never really understood why "x" happened in the history books.  Now I do!"  I highly recommend hidden forces when playing this game (though it works fine open).  Takes it to another level.

RATING: 8.5
Looks lovely and the simple but effective approach is a winner. Yes you can knock the system for lacking this, that and the other. But every game you play tells a story, and once over, you want to talk about, relive, and go again. Great game system, especially for those who like a story and drama in a game, but maybe not for the gamer who insists on detail and knowing all the variables of an equation. 

Battles themselves are good - lovely maps, great counters as ever. Cards add a lot. I found Wagram a little boring - it's just a slog, with little room for manoeuvre. Perhaps a bigger map might help, the Austrians just sit at the top of the map, and react to Napoleon's bludgeoning. Quire realistic in that sense, but ultimately quite boring as a gaming experience. The other battles are far more interesting, knife-edge experiences.

Un système qui tourne parfaitement malgré la lourdeur de rédaction des règles.
Je suis fan donc difficile pour moi d'avoir un jugement objectif sur le système des combats.
Par contre je suis très déçu par les situations stratégiques proposées, certains scénarios sont confus et nettement moins bien dosés que les deux précédents opus (Four lost battles, The coming storm).

ABENSBERG - scénario à sens unique pour le joueur français. L'Autrichien est complètement dépendant d'une initiative très faible.
ECKMUHL - non joué
MINI CAMPAGNE ABENSBERG + ECKMUHL - cette fois ce sont les Français qui sont complètement démunis. Il est étonnant d'ailleurs que les Autrichiens soient si puissants alors que le point de départ est celui d'Abensberg. "Seven days of 1809" du même auteur est nettement plus palpitant...Rectification, scénario rejoué avec l'errata officiel, c'est nettement mieux...Du coup, la note passe de 5 à 6.
ASPERN - non joué
WAGRAM - le scénario sur deux journées qui correspond à l'ensemble de la bataille est injouable pour les Autrichiens. Leur première ligne trop avancée ne peut se sauver. Ensuite il ne restera plus aux Français qu'à attendre leurs renforts pour l'emporter.

La note de 5 correspond à ma sensation globale sur cet opus dans l'attente d'autres éventuelles parties.
Elle est passée à 6 après avoir joué la mini campagne avec un remodelage officiel de ce scénario.

I really enjoy this system - the scale is great, quite unique I think, and gives an excellent feel for army and corps command, and a great insight into the development of battles, especially through the AtB scenario. This is the only system that I know of that can replicate the course of battles as described by Chandler, Petre, Gill, Rothenberg, Dodge, Castle, etc.  

You gain an appreciation of the need to co-ordinate corps across miles of broken terrain, the imperative of capturing bridges or using pontoons to move the crucial artillery and train, the importance of using columns across multiple roads to get more troops more rapidly to the critical locations, and the essential nature of scouting and screening while you try to understand where the enemy is so you can wrong-foot him and ensure you are not surprised in turn.

If you like Nap last Battles you will like this series. If you hate the rigid ZOC, kill em when they retreat into my ZOC of the classics, stay away. However these game captures the macro operational feel of Napoleonics in a fairly rapid playing package.   Playing with the hidden,limited intelligence rules makes this game a truly memorable experiance. The variable reinforcments and the mini-campaing sceanarios ( the combined Abensberg-Echmuhl for one...) make the games fresh and different. Also the current CRT/Bombardment tables made the game more dynamic than earlier editions

It did not work for me. Combat is strange and not fun. There is too much markers, too big stacks - this game seems to be too old mechanic wise, so this could nicely work in nineties, however today I think new games are somewhere else and can solve some of its issues without added complexity.

The Last Success is the result of more than 25 years of development. We were lucky to have a true team of experts (including published historians) putting thousands of hours into the accuracy of the strengths and positions of the units, and getting the terrain just right. Those things tend to make the game play-out properly, since the basic system is known to work well. 

The CRT is quite serviceable. From a top-down perspective, it gives the kind of battle narratives that I want. The front lines move in quite historical ways, hour-by-hour. Why does it work? It's actually simple. It doesn't aggregate tactical details but simply shows the things that can happen to a brigade-sized unit, overall, after 60 minutes on the battlefield, and it does so with a minimum of effort. 

That simplicity allows the design to explore equally important matters, that have to be included if you want to produce an historical narrative: hidden movement and command especially. We only added these elements because they were critical factors. There are very, very few Napoleonic battles that can be simulated effectively without leadership rules. And once you scope-out to include the approach to the battle, then rules for road march and baggage trains become necessary.

If you disregard the Vedette Rules, Hidden Movement, Baggage trains and the rest, the core system has been kept as close as possible to the original game in this series, Napoleon’s Last Battles, which I designed in 1975. 

Many, if not most Napoleonic battles were very unbalanced. However, the force structures on each side were unknown to the enemy, and sometimes even to friends. A player should be in the same picture as the actual commander. "Uncertainty" is written on every page of Napoleonic history.

In most wargames, you know the Reinforcement schedule for both sides. In reality, neither side knew much about the location of their opponents. We decided to incorporate that uncertainty using Hidden Movement and Alt. Reinf cards. To scout the enemy we provided the Vedettes that were the only way of obtaining information short of attacking.

I appreciate the difficulty of running an army, especially in the days of hand-written messages delivered on horseback. Most wargames make it appear that the correct move was obvious at the time, but that is usually not the case. If you carefully look at the information people had at the time they made the decision, it's the lack of information about the enemy - uncertainty - that I want to introduce into the design.

The cards don't add anything to the game time-wise, but add a lot of variation. Here is the account of the Kulm game, from Four Lost Battles, that was posted on Consimworld.

“I completed my first playing of this game. The battle ended up tragically and one-sidedly historical, but it was a lot of fun seeing it happen, and there were plenty of interesting possibilities. For the French, this playing presented a series of lost opportunities. So, on the afternoon of the 29th Vandamme goes head to head with the larger, qualitatively superior, but clumsier Coalition forces. On the 2cd turn Vandamme draws the card for alternative reinforcements; just think what it would mean to have the Young Guard charging in that early? Unfortunately, the Coalition had the cancellation card. The fight went on next morning, with Vandamme steadily losing ground, Kleist creeping closer, and a stream of Austrian reinforcements closing in. Then, around mid-day, in fairly rapid succession, the French draw for Napoleon, the Old Guard, and St. Cyr. They still just might pull it off... but card play enforces delay of St. Cyr, who was already taking his time appearing. While waiting for him, Vandamme is crushed, and flees the battlefield with a handful of survivors. The promised reinforcements, now due, are simply too late.”

The Grand Tactical system is very good both game and simulation wise. The system is rather easy to learn and it is streamlined. Supply rules might feel a bit extraneous on this level but they give a sense of history and work very well in relation to victory points. There are four battles in the box and each battle can be played as a one or two day battle. There are also rules for a campaign, which means the replay value is more then good.

Man I really like this game (actually four battles in one box).  The renewed Quad release's from OSG are simply satisfying especially to a military history buff of the Napoleonic Wars.  Maps, counters and cards are beautiful.  The historical notes (with their sited sources for further study) wet the appetite for each of the four games/battles.  The system works well as the Austrians and French "bump & run" against each other.  The Campaign Game uniting all four battles into a ongoing flowing engagement requires a weekend or two but must be tried.  A fun playing wargame experience.

I own the first four games of the series (I just haven't gotten around to getting the others yet) and this is probably my favorite of the bunch due to the variety of the scenarios. Everything from river crossings and delaying actions to titanic-sized battles (Wagram) are in this collection. I did find Aspern-Essling to be the least appealing of the battles given the static nature of the battle but even that makes for an interesting solitaire puzzle to be enjoyed. 

If you can accept some of the 70's era wargame design concepts like rigid zones of control and mandatory combats, there is a lot of fun to be had in this collection.

Great components all around.  The scenarios provide a good balance of unit density and types of battle so you should be able to find one that appeals to you when you pull it out to play. Wagram is quite heavy for a one map scenario and Eckmuhl or Teugen-Hausen are good ways to introduce the system.

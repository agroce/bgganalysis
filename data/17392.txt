Wow, this game does a fantastic job of recreating the motivations and interactions of the powers of the day. 

I played the Hapsburgs, and so had five fronts to cover (Ottoman @ Vienna, Ottoman in the Mediterranean, France-Spain, France-Germany (French), and France-Germany (English)). As such, the ballet of diplomacy was treacherous, but also rewarding, in that I could use the potential collapse of one front, particularly the Ottoman, as leverage to win mercenaries and cards from other players. To further balance out the many fronts, the New World is an almost unending treasure trove of victory points and cards, despite some bad rolling on my part.

It was very satisfying to come home, pick up the book on the Reformation I'm slowly working through, and read a number of quotes that reflected our game very closely: "Indeed, the Turkish invasions were, paradoxically, good news for Luthor. If Charles V had not been so distracted in his efforts to save Europe's south-eastern frontier, he would perhaps have had the will and the resources to crush the Protestant revolt in its infanct in the 1520s and 1530s. When Charles did strike, it was too late."

The Protestants won our game by one victory point. Had I made peace with the Ottomans in the last turn (which he wanted to do, but I turned him down!), I could've taken just one more Protestant electorate and won the game. Exactly as the book said.

The game does have a couple of flaws, however. How much can you stray from way history flowed? I'm not really sure, but it feels fairly constrained. At the same time, cards played for events are rather limited (except combat cards, which is nice). Finally, it seems to me it would be incredibly boring to play as one of the religious powers. 

As such, I think this game might be best with three. I'm also eager to try out the 2 player variant with a diplomacy deck in the upcoming C3i.

Lastly, I am not a fan of the way the game gives out victory points. Often, games will have victory points two steps removed from a player's actions. That is, do X to get Y which gets you VP. In this game, those victory points are only one step removed. In other words, I can convert my command points directly into victory points, in many cases. A minor nitpick, perhaps, but it definitely takes away from the historical feel of the game.

Update: Decided to sell it, based on the difficulty and time commitment of putting a game together.

Sistema en solitario para cartas mio.
Uno de los pocos juegos que existen sobre esta época. Otro es el Mighty Fortress que es muy aburrido y repetitivo.
Here I Stand quizá se centra demasiado en la cuestión religiosa de la Reforma en lugar de en todos los acontecimientos políticos. Por ello al cabo de algunos turnos la controversia religiosa se hace aburrida y repetitiva.
Bastante exagerado el poder inglés de la época (se nota que son diseñadores angloparlantes).
Se aconseja descargar de internet una variante para jugar con todos los poderes entre 2 Jugadores, ya que la variante oficial con un Mazo Diplomático es muy limitada.
También se aconseja eliminar las unidades navales pues aportan poco, así como las tiradas de intercepción y evasión de la batalla para dar más rapidez así como para lograr conseguir mayores objetivos políticos.
Tiene mejor crítica de la que merece en la realidad, aunque es perfectamente jugable.

RATING: 8
Excellent game!  Fantastic how the cards drive everything.  Granted, poor card draws can be exceedingly painful but, well, that's kind of the game.  The negotiation aspect is *critical* to gameplay.  The different powers *must* work together against common enemies to keep them in check.  The game is designed around this.  Downsides:  Oh so very long.  Very complicated rules (mostly in the nuances) and the rulebook is not always crystal clear.  Poor luck = you're done.

Side note:  Had one 6-player game where the Protestant player repeatedly rolled poorly and the Papacy repeatedly rolled ridiculously well.  This led to the adoption, in our circle, of the phrase "roll like a Protestant" -- i.e., when someone rolls horrifically bad.

Provisional rating after a couple of abbreviated plays. [-]The cards and the diplomacy aspect really elevate this game above mediocre mechanics (buckets of dice or 2d6 with a small modifier randomness, yay) to make an enjoyable experience[/-]. Actually I'm revising this. The more I think about it the random wonkiness of the exploration and the combat dice rolls drag down the legitimately good parts of this game. I wiped out a similarly sized corsair fleet as the Hapsburgs without losing a single boat since my opponent never rolled more than one hit on ~11 dice (and I was only rolling two hits). I also think I just plain old don't like dedicated negotiation phases in games. That amount of randomness (and losing a colony or something) is just absurd in a game with this playtime. Hey I completely wasted my turn because the dice screwed me, how many more hours do we play?

The religious struggle has a neat element of maneuvering influence like Twilight Struggle and there's some good depth in deciding when and how to use your reformers but the actual mechanics of rolling per area slow the game down when it hits the Papacy and the Protestants. The mechanics work but it's a bit of a grind. 

Basically in a game of this length and with this player count I want more determinism. Gating so many of the important things behind swingy dice rolls means just kills it for me.

Took quite a while to get into, but well worth it! Lots of strategic planning, but again like every war game it comes down to 'trying to roll a six'! (it's an over used mechanic, but I'm well used to it. But it doesn't let down this great game!)

I find the historicity and the historic atmosphere of HIS right. I didn't dislike this game, but 40 pages of rules is far too much, although HIS is not a difficult game. Many game mechanics could have been simplified and this would have improved gameplay a lot.

Besides it is as if the Protestants and Papacy are fighting their own religious war, completely seperated from the military wars on the board. A game mechanic which required a lot of dice rolling should have been simplified. And for the Ottomans there is not much else to do but annoying the Hapsburgs.

RATING: 7
A titan of a game: lots of parts to this game, lots of rules to keep in your head. Needs considerable study, and ideally a first play should include at least one person familiar with the game. At the upper end of my limit for complexity, I think, but very enjoyable. 

Diplomacy is the main part of the game, which I haven't got too involved in yet, spending so much of my concentration grappling with the rules.

RATING: 7
The theme is really strong, and many of the mechanics I prefer to other wargames.  The largest issues are the rather odd war declaration system, which I feel stifles choices, and the fact that players can spend large swaths of the game with nothing to do due to disparity in cards held per turn.

A solid giant war game. I played it at Kubla Con, and the game ended too quickly because the Ottoman player got to raid unchecked. It was definitely fun but I felt like between the English, the Papacy, and the Protestants there wasn't enough focus on war. I later played Napoleonic Wars at Kubla Con and preferred it for that reason.

+ One of the most interesting game play experiences ever. Historical game where warfare is constructed on multiple layers (countries against each other and Catholic church vs. Protestants). Everything is interconnected and everything is negotiable.
- The open negotiation phase prolongs the play time a lot. If someone could design the same game experience within 4-5 hours and max. 30 pages of rules, it would get 10 easily!

I am a playtester (you can see in the credits!). 

What attracted me to this game and made me want to join in the development is how well it ties together lots of interesting historical threads -- the military struggle between the region's great powers, the religious conflict, and the age of exploration. I think the game provides a superb feel for all of those things, and despite the rules weight, many of the systems are substantially simpler than in other CDGs with similar mechanics (e.g. there is no interception or avoid battle DRM for terrain or territory control). There's no system for handling the unreliability of mercenaries -- it's built completely into the deck. 

I tend to prefer the 3 player version, which I only played a handful of times, due to the time element. In the 3 player version, the powers are grouped by natural alliance, so you have Hapsburgs/Papacy vs. England/Protestants vs. France/Ottomans. It works very well that way.

I find this game very exciting and wish I had the opportunity to play F2F rather than just PBEM -- I think the change in flow would feel very different.

Edit: Having played 4 F2F games at WBC, there's a lot of tension with every roll of the dice.  Great game.  I have upgraded from 9 to 10.

Purchased 7/08. Looks good! CDG mechanics which can support up to six players. Could be hectic.Rating based on games with 3 players to get the feel for the game. An incredibly rich and detailed game of the period. It was priceless watching my gaming buddy torn between marching some units off to battle or translating the New Testament...not many games have that dichotomy. So far I favour playing the Ottomans 'cos they get to pillage stuff and kidnap women.

A great game about the early Reformation. I think it gives a great historical feel, with various mechanisms functioning at different levels, from the main military and religious, to diplomacy, piracy and exploration and colonization, all very well integrated.

It works great with six players, with a lot of variability in the different factions, although unfortunately the game is necessarily somewhat long. As a bonus, the 2-player rules also make for an interesting game, with the added plus that it can be finished in an evening.

Some people really like this game...I played for 12 hours and kind of hated it.

For what it is (basically a souped of Nappy wars system) this game is way over elaborated with 40 odd pages of rules. Different players might as well be playing a different game. One doesn't necessarily even know what they're doing half the time.

Some of the mechanics feel strange. Powers can sue for peace and remove a threat with the only repercussion being the VP's awarded to the other player. If this guy isn't winning then who cares? You don't lose anything.

I spent 12 hours as the Ottoman Turks bashing my head against a brick wall known as the Habsburgs because they had twice as many cards and seemed little distracted by what was going on elsewhere.

England won because of some rolls for the New World and Henry's bedtime activities. They hardly moved an army all game.

What a dreadful slog.

I want to rate it higher and like it more but..  playability is very poor.  Downtime between actions is a big problem whether it be with three or six players.  A multiplayer timer may help but will unlikely fix the issue entirely.  Other than that everything else is good.  It's fun and interesting.  However, after three plays I think we will have difficulty getting it on the table again.

An empire-building game set in early modern Europe. Can't say I enjoyed it much. The game is just too long for me, with playing a card and then waiting twenty minutes for theological debates (read another type of battles) to be resolved. The historical flavor is interesting, but does tightly constrain what you can do, which I don't really like. Now that I know the system, I would try again, but I would rather try Europa Universalis on PC instead.

I guess I ain't no wargamer.

It's hard to give Here I Stand a fair rating based on the BGG system.  Do I think it's well designed?  Yes.  Do I like the theme and setting?  yes.  Is there tension and interesting decisions to be made?  yes again. 

Do I ALWAYS want to play it and expect this will never change?  Yikes.  This is a looong game.  like any long game, there is only a limited time and place for it.  On top of that...it really must be played with 6 people and it can be hard to find that many willing participants for this sort of thing.

Still...Each time I've played I've had a blast.  I had a blast coming in last place and I had a blast coming in 1st place.  

The downfall of Here I Stand is that it can drag sometimes for some players.  Every now and then you can find yourself on the outside looking in, with little to do or contribute.  A few bad cards and some well timed "gotchas" played by your opponents and suddenly your left twiddling your thumbs for 20 or 30 minutes.

Despite that fact, I recommend Here I Stand for anyone with 5 like-minded friends, historical curiosity, and a rainy Sunday to kill.

Ha röviden össze akarom foglalni, akkor nehéz és hosszú, cserébe viszont nagyon jó.

Bővebben kifejtve: a játék egyedisége abban rejlik, hogy 6 teljesen eltérő szerep jut a játékosoknak. Egyben ez adja a nehézségét is, mivel a sok szerep miatt a szabály is elég hosszú (44 oldal). Aki profin tud minden szabályt, és/vagy általában jártas a wargame-ekben, annak nem hiszem, hogy túl komplex ez a játék, de nekem talán egyedül Die Macher volt ehhez mérhető nehézségben, csak máshogy nehéz egy eurogém, mint egy wargame:) A Die Macher mélyebb, ez meg kiterjedtebb... Az asztalnál amúgy rajtam kívül mindenkinek legalább a 3-dik partija volt ez, mégis végig a szabályt bújtuk:) A játék hossza 9 kör esetén akár fél nap is lehet, a mi partink csak 4 körös volt, és "csak" 5 és fél óra:)

És hogy miért szuper a játék? Mert egy érdekes történelmi kort dolgoz fel (Vallásháborúk 1517-55), ami biztosítja, hogy teljesen eltérő szerepeket ölthetünk magunkra, és mindezt egy olyan jól összegyúrt rendszerben, amibe nagyon bele tudjuk élni magunkat. Még az átlag wargame-nél is tematikusabb a játék: a pápa és a protestánsok főleg vallási küzdelmet folytatnak egymással, a törökök kalózkodnak, az angol szereplő VIII. Henrik utódlásával van elfoglalva, miközben a franciákkal és a habsburgokkal verseng az új világ meghódításáért. És ezek csak a specialitások, mindeközben a térképen a politikai befolyásért is megy a harc. Az egyes hatalmaknak eltérők a választható akciói, felsorolni is nehéz lenne mindet, a hagyományos mozgás, támadás, egységek létrehozása mellett a protestánsok pl. lefordíthatják különféle nyelvekre a Bibliát, a pápa  felújíthatja a bazilikát, VIII. Henrik kivégezhet egy feleséget, hátha a következő végre fiút szül neki (játékról játékra változhat pl. hogy Mária, Erzsébet vagy Edward játéba kerül-e), csak hogy néhány érdekesebb akciót említsek. 
A játékban rengeteg jó mechanizmus megjelenik, alapvetően kártyavezérelt, de pl. a Diplomacy-ból ismert tárgyalásos rész is megvan benne. A leginkább az a zseniális benne, hogy sikeresen egyesíti a hagyományos háborús elemeket egy teljesen más jellegű vallási küzdelemmel, és még a nyelvterületek révén is behoz egy újabb dimenziót a játékba. Így pl. Lyon egy adott pillanatban lehet Habsburg ellenőrzés alatt, katolikus színezettel és ugyebár alapból francia nyelvterület. Ha a protestánsok lefordítják franciára a Bibliát, akkor idővel elérhetik, hogy Lyon protestáns legyen, még akkor is, ha a Habsburgok a Pápa szövetségesei. 
A játék több dimenziója miatt a pontozás is nagyon érdekesen alakul. A hatalmak többsége pontokat szerezhet kulcsmezők birtoklásáért, más vezérének elfogásáért, de van akinek vallási befolyásért jár a pont. Az angoloknak Henrik utódaiért is pont jár, több hatalom is pontot szerezhet földrajzi felfedezésekkel, a törökök kalózkodással, stb. A pontok változása teljesen dinamikus, és a játék eleji helyzet már alapból nem azonos pontszámot mutat. A pápának a játék elején már csak néhány pont kellene a végső győzelmet jelentő 25 ponthoz, de Luther miatt ez egyből veszélybe kerül. Területek foglalásával folyamatosan vesszük el egymástól a pontokat, így teljesen hektikus, hogy épp ki vezet. A játék kooperatív jelleget is magára ölthet, ha valaki nagyon egyértelműen vezet, mert akkor mindenki egységesen őt kezdi ütni, hogy a következő körben már más legyen a nyerő helyzetben. Az a jó az egészben, hogy a történelmi hűséget úgy adja vissza, hogy a kötöttségek ellenére szabadságot is ad (bár nem minden hatalomnak egyformán). Ugyan nagyjából be van határolva, hogy melyik hatalomnak mire célszerű ráhajtani, mégsem feltétlen egyutas a győzelem.
Ami még említést érdemel: mellékszereplőként megjelennek a játékban a magyarok is (3 másik szereplő mellett).

Összességében az egyik legjobb játék, amit próbáltam eddig, de tudomásul kell venni, hogy egész napos program. A szabálymagyarázat 2 óra, és körönként másfél-két óra maga a játék is. Állítólag csak 6 fővel jó, illetve azt hallottam, hogy a kieg 2 fős pakli se rossz, a Pápa és protestánsok lejátszhatják magunk közt a dolgot:) Nehéz 6 főt összeszedni, de mivel majdnem minden wargame 2 fős, én inkább erénynek tartom azt, hogy ez sokszemélyes.
Jut eszembe: kockák is vannak a játékban, de valahogy ez nem zavart, pedig dobtam nagyon rosszakat is:)

Egyértelműen szeretnék még játszani jópár partit, kár hogy ennyire nyelvfüggő és hosszú, mert ez nagyon behatárolja a célközönséget. Jó lenne készségszinten tudni a szabályát, akkor még jobban élvezném:)
---
Kimaradt még, hogy:
1. A játék szép (fényes GMT doboz, aprólékosan kidolgozott tábla, szép kártyák).
2. A királycsinálás durván bele van kódolva a diplomáciába, mivel akár kulcsmezőket is adhatunk a másiknak taktikai okból. Mivel ezek pontot érnek, így bárkivel megnyerethető a játék... elvileg. Gyakorlatilag azonban az akciók fázisa még ezután jön, a többi játékos ha összefog, esetleg megbüntetheti a két etikátlan játékost. Másfelől aki ennyire direkt módon királyt csinál, azzal gondolom nem játszanak a többiek többször. Mert ez kvázi csalás:)
3. Az egyes szerepek kiegyenlítettségéről: akik már a 4-diket játszották, azt mesélték, hogy szinte mindig más szokott nyerni, én sem éreztem egyiket se kiugrónak, szinte bármelyik hatalom lehetett volna a befutó. Különbséget én inkább az alapján tennék, hogy melyik hatalom mennyire tűnt érdekesnek: egyértelműen az angolnak vannak a legváltozatosabb lehetőségei (újvilág, vallás, öröklés, háborúk), a francia tűnik talán a legunalmasabbnak (nekik marad az újvilág, és a hagyományos harci rész). A 2 vallási szerep teljesen más mint a másik 4, és a török kalózkodása is érdekes. A Habsburgot pedig Károly kétlakisága teszi érdekessé.
---
Továbbra is zseniális! 3 év szünet után újra játszhattam vele. A mostani (5.) partimban végre angolokkal lehettem, talán ez a legváltozatosabb, mert ott vannak Henrik feleségei, ott van a reformáció, felfedezések, ott vannak a skótok, stb. Sajnos rosszul játszottam, de így is lenyűgöz, hogy mennyire átélhető a töri. Az egyik legtematikusabb játék, amit ismerek, hihetetlen jó a hangulata. Egyszerűen sajnáltam, hogy csak 3 kör ment le, így "csak" 6 óra volt a pakolással együtt:) Bár akár másfél óra alatt vége lehetett volna, de nem sokon múlt, hogy 6 helyett nem 8 lett.

RATING: 7
Based on six games. Clear rules, but tricky points and a lot of subsystems. Also, if you aren't clear on the religious rules the papacy/protestant game seems simplistic, but I suspect it's got a few cute interactions. 

Tough to determine how much control players have, but a good experience. In fact, my main concern are having players have to sit out most/all of a turn (which is an hour) due to a few card effects. I don't mind losing, but I want to be playing...

But incredible theme, etc.

The background is extremely enticing, and the game does its best (as many GMT games do) in sucking players into the historical context.
Every different power plays in a very different way, and the result is a game of balance, where everyone's position need to take into account its own objectives and victory conditions, as well as the chances others have to win.
I sense a couple of potential (big?) problems here: 
1. the game is massively long, with almost eternal turns (not quite "dense" of meaningful decisions);
2. the religious powers are quite tedious to play, at least in the first few turns, compared to others (it seems many of their actions are about very small changes of control, very easily reversed).
I feel the compulsion to play it again, but I wonder if I will ever have the occasion...

Here I Stand is an event game!  In order to play, everyone involved needs to really commit themselves.  I knew about a month in advance that I was going to be spending my ENTIRE Saturday playing Here I Stand.  I prepared myself by reading and re-reading the rulebook, studying the Cards, looking at basic strategy articles, etc.  However, what I did not prepare myself for was the excessive downtime between turns.

I assumed that it would be entertaining to observe the various player powers in action.  Well, I was dead wrong.  The religious struggle between the Papacy and Protestants is perhaps the most boring dicefest in gaming AND it is the most time consuming activity in Here I Stand!  My advice for those who haven't played is to leave the room and not come back until the Protestant player announces that his or her turn is over.

So other than the downtime, is Here I Stand a good game?   Well, I really enjoy making secret negotiations with the other powers.  It can get pretty intense making non-binding agreements with players that may or may not fulfill their end of the bargain.  I also enjoy the overall concept of the game.  Unfortunately, I really want to like Here I Stand more than I actually do.  The pacing is waaay too slow and almost all of your decisions are based on the luck of the dice.

RATING: 4
Long but enjoyable for all involved, little downtime for players as plotting strategy and possible alliances take time. Also, one has to watch other player actions to time the play of cards accordingly. A run away leader can auto win after 4 turns, but others can take steps to prevent that. I don't enjoy the diplomacy aspect as much as other players and this really kills my desire to play again. Also  the asymetry of the player powers means there is a high learning curve.

I was one of the playtesters and have played the game a couple of times by now. Here I Stand is just a great design, well-balanced and full of atmosphere. At the beginning of the playtest, I had been somewhat concerned that there might be too much chrome and historical detail in there. But Ed was absolutely right in leaving everything in. This game will become a reference for all other multiplayer CDGs to follow.

As of March 2016, there are forty-six BGG pages of rules' questions--forty-six!  I wonder how this compares with other CDG's.  If I were to give HiS a rating lower than ten, it would be because the RULES ARE A SHAMEFUL MESS!  Even in the second edition, there are enough holes, gaps, things placed hither and yon, to sink this game into a bottomless well of despair.  Hello?!  Ed Beach: are you listening?!  Please revise this revised rulebook and at least provide an INDEX.  Hello?!

Then there is that "thing" called a scenario book.  Why waste time and energy and print on those historical snippets that are too thin to satisfy anyone's interest?  Why not include a complete--A COMPLETE--full turn--FULL TURN--example of play beginning, hello?!, with the 1517 scenario?  Why take us to 1532 when we are scratching our heads over 1517?  

I have mixed feelings about this game, but the design effort and GMT quality mean that it must receive a ten.  The grandeur, scope, and vision are both HIS's strength and its weakness.  More to follow.

This is just an awesome game.  It is very long (usually 10+ hours) but the time just flies by.  There is lots of opportunity for diplomatic give and take, and games will usually see alliances form, crumble, and re-form as the balance of power shifts.  Also a great historical game that can teach quite a bit about the period of Reformation. It's not just a military game, in fact it is usually very difficult to win by just military might.  Each player has "alternate" means of gaining VPs (different for every player) that usually also needs to be pursued in order to win.

The game is quite interesting. It's full of period chrome, you can see the author really try to design a flavour game and he was successfull.
The downside is a rulebook full a specific and difficult to learn rules. However if you commit yourself you can have some interesting games where the 6 powers have 6 different strategies and gamestyle. This is good.
The real point I criticize is that the final result often depends by some die rolling over which there is no real control.
Explorations, colonies, english heir all depend by sheer dice luck. No good to have 9 hours game decided by a single die roll, but this can really happen. 
Furthermore I've found the playing the Protstant can be a boring experience

While being a historical simulation and therefore rather scripted, there are more than enough possibilities for all players to choose their own strategy. Only the Protestants seem to be forced into one strategy. I like the two different layers in the game. The religious struggle and the political game exist alongside each other. Each nation has different intererests in these two struggles. This combined with the different player powers makes for interesting interaction between the nations. I love the diplomacy phase where almost anything can be bargained for. The exclusion of specific card exchanges is a good exception to this rule. All in all a very immersive historical wargame covering one of the most interesting periods in European history.

The stories coming out of a game of Here I Stand make this a fun and memorable experience, and my favorite CDG. Review available on the game page. 

If you have 6 players, introduce Here I stand before Virgin Queen. It is much easier to instruct each player what their motivations and goals are in Here I Stand, Virgin Queen is more interesting, but much more difficult to teach to new players.

Bought at Tinnies closing down sale; can't wait to play.

AFTER ONE PLAY:
While but on an interesting set of interlocking mechanics on paper, most of the criticisms I have seen are accurate: the religious conflict plays out in an entirely separate way to the political conflict. the new world feels tacked on as well. The cards play too small a role for the game to be thought of as card-driven, maybe card-assisted is more appropriate. Starting positions enforce most historical behaviours in a way, say, Twilght Struggle doesn't, which is irritating. And ultimately it's a dice-fest, which is never all that interesting. 

The biggest flaw is that it just cannot justify its own length. Why does it take eight hours? I don't understand why it takes eight hours! I am sure it could be streamlined and thus shortened, though after only one play I couldn't tell you how. 

I want to try it three player to see if it improves. 

EDIT: Jan '13 - sold to Chris (Alleyooper). Glad it's gone to a good home!

Balanced multiplayer war games (true war games, not just conflict sims) are extraordinarily rare. Here I Stand not only pulls it off, but creating a layered, asymmetrical, card driven war game that takes up to six players. Outstanding, in every respect.

A brilliant design.  The way spaces have both political control and religious control puts almost all of the 6 powers in direct contact with each other.

It's best with 6 players, but that of course means a little bit of downtime.  The game can be played by as few as 3 players: depending on the number, some players play two powers.  It's a bit cumbersome, but it works as nice as possible for a multi-player wargame.

RATING: 7.5
Multi-player CDG centered on the period of the Reformation. Similar to The Napoleonic Wars but set about 250 years earlier. Units, leaders, navies, keys, Home Cards, diplomacy and minor powers are all similar but the mechanics have been tweaked.

The kicker here is the Protestant vs. Catholic overlay and a good part of the game involves only the Papal player and the protestant player. It is an interesting overlay at first but soon simply contributes to an inordinant amount of downtime for the other four players. Maybe the answer is that the sweet spot for this game will be with fewer players although I have trouble seeing how...

Some good ideas but this ends up being way too long a game for what it is. For a good multi-player CDG, I'll stick with The Napoleonic Wars or Wellington.

As a history lover, I must say that great history does not necessarily make a great game.  I have little interest in the religious struggle that occurs in this game and it greatly slows game play for the other powers who have minimal interest in it.  I have played France and feel its' path to victory seems pretty straightforward. The HRE's multi-front role seems to be a huge pain in the ass.  Thus, the only powers that interest me right now are England and the Ottomans.  That said, the cards and combat are quite a crap shoot also.

Played a 3 player introduction game. It was very fun, and interesting. Only drawback was the time. Played 1,5 turn in 4 hours. Way to time comsuming. Maybe because it was our intro game and the rule reading took to much time that slowed us down.

Think the rating will go up as soon as we manage to get a higher impulse/hour rate :)
Was very well received with a high replay value.

Update:
Has played several PBEM games.
If playing F2F is as fun as plying on PBEM, this game will really shine.

Perhaps the best CDG out there. The more abstracted
treatment of the diplomatic/military decisions makes
the god-role presented in some of the cards less 
disturbing. I don't feel the cards are really 
resources that a nation is expending, but more just
a gamey mechanism, which is harder to accept when
the games get into too much detail.

Brilliant game play and negotiation mechanics.  More structured than TI3, yet just as intriguing due to the asymmetric victory objectives.  

My fourth game played was my first as a non-English power (Protestants!).  We ended on Turn 6, and even though I was the only player to get to 25 VPs, England ending up winning at the end of the that turn by 2 vp's (23 to 21 or so, no one else was close).  Loads of fun!

The time commitment is the only thing holding me back from rating this one higher. I'll certainly turn down a game if there's not time. But for a late night marathon, such as at a convention, Here I Stand is a great choice, a 9. The game has lots of things going on at once -- political, military and religious struggles, diplomacy, hand management, bluffing and timing are all important elements. The theme is very engaging, but sometimes the play feels a bit scripted. Even so, I'll be looking for more opportunities to play.

RATING: 5
I've had to take my rating down to a 5. I think HIS does a lot of interesting stuff, it seems to have learned a few things from (and is much superior to) The Napoleonic Wars, and the complexity is tough but managable. I like the various different player positions, I like the historical flavor, I like the fact that the systems are fairly streamlined, and I like the fact that it's neither a wide-open bash-the-leader-fest (A Game of Thrones) nor a constrained railroad-job (The Napoleonic Wars), but finds a nice spot in between where you have some options but it's not a total free-for-all (at least, in the early game; the later game can be a bit of a whine-fest). In my opinion the card deck isn't quite right, but it's a lot better than many other recent multi-player efforts.

But HIS still has a few problems though, some of them fairly significant.

The small-picture problems revolve around the religious conflict. The reformation/counter-reformation process is very time-consuming for trivial payoffs. You're adding up and rolling tons of dice for minor control changes while the rest of the players doze off. This needed to be streamlined. Related to this, the Papacy and Protestant positions are pretty dull, especially early. The Hapsuburgs,  Ottomans, and to a lesser extent the English are in interesting positions and can drive elements of the game. But because the whole reformation/counter-reformation thing is time-consuming and weak, the religious players get mired in tedium from time to time.

The big-picture problem, and perhaps the much more serious problem, is pacing. Just not enough happens each turn, and those turns are too far apart in time. Play a card, take 3 ops, raise a mercenary and move north. Wait 5 minutes. Roll for a siege. Wait 5 minutes. Put out a "conquest" marker. Wait 5-10 minutes. The density of interesting and meaningful decisions simply is not high enough, and so the game never really gathers momentum and things can be tedious.

As a final point, the practical obstacles to play (the game really seems to want 5-6 players and needs at least 6-8 hours budgeted - although if it goes the distance, it could require 12 hours) are considerable.

It's tough, because HIS has interesting parts and can be fun, so I don't want to overstate my criticisms. But I just don't think it's going to have staying power for most players. Given the pacing issue, it's too long, requires too many people, and I'm not sure it's dynamic enough. The full 9-turn game is a total non-starter, and the 1517 game has some issues as well (it takes too long to really get rolling, I think, and early on the Protestants and Papacy can feel like they're play a whole different, and rather less interesting, game). But then the later scenarios have issues too; they are much more free-for-alls, and so are far more about personal dynamics than the actual game.

This was very disappointing to me, because I think it clearly could have been a top-of-the-line game. But alas, it's not.

Last thing, it seems to me like some of the complaints about downtime are a little over-blown. The downtime here will be extreme if you play with people much slower than you, but this isn't exactly news. For me the downtime, although not great, is not the big problem as it is in some bigger multi-player games. The problem is specifically one of pacing: you're doing stuff, just not very much of it matters.

Amazingly simple and streamed lined for a game with a 40 page rules.  

However the length and down time during turn was a major turn off for me.

A thematically most evocative game. Few - if any - games match Here I Stand's success in portraying a whole era.Yet I do have a couple of reservations:- As far as I'm concerned, there are too many overly straightforward command points/victory points converters, which lack in strategic depth. The New World, St. Peter, French chateaux, etcetc. The most egregious offender's the New World IMO with its many VPs. Apart from the resource allocation decision in favour of the New World, there's no strategy involved whatsoever (save for discovery choices you sometimes have). I think that's inadequate considering how important this sub-system is in the game. I believe only a few easily digestible rules could have given the New World proper strategic depth. Since the New World VPs can often be decisive, greater player control would reduce the VP luckfest element.  My belief is that all extra complexity has to pay off in terms of increased strategic depth. The New World strikes me as inadequate in this  regard (as other parts of the game).- Getting a healthy Edward is too easy. Historically, that did not happen. In the game, you're pretty much assured to get him provided you take your marital duties seriously. :p Anyway, I think there's once again too much luck involved. You might succeed already with Anne Boleyn or have to labour on for years. I'm personally rather fond of the idea of adding a -1 drm to the pregnancy roll. That'd mean you'd have to work your way towards the ultimate goal rather than it being perhaps all decided on the first roll. (Of course, such a variant would require other tweaks for balance's sake).- There are too many lucky VPs in the deck. That whopping +2 VP Copernicus is simply too great a card, IMO, considering how close the frontrunners usually are. Once again a too straightforward boost, IMO.- Ottoman Piracy. There's not enough of an incentive for the Christian Med powers to actively thwart Barbarossa & Co's efforts since when you hand over a VP, all powers lose relative to the Ottomans. You'd basically have to be an altruist to pursue an active anti-piracy campaign. Not at all satisfactory, IMO. Personally, I'd tweak the rules in such a manner that the first pirate result against a power cannot be satisfied by giving the Sultan a VP. That'd give the Christian Med powers something of an incentive to keep the piracy threat in check etc.- Play balance. Generally pretty good, but some positions are too vulnerable in regards to being ganged up upon when in a leading position than others. France, the Protestants and the Papacy. What irks me to no end, is that the Ottomans and Habsburgs can legally forge an alliance. That can allow Suleiman to deploy through Germany right to France's doorstep. A leading France facing this threat in addition to say the Habsburgs and English joining in, is going to lose out bigtime. I think this Ottoman-Habsburg ploy is extremely gamey, unrealistic and unbalancing. I recommend forbidding it. That way, the Ottomans can still attack France, but they'll usually have to take the sea route to the Provence, which is far more realistic and not unbalancing. The religious powers are also very vulnerable to being ganged up upon. Already a one turn Habsburg-Ottoman ceasefire can spell the Protestants' doom. All this means that the three powers here mentioned have a far tougher time emerging on top when being in a leading position going into a turn than the other three more robust powers.- The religious struggle can appear to be too much about dice-rolling at times. It's not uninteresting, but doesn't really quite match the military side in terms of strategic interest, I believe.All the same, Here I Stand is a marvelous game.

A clever design, meshing military campaigns, piracy, exploration of the new world, religious reformation debates, chateau building and Henry's quest for an heir into a single game. I like the asymmetry, the turn-by-turn alliances and throwing big handfuls of dice for battles. I was left a bit bored by the drawn-out religious tug-of-war for territory between the Papacy and the Protestants due to my lack of involvement. The rulebook is excellent but there are a LOT of small rules to remember!

First game: 8 turns. Lucky win as the Ottomans, due to late invasion of Italy, only managed a few VPs from piracy. 
Second game: 5 turns. Dismal loss as the French, at war with England throughout.

Rules reminder:
Players can't lay siege to a port key space if enemy fleets present.
Players can't lay siege if lines of communication cut off.

Here I Stand...The game was easily to be messed up as the results of erratic plays and tiny rules but once you commited to the rules, this game will hook you to its tense atmosphere.  Different players with victory paths at managable levels.  The game also provides a great deal of tension and rewards long term planning.  The game is bounded by the historical background of religious reformation but it gives players to a certain extent of flexibility of alliance.  Like tK and France became the first alliance in 1517 in our first round of the game but it seems to be impossible for this pair of the dearest enemies of the world in reality.   The game is also well implemented the difficulties of the Protestant to spread the reformation message, debates in electorate from different languages and translate bibles at the very beginning of the game.  
Needless to say, Protestant was still being trapped inside the Germany without giving any threats to Papacy in the first round.  UK would not be able to focus on marriage but looked into some opportunities to explore the new world.  However 2 continents had beed occupied by Hapsburg because of some well organized exploration team. 
If you love the historical events in 1517 about Martin 95 thesis...if you love playing war games with diplomacy...if you love playing games with tons of historical background...if you love playing games with asymmetry powers...if you are not afraid of tiny rules....if you can line up 5 more buddies to play with you...you are better not to try or even not to see this game...otherwise you will be hooked and unable to extricate.

A great game with prefect climat, especially for people who are interested in history. Very intense and involving. 
You are acting as one of the main state in the beginning of the XVI century. Every state has it's own way to achive victory. For some it's a way of military conquest, for others war for religious influence. In order to win you must arrange diplomatic agreements and gather VP for different actions. It's also very important not to allow other players to get to much VP. 

This game has only two flaws, that makes it not perfect - it's too long - one game can last more than 12 hours and there is too much dice rolling - especially when figting for religious influence.
That's way I rated it 8 and not 10

RATING: 9
:coffee: :( :what: :) :what: :what: :D The head thinks that HIS is a game that has some brilliant features but goes on unfeasably long (though experience is chipping away at the downtime), has some draggy mechanics (again, experience helps), and suffers from too many situations where the standard CDG mechanism of event vs. ops points is boring or trivial (yeeeeah, this is a bit of an issue). The heart says wheeeeee fun stabby goodness with tons of historical trivia and opportunities for complex diplomatic negotiations...

The heart wins. I love this beyond reason.

HIS is a six-player game -- three is playable but not ideal, and I can see the two-player version potentially being fun but with a backlog of purpose-built two player games on my shelf it will be a long time before I find out. It is significantly non-zero-sum in its victory conditions and there are butterfly effects aplenty as players attempt to bash the leader to the benefit of an unexpected third party.

Two potentially negative effects arise from this asymmetry: first, the religious conflict feels distant from most players -- the subtle ways in which the other players interact with the Pope and Luther's boys do not become remotely clear until a couple of games, and even then it's complicated. Combine that with the limited effectiveness of the Pope's early actions and the lengthy downtime while the gownies have their debates and you have a recipe for frustration on the part of players cooling their heels waiting to stick pointy things in their enemies.

Second, this truly is a multi-player game that embraces the political aspect of multi-player games. HIS is won or lost at the negotiation table, and as such it necessitates players who commit to talking to potential allies (however unlikely) and maintain the delicate geopolitical balance. As goes Diplomacy, so goes HIS: isolationism = death.

All this adds up to a general truism that is more true of this than most: with the right group, this is an amazing experience. With a group of the wrong size, or uncommitted to the game as it is, this is just a [i]long[/i] experience. Cav empt.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This game uses a similar engine to The Napoleonic Wars, but has stripped down the combat system to add two interesting new elements: (1) interphase negotiation and (2) the religious wars between the Protestants and Papists.  The game truly shines only with six players, but it was awesome to see it in action at BGG Con 2008 and 2009.  Another game is schedule for this year, 2010.  

My favorite aspect of this game is probably the negotiation segment, and the fact that every player in the game has multiple options for winning.  I also like the battlefield mechanics in which the outcome is essentially random: making battles very risky, as they were historically.  

The games I've played felt very balanced, but they have all been "newb" games so far.  I'm wondering how well the game plays with experienced players?

RATING: 10
I really enjoyed it, although I think the negotiation is much less in a 3p game than what I'd expect with 6p. The game feels very well designed. Each power has some unique elements to make it interesting. I've no idea whether its very balanced. If anything, seems tough for the Papacy and maybe England. I think I'll get to play a 2p game soon, and would be interested in a 6p game...although that's most likely going to be a PBEM match. I think my rating may go up slightly, but there is a ceiling since I think multiplayer wargames have some inherent problems with kingmaking. Since negotiation is an overt part of this game, that's mitigated to a large extent, but its still not as satisfying to play (for me) as a 2p CDG.

Update: Played as 2p game with the Diplomacy Deck, the game works quite well, and really moves along. I'm looking forward to playing this one more. There is a lot of luck, particularly with the large number of reformation rolls, etc, but that doesn't bother me much. Dripping with theme.

Update: Playing with 6p as PBEM is the sweet spot. I'm not sure I'm ready to devote a full day to this one, but I can recall a time in life when I would have loved to. But the negotiation and diplomacy are the sweet stuff of the game. Each faction is so unique, but the play balance and narrative are very engaging. I expect I'll have a PBEM game going at all times for the next several months.

Very fun game.

Every turn there you are never left for things to do - always lots of options.  Most powers can invest cp's for vp's in some way (new world activities, spreading/countering the reformation, chateaus, piracy, etc.) but also have to pay attention to the military situation.

Interesting events, diplomacy is fun, just overall a great game!

My comments are based on 22 hours playing three different games.The subject is very intriguing, and as a learning tool HIS is great, as a game is way too static in order to catch my attention, nothing happens, everything is still. I also tried the 2 players version (published on Ci3) that solves some problems but that basically reduces HiS to a Papacy-Protestants struggle. [vote= 6 for the game; 7 for the history tool]

LOTS of downtime and long playtime (for the return) really knocks this one down a few notches for me.  Although, the theme is wonderful, and the diplomatic element really brings life to the game.  I will play again to understand the mechanics behind other powers.  

October 2012 - upped my rating to a 6. Not a bad game, but the downtime was huge. Familiarity would prob make this one a 10, but I can't see ever having the time to make it happen when TI3 is available.

RATING: 9
As of right now, a "9".    

Here it is 2017, and I'd never played "Here I Stand", but as a Johnny-Come-Lately, I am really enjoying this fascinating game.  I've played two full games so far, one as the Ottoman and one as the French.   I think there is a lot of runway left for me in this game because I want to play the other powers AND I want to play the French and Ottomans again.  (I made mistakes!)

There is sufficient period flavor, multiple ways-to-win, and even though the connection to historical events can be tenuous, I appreciate the lack of hard-scripting.  I acknowledge a couple of problems though.

First, and probably most important, there is a problem with game pacing.  In our gaming group, a turn typically progresses very rapidly through the Ottomans, Hapsburgs, English, and French, but then bogs down while the Papacy and the Protestants roll dice for twenty minutes.  I'm still new enough to the game that I am intrigued with the religious actions, but the rest of the group is clearly restless and one of the veterans of the group has been suggesting that we play a second wargame on the side while the Papacy and the Protestants duke it out.  This is not a good sign for those who despise downtime.

Second, the learning curve on this game is LONG.  Personally, that makes a game very attractive to me and serves to increase the longevity of my interest.   However, we are still learning the best ways to recover from a bad hand of cards, the intricacies of diplomacy, how to fend off all the numerous threats as the Hapsburgs, and the best moves to counteract those pesky Barbary Pirates.  In the meantime, those of us with less fortitude (like me) periodically commence cursing our luck or whining in frustration.

Overall, I want to play this at least three or four more times, and after that, with 60+ hours of game entertainment under my belt, how do you "update" the rating for a game?   No doubt there will come a time when I'm ready to move on to other games, but I'm going to leave this one at "9".   Even after I'm done exploring HIS, it's been a great adventure!

I enjoy the theme, which is very well integrated. I am glad I got a chance to play it. However, it takes too long and is too much beat on the leader/hide in last place before making a move for me.

I could see myself playing again, especially if I spent more time reading the history, but overall think there are better games out there.

Card-driven war games aren't my thing. The theme is cool, and I think the mechanics work fairly well for what it is. As a six-player game, though, it seems like the religious factions have almost nothing to do for the first few turns, which I see as a big negative. Supposedly it works really well as a three-player game.

Wow, what a fantastic game.  Massively multi-dimensional with enough historical theme to truly engage you throughout.  A wargame at its heart but one with an excellent diplomacy element layered on that can take it to a whole new level - the bluffs and threats, especially the Papacy using its excommunication abilities, is exhilarating.  While I have played it a few times, I certainly feel that there is so much more that I need to learn about optimum decisions and strategy, although I can now see where some choices will be much more productive than others.  A top-rated game, for sure!

RATING: 7
The simulation during reformation period is really hit it all. Mechanically and thematically, it's perfect. And by the main mechanic to be CDG, it really brings out the dilemma of playing cards for conventional means or events. The asymmetry of each factions really brings out the theme. There are a lot of rules that covered almost all of things that happened during that time. 

The downside is it's not really scaleable number of players, since all the factions need to be played. And I don't really dig historical theme, unless it's spanning across ages like Civilization.

Currently, playing the French. One of the most enjoyable multi-player historical wargames I have played in recent times. The different layers of actions and different methods of gaining VPs mirror the best of German games as well like eg Princes of Florence, Amun Re etc, whilst retaining a very good sense of historicity (something which german games lack).

Play of the Ottomans is reminiscent of Gaulish play in Sword of Rome.

But the majors, and i mean really majors, drawbacks are the needs for beeing acquainted with an ultra extensive rulebook and...the availability to dispose one entire day to play it! (that´s the main reason for my "low" rating of 8).
If you are new to the game, beware of that sudden and sneaky protestant victory that comes from nowhere at the middle of the game.

2 plays.
Long, boring, clunky and a monster dicefest.
This is not a wargame AT ALL, it is inferior to Risk in that aspect (!).
This is not a strategy game neither, some much dice roll and huge impacts in random cards, don’t even bother trying to plan much, follow the flow turn by turn and try not to fall asleep.
The worst part is the game design which is an incredible failure. There are so many solitary processes specific to each country (Bible translation, wedding, St Pierre etc.) that have so limited impacts and interactions with the other players that it totally kills the pace and the focus of the game.
As a diplomatic and negotiation game it is a failure aswell, as it is clunky and procedural in its execution and has too much solitary processes.

RATING: 3
Just doesn't work for me. Have played 3 times - they are long affairs at 10-12 hours.  My biggest complaint and the deal-breaker for me is that after 12 hours of playing, it seems like I did basically nothing.  My troops and territory are hardly different from when I started - with having to winter all the time, you can't take territory and hold it; until the end is near then you rush out to get points.  Also, REALLY suffers from the gang up on the leader - if you are about to win everyone will gang up to prevent it.  I consider the game broken. Sorry, I just don't get it and if I'm going to game for 12 hours, I can think of 100 other games to get on the table.  There are times during the game I have sat for 20 minutes and done NOTHING. The one (and only) redeeming feature is that it's a group of 6 so it ends up being a social affair, rather than a gaming affair.

RATING: 5
Love it for the history and the work that went into it. I'm less interested in sitting through a game of it, though. The players are not involved in the whole game; rather, each player has a few sub-games that concern him to the exclusion of other sub-games that don't. Watching other players play a portion of their game while you wait for your turn is not to my taste.

Very long game that just isn't that fun. Was playing the Lutherans and I didn't feel like I had many interesting decisions to make. Maybe my expectations were too high since the setting and premises are all perfect fits for me. Must admit I fail to see what the hype is all about. Would be willing to give it another go, but it's just such a long game that requires 5 or 6 players I can't really see when that would be possible.

RATING: N/A
(Comments based on a 3-player game that just ran a few turns)  I was pleasantly surprised by this -- the rules are a bit longer than I normally go for, but they're very well written.  The individual parts aren't tough to understand, but there are a LOT of them.  Only one of the three players had played before (or even read the rules), so we screwed up a lot of stuff.  We're not an uptight group, so we just chalked it up to a learning game.  The basics are similar enough to Napoleonic Wars that if you're familiar with that one, you can get up and running to some extent here.

The actual process of playing the game was more fun than I expected it to be -- there are some restrictions, but not so many that you don't feel like you're making decisions.  I'd like to try it again with a better handle on things.  However, I don't know that I'd want to play with more than 2 or 3 players.  Playing only one of the six sides could mean an unacceptable ratio of stuff to do vs. play time.  We'll see. . .

RATING: 7
Excellent historical theme, with six different players having differing goals and paths to victory. I greatly enjoyed the games I played. You definitely get a real sense of history here. The game play itself is interesting because each player has different objectives, and some players have actions available to them that are not available to others. The way the religious conflict is handled, via reformation and counter reformation attempts, along with debates, is pretty cool.

The game does suffer from "Must Be Played A Certain Way" syndrome, however. Having even one bad player can cause a chain reaction of weird behavior from the rest of the players that can tilt the game out of whack. I've seen a few games now that were messed up as the result of inexperience and/or erratic play. There's also a fair amount of luck, and if you just can't get the ops, no amount of diplomatic skill will make up the difference.

On top of that, I've never actually seen the game go past turn 6, with most games ending a turn or even two before that. This is problematic since it means some of the more powerful Papacy and Protestant cards often never come into play, and it's not like there's a lot either of those powers can do in the event one of the military powers starts to roll.

That said, it's still an enjoyable game that I probably wouldn't refuse to play with the right crowd. One a side note, this game has found its niche in the PBEM arena, as the downtime for F2F games can be aggravating. I recommend the most experienced player take the Hapsburgs.

Includes 2p Diplomacy deck from C3I #19.

I really like what this is trying to do and the design is very solid. However, having played (albeit only once) I think there are a few problems with this as a game experience as far as I am concerned. 

Six players, which is the ideal/recommended player count, stretches the viable player count for a game of this complexity and length, and the CDG format itself. There is simply too much downtime between turns and what is happening at the other side of the board is simply not of enough relevance to be that interesting - unless you are the Habsburgs, in which case everything is of interest. I suspect it is hard, but not impossible, to come back from a bad start, but it is a long game if you are not able to. Some of the event cards can also be quite devastating - you could play an excellent turn with clever planning and tactical execution only to have someone hit you with a single card that would more than wipe anything you've done out, simply by them having drawn the right card. Again, I just think it is too long a game for such things to be deciding factors. 

I would play it again just to see how some of the game works out that I didn't see on my first play, but I wouldn't arrange to play it, so my own copy has gone up for sale/trade (SOLD).

If I want to play a multi-player CDG I would go with Successors - everyone stays interested for more of the game and it's much easier to bounce back from a bad start.

It's a very good game and it's fun to try out the different factions but to me the game is just a bit too unbalanced/luck-driven to be really great. I wish I could come up with a tweak for the new world as I feel the biggest problem with the games lies there. Another problem is that the game usually ends in turn 4-5, so you never get to experience the endgame.The rulebook and the support from the designer are both fantastic.

Update: With some more plays the game tends to last longer as people are better at spotting leaders and dealing with them which makes the game better. Nice to finally see some of the late game cards.

Update 2: This game is one of the best on-line games around. Try it!

Excellent combination of asymmetric diplomacy, warfare, and strategic cardplay.  The one drawback is that you really need 6 players, and they all need to have a clue, which means sitting down with the rules for at least an hour.  It's tough to get eurogamers to do that. All that said, if you give me six players, and a free day, this is what we're doing.

I confess: I fell for the hype.  After hearing for months how great this game was, I got a copy.  Meh.  I could tell right away that it was never going to hit the table more than once.

It's a huge game, best played with six people, in which everyone has his own goals he needs to reach in order to win the game.  That part sounded terribly interesting, but the game was complicated enough and long enough that I couldn't imagine who the hell I would have played it against.  And I certainly didn't relish the aspect of teaching it to five people at once....

Traded it away (along with Freedom: The Underground Railroad) for 1714: The Case of the Catalans and Road to Enlightenment in May 2015.

Update 2015: I think that as an actual game this thing is effectively broken, but I still like it for the story it everytime manages to tell and the tension it always produces.

This is a great diplomacy game. What happens on the board is pretty much a side-show. The most important things happen during the diplomacy phase. After that you are usually in for a very bumpy ride. Watching things unfold is simply amazing. 

Works as well with email as face to face.

Maybe my rating should be ten...

For pure flavour, richness of gameplay and interlocking mechanics this must count as one of the most interesting multi-player war(?)-games ever produced. A real gem and a labour of love. (note: updated to 10 after more intensive study of the game, it really is that good)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun card-driven wargame that makes a bold ambition to cover all aspects of the 'religious' wars in Europe of the 16th century. The game has a lot of flavour, down to individual characteristics of Henry VIII's six wives and theological debates of the Reformation. Very enjoyable if you are familiar with the history. However, the game is clearly overchromed. There's a lot of 'chromic specificities' - rules that are applicable to very specific situations only. This gives the game design a lack of holistic flow which hinders getting the game right. You can play this game three times and still get critical rules wrong. For the 'military' powers, the military aspect is quite satisfactory, as it's quite difficult to get the requisite keys and will require strong strategic play and manoeuvre. But for the Papacy and the Protestants, the game is a crap-shoot. Not much strategy as a lot is dependent on dice-rolling. The game balance is also very delicate. I suspect that replayability of this game will dry up after the 5th or 6th play because players are pretty much constrained to the point where the best move is usually quite obvious and will be repeated in subsequent games.

I have a real fondness for big games with big ideas and a lot of pieces and a lot of players.  But I sort of dread the idea of starting another game of this.  All of the potential benefits of a great long multiplayer conflict and negotiation game are choked by the limitations of the card-driven mechanics and the victory point system.  Each player has a scripted role and only a few variations in the way they can approach the game.  Too much history, not enough game.

December 2014 EDIT: OK, so this is STILL MY FAVORITE GAME. I will always play it, time permitting. If I only had one game to play, this would be it, and I would be happy. 

But I'm dropping it down to a 9. I am doing so for two reasons:
1. This game is enormously dependent on the quality of the group. This is true with most games, but my last two experiences were incredibly frustrating because of one or two players who just didn't get it, even a few hours in. The game demands a minimal level of competence from all players; typically, the balance of powers demands that the better players inform the less experienced players of what they ought to be doing. Usually, this works fine. But if you have a loose cannon who wants to play a different game entirely, you're in for a miserable second half of the game. 
2. Ed Beach let the mutants who make up the "community" decide against streamlining religious roles AS AN OPTIONAL RULE. Mr. Beach, Sir, I would very much like the option to play with VQ religious rules. May your informal poll be burned at the stake.

10/10 with a great group.

This is an assymetrical multiplayer CDG which pits the great players of the Reformation period.  In between building castles, beheading uncooperative wives, burning heretics, pillaging Europe and America, nailing posters to church doors and retaining a modecum of territorial integrity, the players must find a away to plot a path to 25 VP's all the while avoiding the pitfalls of taking an early lead.  Much could be said about the power of debate, especially during the crucial Diplomacy phase, but I think it is the judicious use of firewood to warm up the conviction of heretics which hooked me to this great game.  Yes, 6 players and 6+ hours are by no means easy to muster, but I would never turn down an opportunity to play again.

[5 plays]I love how much history comes through this game.  Every power approaches the game so differently, it's quite a sight to see the complex web of interactions and rich diplomacy. 

There are a few downsides, though, the most obvious being the length of the rulebook and game itself.  There's a lot of ganging up on the leader so unless you're going to win the game, there's little point in pressing too much of an advantage and the game tends to be about preventing others with good streaks of luck from winning while still keeping yourself in the game.  Dice rolls at the edge of the bell curve can be [i]huge[/i].  Even though the game seems very balanced, I feel like many of these powers rely too heavily on getting a few really good rolls without which they're little threat.  

The powers with more cards are just more interesting to play, in my opinion.  The more cards you have, the more decisions you have and the more opportunities for interesting diplomacy.  I want to rate this a lot higher because I can see how great this game is for the right audience, but ultimately too little of the game is thought provoking for me actively suggest playing it.  I have recently been having a grand time just enjoying the "experience" of the game, especially PBEM, but I imagine it will eventually wear thin and the game underneath won't be quite my thing.

El HIS es quizás el wargame más completo que he visto y podido jugar en decadas.
Las reglas están perfectamente engrasadas y permiten el juego de 6 potencias de caracteres diametralmente opuestos, cada una con sus métodos e intereses distintos para ganar, en ello influye decisivamente su motor de cartas, porque pienso que con los métodos tradicionales del wargame no hubiera podido ser.
Además una lección de historia en cada momento, jugando dan ganas de profundizar en esa turbulenta época.
Graficamente una gozada en su version deluxe, componentes supercuidados y con estetica colorida y fantastica, tablero montado, carton grueso, multiples ayudas, etc... una verdadera maravilla ver el tablero desplegado y 6 jugadores en mesa.
Un "must have" sin duda para todo wargamer que se precie.

02ABR2014 Reduzco la nota al juego, que sigue siendo brutalmente bueno, pero me he dado cuenta que la mecánica de juego de los bandos "religiosos" toma en cuenta tantos factores que su turno se convierte en tedioso si no se cuenta con medios informáticos para simplificar. Así, en una partida standard, el 70% del tiempo correspondería a estos dos contendientes, y el 30% al resto de participantes. Habría que simplificar esto de alguna manera...ahí lo dejo...

As a historician I enjoy those games that show somehow any parte of History. In this case, the game success in that task because it really puts you in "the moment".

You rule one of the major powers in Europe during the dawn of Lutheranism and the Reform. And when I say "you rule" I mean that you can really fill the problems of all the powers involved in the strugle. Here I Stand has the ability of recreate the historical situation with a great card driven system and an easy to learn rulebook.

Is a game that takes several hours to be played but, at the end, the time pass incredibly fast. That's good in a game so intense!

Here I Stand is one of the best games I've ever played.  So, if you want to play, just call me :-)

RATING: 6.5
Each power plays so differently that I feel like I'm just barely beginning to understand this game.  Will feel safer making comments after more plays. Not sure yet that I like the sense of the Protestants and Catholics playing a completely separate game. 

Update: I'm finding that a deck shared between 6 powers kind of bores me.  I've played this game twice in a row with almost zero non-home cards that contained a usable/useful event.  So a hand of cards for me has just been a hand of CPs, which takes away much of the intrigue of a cdg.  Another complaint: my overall philosophy of cdgs is that the cards need to be plentiful enough to offset some bad luck in the draws (e.g. Wellington) or be fairly balanced in their values.  In HIS the cards are enormously unbalanced, yet they are so precious that some bad draws in the first couple of turns almost guarantees that you'll spend the next 10 hours trying to avoid being a kingmaker rather than truly competing.  My dream version of this game would be power-specific decks, a la Sword of Rome (without SoR's broken CRT).

An instant classic from the very first play.  The design here is true genius; six independent sub-games being played by 6 players that are all completely intertwined and balanced.  The history is treated with great respect by the deisgn and the rules are not terrible complicated as long as each player knows their powers special rules and objections.  Such a wonderful gaming experience that it is really a shame that it requires 6 players to get it to shine.

This is a fine game, well balanced and well play-tested.

I especially like the fact that, basically, it is six different games in one, as each player has his own set of rules. Though there is a great deal of overlap, there are also entire sections that only affect one, two or three players. Just think of the wife track for England or the Turkish corsairs or the Hapsburg/English/French exploration sub-system or the Papacy vs. Protestant religious wars. Despite this, the game is tense and as fast paced as any 6-player game I've encountered. I would say, however, that not all of the factions will interest all of the players. For example, not everyone will find the Protestant position of particular interest. And while the Pope has a greater range of abilities, he is weak in most of them. 

For those who like the period, or multi-player games, a must.  

Simply put, this is one remarkable game.

Not for the faint of heart.  This is very much a wargame, with a correspondingly complex rule set.  The historical events do a great job of bringing the theme to life, but you need to be prepared for lots of dice rolling, computing modifiers, and following references within the rulebook.

I was not impressed with the organization of the rules.

I'm hoping I have absorbed enough of the rules that I can spend more time *playing* the next time this hits the table.

I've played this game and it's fantastic. I always go back and forth between whether or not I like Virgin Queen or this game better. What I like most about this game is it's more military focused and forces players to do more on the map. This way everyone is not just patronizing artists all game.

This is a really fun game.  Unfortunately, I only have a few games under my belt, but I can't wait to play again.  The game has some down time as others are taking their turns, but the depth of the game is absorbingly fun regardless of the downtime.  After some more plays, this is a "10" for me.

To have a decently played game, ALL players must understand all its nuances.  Otherwise, it will end early and unsatisfying as someone reaches their victory conditions before the others get into things completely.
The Pope vs Protestants religion subgame is fun for them, sheer boredom for everyone else.

If you want to learn about this period, read one of the many good books on it. The gaming experience is long, fiddly, and unsatisfying.

RATING: 8.5
I've moved this game down a bit.  It was a 10 for me, like, forever.  The only reason it has gone down is because I've played it a large number of times (for a huge campaign game) and extracted a lot of great gaming.  Overall this is a excellent game, combining the negotiation of Diplomacy with a strong wargame frame and wildly asymmetrical player positions.  Very few games have done this as well.

Nevertheless, higher level play in this game becomes very predictable, very static.  I'm not even that experienced a player and I can sense that I'm reaching a point where I know what is going to happen next---each power chooses from among a few options.  Worst of all, war is often not one of those options because it is a zero sum activity that has a high risk of failure.  Instead you min-max everything else (e.g. piracy).

Obviously I've cooled a bit since my review on BGG.

RATING: 6
I am pretty impressed with how this game captures the theme of such an interesting era, and I always like games where each player has their own objectives to consider.  Everyone plays a pretty different game yet there is  a lot of interaction.  I can understand how people might not like playing the Protestants or Catholics since their main objectives are to bicker amongst themselves while others get to go to war.  I think playing the Catholics is tough and of course I had a flurry of amazingly bad dice rolls at the beginning which hurt my situation plenty.

The game is daunting at first, but I think playtime will improve when people are familiar with the game.

Wow...what a game. This one has a lot of things I really look for. Every superpower plays completely differently, different ways of scoring points, different positioning, total asymmetry, but it feels fairly balanced. The theme is terrific and plays out quite well. There is a good amount of negotiation. I can see playing this game quite a bit and not getting tired of it. The downside to it is that I can't really see playing it with any less than six players. Also, the game is very rules heavy, particularly since each power uses operations slightly differently and has different decisions to make. I'm looking forward to playing this again, very enjoyable experience.

I usually don't much like games with diplomacy as emphasis, Here I Stand seems to be the exception of the rule. There is so many different things you can grab what to negoatiate that it becomes natural even for those who usually find diplomacy tedious and heavy. Tons of theme and atmosphere too. There are negative things of course, biggest being long playing time and need of 6 players for the most interesting and balanced game. I don't think the mechanics are best ever either, but that don't matter much because the as whole the game works and is really good. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a thorough simulation of the period, and in this respect a superb way to learn about the Reformation and the wars and politics of the age. In being a simulation the game can be restrictive on strategy. As Henry VIII you'll always find yourself siding with the Protestants. Most of all there are so many rules that one can easily get lost, while the game is quite capricious and frustrating. What it has in historical value it lacks in fun, so I sold it, but with many reservations. Overall, a good game that I would play with a group, but I prefer the less accurate, but far more fun second edition of the Napoleonic Wars, of which Here I Stand is a descendant.

If the period is among your favorites, then get this game as fast as you can. If the period interested me more then I might have kept it.

UPDATE: I think Darilian hit the nail on the head:

1). I don't like how there are so many seperate subsystems. Combat is different from the Debates, which is different from Exploration/Colonization.
You have to play the game at least THREE TIMES to say that you really know what the heck is going on. I prefer my games to be a bit more consistent.
2). I don't like how the game focuses so much on the seperate mechanics that it just DRAGS. Don't get me wrong- I love long games. But waiting for the Catholics and the Protestants to figure out their debates while as the Turk all you want to do is to smash Vienna gets old quick.

Awesome game! Good 3 or 6. Typically play this with 3 players as I cant handle the downtime of playing a 6 player with 4 non gamers. I would love to try a 6 player game with experienced players at a con but those are hard to organize.

Either way as a 3 player game it is great. The experience is still great fun despite losing some of the diplomacy. It usually turns into more of a military game as the arms race starts. Games are usually close and coming down to the wire around turn 4/5. Have not seen it go the distance.

The historic accuracy is like handcuffs in what or how you should plan your moves. Additionally there are tons of fiddly counters and lots of special rules to cope with. Despite the asymmetry it seems ok balanced. Still there is also a considerable luck factor when drawing cards. However I am not fond of the downtimes and wished it had a higher pace to keep me interested.

There's a special reserve for games which one must coordinate with a "no more, no less" number of players, and then meet those players in the morning with the intention of burning through the day.

When it works, it doesn't matter if two people just spent 20 whole minutes determining whether or not some obscure corner of Germany you'll never have to be concerned about has gone from purple to brown or vice versa. Let's just enjoy our time together, friends.

This game is different from your common wannabe wargames (all the true board wargames lives mostly in the 1980s and 1990s). It has religion... although they should have included the Muslim threat (the religion) and the Orthodox movement in the Christians, because it is even more important in eastern Europe than the Muslims, and also more present.

I know this is about the protestant movement, and they should have just limited the map to western Europe and leave the Ottomans as a bad event that can happen a couple of times during the game. I think the Ottomans have no reasons to be in the game as a player... they have no reasons to be there since the protestant movement ain't about the Muslims or the Ottomans and they had no influence on it nor did it get influenced by it since they're not even Christians.

Aside from that, I think it is an okay game with a very limited lifespan. Once you have played it once or twice, you have seen all what the game has to offer, and other games will just be pretty much the same in the end.

Don't buy this.

A really elegant game system.  Am a huge fan of PBEM with Cyberboard and ACTS.

Rating is for 6 player.  Would not play 4 player, and 3 player is a couple of points lower.

rating based on three three player games, two 2-player games, one 6 player PBEM, one 6 player tourney scenario, and one 6 player full campaign.  the detail and design of this game is excellent.  While the game is actually pretty easy to play, a moderate effort is required to understand what good and bad moves are (one-two games should do this).  If you are interested in the history, this is a must-have.  As a game, the need to have 3-6 people willing to invest the time (8 hours) required to play (>2 games) makes this a solid 'excellent', if not 'outstanding'.  Since each player has such a different experience, I could easily see a dozen plays without re-tracing your steps.

includes 500th Anniversary Update.

one caveat:  all of the players must be at least semi-rational and trip up the leader.

there are some rough edges, the play-time is long, and you really need 6 players to make it really work, so I can't give it a '10', but this is a major 'experience' game that I would certainly never turn down.

I'm very, very glad I played. If this game could reliably clock in at 4-5 hours, it would have a serious shot at being my favourite game. It's got options, depth, fluidity, and theme out the wazoo. But...
-although the diplomacy has some very clever bits (sue for peace is brilliant, bribes are great), having to declare war is often prohibitive--if you've got 3 or 4 cards in hand, ditching 1 or 2 so you can walk somewhere and/or bash the leader is not a good option. So, many turns (which can take 3 hours), you've got nothing to do because you didn't.couldn't declare war on the right person.
-card advantage can get nuts; if one power has 3 cards, and other power 12, the game will not be fun for all parties. 
-swingy luck; one cards gives you 2 VPs (WTF?), you can get really lucky exploring the New World, and sometimes you gte dealt a hand of 1-2 CP cards. 

Maybe I should try one of the later scenarios, but currently I can say despite its moments of brilliance I would not be disappointed to never play Here I Stand again. Besides, Successors is just ever so much better.

One of the best, multiplayer games of diplomatic action to have been made in the past several years. The trouble comes when the players don't realize that the game /must/ involve heavy diplomacy to work well!

A flaw, in my opinion, is the ease of winning and the impossibility of taking away victory points from other players once they have them--this can lead to tragically short games.

A very complex and option-rich unique game. I really want to like it, but it seems quite tedious at times [We played till the end of turn 3 and it took us more than 6 hours - although that included rules study]. I will definitely play again, but I would prefer the 1532-scenario that starts with turn 4.

Played again - nice people and laid-back diplomacy. I still find it a bit unintuitive and cumbersome at times. A lot of occasions for making grave rules mistakes/misunderstandings that can really backfire. Would play the protestant again, but not sure if it will ever become a favorite.

I found that any game involving secret diplomacy is not my thing at all. Also playing with an experienced group just makes you realize how much there is still to learn - rules-wise and experience-wise - which just would take too much time for me that I do not have free to invest in that game. Might play again with a group of other "newbies" but will preferably spend my time with more "easy" and accesible games.

-Lot of downtime

General comments:

If you have a group and time; this is a unique experience. However, if a group and time lacks this sits on the shelve.
  
What Twilight Imperium 2ed. is for a futuristic space game, HIS is for history. Although the games are very different I found the similarity as dar as the time and multiplayer / roles aspect very striking.

Rules are numerous but clear and to the point. It seems like a very complicated and chaotic game but in reality it is less chaotic and complicated than it may appear. 
Played my first 6 player game and we simply followed the sequence of play and read on the spot what to do. Pretty chaotic at the start but after we a couple of crad plays and one round things clicked. And keep the book aside for special cases (Attack on Budapest!).  
I have had a great experience it seems to become one of my most precious games however it is a challenge to find the right group and time. If you have both, an amazing experience every once in a while (like Twilight Imperium 2ed.

Revisited: great multiplayer game but unfortunately due to a lack of time / players it does not see as much table as it deserves.

The perfect gateway game for Reformation scholars?

This is one of those games you wouldn't end up playing unless you had a specific woody for the theme (at least one would hope).  Me, I get all sweaty for it.  The game has two issues that by themselves are no problem, but when combined work to kill it off:

1)  It takes all day to play.  Our "learning game" took eight hours; and

2)  It requires repeat plays to really grok the interlocking systems and possibilities.

This isn't a problem for me, personally—I enjoyed the hell out of that long Saturday spent with friends in the early 1500s.  But it will take insane levels of logistics to arrange a day off with a suitable quorum of six ("An all-day game where we LARP the Reformation?  Holy crap—now THAT makes my pants fit funny!").  So really we're looking at [GAMEID=1] levels of replay...  like twice a year, max.  And that's a bummer.

If you're here asking, "Is this game for me?" take the [i]Here I Stand[/i] Compatibility Quiz:

1)  Does the idea of nailing stuff to a church door make you sweat?

2)  Do you have five friends who would fight over being the Pope or Martin Luther?

3)  Not counting those five friends, are you a social misfit who has no life such that you can spend whole days gaming without pissing any SOs off?

If you said "no" to any of the above, this probably isn't for you.

Provisional rating after one play = 8.

UPDATE:  The second play rockets this to a solid 10.  The first game was with five n00bs, the second with only three; both were 6p games.  Even though it was fraught with error and much page flipping, it was an incredible experience.  Can't wait to play it again!

Ideally, the ultimate game would be the seventh one, with the same six people; six games so that everyone gets a chance to play each power (as well as get all the kinks out of the system).  That seventh one would be the Real Game, with no n00bs, no one getting hammered through ignorance, and everyone knowing what everyone else is capable of...  I know there are at least two of us who are completely smitten with this game, and at least one other we can reliably convince to play, but I fear those other three slots will be forever sat in by n00bs playing for the very first time.  Sigh.  Time to install some more D-rings in the basement ceiling and break out the chloroform so I can collect some more, uh, [i]dedicated[/i] friends.

UP-UPDATE:  Fourth play, two n00bs.  Rock solid.  Also, we now have so many people up for this that we actually had two alternates waiting in the wings for an opening.

This is a game where BGG's usual rankings fall down. This isn't a "bad" game but it is one that I am unlikely to ever be talked into playing again: that is entirely a function of the length.

This is a game that I want to like more than I actually do. The choice of subject material sounds pretty cool (or unusual, at any rate). The idea of an engaging six player game sounds cool. The idea of asymmetric goals and subsystems sounds cool.

Unfortunately none of it really worked out to my satisfaction in practice.

I don't know that I've played ANY six player game (outside of party-style games) that really works well with that many people. And HIS doesn't IMHO. Too much downtime, too much other people doing stuff you don't care about.

The asymmetric subsystems mean not everyone has to care about all the complexity in the game. But it also means there are large swathes where people go, "Oh the Ottomans are doing some kind piracy thing" or "guess Henry is rolling on his pregnancy table or something" or "I think he sent an Explorer I suppose".

The worst of these are the Papacy/Protestant dice offs, which take more time than the other subsystems and are even less interesting to the other players. I also couldn't help shake the feeling that there is a mathematically "correct" order in which the Protestant player should conduct the conversions in order to maximize success.

- The board is too static. At the end of the game, an outside observer would be hard pressed to point to major differences other than the Protestant conversion of Germany. In my game I had 24 points as England and that consisted of taking one additional key in Europe (Antwerp, which is adjacent to a starting English army). That's it.

- This is in large part because there is relatively little for players to do. This is a CDG but there is rarely much of a decision as to whether to play the card for Event or Command Points. Much less so than any other CDG I've played. So you play a card for 3 points and....put an Exploration marker on the board, then wait for your next turn.

- Because you have few actions, the impact of a few dices rolls can make or break your game. And in many cases there is nothing you can do to affect them one way or another. Does Henry get an male heir on the try? If so, that frees up a 5 CP card every turn he'd otherwise be using on that. Does an explorer get eaten by cannibals (0 VP) or explore the New World and circumnavigate the globe (5 VP total)? Does the colony collapse on the first turn or allow an extra card draw for 9 turns?

- There is a rich-get-richer thing going on. The more VP you have, the more cards you draw, which lets you do more stuff. It's not clear to me how someone who suffers a major early set back can reliably climb back into the game.

- You're supposed to bash the leader when someone gets close to winning but it wasn't at all clear how that is supposed to work in many cases. What can England do to stop the Protestants or Ottomans if they are on the brink of winning? I suppose the answer here is "that's what the diplomacy aspect of the game is for but that feels indirect, uncertain, and somehow unsatisfying".

- The declaration of war mechanic (DOW) is interesting but frustrating and I'm not sure it works. Many, many times people's plans were upset because they didn't think to DOW 45 minutes earlier at the beginning of the turn against someone. Given that it also has a non-trivial CP cost you can't go overboard with DOW either.

- I have my concerns about the scripted nature of the game. I doubt many people will ever play it enough for that to be a major issue but it is still there. Henry VIII can take Antwerp...but then what choice does he have but to declare war on France? Etc.

- There are a ton of rules. And enough little chrome bits all over the place that we continually made mistakes. The game didn't appear "broken" by those mistakes but that argues against having all that chrome in the first place. "Ooops, England doesn't get a troop bonus since Henry is the King." "Actually that card says you have to use it for a Field Battle not an Assault." Etc. Since this isn't a game that anyone is ever going to play often enough to get all the rules down pat, it seems like most plays are going to involve a ton of mistakes.

- Finally, I think this game shows the weakness of the "typical wargame designer toolbox mindset". By which I mean: there are two basic resolution mechanics: roll a bunch of dice and "hit" on 5-6 or roll 2d6 and succeed on 9+. Those are both easy to remember but they seem to totally undercut any pretense at "simulation": so why do we have all that OTHER simulation-y chrome? I mean, is there really a 27% chance that New World voyages were successful? And ALSO a 27% chance the military formations could intercept? The religious conversion of Branderburg has the same historical probability as a military assault on Paris?

I'm not saying the game should be MORE complicated to account for that: I'm saying given the concessions to playability already made, the game should have been more streamlined so there was less downtime, less "I don't care what is happening on the other side of the board", less static board positions/historical railroading, and so on.

A wonderful game thick with historical flavor that, while dense, is surprisingly accessible.  Combining that with the fun of a six-player all-day game makes for a very memorable experience.  The diplomacy, card play, historical context and decision making create a unique gaming experience.  Yes, it is a game that may take a little study, but the payoff is worth it.  On that note, it is highly recommend choosing sides in advance to help players focus on their faction's rules.  A rich, thematic game that is as educational as it is fun.  This game helped open up a new era of history for me.  Excellent!

A massive CDG that really attempts to do too much: there are political, military, religious, dynastic and exploration elements yet there's a lot less to this game than a glance at the 40 page rulebook would suggest. Put simply, this is a multi-player wargame where each player is trying to reach a VP total by rolling dice to make progress. Trouble is that, unlike Twilight Struggle, the progress made never really locks in and can quite simply be undone by another player. So everyone is constantly rolling tons of dice for quite trivial gains while the card Events are either dull or can only be played by certain powers, so consequently are little used.
Each turn can last a whopping 90 minutes, so the 9 turn game isn't very practical. Always play the 1532 scenario as some big point scorers (Edward VI) can only emerge late in the game, so it isn't balanced to start in 1517 and end after 4-5 turns. I'm very much a fan of this era in history, so I want to like this, but there just isn't enough thought required to compensate for the extreme playing time.

RATING: N/A
A relatively simple game made infinitely complex by the sheer number of rules - not only the basic rulebook, but also the 100+ cards, each of which carries it's own set of rules.

You get an involving experience where alliances change from turn to turn and a lot of time is spent making small changes to your posotion.  However, you need to control these changes as anyone making a big change unchallenged can win the game very quickly.

If you like Diplomacy, Here I Stand is a good modern alternative.

If everyone has a roughly equal knowledge of the game it's a good experience, but a newbie vs an old timer is at a distinct disadvantage as they won't know what cards/events are coming along and how to prepare for them and take advantage.

That being said, it's still a very good gamers game.

RATING: 7
Solid 3-6 player card-driven game covering the military, political, and religious struggles during the Protestant Reformation and the colonization of the New World.  I was put off at first by the 40-page rulebook, but in practice the game was relatively easy to pick up.  The game features attractive components and is essentially errata-free, which for a game with this much detail is very impressive.  Balance seems pretty good, and some of the game's mechanisms (the sue for peace rule in particular) cut down a bit on the kingmaking that can sometimes plague multi-player wargames.  Unfortunately, the card deck is very unbalanced and some of the events don't work right.  The worst offender here is that Henry VIII won't marry again if Elizabeth and Edward are already born, even though historically he married three more times after this occurred.  Gameplay is fun, if a bit too dependent on dice luck for my taste.  The Protestant player in particular does almost nothing but roll dice and will become very frustrated if the dice don't go his way.  One issue that affects both gameplay and realism is the lack of unit maintenance costs.  I can understand the desire to avoid accounting rules, but without some check on military growth players who avoid combat for a few years can build up some very large armies.  This is exacerbated further due to the command point expenditure mechanism, which means that sometimes players will hire mercenaries just because they have nothing else to spend their leftover points on.  Despite these problems, it's a very impressive game; I just wish it played faster than 8-12 hours.
Rating dropped after an unpleasant PBEM experience reminded me why I generally dislike multiplayer wargames.  By their nature, one bad apple spoils the whole barrel, and the disparate goals of the different powers don't mitigate this as much as I had hoped.  However, the designer is currently working on a two-player version of the game which focuses on the religious struggle, which could rekindle my excitement for the game.

RATING: 5
One 6-player, 10ish hour game as Protestants, half the players were first-timers (the other half played 1-2 times previously).  Some random musings:

- The downtime in this game is atrocious.  Three of us played an ENTIRE game of Brass online just in the time we were waiting for other people to make their moves, so we're talking on the order of several hours.  My wife (one of the participants in said game of Brass) also managed to walk the dog and pick up dinner without missing anything.  Certain players get far fewer card draws than others, and thus play out their cards and spend an hour waiting for the round to finish.  The downtime wouldn't be as much of an issue if the political and religious game systems (and New World, English wives/babies, etc.) were not so isolated from each other; as it stands, the Protestants and Papacy (and for much of the game, the Ottoman Empire) really have no reason to follow what the other players are doing and vice versa.  For such a long game, to spend so much time not involved in playing or paying attention to the game is a huge strike against it.

- Overall, but especially for the Papacy, Ottomans, and Protestants, the game is far too scripted.  There's really only one viable strategy for each of them to take in order to be competitive in the endgame, and it takes about four to five hours of doing the same thing over and over to accomplish it (in fact, the Protestants really only CAN do one thing for the first five hours of the game).  The end result is that it felt like the game was designed in order to get everyone in the same VP ballpark around turn 4 so that the interesting part of the game could happen (of course by then I was so exhausted that I didn't really care what happened at that point).  I have a feeling this game would be more interesting as France, England, or Hapsburgs as they have more options available to them.

- Drawing bad cards can really hose you in this game, because you get so few of them and the events are rarely worth playing (or even apply to you).  I also don't understand why the entire deck is reshuffled every turn - it just seems like that would increase the likelihood of getting dealt the same bad cards over and over.  Also, the odds of drawing any specific card become very low, so it's a gamble to plan for certain events occurring or not (thematic perhaps, but still annoying).

Overall I didn't dislike the game, but I don't think it was worth the time invested.  There was simply too little to do for the extreme length of the game. This is one case where I think the Tournament scenario might actually be an improvement over the full game, as it skips the slow buildup of the early turns and goes straight to the interesting part.

This game would be a perfect 10 if: A) it wasn't so long and complicated and B) that the Protestant player's fate is determined the first term. That starting point is so vital to the game that if the Protestant doesn't do well (i.e. have successful rolls) then they have basically little chance of winning. It works really well thematically, but game-wise upsets the balance. Other than that, the game is near perfectly balanced.

Game dynamics are a bit tricky but the game rarely plays out as expected.  The only negatives are that when England and the Protestants are a single player, the game can get unbalanced AND the leader at the end of any turn is likely to be punished the next turn.

This one is hard to rate. The game itself is great. It is a bit long (6 hours) but it does not feel like a long game, the time goes by fun. There is no problem with down time, and the diplomacy in this game is better then in any other game I have ever played. The history forces you to engage in diplomacy and then change your diplomacy again. It does not feel like a wargame or that you are constantly in conflict with others, although it is a wargame/conflict game. The rules are not terribly difficult, and the player aids it comes with helps a lot, but there are a lot of things going on. I wish you could "watch it played" online because that would make to rules so much clearer. It is one of those games that, once you see it played it makes complete sense and is easy to remember. The education value is extremely good. I can not think of any better way to show the interwoven events of history. Just reading history it can feel like a serious of isolated events. This was invaluable to teaching my kids. Having said that, would I buy "Virgin Queen," the second part to this game? No, I would play it if asked, but I think owning one of these kinds of games is good enough for my collection. It will be enjoyed when we play it, but I can not see it being played all of the time because of the length and the need for so many players. I would not recommend it with less then 5.

As I type this, I want to cry.  I had such high hopes for this game but it falls flat for several reasons:

1 - the downtime is insulting frankly.  This is exacerbated if you are playing one onf the non religious factions.  As an Ottoman player, none of my turns ever took more than 1-2 minutes...some of the Protestant turns take 15-20 due to #2
2 - glorified yahtzee between the pope and the protestants is ANNOYING.  VERY ANNOYING.  And in a 3 player game, the protestants jimmying the control in England to push his average score up is VERY GAMEY and should be forbidden frankly.
3 - There are FAR too many 1-2 number cards in the game.  I think all cards should be  1 CP more across the board.  This at least would allow people to do things
4 - The new world felt really dumb to me.  It should have been much deeper there.  I felt the game was won by a lucky die roll that let a circumnavigation occurr and let France get a big VP boost at the right time.  He didn't have to work for keys, he just needed to roll his dice well
5 - The siege rules are really annoying.  Take the Nappy siege rules for forts and apply them to keys!  Yes, that will give the non combat oriented factions a chance by making combat so unattractive and expensive nobody can do much!

This is no wargame, it is a historical simulation, no more, no less.  This game gets  4 for being a VERY good historical simulation, as a game, it is a 1 for me.  All in all, I felt the Ottomans had no chance to win from turn 2.  

The point rewards for piracy versus the CP expendature requirement is far broken.  The fact I got dealt a hand of 1 CP cards twice and thus lost 2 game turns being unable to do any piracy felt broken.  If I want to have a game decided by dice, I'll play Can't Stop and have it last 6 hours shorter and have a LOT more fun playing it.  I'd not play this agin without a timer locking each players impulse at 2 minutes per CP used and forbid table discussion at all excluding rules discussion and diplomacy phase setup timing discussion.

This is the BIG multiplayer conflict game that I've been looking for.  This game ROCKS.  My 9.5 is tentative only cuz I have but 1 play under my belt.  What a magnificent game.  There is SO much going on, but nothing feels forced or complicated.  The rules make sense and everything seems to work.  There are lots of agonizing decisions and multiple paths to victory.  The different powers can play distinctly different games within the greater struggle for victory.  The rulebook is a masterpiece of clarity and the minimal errata for a wargame of this scope speaks to playtesting and care in it's creation.  Prepare for a LONG game, but it's worth it.  The game shines with 6 players and this is how it should be played imo.  The diplomatic options are terrific on top of a solid wargame foundation.  This is the best game I've played in a long time.  

Edit - I've played 3 times now.  I've loved it every time.  One of my favorite multiplayer conflict games ever. It's a winner.

Finally got in a whole play of this one, and I have to say, it's absolutely knock-your-socks-off good. It's profoundly asymmetrical, there are tons of behind-the-scenes factors which go into every decision, and the game state is extremely dynamic and always changing and shifting. I'm convinced that this game shouldn't take too long when played with the right crowd, and the 6 hour playtime is realistic. Our game, which was an all-around learning game (no one had played it before), only took about 8 hours after rules, so I'm actually tempted to try it in an evening w/ the tournament rules or something.

Here I Stand`s rules are by far the most convoluted ones I have read. They are not hard by any means, but the way they are presented on the manual are very hard to follow. Also they have lots and lots of exceptions.

We finally managed to play this, but we only played 2 turns and it took us over 5 hours to do that. For that reason I won´t pass judgment just yet. Still I was a “little” disappointed, it seemed my friends were having a great time but it was merely ok for me. I don’t like historic themes, perhaps that’s why I didn`t enjoy it as much.

Next time I hope we can play the complete game to really see if there IS a good game here or not.

I don’t want to play this monstrosity again. I already forgot most of the rules so the thought of having to learn the game again fills me with nightmares. I’m definitively not a wargamer. My desire to play Here I Stand is null, so I’m rating it accordingly. I don’t think I will play it ever again.

This is another one that may never see the light of day and ends up just being moved on in the end. I have a constant battle with my modern self and time demands vs. my nostalgia for war games. 

Long games today though...will most likely never be played. I know that I should stop investing in them really, but I still find them appealing for some reason. I'll just never get them played I think.

Two plays only, so opinion may evolve with further plays.

Long, complex multiplayer strategy game using the core military rules from GMT's earlier Napoleonic Wars games along with religious rules reminiscent of Twilight Struggle's tug-of-war for influence.

Involving, and I can see the potential, albeit as the non-religious powers you seem to spend a lot of time waiting for your turn to come round. The religious conflicts in particular seem to involve a lot of counting, counting again and rolling a ton of dice, evaluating the result, then back to some more counting etc. five or six times, which slows it down some.

That said, with 6 players who know what they're doing, the back-and-forth and twisting alliances are a lot of fun if negotiation and a little light back-stabbing turns you on - as it does me!

Want to play again.

12 plays in now, and thoroughly enjoying this engrossing, multi-layered game, to the point where I have acquired he new 500th anniversary edition.

Once you get over the (admittedly high) learning curve and understand how the factions work and interact, winning is more about diplomacy and timing. I like that they have toned down the Copernicus card (which previously was the source of more tan one fluky win for the player lucky enough to have drawn it - it's 2 free VP, which is almost 10% of the target and can easily get you over the line) and given Scotland a stronger focus (I'm Scottish!)

Dislikes? Religious battles take too long for those not involved, and the Protestant player is no fun as that faction's strategy seems pretty scripted.

The amount of diplomacy/negotiating involved is great.  The balance of powers seems spot on as every power has a juggling act to maintain.  Sure, card draw can affect some hands, but I think that is where the diplomacy aspect really shines.  The driving force to the greatness of this game is how different each power behaves and plays.  All 6 powers are interwoven into a massive struggle and learning who to help/hurt when is key to victory.

In fairness to my eurogamer identity, my only war game comparison is Sword of Rome. As both are CDG's, I felt they played 'similar'. While I enjoyed Sword of Rome (quite a bit actually), I think the religious influence and the 6-player interaction of HIS greatly adds to the game experience.

While I'd be willing to try HIS with fewer than 6, I'm pretty sure that it truly shines with the full 6.  Eliminating or at the least, reducing, the diplomacy/negotiating could detract from this, dare I say, masterpiece?!

While my rating may change with more plays, as of now, it easily warrants the 10 as I'd gladly play if I have the time available.

Wonderfully conceived card-driven game about the Wars of the Reformation. I don't recommend the 3P game because diplomacy and negotiation are limited--play it with the full 6 or not at all. The 2P variant is a fine (albeit swingy) way to get most of the game's flavor in a quick-playing format with few rules alterations. 

There are a lot of rules, but it's not as daunting as it appears--they are presented in a simple, procedural manner. The basics can be explained to a newcomer in about 30 minutes. 

Playing the game is a bit draining, and I'd probably only be up for it in person a handful of times per year. It is remarkably well-suited to PBEM, though--if you can get a group that is committed to a brisk pace. I have taken over maintenance and ongoing improvement of the VASSAL module (available at http://www.vassalengine.org/wiki/Module%3AHere_I_Stand).

I've vacillated over time on how to rate this game, but the more I pondered it, I realized it has to be a 10. I constantly find myself looking at the forum (here and on CSW), trying to help with rules questions, thinking about my ongoing games, and so on. It is a significant achievement to come up with a 6 player game with such balance and have it hold up over time with wargamers (a hypercritical bunch if there ever was one). Tack on the ever-present support of a true gentleman like the designer and a spirited community of players, and it's the total package.

HIS is a sprawling, epic game of military, religious, civil, and new world conquest set against the backdrop of 16th century Europe. Early on you're caught up in the narrative as players strive to achieve victory through a menu of asymmetrical goals/mechanics. 

However, this feeling quickly evaporates once 5hrs have passed, you're only through round 2 of 10, your net VP accumulation is zero, and you realize that for all its narrative and asymmetrical touting, the underlying mechanism for everything is dice.

I love the ambition of the designer and his use of the CDG template incredibly admirable. However, at the end of the day HIS is a long, semi-scripted, procedural, dice-fest with significant amounts of luck, negotiation, and downtime. I like and in fact love some games which have one or two of these issues but all of them wrapped in a 10hr game is a bit much for my taste. 

I’d love to see a redesign using the card and operational mechanisms from COIN. That would both significantly reduce the luck and use of dice and shorten the game

Te Ottomans and the Hapsburgs tend to have lots of military type actions for them, but each of the powers have a unique and flavorfull range of choices. Note that the Protestant side may get tired of translating bibles and stuff. Another strong point is that you can fall behind and still come back to wing ina couple of turns.

RATING: 8
Only played about five times, but of the plethora of card-driven wargames out there, this is probably the best one.  Best with six, as the diplomacy and negotiations is where this game really shines.  The political and religious strife is accurately depicted, as is the fact that each of the six powers has unique paths to victory.  Only problem (in addition to finding the playing time) is the rules are fairly complex, and you really need to do your homework, particularly if you aren't able to play the game all that often (as is the case with my situation).

My first true wargame ever! :)
This is another one that I respect and admire in terms of design, complexity and detail - but I’m not sure how I feel about it overall. I played England, and won by a hair. The English king had a male heir, and if he had a female heir, I would’ve gotten fewer points, and would've lost. That was decided by a single die roll. So to have 7 hours of play boil down in the end to the roll of a die (even if it happened mid-game), is kind of weird. On the other hand, I appreciate the dilemma the designer faces for a game of this length - you want to keep the game close, because a runaway leader problem would be a disaster when you’re playing for so long. In the end, I would opt for the closer game and more hours of tense excitement, as it is. I see a lot of historical and educational value in this game, it would be great as a component of a college course, for example.

RATING: 5
Highly overrated!!!!!!!!
After several games my beginning-euphoria is gone! O.k., it's a very good historical simulation BUT where is the fun? E.g. the French player: ''Yes, yes, yes, now its my turn! Watch out guys what's going on! Aaaaannnndddd I flip my homecard to get a VP!!!!!'' Well, maybe he will win with such an action but is it fun to Play 8wait a Long time for his next turn)? This is just one Example of boring play-situations in this game! I, as the English player in our last game, fought 3 whole turns to conquer Scotland (means I fought about 2,5 hours to get ONE Key). The only French player actions in that turns were trying to defend that key! Only Protestant (for me the Superpower in the game) and Habsburg can be fun. Habsburg has a lot of cards and a lot to do! For the most powers game play is to static.Next time we will try it as a two-player game with a few rules-changes (a constellation Habsburg, Papay and England(!)) against France, Ottomans and Protestants needs a few modifications)! In a two player game both players will be busy!

RATING: 5
I would not call this a great game by any stretch, but there isn't much to compare it to. On the one hand, it's easy to feel swept up in the sheer scope of the game. The Protestants, Papacy, French, English, Ottomans, and Hapsburgs all offer distinct objectives and play styles. Overseeing the reformation under Luther and Calvin (Protestants) is night and day different than fomenting piracy and plundering Eastern Europe (Ottomans). High Replayability comes from the diplomacy phase of the game, during which players can ally with or extort each other based on the layout of the board and the cards in their hand. On the other hand, a single turn takes 75-90 minutes, and most of the victory points come from die rolls and card draws. Certainly, you will lose outright if you do not pursue the objectives built into your Power. But most of the game here is about seeing who is randomly awarded points and then trying to bring them back into line. Perhaps an interesting balancing act with so many players at cross-purposes. Perhaps a somewhat glorified case of Bash the Leader. It takes skill to contend for a win in Here I Stand. I'm not sure how much skill it takes to actually win. 

Update: 2nd play as the Ottomans. I spent at least half the game not playing the game (thank god for wireless internet). I would look at my hand, plan out my turn, and stop paying attention for well over an hour. When it came to me I would execute my turn in as little as 10 seconds and then it would take several minutes for it to come back to me. I don't think I detracted from the game at all (unless it adds something for the other players to see me stare at the board for hours), but I somewhat inadvertently proved to myself just how much downtime there is in the game. As the Ottomans, only a tiny slice of geography matters, and occasional Diplomacy is exciting but also straightforward (and also comes once every couple of hours). 

I like the theme of the game, but the game doesn't do much with it. It takes a good 2-3 hour game and makes it take 7-8 hours. I don't find it annoying when I play, but I'm a veteran space-case, and after a while even I'll start to wonder why I'm sitting there. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be getting out of Here I Stand, but I don't think I'll be able to make it through another game.

Unless otherwise noted plays are all of the 1517 scenario.

[b]Game 2[/b] - Papacy, lost. Couldn't stop the reformation.
[b]Game 3[/b] - Played as England. - 10 hours - Much better understanding of the rules this time. Won by tie breaker on turn 6.
[b]Game 4[/b] - PBEM - Hapsburgs - Slaughtered by the Ottomon Hordes!
[b]Game 5[/b] - France - Got slaughtered by England on his road to an auto win - 10 hour game - very interesting again this time around.
[b]Game 6[/b] - [i]1532/Tournament[/i] - England - Lost in the final turn due to a failed siege attempt!
[b]Game 7[/b] - Hapsburgs - fail... I would like to play the Hapsburgs again.
[b]Game 8[/b] - Played the Ottomons for the first time. I was hurt in part by the fact that Barbary Pirates was never dealt into the game and was forced out at the end of turn 3. The other thing that hurt was never coming to any sort of agreement with the Hapsburgs leaving us at a near stalemate and constant war for the final 4 turns of the game. If I had left the Hapsburgs alone on his Eastern front he would have been able to stop/slow the English win. Because of the way it played out the Hapsburgs and Ottomons were in 5th and 6th place by game end.

HiS manages to loan the best aspects of The Napoleonic Wars, mainly the multiplayer capacity CDG design, and a historicity TNW doesn't have. The result is highly satisfactory : I played this game three times already, and ask for more. A default maybe : the gameflow is a bit slower than the wild TNW rides, but still, this game is a joy !

(Rating based on two plays)

A true masterpiece of CDGs. Tons of historical flavour and the best diplomacy mechanics I have ever seen: players are allowed to hold negotiations at the beginning of each turn but before the turn starts all alliances and wars have to be formalized. This means that for a given turn there are little chances of getting backstabbed (aside from unfavourable events that can be played by others).

There are a couple of downsides though. Firstly, Here I Stand does not scale. Although the rulebook gives the rules for 3-5 players the truth is that this game only makes sense with 6. It is also very long, at least with inexperienced players. Related to this is a significant downtime.

Throw a lot of history onto cards and it's a game. Problem I have with these sorts of games is that they try to repeat history too closely. For example having cards where someone dies on an exact date or some event and it's a mandatory play as in this game. Well by the second play everyone is suddenly Nostradamus! The event will repeat and one can even plan your play on it. 
If you were a leader in an historical period, other than killing someone will you know healthy King so and so will die precisely on such and such a date? 

Rant done. 

The real killer of this game is the massive player down time and how long it takes to play. If your group has played this game a lot then play time may be faster, but since the first few plays are so unbelievably long will many but the hardcore want to get that far? Also the amount of play each player gets in during that time is very low. Each of the regular nation players can literally finish their turn in a couple of minutes to maybe 10 mins max. Then when the round gets to the Papal of Protestant players the game slams into low gear and the other players just sit and wait .....and waaait..... 

So figure that each player may have 5 cards each to play and 5 to 10 mins per player turn ( and much longer for Papal and Protestant players) and 9 turns you have a game that will take double digit hours to finish. The painful part is in that time each player isn't doing all that much if anything (well time to hit the snack table), thank goodness in my plays the players were at least in good spirits and enjoyable to be with.

After two six-player session both ending at the conclusion of turn four. As France in the first game I had not much to do but still remained a contender for first place. This may be actually bad as the game doesn't seem to reward good play (do nothing for for turns and still win). As the Protestants in the second game I had a lot more to do and was fortunate in my die-rolls. The Papacy was pretty occupied militarily and didn't spend much effort on the Counter-Reformation (maybe because his good Pope hadn't come out yet) but did call for a couple of debates with mixed results.

I want to like the game for the theme, the cleanliness of the rules for such an involved game and the overall balancing act by the designer. But I'm afraid that this one will come out rarely in our group as it does have balancing issues with regards to player involvement. Some players may have three or so cards to play and have to sit and wait until others work through their eight+ hands of cards.

I do wonder if Diplomacy is the deciding factor that holds the game together so *ALL* players have a roughly equal amount of satisfaction after playing this game for many hours.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Despite the randomness it's one of my favorites. Diplomacy plays a big role here, so mitigating the randomness is often down to the deals you manage to make. Downtime can be an issue especially with AP prone players, so you can't stress enough that players should think about their next move while waiting for it. You also need to keep an eye on how things play out between the other powers in conflicts you're not currently involved in, so I don't think the downtime factor is that bad all in all. Just don't invite your social gamer friends for this, everyone needs to stay focused or you might not finish it in tolerable time.

My 9 rating only applies to the 6-player game where skillful diplomacy becomes a key factor. With 3 players controlling 2 major powers each the diplomacy is limited, apparently very much so, compared to the full game. But there are practically no downtime issues, and the shorter scenarios feel more balanced in the sense that you can use your other faction to help another that might be suffering of a bad hand or crappy die rolls.

LIKEs:

* Enjoy the diplomacy aspect of the game which can involve quite a bit of backstabbing.
* Each country/religious power has some unique abilities and roles.  IE, the Protestants are not very involved politically/militarily, but are focused primarily on the reforming of the Catholic Church.  The European powers can explore the new world, but the Ottomans do not.  Instead, the Ottomans can engage in piracy.  And, of course England is consumed with the marriages/divorces of King Henry VIII, etc.  Lots of interesting interactions between the powers that be!
* I enjoy the card driven aspect of the game.  Reminds me of Twilight Struggle in this element although you can use the ops in a mixture of different actions instead of just committing all the ops points to one thing.  Some mandatory cards exist that the event must take place and some are response cards that can be played out of turn.
* The dynamic of religious confrontations versus political confrontations is well implemented.   

DISLIKE:

* Game takes a very long time to play, particularly if people are AP prone.  In my first game one person agonized for 10 minutes that he couldn't carry out his plan despite knowing that he couldn't and needed to move on...argh!
*  While I enjoyed being the Protestants, I found it disappointing to some degree that there was little value in military/political conflict for me.  Protestant political forces are easily destroyed if the Hapsburgs in particular are allowed to focus on the Protestants.  However, this is a feature of the game and I'm not really complaining...really!

This gotta be the one to watch for which could have been the "Wargame of the Year". Card-driven point-to-point movement for the Wars of the Reformation 1517-1555, a period loaded with myths, religious aura, and the ever political non-stop struggle. Plus the period sees the big change in European battlefield tactics. Designer Ed Beach is the one who continues developement of the series games Avalon Hill's Great Campaigns of the American Civil War. His writings and designs show how delicate they are. Excellent operational research and extensive game playtestings. After a 6-player play the first time on 15 Oct 06, this is a magnificient wargame masterpiece in 2006 (well, at least initially on the surface)! Check out my AAR here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/7679  

After several subsequent plays, however, I knocked down the game by a rating point from "9" to "7" because of the now seemingly relatively constricted gaming system in the course of monotonous game development. Whether you are good at diplomacy and interacting with other players in the game is crucial to winning and I am not good at them. There is no room for tolerance over error(s) you committed in a turn not in the right fashion that the game demands upon the players during the early and middle stage of the war. 

The player downtime is quite significant for this game than other multiplayers games I have encountered.  Everyone is quite pretty sticking to their own goals and doing with one strategy (and it is pretty hard and slow to change your general strategy once the momentum is beginning).  We have a group of gamers who enjoyed this game so much because everyone gets their own share in the game.  However, I feel bored each time I played the game because of the downtime and limited strategy available to the player of any faction.  Actually I think this game is much better with the 2-players C3i variant as coordination can be higher among the controlled factions and downtime is much lower.    

An early win by Ottomans is very likely (2 out of our 3 sessions) if France, England and Hapsburg could not be allied on the table.  Still, a lot of history packed here to learn. (Note : A must-see TV series for this game: Tudor.)

One thing you must do is to read the designer's article in C3i #19 such teaches you the game in twenty minutes. It is a very good summary of how the game works and refreshing every time you approach the game again after a long time.

I really, REALLY like this game. But NOT as a face-to-face multiplayer game: it is a bit boring, for  most of the time in a turn about half of the players have nothing much to do, turns take forever to finish. You could just wait with a book in your lap forever waiting for your turn (where you don't have much to do anyway sometimes). Just awful. UNLESS you have a good gamemaster to whip things along (like I did at GMT East 2010).

As an internet E-Mail game, it really shines above all others (you don't have to sand around waiting to play, but can plan your perfect move at will!).

One of the rare games that is still keeping my interest level very high after more than 10 plays. 

The game of a decade.

Hey... It's so damn good that it almost made me want to believe in God again!

*** After 20 full games I lowered my rating form 10 to 8 because of play-balance problems I have (English too strong because of a Healthy Edward 9/10 of the time, and the Pope too weak). Still an excellent game. But I will not play the Papacy anymore if I want to do better than 2nd place. Too much randlomness in the card draws and exploration rolls also hurt the game. ***

RATING: 7.8
A great strategic game on a grand scale. There are a few little rules that are hard to keep in mind all the time but definitely manageable. I am very keen on the interactions between the powers here and how the situation can change from round to round.

My first impression was not so good, but after some game I understand the gameplay much better. On the militar side it's a static game compared to TNW; but it's very complex and dynamic on the diplomatic one. It can (and should!) be played at a good speed, once you know the rules. The only issue I have with this game is about a design "style"; you have some rules to put and keep the game on historical tracks (must-play events, Hungarian surrender...). I'm not saying that it's the wrong way, only I prefer other mechanics to deal with such things but I understand that the game cover a long time. For this I give to the game is 0.5 point less; after some other game the rating may grow up. Very fun game, in the end, with pirates, papal bulls, heresies (or reformation, points of view...), stakes, the 6 wife of Henry VIII and so on... Try it!
UPDATE
Not willing to play it again, boring to me... 5 because I love the background, else a 4!

I have played a 3 players game and, after a machinous 1st turn, the game went on fine. The rules and scenario book are very well written. The game flowes like a historical novel. The atmosphere is tense and each move, due to the relative minumum quantity of troops is like a chess move.

The only thing keeping me from giving this game a "10" is that it works best with six players.  Anything short (and I have played it only solitaire so far) still makes for a great game, but you miss out just a tiny bit from its full potential.

This is one of the games I really hated to get rid of, but we don't know anyone who would play something this involved. I tried to play online, but I play board games to play with other people and it wasn't as interesting. This is a really interesting game.

I really like Here I Stand.  It has been criticised by a number of people whose opinion I value, I think on the basis that the ratio of total playing time to active decision making time for each player is too great.  Some have been so unkind to describe it as "Here I Slump".

In a sense those are valid criticisms, but I still love it.

I love the separate paths to victory for the different powers.  I love the ability to directly attack your opponents that marks this as fundamentally of the wargame genre.

I love the historical flavour - and the genius of simultaneous (and equally important) religious and territorial battles.  (I also like the reminder of the short distance between religion and warfare throughout the ages).

In short, I think this is a game of great beauty which I will always be keen to play.  Not for everyone.  But a worthy inheritor of the tradition of We The People.

After all the build up for this game (high ratings, glowing reviews, I enjoy wargames, buddy set aside a whole day for a 6-player game...) it was a terrible let down.

Not all here is bad. there are plenty of decisions to make, and once you get going the turns flow ok. But there were just way too many turn-offs for me. It's a shame as I wanted to enjoy it.

CONS:
- It takes way too long, and not enough enjoyment for that time spent
- A bunch of people got turned off during the game due to downtime
- Felt like there were 3 separate games going on, none of which really impact anyone else...
- Other than earning victory points there was just no reason to do anything in this game...As the Hapsburgs I was not invested in the Papacy/Protestant conflict, England hardly had any input on the game, France had to just fight to stay alive, and the Ottomans just start piracy for VPs...none of it mattered. I never gave a crap about what others were doing.

I dunno, maybe I didn't play it enough to know all the little "aha" moments...but frankly, halfway through a game you out to be able to see some general things to come to grasp with...there was just no point to all of it...I was never motivated to do anything.

Heck the first game we played, I decided to hate the Protestants and was able to help the Papacy to a TURN 1 VICTORY...that just seems broken in my mind.

Whatevs...maybe it just isn't for everyone...

Very good multiplayer game. Interesting game mechanics, and an interesting historical period. Takes long to play, expect 10 hours for the standard scenario. 

I think the game would have benefitted from some development and cleaning up. There are too many special rules and chrome. Does there really have to be 3 different ways to convert a space? Are umpteen different religous conferences really necessary in the deck of cards? I theink maybe the designer tried a bit too hard to make the game into a history lession, but all the detailed events are largely wasted, as most of the cards will never be drawn! Still, I like the game a lot despite this criticism. It's just that I feel that with a little more streamlining it would have been perfect!

RATING: 8
There's a lot of really good stuff in this game, and my rating would be higher were it not for the very complex rules, glacially slow pace and monstrous play time of the game. The event cards, setup and asymmetric powers capture the history of the time brilliantly and the game offers all the usual excruciating and thrilling CDG choices between events and operations and what to use those operations points to do, although this is diluted by the multi-player nature of the events. As an added dimension the negotiation in the game is as tough and vital as it is in Diplomacy - and HIS is the only other game I know which semi-forces it onto the players as a prerequisite for success. But the bottom line is that unless you've got a vast amount of time on your hands to learn and play this, it's going to see the table very rarely indeed. It's suitable for PBEM play but is very, very slow. See my review for more details: http://fortressat.com/articles-boardgame-reviews/2206-here-i-stand-review

RATING: N/A
2-6 players
There are 6 playable groups and all are always used. The game is designed to be played with 6 players. 3 player games have everyone taking control of two factions, and the rules make allowances for asymmetric setups with 4 and 5 players. And there's a 2-player variant that changes the rules more drastically.

Full game playtime for 6 players is 8 hours (assuming everyone is familiar with the rules). The game was apparently play-tested over email and forums. The rules appear to be similar to Twilight Struggle or 1960: The Making of a President, but I can't confirm that.

The two books that comprise the rules are each about 40 pages.

Great FUN for a group of 6. The interesting thing about this game is how much fun players have with this game, despite the incredibly dark period it portrays. For whatever reason, burning books (and debaters) and spreading disease always gets a good laugh. Better still, the game feels genuine, and the end-game is entertaining (if frustrating, as it's so easy to feel like you're just a card or two away from winning). Just remember, you MUST be at war with people in the last few turns, or you'll be powerless to stop them from winning...

Nearly a perfect simulation of the reformation period in Europe that combines both the religious and political struggle.

The game is also highly enjoyable using PBEM and combining ACTS with VASSAL.

I'm not a wargamer, but I tried Here I Stand because the theme is so compelling. I enjoyed it, but I don't think the game justifies it's length. Four hours, maybe five would be perfect.

This is one of the most amazing and thematic CDGs I've ever seen or heard of. Incredibly good at capturing the feel of the religious and historical context of the time. Brings back all the religious history studied at parochial college. The game is very different for each of the six players, and the only drawback is the length and complexity. It just won't hit the table very often, I'm afraid.

Wow.  This is the best multiplayer game I have played in ages.  The battle system is based on TNW, but there is SO much more going on here.  The game's mechanics are brilliant - I like the way debates are handled, I love the way the reformation and counter-reformation attempts are done, and the way that Cards and VP are using with unrest on the power cards is so succinct.  Dazzling.  Get it. Really.

Outstanding theme and an ambitious project.
Awfully long, though.  So long and with so much downtime that the cost vs. benefit does not come out in the game's favour, I'm sorry to say.
Quite complicated, I thought, and I have trouble keeping the Religious and Political aspects of the game straight in my head and separate.  
Having knowledge of the cards is pretty key - without that you're kind of just flailing about, hoping for the best.
Overall enjoyment also depends a lot on the group playing it -- avoid players who take backstabbing/ rejection / plotting personally.

Good strong historical theme combined with proven card driven mechanics. Will be a gaming favorite for those who really enjoy this era in history. Game plays a bit long but tightens up with familiarity. 

The conflict between the Protestants and Papacy might not be the cup of tea for some folks who prefer a pure military simulation but on the other hand things like Henry VIII's wives and exploration of the new world will appeal to players who enjoy the history surrounding the military conflict.

The Lutheran in me cringes for having sold this, but this gorgeous game is ~120 pages of rules between the main rule book and the very necessary scenario book.  Not only will I ~never find anyone willing to sit and play through this very complicated game... I read the rules myself a few times and was more than a little overwhelmed by the sheer scope of the game - political, military, AND religious conflicts of Reformation Europe and you could play with 2-6 players.  No pressure - but good luck remembering everything!

The game even got partially set up once, in New Haven, to try and play through by myself enough to be able to teach it.  And life is too busy and so got too busy, for me to be able to do that. The game sat unplayed for years, and so it was time to send it to someone who would enjoy it.  Sold at auction.

"Here I Sit" waiting 45 minutes until it is my turn again to take some simple action... Each faction's mini-game is an infantile but necessary distraction.  I won as the Protestant faction only by translating the bible.  None too exciting I assure you.  Played with six and was so bored I had two other games going at the same time to entertain me between my turns.

RATING: 6
The single game of this I have played was a 19-month long PBEM drone fest, and I really disliked it. I couldn't go a single turn without getting a rule wrong, and in general that's my real complaint about the game: the rules are needlessly complex, and none of the chrome adds significant strategic depth. Indeed, most of the extra rules, and the exceptions, and the exceptions to the exceptions, fail to even add THEMATIC depth, and the game is pretty thematic. I think this is a design tendency of wargames--for too many years grognards have been handed rulebooks full of obtuse arcana, and so they have come to believe complexity equals depth. That is certainly not the case here.

However, in considering my experience, and discussing it with my good friend [user="Mosier"] I think the much of my distaste for the experience was the fault that it was PBEM - I got rules wrong because it was two weeks between turns, I didn't experience any significant negotiations because, well, it was email, the game dragged and failed to hold my interest because it took nineteen months to complete. These things may not be the fault of the design or mechanics, and I am willing to admit that.

So. I would be willing to give this another try, but only face to face. I traded my copy away (and got a copy of Descent for it, plus Ghost Stories and Perikles so I am not even remotely disappointed--I definitely got the better deal.) So it would have to be a convention. And I sure as hell don't want to be the one to teach it to others.

RATING: 7
An okay CDG.  The value of the cards can vary too much, with some players totaling 11 points and others getting 24 points to spend in a single round.  This is a bit of a problem when over half of the cards are limited by which factions can play them for events (and those tend to be the low numbers).  

Much better PBEM

I didn't think I would like this game but after a few plays I do enjoy it quite a bit.  One of the more complex card driven games, but each power has a nice flavor and different challenges. Takes a long time to play, but it is worth it if you can find like-minded players. Some of the mechanics can be a bit tedious (lots of dice-rolling), but it does simulate the oozing influence of the reformation well.  Don't underestimate the value of diplomacy.

Downside is down time in multi-player. Also, Protestants and English can be a powerful team if the other powers don't cooperate to keep them down.

Very keen to purchase the 2010 edition of this game.

UPDATE - thanks to the Milsim sale I now have a copy.  Hurrah!

UDPATE - Actually got to play a full game.

Finally after two years I managed to assemble five other hardy souls to take on this epic. We were not disappointed. Despite a pretty steep learning curve and plenty of time flicking through rulebooks and suchlike we played a full game from turn one until turn six when the English got their victory with a healthy Edward and Copernicus. I came second as the Turks, taking Vienna and Prague, and the Protestants just pipped the Hapsburgs (who pretty much ran the new World) for third.

The game was everything I hoped it would be. Constant challenges and some very difficult decisions as all players tried hard to manage both the fickle finger of fate was well as the machinations of their opponents. This card driven strategy game really captures the feel of the period and the religious conflict between the Papacy and the Protestants was particularly interesting.

I do not regret this purchase in the least having enjoyed an epic gaming session. I hope to be able to repeat the process again soon.

RATING: 8
Excellent game. I'm not much of a wargamer, but this is definitely one of the better wargames I've played. It's very tight and well-designed. I've only played once, so I'm not really qualified to discuss its stengths and weaknesses in depth, but just after a single play, I think there may be some balance issues with certain player counts, and I'm not so sure that the luck factor is quite as well mitigated as it could be. On one hand, it's tense and interesting when there are several players neck and neck going into the last round, but at the same time this means that the final result can easily come down to a single die roll or card draw.

UPDATE: I love HIS more than ever, but grokking the rules has proved arduous. I'm a veteran of six games, but have been brought up short by rules wrinkles or needed clarifications. The rules desperately need a well-illustrated and -exampled FAQ. There are too many situations that may arise for new or even experienced players. I'm actually surprised the dots haven't been better connected. Dropped rating half a point from the glory that was 10.

This is it, boys and girls.  This is THE Grail game.  Stop looking now.  I just got finished playing as England in a 6-player, 7-hour love-fest.  Meaning that we all LOVED the game.  The time just flew and even other players' turns were interesting.  I was fascinated the entire time, and that's with mistakes, rule glitches, confusions, etc.  You just feel like you've BEEN through something, and if I want to spend my seven hours in a state of revelatory shock, that's time well spent.  All you TI3 acolytes should play HIS immediately and see how a *real* strategic 8-hour multiplayer game should play!  A+!

RATING: 6
Great theme, but the execution leads to the Protestants doing a little math and then rolling dice for 1-3 turns. With victory point cards spiced in the deck, endgame can feel capricious, especially in a close game. In all, probably not worth the time invested.

My rating represents only my first impression of the game. I liked the chrome of the game and the fact that it's all about theme and history. So far, it has none of the excitement that The Napoleonic Wars provides for me. I war rather dissapointed with this one.

Very clever designed victory conditions which should be incorporated in several other designs: You win by either having 25 victory points, being ahead 5 victory points or by territorial expansion. This assures that you are motivated to be the leader in the mid-game (and thus the obvious target for everyone) because you may end the game with a quick victory, while in many other designs you are simply punished by the "leader bashing" effect if starting to early for top position. As there are more and more victory points pumped into the game during the turns (they are not simply transfered between players) it becomes more and more complicated to bash the leader because several players may take the 25 VP hurdle.
The game needs some plays because the different powers have their intrinsic up and downs during the game (driven by mandatory events, which assure a "scripted" history), thus it needs some game experience to correctly evaluate the potential of the powers in the different stages of the game and to play accordingly.
Last but not least: One of the best written and organized rulebooks.

Fascinating reading; working through a solo learning game at the moment...

Update after one 6-player game: What a ride! I was France and we made it to turn 7 or so before calling it a draw (out of exhaustion -- mostly new players so lots of learning). Certainly not without flaws (the religious dice rolling), but looking forward to another game.

To me, games like this are a great supplement to reading history: they help to clarify people and events, and provide a visceral understanding of the role played by geographic and logistic constraints in determining how and why things happened the way they did.

I'm a playtester, so if that bothers you take it into account. In favour of the game: I've been playing three online games at a time for some time now, find it a *lot* of fun. I haven't done particularly well (I've won once as France), but have enjoyed it thoroughly. You need to do a lot of planning ahead, diplomacy and plotting your strategy, but do it all knowing that someone else may have an event that throws things off.

Much improved on by Virgin Queen. However, in both there is too much randomness for such a lengthy playtime, and while good cards and good rolls won't win you the game (unless you're the Protestants), poor cards will invariably gimp you. To me, this is worse. I do not want to sit around wishing I could do things.

RATING: 7
I like the flavor of the game very much and I'd like to play something else next game.

It feels like it would be hard to go to more than turn 6-7 with the 1517 scenario game.

Diplomacy feels like it's very important, but being the Protestant, it feels like I'm left out of the game.
That costs a point from the score of 10.
Another point lost is the hard to remember and not explicitly covering rules.
The last point is lost because my hopes were probably too high for this game.

It has a lot going for it, lots of minigames, but perhaps it has too much going.

[b]Here I Stand: Wars of the Reformation 1517-1555[/b]
2-6 players, 6 best

Is it better than Revolution: The Dutch Revolt? Have yet to play both. 

Virgin Queen or Here I Stand? After reading reviews, maybe neither. Very complex rules, long, slow game play, and many patient/persistent players needed. I enjoy long and deep games, however, regrettably this particular game might just gather dust on the shelf, so I pass till I get to try it out first.

[i]
Here I Stand: Wars of the Reformation 1517-1555 is the first game in over 25 years to cover the political and religious conflicts of early 16th Century Europe. Few realize that the greatest feats of Martin Luther, John Calvin, Ignatius of Loyola, Henry VIII, Charles V, Francis I, Suleiman the Magnificent, Ferdinand Magellan, Hernán Cortés, and Nicolaus Copernicus all fall within this narrow 40-year period of history. This game covers all the action of the period using a unique card-driven game system that models both the political and religious conflicts of the period on a single point-to-point map.

There are six main powers in the game, each with a unique path to victory:
The Ottomans
The Habsburgs
The English
The Valois Dynasty of France
The Papacy
The Protestants
Here I Stand is the first card-driven game to prominently feature secret deal-making. A true six-sided diplomatic struggle, the game places a heavy emphasis on successful alliance-building through negotiations that occur away from the table during the pre-turn Diplomacy Phase. Set during the period in which Niccolò Machiavelli published his masterpiece "The Prince," backstabbing is always possible, especially because the card deck is loaded with event and response cards that can be played by any power to disrupt the plans of the powers in the lead.

Here I Stand integrates religion, politics, economics, and diplomacy in a card-driven design. Games vary in length from 3–4 hours for a tournament scenario up to full campaign games that run about twice the time. Rules to play games with 3, 4, or 5 players are also included. The 3-player game is just as well balanced as the standard 6-player configuration, taking advantage of the natural alliances of the period.[/i]

RATING: 4
Simply too long. Way, way, WAY too much luck; if you are going to make victory depend on dice-rolling then it should be decided in the first ten minutes.

Suffers for exactly the same reason as other CDG's with complex event text: with over 100 cards you can only play well if you have detailed knowledge of all 100+ event texts. A few of the events can have such drastic effects that you just have to shake your head in disbelief. Perhaps this game could be improved by replacing all but the mandatory events with blank cards worth either 3 or 4 CP. Perhaps each Key should grant the owner a card worth 1 or 2 CP, and each impulse can be performed with up to 5CP by playing any number of cards.

Very irritating when there is a large disparity in hand sizes between players. Having to say "Pass" so often while others are still involved in playing the game is a bit crushing.

It is ridiculous that the Hapsburgs are able to get both Vienna and Emperor Charles back from the Ottomans merely by suing for peace; I can see why a Christian power would have to give both back, but the Ottomans clearly never would have, had they ever actually taken Vienna and/or captured the Emperor. And, having achieved the Ottoman dream of taking Vienna (which historically was beyond them). . . . they lost the game I was in (1 point from being last actually)!

Can you imagine being a Christian King, in his council chamber one day in 1538, when a messenger arrives to tell you that the Emperor is in chains in Istanbul, that Suleiman has taken Vienna and is poised with a massive army to ravage the heart of Christian Europe? Would such a King just shrug and say "no problem, they are only 1 point off last place"? Would such a King say "So what, the loss of Vienna only cost the Hasburgs 1VP, the Ottomans only gained 2, and look, hahahahaha, they don't even get an extra card next turn!"? I guess the inference is that the Ottomans should not be a player since the game's victory criteria don't reflect actual Ottoman goals. Perhaps the best way to make this a 6 player game is to split the Hapsburg into two players?

I don't think this game had enough play-testing by a LONG way.

Excellent design, well developed, but weak on playability: the religious system is very tedious, with dozens of die rolls each turn. The game moves along slowly (we played 4 turns in 6 hours in our first game) - I think even experienced gamers would need 3 sessions to finish a game. The length and complexity make it a game for grognards. It's probably best for PBEM than Face to Face. 

The game is very vulnerable to foolish play by one player. In a recent game, the French player decided to focus on attacking the Pope : the result was an automatic Protestant victory on turn 4 (and the loss of Paris and Rouen to the English).

The game compounds the randomness of diplomatic games with that of card-driven games, which I don't particularly like, but the result if fun. Not sure if that's worth 10 hours of gametime though. Sold my copy in 2007.

Like Advanced Civilization and Dune before it, this is a Weekend Game, a Long Game Day game.  This is not a filler, and you probably won't get through it if you start at 8pm.  Hell, just going over the rules is going to take you about an hour.  Be prepared -- this isn't a game for dilletantes.

That said, holy cow, is there some asymmetrical beauty in this box, along with a sizable amount of period history.  Six players broken into three camps of natural enemies, with unnatural allies on all sides, each trying to excel at what makes them great.  With several ways to score VPs but with each civilization/religious order having an easier path through certain strategies (England should try to produce an heir, the Protestants should translate  bibles, and so on), with secret diplomacy of both open and caveat-emptor natures, and with a mechanic designed to keep runaway leaders constantly on their toes, it's anyone's game for 4-6 hours.

And in what game this year will you have theological debates where the losers risk being BURNED AT THE STAKE?  None?  What I thought.

This very ambitious game bites off a lot and it chews a lot.  It will not be played often, but every one of those games will be memorable -- significantly more memorable than any game of Puerto Rico I will play.

I love The Napoleonic Wars and Here I Stand takes that up a notch using many of the features found in the aforementioned game.

RATING: 6
This is a multiplayer game with a lot of historical flavour, conflicts and negotiations! However, it is a pretty bad simulation. These problems become evident once you have played few sessions. I really dislike the fact that experienced players know in advance when certain historical events are going to happen and base their strategy on that knowledge. Here is another problem: the religious game is like a game in a game. Other players just do not care what the Papacy and the Protestants are doing, as long as they are not winning. It's like four guys are playing tennis together while two guys a playing poker on the field. I hope Virging Queen will fix this problem (it did, but it has other stupid issues and I do not play the game anymore).

Oh what do I say about Here I Stand? Two dozen subsystems, hundreds of moving parts, exception upon exception... yet all of it contributes to a relatively historically sound depiction of one of the most fascinating periods of history. A whole continent was found, wars were started, a church was torn in two. While it's a monster to learn and I will rarely have the time for it, it's an absolute blast to play.

Basically you're trying to grab a bunch of key spaces on the board, but you'll need alliances to help you along the way. Each power also has special ways to achieve VP, and some like the Protestants don't even really care about the keys for much of the game. In our two-turn, 6-hour learning game, the Protestants jumped from being non-existent to being tied for the lead. Very dynamic swings of fortune. A joy to participate in.

Wow, second play was even better. There is so much going on here, but it all makes sense thematically and ties together very well. If this didn't take 2-3 months and a ton of string pulling to get a session together, it would be a "10" for sure.

Components (baring no solid game maps of days of old Avalon Hill) are rather lavish.  The cards are beautifully done with the sense of the history they portray.  The player aid charts help with set-up and the scenarios.  The 1532 scenario is by far the best as players are positioned for victory in only a few turns (get those dice ready!) and is rather tense.  I found the 1517 scenario a yawner; which might actually be a good scenario to newcomers introduced to the fray if you have several hours to play (and player's patient enough to get the new-bees up to speed).  Overall, this game captures (and covers) a considerable amount of (unknown to most) history in a manageable format that is both entertaining and informative.  The rich historical notes and the sequence of historical events presented in game turn numbers is a bonus.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Interesting ideas, but I found the execution extremely annoying and will refuse to play this again, hence the low rating. I enjoy card driven systems with their ops vs events decisions in the main - what doesn't work is the huge downtime in a 6 player game using this system. Watching the Papacy and Protestants play glorified Yahtzee for 7 hours in a futile backwards-and-forwards contest for religious control is the definition of dull. Waiting whilst the others resolve moves and combats and builds is dull. Playing a card for instant execution and then waiting 5 minutes for your next play is dull. In a low VP game, having VP's determined in the New World by a 2d6 roll is irritating. Not being able to attack the leader because they're on the opposite side of the board is irritating (and yes I know that alliances allow you to spring deploy over there - nonetheless). Never have I invested so much time into a game - reading and re-reading the 40 pages of rules and then the 7 hours play time itself - for so little reward.

RATING: 10
I put off buying this because of the need for at least 3 players, but with the Diplomacy deck which came with C3i #19, I went ahead and bought it, mainly because of my interest in the theme, and because the learning the combat system and card play would help me with The Napoleonic Wars. 

That said, the 2 player game concentrates very much on the religious struggle as the players are the Papacy and the Protestants, so a lot of the other stuff (like Piracy and the New World exploration) doesn't get a look in. Having played 2 player, I really want to try a 3 player game, but the chances are slim unless I can fix it up over PBEM.

Update - got a 3-player face-to-face game in and really enjoyed it. Now playing a 6 player PBEM game which seems to be moving at 1 card play a month so I keep forgetting what my stategy is :-)

I have had rather more opportunity to play Here I Stand than would normally be the case for a 6-player strategy game, mostly due to face -to-face and online tournaments sponsored by the BPA.

Interesting game, a lot is going on, lots of historical flavour.
On the other hand, lots of downtime, lots of rules (read: too many), and too much is going on - it's difficult to focus on everything, and if you don't, and only look at your own small sphere of influence, it could get a bit long. Hmm. Rating may go up with more play, but at the moment, it's an interested soso.

An Excellent cdg type game for six players. Awesome theme and educational. You feel like you are living the history. The narrative that flows out of this thing is fantastic! I wish there were some computer games out there that could manage to capture what this game does. Maybe some day.

Unfortunately the game is brought down by some fiddely rules, long downtimes (at least at first), and long play time. This game is an event which needs to planned for. Everyone NEEDS to read the rules, they really do. Otherwise the game slows to a crawl. It took six hours to get through 3 of 9 turns. I'm sure that would improve with further plays with the same people. 

At some level I think this game could be a 10 with further plays, but for me its an 8.5 I think. 

I would though most likely, if I had the time and the 5 other players, play this epic monster every time. I think it will be hard to play other similar games and not think about the cool ideas in this one.

Favorite quotes that came out of our game: 

Papacy:"I feel like I need to burn some more books"
French:"Take that you silly english Kaaniigits"
English: " Help help I'm being repressed!"
French: " dang it, I think King Henry just successfully rolled Jane Seymore...wait that didn't sound right".
English: " Change history, say yes to divorce!"

edit: upgraded to a 9. I would give it a ten but the play time holds it back from a ten. took 6 hours to get less than half-way again.

edit: Awww who am I kidding? This game is awesome beyond belief. I've dreamed about this game. I've thought about this game months later. I've wished for other games that could capture the feel of this one and drive a powerful narrative. It may not get played much, but it is the best board gaming experience I've ever had. This puppy is a 10!

edit: a fantastic game. Not sure how many times I will get to play it though. Also seems like it might have a number of limited plays in it. Awesome while it last though. Decided on a final score of 9.

edit: I realize that if I have an opportunity to play this game I will choose it over anything else in my collection. So therefore it goes back up to a 10 flaws and all.

This game was a terrible experience with four; the two player who got two powers each totally steamrolled the rest of us, and created hours of downtime to boot.

That said, this game is nifty and I'd play again, but ONLY with six players.

Great gods, what a game! I don't think I've ever been so anxious and excited to play a game again. Game Play Weight goes to 11. 

Tentative rating. Can't wait to play it with 6 (even if it would likely take 16 hours or so)! This could very well be a top 10 game for me. Love everything about it, except maybe the playing time and player number. And the rules length, I guess. 

I like that it plays well with 3 too, and that there's a 2-player variant. Makes it easier to get a game in than something like Diplomacy.

Excellent multiplayer game.
However, in 12 matches the habsburg won half ofthe times.
The papacy has no chance and won none of them. Their best result was a second place.
The game never lasted beyong turm 6.
Downtime maybe a problem for many players as well as a poor hand.

It is on some level interesting to get a abstracted sense of why historic events went a certain way. Loads of downtime between turns, as each faction participates in completely different mechanisims, which many times only involve one or two of the other players. This leads to long downtime and entire areas of the game certain factions just don't have any influence over. Many factions have 'best moves' that are somewhat telegraphed. Seems like an area control game, but the action cards and reinforcement rules are harsh making it hard to keep any conquered territory, which I suppose keeps it historic and accurate.

I would like to play this with 6 people, but I don't think it will ever happen.  My only play was 3 players and I found it difficult to manage 2 different powers while trying to learn the basic mechanics.  Downtime was a big problem. I also had many battles where I was the superior force but ended up getting routed. Combat resolution seemed too dicey with no ability to manage a bad die roll.

RATING: 7
Awesome looking game. It has a lot of theme and covers a very interesting historical period. 

I like how the different powers must use different strategies and they have different victory conditions to strive. It leads to open play of how you can improve your position. At a glance several powers are in difficult positions. The game forces a lot of diplomacy since it is interest of the players to trade card play.

The richness of the system does make the game complex, there are lot of modules and steps to consider. To follow history the card deck is heavily managed, with cards being added and forced to be played. All this makes the game one that is difficult to wrap your mind around and would require several plays to understand.

The drawback is that it really needs 6 players, who have studied at least the requirements of the power they are playing. It is tough to get that complement.

I finally got to play this at Dragonflight XXX (2009). Seems like a great game, but I have only played it once, and I lost badly.

Wow. This is one brilliant game. Well balanced and very thematic. Different factions have different objectives, powers and mechanics, yet it all fits together like the best designed jigsaw.

not quite deserving of 'here i snore' monniker, but serious downtime. the real prob is that most victory points are given out on basically a random basis by events or dierolls for exploration or babies. the only thing saving this game is that its the only game on the subject.

I am torn with how to rate this game.  I could go with a rating that is just with if you had five other players to play this game with and the free Saturday to play it.  Or I could talk about how one might as well not play it if one does not have that compliment.  I could talk about AP or the fact that everyone needs to be committed to keeping the game going.  There are many directions one could take.  Then there is the fact that it makes a seemingly great online game.  

So, it is great under the right circumstances.  Unfortunately, those circumstances do not happen as often as desired.

RATING: 5
Downgraded from 7 to 5!

Pros:

* Ample opportunity for negotiation
* Very interesting theme

Cons:

* Horrific downtime. During our last game, the Hapsburg and the Ottomans were playing abstracts while waiting for their turns.

* This is by far the most convoluted take-that game out there. I don't mind having to deal with occasional crappy hands. What I do mind, though, is not knowing what to expect from my opponents. Of course, I could alleviate this by studying the entire deck, but I am not going to do that. Compare this with Twilight Struggle: All the cards are gone through at least once, so after only a couple of plays you have an idea what to expect in the game. And even during your first play, you are already anticipating those powerful mandatory scoring cards.

=============

UPGRADED from a 5 to a 7.

Finally played an almost full game (we ended at turn 5; it would have probably ended at game 6). This time around, we figured out the game. It helps a lot if some have played before. And everyone else is willing to read the 43 page rulebook *before* playing. Prepare for your first game becoming a disaster.

Why I bought the game: it was a heavily themed, multi-player negotiation game.

What you get: The most convoluted take-that game ever. Negotiation basically devolves to how to hit the leader -- scoring is open.

If you are a Euro-snoot and expecting Twilight Struggle, multi-player, then stay away! This is your typical GMT war game,

What sucks most about the game: It's a multi-player combat-driven game, but 90% of the time, only two players are ever involved in a conflict. This is fine if turns went by fast, but they do not. Worse, someone might (rightfully) take ten minutes for his turn, while you only need 30 seconds. I don't mind waiting for my turn if it's worth my time to pay attention to other players. However, in many cases there is no incentive to do so. For example, the Papacy and the Protestants are involved in a religious war that has little impact on the other four factions (those other factions do give die modifiers, but those situations are incidental -- those factions have much more pressing issues to deal with, namely themselves). So while the Papacy and Protestants duke it out with what some BBG commenter called "glorified Yatzee" all that the other players could do is roll their eyes.

However, the theme is well-implemented, and the gaming group with whom I play these kinds of long, drawn out games are very entertaining, which might explain why I have raised this one to a 7, which is probably too inflated.

=========================

Tentative rating after one learning game that lasted until Turn 4.

Why is this so highly rated? I hope I could find the time to try this again, but the first play gives a really bad impressions.

Summary: Stay away from this game unless you are experience grognards or have a group of wannabe grognards who are willing to play several long, disappointing learning games.

Problems:
1. The rule book. Every phase contains step-by-step instructions including every foreseeable exception. However, if you're trying to learn the game with these kinds of rules, it's impossible to absorb them. You simply get lost in the details. The game with this much chrome should have the base rules succinctly written with cross-reference to the chrome. The most frequently used phrase during our game was "Give me the rulebook."

2. The luck factor. Compare this game to another CDG Twilight Sruggle.

In TS game, all the cards are seen by the players before the cards are reshuffled and dealt again. This allows players to more accurately plan what's about to come. In HiS, all played cards are shuffled into the deck after each game turn. So there's a chance that some cards will never appear in a game, and other cards that will appear multiple times.

In TS, event cards that are good for the opposing player will be activate by yourself, so there is a good deal of tension with regards of trying to get rid of these cards. In HiS, event cards good for an opposing player are simply played as command points, so there's less decision making in terms of whether to use a card as an event or CP.

In TS, you have a hand size of about 7-8 cards. In HiS, it can be much, much smaller, which increases the chance you might be dealt a really bad hand.

3. Player interaction. HiS is actually two war games in one: a political war game in which about four factions vie for control over key spaces on the board, and a religious war game in which two factions fight over all the spaces on the board. Unfortunately, if you're involved in one war, there's little reason to pay attention to the other one early in the game. That said, I only played one game and do not yet comprehend how these two wars interact with each other. Still, it was somewhat annoying to watch the Papacy and the Protestants duel it out with their totally random theological debates and know that there is no way we could have fun in their alternative die-rolling world.

Also, we didn't fully understand how to take advantage of the diplomacy phase.

HERE IS AWESOME

I've played this twice and I really want to play this again. It combines so much. First of all, you learn a ton about the history and politics at the time. You learn about influential people such as Martin Luther and his Thesis and also about famous events such as the Diet of Worms (ew!). As a game though, it combines diplomacy and absolutely asymmetric forms of gameplay. England is trying to get a kid. Hapsburgs are trying to hold onto their land from being attacked from 3 sides. The Protestants are trying to evangelize, etc. Not only that, but It's almost like 3 games of 1v1 rather than a simple free-for-all. The Protestants are pitted against the Papacy. The Hapsburgs have to deal with the Ottomans who are raiding their seas. The British and French are going at it, the first conflict being Scotland, etc. There is so much richness to this game that I'd say it's one of the best board games ever made. The issues are several from the playability standpoint. First of all, the rules are long and complex. The game also takes a long ass time. The last is that You REALLY need 6 players to make this game. You can play with 3, with players controlling 2 powers each, but that's really suboptimal. There is a 1v1 variant, but I doubt I'd get into that as well. It's really a masterpiece, but I wonder if I'll EVER get this on the board.

This is such a fantastic game, it really pulls you into the period and has so many layers between powers and interaction among them.  I marvel at the work that Ed Beach as performed on this game.  There seems to be very regular upsets with all the factions; don't underestimate that long-shot nor get too comfortable when making opponents roll them. Here I Stand would be better with more probabilities put on the curve and using less dice in the rolls.

The dice mechanic really may be that distracting to an otherwise brilliant design. 

It does have me refreshing history, with more awareness within the period (which is marvelous) and I suspect that a good many people that experience this game will do the same!  If you get a chance to play this game, DO IT!

A very clever game.  However, the very long playing time and the requirement that it works best with 6 people means that I can't say that this game will be a favorite of mine.

I've played one game (from 2:30 pm to past midnight) and didn't finish it.  The game was only about 40% done.  However there were a bunch of new players.  The majority of my time was spent sitting waiting for other people to finish their turns.  

Apart from the length, the religious 'battles' are dull.  Roll dice - again and again.  They are also very scripted, the reformation leaders always come down in specific areas and can't be moved.

I bump this game up a half point because you can learn a lot of history from it, and that is something I find valuable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
My fave heavy & long CDG despite only 1 play. 

Amazing game that manages to capture the thematic considerations of each nation of the period and hence producing asymmetric gameplay and objectives for each faction that interacts subtly and elegantly with other factions while being historically sound.  Tense and fun to play with the Papacy and Protestant's game play climaxing after 5 to 6 turns, placing a limit to the number of turns and preventing games from becoming too draggy. Prefer it to Virgin Queen.

I really enjoy the diplomacy in this game.  There is a lot of skill during that phase to set up your turn.  However, the backstabbing and die-rolling can completely change everything causing you to rethink and adapt.

Good 6 player CDG. I feel it gives VPs sometimes too randomly (Copernicus, new world...). However random VPs also help to end the game in a reasonable time.

RATING: 9.5
The game has a lot of different facets, war is only part of the trade. Diplomacy is important and of course a portion of "machiavellique" grain is needed to win. Each side has its own specific way of achieving victory. For example the Protestant player has to translate the New Testament and the Bible to achieve Victory Points, whereas the Ottoman player may gain VPs through Piracy actions in the Mediterranean.

A hugely positive side-effect: the game got me interested in the whole "Reformation" thing and I must confess that I missed a lot of the story. Of course I knew about Luther and being squelched between the German Protestants and the French Catholics I knew some about the Reformation, but in the end not too much.

A game not only for those interested in the period. Excellent multi-player game.
For those interested in the period it might even be played solitaire just to see history develop.

Multiplayer card driven wargame, involving the six major powers during the wars of the reformation. Each power has asymmetric abilities, actions, and goals. Protestants aim to print books, convert cities, translate the bible, and disgrace the papacy; Ottomans earn points for piracy; England, France, and the Hapsburgs explore the New World and get bonus VPs for special goals (e.g. England for producing a male heir); and the papacy earns points for keeping cities catholic, burning protestant debaters at the stake, and expanding St. Peter's basilica. The game flow involves Preparation (introducing turn-specific items, rolling for New World riches, and dealing cards);  Diplomacy (secret deal-making or war declaring phase); Troop Deployment; Actions (via cards); Wintering (troops head to your capital or the nearest fort); resolution of Explorations in the New World; and finally checking for victory. The first to 25 VPs wins the game.

Finding the cognitive load and shear fiddliness of this game (and Virgin Queen), when combined with the extreme player requirements and playing time, combine for a wearying tabletop play experience.

=======================================================

Not an especially complex game mechanically, but there sure are a lot of moving parts. What gives the game such sparkle is the colourful history that the mechanics represent. And the balance between playing the system and playing the other players is perfect. Stands in the upper echelon of all-day multiplayer experiences.

I have to get five other enthusiasts who can endure extensive English reading and have the patients to sit around the table for probably 5 hours.

I've enjoyed my PBEM games of this: the evocation of the historical period is amazing and the interaction of military, political, dynastic and religious elements works extremely well. However, I can't imagine wanting to play this face-to-face (at least with more than 3 players), as some players would have long periods of not doing much. 

Certainly not a game for those who don't like having their best-laid plans being sent awry by a poor die roll or a the lucky chance that's one's opponent has exactly the right card for the situation.

1 play Tournames rules, Played the Catholics.  A lot going on with two sets of rules plus lots of exceptions from the cards.  Great game but going to take more than 1 play to really get it.

2nd play with full length game, 6 players.  Was a great game.  The back biting and deal making was very enjoyable.  Only it's length keeps it from being a 9 or a 10.

3rd play, 2 player.  Not as good 2 player but still a solid game.

Fascinating in a couple of early plays, mostly b/c of the rich historical setting, although I suspect some (most? all?) powers will have rather formulaic moves after a few games, not that I'd ever want to find out. 

Too many rules, too much time, too much downtime, too few decisions, not as much interaction as I anticipated. Tourney scenario likely better. I'd play this again, but only if I didn't have to read the rules and as a social occasion with friends. Seems highly unlikely. 

Successors, which has the added bonus of less strait-jacketed history, has it all on this multi-sleeper soporific. Diplomacy, Machiavelli, Holy Roman Empire, etc.

On the other hand there is quite a bit of downtime, rules that try to simulate more than create fun gameplay (personal bias here), quite a few subgames that involve only a couple of the players at a time (with rules that get fiddly with each one). I still don't know what all the dice rolling between the Papacy and Protestants is all about. Things got flipped over in France while I was playing. I asked what that meant, and was told it really didn't affect me, I just had gone Protestant. I wondered why I had sat there watching them roll dice at each for 10 minutes for.
I do really want to play again though despite these "flaws".

Extremely well thought out theme and I adore the card mechanic, but at the end of the day it's really, really going to rely on the right players for balance and fun. You have to have a certain level of interest in the subject matter to get a kick out of this or else it's just going to go over your head and you'll be wasting your time. You're in it for the experience, but it certainly helps that the game mechanism is a good one.

The card driven mechanic works very well here. Depending up your success in various areas you'll be dealt a certain number of cards each turn. Of course the better you're doing the more of a target you are, so you'll need the extra cards to fend off combined attacks. You're allowed to retain a card or two between turns, so it's certainly a game where you'll have learnt about pacing yourself by the end of your first game. One of your cards is a powerful mandatory card, which must be played before you can pass in any round. So there's a lot to consider on the board, cards, troop levels, etc, but because of the multiplayer levelling aspect of the game I can't stress enough how important pacing yourself is. Everyone is trying to time their finish and automatic victories in the most quiet and subtle of ways.

There are a lot of dice rolls, wild swings in points based on cards that are hugely powerful, and some powers have almost no interaction beyond a couple of the other players. Amongst all that fine history and detailed rules the game is the most asymmetrical game I could imagine, teasing me with the memory of so many rules exceptions I can't recall off the top of my head. Once you've learned the rules and have an idea of what sort of cards will come out when, it cries out for further plays. When I devote seven hours to just one game I need to enjoy it if I'm going to keep cracking it open. This is a game that will definitely become more enjoyable the more often you bring it to the table.

One personal observation: I feel sorry for those playing a couple of the powers and how little they have to do in their turns beyond rolling dice after dice after dice. (For me personally there's a couple of powers I'm not keen on playing, but four I think would be fun for me.)

Take the wild card swings in your stride and ride the history train for an immersing game of balancing alliances and surprising moves. This really is an experience.

This is one of the best multi-player games I have ever played.  The card play is fantastic and the unique strategies of the powers just adds to the enjoyment.  There is so much to this game yet you do not feel overwhelmed by rules or analysis paralysis.  

The historical backdrop ties in perfectly with the paths to victory, you never feel chrome or theme is pasted on to the game mechanics.  The need for opponent interaction through diplomacy is what makes the game really shine and allow for endless replay value and tension.

The only downfall of this title is the inability work as well without the full 6 players, but that has been rectified somewhat by its sequel Virgin Queen.

RATING: 6.5
For the first 5 hours, we were all LOVING it...seriously. We commented on how the time was flying by, how the powers seemed balanced, and how fiddly things had been abstracted. At one point the guy playing the Papacy yelled out, "I want that guy DEAD!" after Luther screwed up his plans yet again. It was perfect. We were having a blast.

But then, somewhere between 5 and 8 hours, the flaws started to come to light. For one, there's a fair amount of downtime--particularly if you're not the Papacy or the Protestants--and we were playing quickly. This problem seems to get worse as the game progresses: You wait around for 10 minutes just to play a card and put some troops on the map. Lather. Rinse. Repeat. 

For the Papacy and Protestants it turns into a dicefest, and over the course of the game spaces just flip back and forth, and the P&P scores go slightly up and slightly down. By the end, those who weren't playing the P or the P commented that we were glad we weren't playing the P or the P.

The cards weren't full of interesting choices: It was either a great Event for you that you'd obviously play, or it was equally obvious that you should just play it for CPs. There were pretty large differences in the strengths of the Events. One gave 2 VPs to the Ottomans if they played it. What?! Our game was incredibly close, and that sort of swing for just drawing a card was wacky.

There was some bash-the-leader with those cards too. The Ottomans were set to win, but the Haps had a card that let him cause a revolt in a city, booting the Ottoman out and costing him the VPs. On the next turn the Ottoman player recaptured the city...but the Haps player had the drawn the SAME CARD on that turn and foiled him again. It was a less-than-gripping way to stave off victory.

There's also a rich-get-richer problem: As people gain Keys they gain VPs and cards, so if you lose a Key you're losing cards (turns) and your ability to gain a key back is limited further.

Another problem was the different setups for the different scenarios. We chose the 6-turn scenario, which skips the first three turns of the regular campaign. But the setup is completely wonky. Somehow France loses Milan, the English aren't anywhere to be seen in the New World, and the Hapsburgs are all over the New World--including circumnavigating the globe! There's very little chance of a real game that started from the beginning being at that point 3 turns later. So France was screwed from the beginning, and England was down in New World VPs from the start.

In the end, I wish the game could hold onto that first-5-hour-feeling we all had. Alas, we were quite happy for it to end by the time it did. The weird thing is, everyone said they'd play again, so I think we all recognized that it's SO close to being a great game. I liked the history; I liked the varying powers and varying ways to play each of those powers--which makes replay value through the roof; I didn't at all mind the length. It just feels like a nearly there game.

A terrific game, very broad in scope with a lot of different things happening, from military campaigns and sieges, to New World exploration and conquest, to burning heretics and translating the Bible. Each of the six powers plays very differently and has its unique victory goals. It's hard to get 6 players together for FtF play but it works great, perhaps even best, via email.

RATING: 10
My first game with 5 other beginners, took 11 hours and we still didn't  finish. Full of history, demanding and yet riveting. Lots of rules checking as there are plenty of exceptions to the standard rules. The diversity of goals for each power provides a superb interactive experience for all players. 
I have now played many times across the table and involved in three PBEM games - very engaging, one of the best games for years!

One of the big criticisms from those giving the game a low ranking seems to be downtime. Huh!!? After one or two games there is not enough time to consider your next move before it's your turn again. Once played TWO games in under 8 hours!! Besides, just about every impulse has repurcussions so it pays to stay focused on what is going on.

Another criticism (not from me) is the dice-fest, particularly between the religious powers. True, this is the weakest aspect of the game, but most gamers like rolling dice, so it's not a big issue. 

Most of our local group all played the game with no knowledge of card-driven games and now get withdrawal symptoms if we don't play HIS for a couple of months!

This is the first CDG I have played from GMT and I am very impressed. Lovely pieces and nice historical narrative in the scenario book.

Two partial plays now.  It's hard to know what to think about this game.  On the one hand, it's got enough going on for any three other games -- piles and piles of chrome, and I think I saw some tailfins in there too.  The sense of history is pretty good.  On the other hand, it's much ado about nothing.  After several hours and three turns, the board hardly looks different than when you started.  Some powers are animatronic - there's a lot of motion, but few decisions with any real impact.  The bottom line is that it's still a good time.  Just be prepared for the enormous effort.

This game is big and grand in scale.  The history is there, and the asymmetrical powers create some interesting struggle.  However, the game by necessity has a "gang up on the leader" problem that drags the game down and makes it feel like a real slog.

A fantastic game. If you have an interest in history and are prepared to invest 7-10 hours of your time then this is a winner. Played a few turns solo to get a feel, then a 3-player game, won by the Habsburgs at the end of turn 4 (military auto-win after the Ottomans made some tactical errors and got unlucky with the dice to boot).All three players involved enjoyed every minute and the time seemed more like 4 hours than the 9 it actually was (including setup and explaining the rules to them). The rulebook is very well laid out and it's quite easy to find the 'niggling' rules such as the effect of unrest, and which troops are catholic/which protestant and when. A few rules complexities that will require a game or two to get on top of, but generally the rules are very straightforward for a game of this depth. This game is a real achievement for the designer!

Rating increased from 9 to 9.5 after half a dozen PBEM and several FtF games. Once you know the rules inside out - it just gets better.

Wow. After one play (the game ended at the end of turn 4 with a French victory due to five more points than any other player) I am going to have to buy this. The asymmetrical powers, the card play, the chrome, the diplomacy, it all gels into a great game experience. I do find that playing cards for points and things like that take away a little from my feeling of historicity (especially when no reason is given for the points), but overall this was a really fun game and one that I want to explore much more. We are going to try and play this one more often. Hopefully, we can get together every month or so to play!

Preliminary rating. Six-player CDG covering the Reformation. Enjoyed the historical setting. Making efficient use of CPs is very important and negotiations with other powers have meaningful consequences. Main negative is long downtime between impulses (especially if short of cards), overall playtime, really does need 6-players, and constrained strategic paths for each faction.

RATING: 2.5
Boy, what a heartbreaker. I'd been looking forward to this for so long. As soon as we got the chance to play, it was on the table. Yuck. There is none of the angst that you get from Paths of Glory here, there are no tough decisions, all of your choices feel obvious and straight forward. I never felt the tension of whether to play my cards as actions or as CPs, either the card was great for me or it was an obvious CP move. Playing the pope was dreadfully dull. There weren't a staggering amount of choices, and those that you do make all are completely resolved by rolling tons of dice.

It never seems worthwhile to debate as you can spend your own CPs to lose territory. The first four turns seemed overwhelmingly clear and laid out for everyone involved (except perhaps the Hapsburgs). I almost feel like you just shouldn't bother with the protestants and just take keys for the auto-win. Even spending all your CPs on building the cathedral seems like a better option.

I traded places with the Ottoman player halfway through turn 3 hoping for some excitement and we both were let down by the real lack of worthwhile options available to us.

The first half of the game is so static. By turn 4 there is some difference in the board, but it seems like there is so much effort going on, and so much time committed for such little return.

There is a great sense of history here, and there is some wonderful chrome, but where is the game?

Awesome game - a nice blend of card-driven mechanics giving lots of options for how to play combined with some interesting victory point mechanics beyond simple warfare and objectives. Both the New World and the Reformation are presented with interesting mechanics that gives additional action options, plus I love the diplomacy. The only downside is that the players really need to pay attention in order to ensure the balance, and there is some scripting, as the Hapsburgs pretty much have to fight the Ottomans and the Papacy needs some help or it is easy for the Protestants to win. In particular, inexperienced players fail to maintain this balance well, and England is easy to win with and needs better work to reign them in.

This is maybe the most interesting game that I've ever played. It's a game among games. A classic masterpiece. Putting this multiplayer game together is quiet an achievement. Congratulations Ed for this superb release.

Played again with three players. A complete disaster as I only pulled out 1's and 2's on the dice! Played with the French and the Ottomans in a 3 player game that ended up with an easy victory of the Hapsburgs at the very beginning of the 4th turn. I didn't have any luck, something really really scary and had the feeling that playing with the Ottomans require some luck on the dice because they do actually live for battles and confrontation. As a result of this total lack of luck the Hapsburg player found himself alone in the map with no competitor in the East side giving him a real solid advantage and destroying the game balance.

There are still lots of things to learn and to try such as diplomacy and also long head planning. I found myself playing in a rush trying to get keys very early in the game and forgetting that the game should last for 9 turns and not only four or five. Some huge mistakes were made.

The best thing I can say about this game is that even though I didn't have any luck (any luck really!) in the end and after 5 or 6 hours of rolling bad dice and conducting my two major powers to disgrace I still had the desire of playing it! A great game!

Let me just say it again, I rate it a 10!

RATING: 5
Big disappointment - I was eagerly looking forward to it.  While better as a three-player game than a six-player (less downtime), one player (England-Protestants) still has less to do than the others.  As you can guess, I feel that only France, Hapsburgs and Ottomans have an interesting game in the six-player version.  And, I admit, for them it *is* a good game.

But there's simply too much "let's make it match history" - in the process it lost some of the "let's make a good game" aspect which I value more highly.  They added WAY too much chrome and piddly, fiddly details so it felt like history, making it a slow and frankly boring game.  Then they gave too many of the players too few options - to at least half the powers, your decisions are obvious and not even that exciting.  Feh.

I suspect it would make a good two-player game (Hapsburgs-England vs France-Ottomans) if you ripped out most of the religious aspects, including the appropriate cards.  But that was way too much work for me to do, so I traded it away. (The previous was written May, 2006.)

Edit June 2007: GMT has announced they are releasing a two-player conversion kit.  *sigh*  I have acquired another copy in trade, and have pre-ordered the two-player conversion kit, as I really, really want to make a game on this subject/era work!

I still haven't played but it seems to be a wonderful game and a lot of fun. Card driven mechanics are easy and fun to play. Unlike other games diplomacy is really important, and it really catches the feeling of the XVI century. Absolutely love the mixing of military, diplomatic, religious, economical and dynastical/political affairs. I expect so much of the game. Let's see the feelings when I finally have it checked.

A nearly perfect game. The game itself is awesome. But you have to have time to dedicate and players of equal (or semi-equal) ability.

I love the variable player powers, multiple paths to victory, card-driven mechanism, and even the diplomacy although it's not usually my thing.

Currently I only play pick-up games through ACTS; it's just too hard to get 6 people together for this.

I love this game.  There are few games I rank as tens, and for me they are games I always want to hit the table and always have that 'magic' about them.  Here I Stand combines so many mechanics and game ideas into a perfect, fluid game.  While not every nation has the same chance of victory, I enjoy that in a game like this.  It makes diplomacy with others that much more important!

I own the 2-Player Diplomacy Deck.

HIS is a great game that I waited a long time to get and then find enough people willing to play.  

You need to dedicate a day or break it up into two sessions.  Having people with an attention span longer than a couple hours makes it much better.

The different countries provide for gamers with different personalities to thrive.  If you have a person who just wants to attack and not really worry about politics or religion, then the Ottomans are perfect.

Protestants and Papacy have less fighting, but need to really focus on different ways to stem the changing tide of the swings.  Some political savvy is helpful.

Holy Roman Empire, France and Britain are the others and can really be the ones that must be able to multi-task.  They can't afford to focus on just one approach.  These players can make or break a game.  If one of these players is too timid, shy or a pushover, then it can ruin the game.

I will still play this game whenever I get the chance, but another friend has a copy and our group is too unreliable to plan on getting all the required players together.  This is a great game for a long convention because you can get the entire game played.  I'm not sure I would play at a 1-2 day con as it would seem like you are burning too much time on a single game, but if it is a favorite, then it is worth it.

Still working on this one. It seems a fantastic game - lots of interrelationships, plenty of choices. As a simulation it's a failure (like all CDGs), despite its veneer: there's no sense of the interrelationship of some of the events. Outside of that, it's been a great game so far.

Played once with 6 players. Incredible thematic, but... a little bit too long. You need to be ready to read the rules for about two evenings, explain them for minimum 1h30 to the other players and play your first game in about 12 hours. If you're ready to do that, you will have a great evening. Otherwise, pass your turn on this one. For heavy gamers only.

So hard to get to the table. Components and board wise absolutely gorgeous. I have play one 7 player game that went 8 hrs plus and had a awesome time. The group I played with spent weeks discussing the game afterwords. The only major downside is that it's so hard to get to the table because of the player count and time involved. I hope one day soon to play Virgin Queen it's successor. If you love diplomatic games with a solid but relatively light Wargame mechanism that truly gives you the feel of the reformation then this game is for you. Doesn't sound like much of demographic but you would be selling yourself short not to try this game.

Unfortunatly this is much better with 6 players, and my group only has 5.  With 5 players one person takes two countries (who normally are allied - that only gets odd when one is about to win).

RATING: 7
This is a well-thought out game with a lot of interesting features.  It ultimately gets boring since many of the factions are relatively impotent.  How does the English player stay entertained?  This game takes too long to get going for most of the people on the map.  How do the Hapsburgs win?  If any of your explorers, colonists, or conquistadors fail, you have no chance and even if they succeed, your lands are easily poached.  These are the questions which I still cannot resolve.

The various factional arrangements do encourage a good amount of thought and strategy, which is always a good thing, but ultimately the the explorations, conquests, colonies, debates, and treatise conversions are based solely on dice.  If in war, a good strategist usually trumps a good tactician in the end, in this game, a lucky and average player will destroy a good player with average luck.

[thing=17392][/thing] is a beast of a game - it is hard to pass the full scope of it. To make matters short, [thing=17392][/thing] is a card-driven game of negotiation and batlles, both of armies as of ideas, in heated debates between the Papacy and the Protestants. The six main powers in the game have an unique card, that can be used each turn, and have different strenghts and ways to gain points, as the goal for everyone is to have the most points at the end of the game.

[thing=17392][/thing] has a not often seen feature: basically an intrigue phase, in which the powers can talk among themselves in secret from others, and set alliances, deals and other options. Then comes a more usual action phase, which remind me of a multiplayer version of Twilight Struggle: players use cards either for the event written or for the points that allow to raise armies, hire mercenaries, build ships, move, explore the New World, and many other possibilities, specially for the Protestants and Papacy - the other 4 powers do a more regular approach of battling for key cities in order to gain more power. There are mandatory events, that must be played, and some powers can hold a few cards for the next round.

While [thing=17392][/thing] is very deep, it also counts with a good deal of luck, specially for the occasional players. Battles are decided by dice rolls - though a bigger army has more chances of winning, small forces can hold pretty well with luck. The blind card draw can also give a cards with better events and/or CPs for one, and others in the lower end to someone else. These swings must be dealt by player interaction - usually by calling for peace, alliance or pointing fingers to a power ahead. All is valid - this is a social game, not a multiplayer solitaire: talking and convincing your fellows are very helpful in order to do well.

[thing=17392][/thing] is also quite long. The full scenario can run much longer than the given 6 hours - though it can end sooner, due to someone pulling ahead after the 4th round. Downtime is likely the biggest problem - as the powers receive different amount of cards, and happens often that a power must pass, and wait for quite a while until the other players end their turns - in one play, the England player waited for around [b]1 hour[/b] to play again! Maybe a record.

The scope of [thing=17392][/thing] is big and features an amazing period of time. There is so much happening, and the game gives space to basically everything: you can battle the Ottomans, burn people and books, debate, sail to the New World to explore, conquer or colonize, follow the bed adventures of Henry VIII (a game that has a Pregnacy table sure is special), do some piracy, and so many other possibilities. This is the 1% of games - the rich among rich.

Overall, playing [thing=17392][/thing] is truly and experience. Maybe not a great one - it surprises no one that HiS isn't for everyone: too much time, too much luck, too much downtime, too many options, too open and social, too mean, too deep; you can pick. Yet, [thing=17392][/thing] shows how far games can go, how memorable and grandiose in scope. It is daring, bold and a little maniacal, and ask the same from the players.

Sadly, in spite of its name, [thing=17392][/thing] won't be a game that will hit the tables often, due to high and demanding standards, but one that brings a greatness not often found when it does. Recommended for the brave.

A great multi-player system with multiple ways to win.  I enjoy the decisions that need to be made each turn.  The diplomacy phase is a great addition to the system.  Make a deal with your opponents to slow down the person in the lead or to gain an advantage some how for yourself.  Each game played is different and one can never be certain they will get the key card they need for victory.  The abtract religion system gives one a feel for the religious conflict between Protestants and Catholics.

My favourite Multiplayer CDG. It really has it all. It's deep, lenghty (this being a pro for me. I think the longer a game is the less relevant luck becomes) and every power plays entirely different. It has a strong diplomatic component and a simple, yet rewarding military system.
I cannot express a more heartfelt recommendation.
This is THE CDG bar none.

Downgraded from a 9 after ~15 plays as the impression was confirmed that the game is more often than not decided by  hefty doses of lucky events.

I love history and the Reformation era.  HIS is a great game that captures the military and spiritual warfare of the age.  The game also captures the intrigue of diplomacy with the full 6 players trading cards and forming treaties to make gains toward their goals.  An outstanding game. However, the game is fairly complex (42 pages of rules) and needs time for players to really get it.  But if you have the time to put in to it, you get much back.

An impressive game on every level. Here I Stand incorporates many layers of gameplay to model the various military, political, and religious conflicts of the era and is structured in such a way that each power intersects those layers differently. You could play this game six times (as each power) and feel that you've played a different game each time. Within all that gaming is a ton of great history, which the various events, home cards, and victory paths bring out nicely. And the graphic design of the game, besides being nice to look at, does an admirable job keeping all the information straight.

The only reservation I have with the game is the time and energy commitment required to play it. The games I've played tend to run 8-10 hours, and that's with an experienced group. There's also a fair amount of downtime as you wait for the other players to take their turn. There are various official ways to shorten the game and/or play it with less than the natural six players. But, personally, when I look at a game with such wonderful history and so much potential for player interaction, it's hard not to want to play the whole shebang, especially considering how hard it is to schedule that many people to play in the first place. So I consider this an "event game" - one that I would enthusiastically play a couple of times per year, but certainly not something I could find the time or the energy to sit down to every week or even every month. Still, in the end, Here I Stand is a marvelous game and highly recommended.

Long and clunky.  For me this game did not strike the right balance between historical accuracy / immersion and playability.  There was too much chrome which made game play incredibly slow.  A very poor choice in a 6 player game where down time is amplified by even the smallest bits of extra fluff.

The game told a great narrative but wasn't particularly fun for me.  If we could have done that in 4 hours instead of 12 it would have been a different story.

This is a great choice if BOTH of the following apply to your group: (1) You have exactly 6 people in your group. (2) At least some people in your group have experience with wargames, preferably card-driven wargames (CDGs). If you're new to CDGs or only have 2 in your group, I'd suggest We The People. If you have 4 in your group, I'd suggest Sword of Rome. If you have 5 in your group, I'd suggest The Napoleonic Wars.

RATING: 4
Almost every victory point comes at a favorable die roll, but the saving grace is the diplomacy and manner that very different factions fighting different wars with different operations fold into one another into a coherent game. That's no small feat. 

I'm less enamored with it after the past couple of plays. There appears to be more choices than one actually has for each faction. Many offensives would rely upon a combination of unerring brinksmanship and incredible card draws that make for little more than two options a) pursue early victory, or b) grind out vp and hope for a late implosion of opponents. My last game had three players lamenting how dull their powers were to play, and by some miracle, none of them were playing the Protestants. 

A game of this length could afford more creative approaches to victory, but it relies on diplomatic interaction to offset its numerous shortcomings. I'm lowering my rating to a 4.

The great roll-off for Strasbourg! I had hoped to play this for some time as a long time player of Europa Universalis on PC. While there are interesting aspects of the game, I can find all of those in other games I like more that play in 1/4 the time that this does. I love the idea of an all day game about the Reformation, but this one sadly disappointed.

Amazing in both scope and gameplay.  This is THE best game for variable player powers.  Not only do you have variable player powers, you have variable player [i]goals[/i], and even variable player mechanics.  There are complete subgames like piracy and the religious struggle that most powers never participate in.  All this and the game still seems impeccably balanced.  I've seen every single power win, a rarity in games that are so asymmetrical.  This game takes a play or two to get a good strategic grasp of it, which is only unfortunate when you consider that it can take 8 hours or more to finish a game.  Still, when you're going for an all-day historical wargame, you can't do better than this.

First GMT war game I've played (I believe).  I like the unique path to victory aspect.   Didn't utitlize the secret diplomacy as much as I should have.   Played with 3 players.  It did drag a little timewise, but fun overall.  Seems like assaults are tough and attacking ports with a ship are extremely tough.   Probably helps keep this "war" game balanced a bit for the Papacy/Protestants.

RATING: 9.5
Played via Vassel - great combination of Diplomacy and CDG (how must do you trust your ally) - and the fact that you absolutely NEED to ally with others to accomplish your goals.


Edit.  The more I play, the more I appreciate how all of the pieces fit together from turn order, to victory conditions to card play - pushing my ratign to 9.5

Does require a good group of people to play with to realize potential (which would move this to a 10)

I have fallen in love with this one. After 2 solo plays to get clear on the mechanics, I have gotten into a PBEM for newbies moderated by the designer, Ed Beach, and the game rocks! Diplomacy adds a whole level of playing complexity, and the combined military/religious power struggle is fascinating.

Tentative rating after one 3-player game.
My first experience with a CDG, and I really like the mechanic so far.  There is a lot going on in HiS, but the learning curve is defiantly worth it.  I%u2019m worried that play-time with 6 will keep the game off the table, especially as I imagine it takes several games to really grok all strategies.  I wish the naval rules were less obtuse.

RATING: 8
Wonderful historical simulation, but just too long and with a ton of rules and downtime that just drags its rating down from what could very well have been a masterpiece.

Increased its rating since by the time all players are experienced with the game, it flows much more smoothly. It still requires a ton of time investment, though, and it absolutely needs the full 6-players complement.

[500th Anniversary Edition] This edition is just excellent. Modifies just a few things (couple of cards, some minor rules) which bugged some people in the original edition. If possible it is now even better than before.

The more I play this one the more I like it. There is a lot to this game with each faction having unique ways to gain victory. It is very long which is one of the only drawback. The other being if there are newbies playing they would probably be taken advantage of. If you get a chance try it out. And if you played it already try and get it back to the table at least every six months so you don't forget the myriad of rules there are.

Beautiful game. Greatly enriches the treatment of this period, which was done decades ago by SPI's Mighty Fortress. Lots of historical chrome. Players can definately sense the role they have to play. However, player strategy choices seem rather obvious at times, and the combat system is very light. Can take most of a day to play if things stay balanced. Worth playing.

One of the best games I have played. For those who can play real time I recommend playing at wargameroom.com As much as I love this game, I have found myself playing it less for two big reasons:

The 3 and 4 player games suffer because each power has two decks. You end up with the Eng/Prot and Haps/Pope teaming up a LOT more then they would in a 6 player. You can find yourself losing battles against the English or the Haps because the religious power is playing cards it wouldn't in a normal game.

Unfortunately this leads to another problem. In the 5 or 6 player games, a less experienced player is at a distinct disadvantage. I wouldn't recommend sticking the new player with the Ottos, as it really makes it too easy for the Haps. The English when not teamed with Prots are a much better choice for a new player.

It's a great game, but it's problems have slowed me down on playing it.

Love this CDG.  Like online play but wish I could get it to the table locally.  Having fun as Charlie V in an online game now.  Have not tried the 2p variant but own the deck.  Nice historical nuggets and got me to watch the Tudors on Netflix just to bone up on the "revised" history.

RATING: 10
This game rocks.  There are several things going on at once.  There is the military struggle - the Ottomans against the Hapbsurgs, the French against the Papacy, the Hapsburgs against everybody, England against the French...  

There is the Age of Exploration element - circumnavigating the globe is worth significant VP, and establishing colonies brings extra cards, a valuable benefit.

And of course the religious game.  Protestantism spreads as Bibles are translated and debates won.  But the Counter-reformation is underway and the Catholics/Papacy aren't taking this Reformation stuff lying down.

So you can win by conquering people.  Or by encouraging - or stopping - the spread of Protestantism.  Or by procreating successfully (Henry VIII).  Such fun!

A reasonably heavy game that will take a day to play.  But a great experience.

Fantastic game, raised to a ten after Play #4.

On the whole this is Napoleonic Wars with knobs on. A lot of chrome, seriously diverse victory paths, make this for a great contender for any evening spent on a multiplayler wargame. 

Personally, I can hardly decide which of the two, plus Sword of Rome, I like best. I simply like them all, and am glad to own all three of them. Sheer joy!

Love the asymmetry, the setting, the interplay of powers, but the luck swings - both from individual dice rolls and from the game's flawed cardplay - make playing HiS as unsatisfying a game as it is satisfying as a gaming experience.

More on the cardplay.  A shared deck, small hand sizes, cards that give enormously powerful events but only if a certain player holds them, and the wide variance in Ops mean that the entirety of HiS card play is enormously swingy while simultaneously not providing much of a choice during play. Most of the card play boils down to 'Duh, use it for Ops!' or 'Duh, use it for event!', which is very much at odds with TS and PoG, where those decisions can be both impactful and excrutiating. To be fair, I think the cardplay in most CDGs fall well short of those two games, but it seems particularly problematic here.

The history, and the chrome, of the game are brilliant and make me want to ignore a lot of HiS's technical flaws, but in the end, those flaws remain.  Still, as a playing experience, the game is well worth your time.

One 12-hour, 6-player game of the 1517 scenario.  Rich, evocative, and long enough for players' fortunes to rise and fall and rise again.  Probably can't play it more than once or twice a year, but I'll look forward to those plays.

Un multijugador largo sobre la Europa de la Reforma, englobando distintos aspectos políticos, religiosos y militares. Asimétrico y aparentemente interesante, pero el juego tiene un altísimo factor de suerte en casi todos los aspectos. Para un juego de 10 horas, esto lo hace ser un juego que no volveré a jugar. Le di una segunda oportunidad, y fue a peor la sensación.

RATING: 10
Not the easiest game to get to the table due to the number of players, game length, and rules length.  That being said, this is an excellent game.  Adding the new cards and reformers each turn and mandatory events causes history to progress yet without it feeling too scripted.  The asymmetrical powers cause different strategies for each and different bonus VPs to pursue.  The nature of the game requires diplomacy and shifting alliances.

After first game I'm thrilled. I found that HIS delivered what it promised, 10 hours were filled with political plotting, scheming and backstabbing. Game is full of theme & historical fluff and it just enforces my love for this game. Only thing that I mourn is that most of the players I played this with thought that it was way too long. Now I fear that the chances to get playing this again are horridly low.

The definition of role playing and history-referential comments inviting game. Best game about history in existence – and I wasn't at all interested in the period before buying. Also the most stratified diplomacy game there is. Beautiful components. 
I actually set this one in front of 6 people of whom 3 or 4 were complete newcomers to board games in general. And we had a blast!
I guess my only problem is that I was never attracted to play it competitively, as it is after all meant to be played according to the designer and the community.
It is also very very demanding: 9 hours and 6 players is effectively the only way playable.

RATING: 9
Here I Stand provides an interesting insight into the 16th century. The main positive feature is the feeling of being there and the intense competition between players. In our first game five out of six players had a reasonable chance to win with one turn left. On the negative side I find the tedious shuffling of the protestant - catholic frontline, the awkward debate sequence and the bucket-of-dice fest it is. In the end this is compensated by the positive factors for an overall positive verdict.

It's amazing how they managed to balance a game for 6 players, that additionally plays totally different, depending on which side you are.

Just playing the Ottomans is sometimes a bit boring, due to longer downtime and lacking interaction...

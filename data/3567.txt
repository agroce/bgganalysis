RATING: 7
For what it is, it's really a cute little game. Based on a computer game where you actually build rollercoasters, this game is a little silly on the face of it. However, it's not a badly designed game and I've enjoyed more than a few rounds of this one.

Received unplayed and cheap in an Ebay deal.  Wow.  This is a Hasbor/Parker Brothers game?  This was a lot of fun!  Keeps to the theme of the video game and moves rather quickly.  Kids loved it and the 3D coasters and rides are neat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
No building of roller coasters here, but the auction mechanic is strong.  Also the idea of moving pieces that don't belong to any specific player is fairly unique in a Hasbro game.  It's a nice quick game with good components.  It would be a great alternative for young people instead of some of the games we grew up playing.

RATING: 6
Not a bad game, but if you don't get some of the higher rides (at least a 3 point) you have little chance if any.

A decent kids game to teach them auctions and choice, but something I wouldn't pull out most of the time.

Pretty fun game, but very fiddly with all sorts of bits and pieces everywhere.  This is clearly a game that is far better as a computer sim than bord game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good family game.  Lots of fun auctions and opportunities to min-max your score.  Tough for kids to effectively value the attractions (they tend to pay more for them than they should...especially towards the end of the game when they likely won't pay out at all), but it is a great skill for them to learn!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
With kids... Fun combination of Monopoly and PayDay, with a great theme.  Auctions are great, I am not in love with the time progression mechanic.  I don't hate the card arrival method, I just don't like it.

RATING: 5
An entertaining game of managing amusement park rides by bidding on them and getting customers to visit them.  The event deck is really what makes this game tick and adds a level of excitement and fun to the game.  Very light, but fun to pull out once in a while!

This game is really better than I expected it to be...but that's not saying much. The components are pretty shoddy, although I like the larger roller coaster pieces. 

In the end, this one is too luck-riddled to count as a real game. I got my copy (now gone) for free...and that barely made it worth playing a time or two.

Surprisingly fun family game.  Scratches the monopoly itch without ego's or hurt feelings.  Competetive enough to get into, but low "screw over"factor.  If handled right, the blind and double blind auctions add a lot of excitement to the game.  Great for kids, enjoyable and quick enough for adults.

A good solid family game. Somewhat Monopoly-esque, but the movers are neutral and players collect "rent" from the bank instead of each other. When playing with more than 2 players, some of the decisions can be interesting in that each payout is shared by the "property" owner and the player moving the token ("With which opponent should I share a payout?"). A deck of event cards provides replayability as well as a variable endgame timer.

This turned out to be better than I had thought it was. The 3D looking game parts look nice, though they tend to wear out pretty quick, from having to put them together and take them apart each game play.

Yes, it has that Monopoly feel, which made me leary, but it turned out to be a really fun game, that doesn't last forever, as the game end is managed well, by a deck of cards, that sometimes you don't even get to go through.

Surely a good game for families and new gamers and not bad for us veteran gamers, once in a while either.

Surprisingly fun game!

Has several things that make it more then just a roll & move game.
1) An auction where the attractions are auctioned off.  There are Open and Blind Auctions and single and double attraction auctions.
2) You have several choices about which way you are going to move the selected pieces.
3) Cards that let you close rides or take away points from another player that can be used to slow down the player in the lead.
4) A finite ending but you are not exactly sure when it will end.

Good game to play with kids.

RATING: 6.5
This is a game that I didn't expect to enjoy as much as I did...  Especially since the game is based on a computer game that I really really enjoy...It has more choices to make during the game...  On one hand, strategy is needed to do well in the game, but on the other hand, there is a lot of luck involved in the game...

I've played the original PC version of this game for years.  Finally have a copy of the board game.

The board game is missing so much of what made the video game great.  The rules are way to simple.  I'm working on a new variant set of rules to try to capture at least some of what made the video game so awesome.

RATING: 8
Wow this game seems underated! This is one of the best kids games that I have played. It has a nice auction mechanic to buy the rides. The paths on the board offer a number of routes so you have to figure out the best one to get to one of your rides for double victory points. If you can't reach one of your rides, you may need to choose another player's ride. You will then split victory points with the owner of the ride so you need to decide which other player has the least victory points. Note that cash also counts for victory points. The theme is really well done with two 3D roller coasters included and nice detail on the other rides which are cards. This is a great game for kids to start them on learning the strategies needed for more complex games.

RATING: 5
Good title by Parker Brothers, but it feels very lacking. Gameplay gets repetitive and uninteresting quickly, and there is very little strategy involved in this roll-and-move. The pieces are very nice, but all the tokens and tiles take way too long to set up. The 3D element is nice, but it feels like I'm playing Monopoly Jr. The most fun I get out of the game is joking about intentionally drowning park guests or charging for bathrooms.

I am missing one purple player token (the ones that mark ownership of a property), but I have hardly ever seen anyone use more than half anyway. Very playable as is, and if you really need the piece, I'm sure BGG has it.

For a family game...and mass market, roll n move type...this one is a keeper.

Not too much strategy (although it has periodic bidding phases), but fun as heck with the family.
I'd much, much rather play this than any of the typical American boardgames (i.e. Monopoly).

Good game with a clever implementation of the riders (you move them around to your rides).  The cheap cardboard rides fall apart if you do not store them assembled (hard to do because the box doesn't fit them well.)  Also it is a good way to teach an auction game to a child.

Some definate screwage with roll and move.  I love the components of this. It realistically captures the look/feel of the software-its too bad a slightly better game wasn't to be found here. 

I would play, but I wouldn't suggest with serious gamers, but anyone else definitely. I'd rate a 7 or 8 if playing with non "gamer" adults and a 5 if those were "gamers".

This is a good one to keep around just in case someone tries to throw down with monopoly or apples to apples.  Its quick too!

RATING: 6
Amazingly good for a US release from a major company.  The 3-D elements are gimmicky, and luck plays a large factor (one of the event cards--the one that takes away one guest point for every ride--is incredibly punishing if it happens to come up late in the game.)  It's a fairly decent auction game at its heart though.  Some rides and concessions seem to be worth bidding more for than others, but I'd need to play this a few times to see if that strategy actually works or not.  The paper money is rather superfluous--since leftover cash gets converted into Guest Points at the end of the game anyway, why not just bag the cash and have people bid GPs instead?  Ah well ... it's still a better game than I'd been expecting.  I'm not sure that I'd play this often, but it's not bad for an occasional diversion.

Cool little game where your building a theme park by running different rides and scoring points by moving guests to rides owned by both you and your opponents. It's fun but will probably only get 1 or 2 plays a year.

I would rate this a 7 to play with kids, a 4 or 5 with adults. Better with more players, I would say. I would be tempted to deal out extra rides at the beginning, pull a few cards out of the deck, and start a few months into year 1, to shorten the game and reduce luck of the draw in the early going. Maybe give out a little more money too.

Simple quick fun.  I am amazed at how many times my gaming group has had me bring it out to play considering that it's not a German game. =)

A pretty decent game for what it is.  More geared towards kids, but I can still enjoy it and they are not overwhelmed by the complexity.

Okay kids' game (with enough holes in the rules to drive a Zamboni through). House rules in the works... nice coins.

See: [gameid=9217]. (for coins).

A solid, but unremarkable family game.  The stand-ups are cool, but other parts of the components are flimsy, like the cards and guest markers.  It has some strategy to it, which makes it a pleasant surprise when compared with games like [gameid=2921], [gameid=2407], or most other traditional family fare.  Unfortunately, it uses an auction mechanic which is both too dry and too obtuse for a game of this type.  The luck-heavy nature makes it best for families and non-gamers, but in my experience, those are not people who really care to judge how much an auctioned item is REALLY worth.

This game has a lot to offer. The theme really appeals to my kids. Great family game that is a fun version of a monopoly-type game.

Good family game. There is a little strategy for adults. You at least have the option of right or left for the customers. If you added a second customer die so that you had 2 choices it would probably be a little better.

Not a gamers game, but a good fun auction game. I love the theme!

An auction game in the most straightforward sense of the word. The twists are that sometimes you don't know what you're bidding on (blind bidding, or double blind bidding). Pretty lucky, but fun, and the scores have been coming out closer than I would have expected.
